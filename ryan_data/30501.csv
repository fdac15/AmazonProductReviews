"Just picked some of this up at Whole Paycheck (WF), but for a bit more $$. It is a blend of beneficial oils, with Argan being the second, so that's great. Here are the complete ingredients:Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Organic Argania Spinosa (Argan) Nut Oil, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Organic Hibiscus Sabdariffa (Hibiscus) Flower Extract, Organic Punica Granatum Linn (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Organic Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Fruit Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)Stuff is light, sinks in and dries nicely on skin, is completely scent-free, and fresh. You get a big 3.4 oz, so it's a bargain, too. Love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JX287NAXX9HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVFIUAE#wasThisHelpful","R3JX287NAXX9HJ","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the single version of this comb, but these are the same kind I received, so here is what I experienced. I really was looking forward to receiving this comb as most of the reviews were great....but now I know that the negative ones were more true, at least for the comb I received. It was wrapped up in bubble packing, then in a plastic bag, then in another bubble wrap envelope. lol All that for what turned out to be a really poorly made item. (Way too much packing, by the way.)First of all, the teeth were not as shown in the pic. The two on one side were squished together (must have happened when they poured the mold), so it never should have been shipped to me. I tried to straighten them out, but they were stuck like that. Second, this is a ""one-sided"" type of mold, meaning the backside of the comb is flat, making for some sharp edges. Now that I look closer at the France Luxe combs, I can see that their ends are rounded so as not to hurt the scalp. Interesting. These are super pointy. I tried using it anyway, but scratched my scalp even though I was going very slowly with the comb insertion, and I wear a French twist often.All in all, a nasty little comb, at least the one I got. It does have a very faint ""made in France"" stamp in the plastic, but I'm sure France doesn't want credit for this little torture device. I'll stick with paying more and only ordering France Luxe or other such level products. So much for trying to save some $$.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWN19UXOWUZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002RN6WY6#wasThisHelpful","R1NWN19UXOWUZM","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent product, not just for sun protection, but because of the fruit stem cells, it's non-irritating ingredients, drying time, and pleasant scent. It is also completely non-oily. Yay!I put this on every morning after cleansing and let it dry (which is fast) and then put on some liquid make-up. Nice finish!I have a really hard time finding sun products that aren't greasy, or that don't sting, or run into my eyes, etc. This is an easy winner for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4A4N5RGZVBHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052P0XBO#wasThisHelpful","R4A4N5RGZVBHD","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The color is great. Good sunscreen level. The smell is great (minimal and fruity from the stem cells).But it is way too slippery for me. I don't know why it is so oily, but the oiliness never goes away. Ick. I LOVE so many Andalou products (hair, skin), but this is not a winner for me.However, I DO highly recommend the Andalou Naturals Ultra Sheer SPF 18 Daily Defense Facial Lotion, 2.7 Ounce Totally non-oily and very nice.

"In looking for a nice, intensive yet not silicone-laden deep conditioner, I had my work cut out for me. Most are full of ""cones"" as they are referred to; dimethicone, cyclomethicone, etc. Dimethicone is the most common (read ""cheapest"") but the problem with it as with most of them is that they build up on your hair over time, eventually taking you from a mirror finish to dry and frizzy. This is because most ""cones"" build up on themselves, getting thicker and thicker, and locking out all moisture from your hair eventually, unless you strip them regularly with a harsh sulfate shampoo. Not a good cycle to put any hair on.So, the search was on. I did my research and found two potential candidates. One is Shikai's Intensive Conditioner (contains the non-building amodimethicone), and then there's this Andalou product....no cones at all. What??? If no cones, what do they use? Why, lots of argan oil and other natural oils and proteins, that's what. Here's what's in it...and not in it.Aloe Barbadensis Juice*, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinsosa (Argan) and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oils*, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Butter*, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Vanilla Planifolia Extract*, Allantoin, Amino Acid Complex (Arginine, Threonine, and Serine), Fruit Stem Cells (Malus Domestica, Solar Vitis) and BioActive 8 Berry Complex*, Panthenol (Pro Vitamin B5), Octyl Palmitate, Soy Lecithin, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) and Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Extracts*, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*Non-GMO verified  *Organic  Fair TradeWe champion Certified Organic, Natural Origin, BioActive, Fair-Trade, Verified Gluten-Free, Non-GMO Project Verified, Vegetarian and Vegan Ingredients, Eco-Friendly Practices, and a Meaningful No Animal Testing Policy.We reject GMO's, Petrochemicals, Phthalates, Sulfates, Synthetic Colors, Dyes, Fragrances, Triclosan, PEG, MEA, TEA, DEA, or Paraben Preservatives.This product is VERY conditioning, almost too much so for my hair, which is fine but thick and shoulder length. It also has peppermint and cocoa in it, which is perky, and on the chocolatey side. Think a deeper flavored Junior Mint. :)If you are looking to kick the cone habit, Andalou's entire line is brilliant. No cones (or parabens, sulfates, or phlalates) in sight and very natural and gentle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LUS3XVMWLUXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNBJ6IO#wasThisHelpful","R3LUS3XVMWLUXW","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LOVE this product. I wash my hair with their Sunflower and Citrus shampoo, dry gently, and use about a marble-sized amount starting on my ends. (My hair is shoulder length and fine but thick). Protects my hair from blow drying and/or flat ironing it, leaving it with a nice texture and swing.When I decided to grow out my hair from a pixie cut a couple years ago, I knew that to get the best growth and condition, I'd not only have to stop coloring and highlighting it, but also find better products to wash and condition it. Gentle products with no sulfates, parabens, and other harsh chems. Andalou's hair line fit the bill not only with what it didn't have, but what it did have. It's one thing to leave out the bad stuff, but if all you're left with is mediocre, then what good does it do you?This leave-in (and I had never used a leave-in before) is just what I needed to combat dried ends. I really thought it was going to be greasy or heavy, but it has no silicones in it like so many other such products today, so it's light. Smells a bit like citrus, but really faint. All 'round, a winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EYXB3X2MJ94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JNBJ5AI#wasThisHelpful","R23EYXB3X2MJ94","A3VU2J7G0U35AU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VU2J7G0U35AU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Couldn't find this great stuff anywhere here in AZ, so I was thrilled to find in on Amazon. Price is the same as Lowe's, but who cares? There is nothing safer, more effective or long lasting to use on your lawns. It took about a week to see a noticeable difference in a lawn that was really suffering from weeds and malnutrition.

"This powerbank is brilliant. I already have several DE flashlight/powerbank combination devices that impressed the heck out of me. But this one offers the most important feature that no other powerbank I've owned has: days worth of power. And that's not just hype. This powerbank will run your cell phone or tablet for days, not hours. I've tried to run it down to test it. I've never run it completely out of power, yet!For all its power, its surprisingly lightweight and portable. I've been using it to power my Kindle Fire on the road and outdoors and you're barely even aware that the tablet's attached to an external power source - a power source that not only runs my Kindle, but charges it, simultaneously. I know it's delivering a lot of power because the Kindle complains, when you disconnect it from a computer's USB port, that it had been connected to a low-output power source. It doesn't do that when it's been running on this powerbank. Believe it or not, the Kindle likes this DE powerbank more than it likes the USB port on my desktop PC, plugged into the wall.And in case you specifically need a high-power source for your device, this powerbank includes another fairly unique feature - two full-size USB ports, one that delivers 1 amp, another that delivers 2.1 amps.The package contains the powerbank and a short USB-to-MicroUSB connecting cable. You can charge this device from your PC's USB port or a standard  wall-outlet charger with a USB port - such as the charger that comes with your phone or tablet. You can also can buy such chargers inexpensively here on Amazon. That comes in handy if you're on a long business trip, for example, and using your handheld devices extensively. Just plug the charger into one of your hotel room's wall outlets while you sleep. When you wake up, you've got at least a day-and-a-half of power just waiting to use. That's truly impressive.I did have two small issues, but neither was big enough to deduct any stars or really detract from my impression of this wonderful addition to my arsenal of mobile devices:First, the tiny, 4-point-type manual that comes with it (which requires a magnifying glass to read, as is so common these days. What, has the cost of paper recently become a budget buster?) is not accurate to the device. The layout pictured in the diagram is just a bit different from the powerbank, itself. Plus, the manual gives you instructions for turning on the built-in flashlight, but it doesn't have one, and tapping the button twice did not turn anything on. It's not a big deal, because the Amazon description does not promise a flashlight, only the enclosed instruction booklet.I never intended to use it as a flashlight, I have smaller DE powerbanks with powerful LED lamps, which is all I need.Second, I found the micro-USB port to be just a little loose inside. Because of the short length of the supplied cable, I'm using my standard 6-foot USB-to-MicroUSB cable to charge this powerbank. Unlike all the other devices I use with it (including several other DE devices), I found that the micro end of the cable tends to pop out of the port when you move the device. This same cable fits snugly on my DE flashlights, my Samsung Galaxy Phone and my Kindle Fire Tablet. The cable never pulls out.So, just a word to the wise - make sure the lights are flashing after you plug the powerbank in.Despite those very minor issues, I must admit I love this device and recommend it wholeheartedly. I tend to read, at times, for hours on end (one of the things I do is edit and review books), and now I'll never again worry about losing power before I finish one. That alone makes the reasonable price of this device more than worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36A2XUKTJPUQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3MBHJC#wasThisHelpful","R36A2XUKTJPUQI","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a brilliant, elegant bargain. This set is nothing less than gorgeous. The Swarovski crystal catches the light like a fine gem, the settings are beautifully wrought. The quality is quite surprising for the price, it's much better than I anticipated. The clasps and plating first-class, the weight of the chain heavy enough to avoid easy breakage, and the teardrop is, well... gorgeous.It has the weight, motion and brilliance of a much more expensive jewelry-store set. I'm going to give it as a gift to a beautiful friend of mine. The beautiful orchid color will complement her natural color and catch everyone's eye when she wears it with a low-cut, evening dress.I'm usually very wary of buying relatively low-cost costume jewelry, but the Swarovski crystal and the exquisite contemporary design don't even look like costume jewelry. It is something that every woman would be proud to wear, and if you're giving it as a gift, you'll be proud to escort the lady who is wearing it.One of the best surprises I've encountered in purchasing or reviewing personal jewelry. I received a set at no cost to evaluate it for an unbiased review, and I must say, I'm so glad I did. I would gladly have paid full price for it. I can't wait to see her eyes when she unwraps it - and it comes in a classy black fabric, string-closure pouch for storage and presentation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IX2NGLUUL5AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3YJVZW#wasThisHelpful","R3IX2NGLUUL5AC","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, I'm fairly sure you're not going to be able to match the quality and clarity of this 12X monocular. It's an incredibly handy spotting device for following sports action on the field close-up, for identifying obstacles and landmarks while hiking or climbing, even for checking out your kids while they're running or bicycling outdoors with their friends.It's so handy because it's relatively lightweight and portable. You can stick it in your purse, backpack or fanny pack with nary a bulge.It's so useful because the optics are surprisingly good for such a reasonably-priced optical device. I used it both in daylight and low-light incandescent, and it delivered a surprisingly crisp and bright image area under all circumstances.The controls are simple, too. This is not a zoom device. It has a fixed focal range (12X magnification), so all you need to do is rotate the focus ring directly in front of the eyepiece. It has a handy scale so you can return to the same settings with ease. I found that very convenient. After using it for such a short time, I remembered a handful of settings that had worked for me on objects at various distances, so that all I had to do was occasionally fine-tune the focus. And the focus ring has just the right motion and drag so that it was very easy to fine-tune without over-shooting or under-shooting, and not once did the focus jar or slide out of where I put it - no ""lens creep"".This compact monocular exceeded my expectations for an inexpensive but remarkably well-designed and well-made optical device.I was given a copy of this monocular in exchange for an honest review. I didn't have to think twice about it. It's well-worth the money and I'm constantly finding new uses for it. I'm a photographer, so I've even used it as a spotting-scope, to identify potential Fall foliage closeups without leaving my car or whipping out my heavy and awkward photographic equipment while belted into my seat.By the way, the rubber exterior of the monocular feels great in the hand.Honestly, I love this little scope.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWX9D8DUK4KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017H7DZFU#wasThisHelpful","R2MWX9D8DUK4KI","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an exquisite belt. I'm surprised it's not more expensive.The leather is nothing less than gorgeous, the stitching perfect, and the buckle is first-rate. It's really quite remarkable because it gives the impression of being an elegant, high-end product. But in design and toughness, it's something you can wear with your everyday clothes, or dress-up clothes with a Western flair.I love the smell of top-rate boot leather that came off the belt when I opened the package. I haven't purchased a belt in a long time. I tend to stick with the ones I've had for decades. I was given this belt to test and review, and I must say how impressed I am and how glad I am that the vendor asked me to check it out.What's not to recommend?

"I love these gloves. These are the third set of heat-resistant gloves I've tried over the last year, ever since I burned my hands, pretty badly, on a cast-iron skillet filled with smoking hot oil. What a mess that was!I had one of those potholder-handles on the skillet and grabbed the other side with a tripled-over kitchen towel. It didn't work. Both fabrics got saturated with hot oil and burned the heck out of my hands. I had scabs for weeks. Fortunately it didn't scar too badly.So I began my search for something better, something more protective, something really usable that I could employ both in the Kitchen and outdoors at the Barbecue.Then, this company asked me to take a look at these silicone gloves in return for my honest review of them for other potential purchasers.Well I was a bit skeptical, to be honest, but willing to give them a try. The last heat-resistant glove I'd gotten, just a few months ago, was dreadful. It was stiff as a board and I could barely get my hands in and out of them. It was like trying to handle hot pans and roasts with mittens on!So, prepared to really dislike these, too, I was pleased as could be to discover that I love them! Most important is its promise of ""one size fits all"", and this time it's true, even despite the fact that I have big, wide hands. I could get in and out of them with ease, unlike the previous gloves I tried (I hate wrestling with something that is supposed to IMPROVE my life, but, instead, makes it more difficult). Equally important, they move naturally. Despite their thickness, they're remarkably supple (silicone, right?), and move easily and naturally with every movement of every finger.I've used them both in the oven and with my cast-iron cookware, and they've been amazing. I've even used them to take hot bowls and prepared foods out of the microwave! I can't feel any heat through them, at all. No more towels or potholders to grab the turkey out of the oven, no more fear for my flesh the next time I move a smoking cast-iron skillet off the hot stove. I don't even keep potholders or towels near my stove or cooktop any longer.The only drawback I saw, when I first got them was that neon-orange color. I was thinking ""how ugly"", ""how unstylish"". Until one day, when I had a lot of stuff on the counter and wondered where my heat-safe gloves were, I saw a brilliant bit of orange sticking out from under some mixing bowls and pots, and then I finally understood - the gloves are bright orange so you can find them without hunting for them!!I love these gloves and recommend them highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTVKJCRFDEXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014504QPA#wasThisHelpful","RUTVKJCRFDEXR","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fabulous. It's amazing how innovative companies are repurposing technologies and designs originally meant for other applications - for new uses that don't change the world, but sure do make the mundane things in life easier. And more fun.These hampers are exactly one of those brilliant innovative new applications.These clever and useful hampers and based on mobius strips, those flat metal springs that, with the the right twist, fold down in layers, flat, to one third their size. And Nezarco adds a clever twist so that, when the hampers fully expand (watch out, the spring really springs up. It is, after all, a mobius strip like those pop-up tents and collapsible photo backdrops), they still have one more twist to go as they're still folded in half. Pull one side away from the other, and you end up with a fabulous metal-framed, lightweight, rigid hamper with mesh sides and a plastic fabric top and handle.It's almost miraculous! If not miraculous, then incredibly clever.It's also very handy. It folds down to a flat circle less than eight inches in diameter, which makes it very portable. When not in use, they take up almost no storage space. When expanded they're generous size, fit a day's laundry, and most important, if you're camping, or participating in a sweaty sporting event (or your children are), and you want to keep your (or your kids') sweaty, smelly, dirty clothes isolated from your clean stuff and exposed to ventilation, they're nearly perfect!It also makes a great gift for the busy mom or the single guy or gal living an active life.I was given a pair of these to test and review, and I'm so glad I was. I never would have looked for them, or even known they existed, and now I have a clever, efficient, useful new toy to manage my clothing when not at home. And that's another thing, you don't have to use it for dirty stuff, either. I once used it to carry bags of new clothing from a shopping spree, and another time, I used it to bring a fresh change of clothes with me, and then swapped out my dirty ones into it. My next trip I'll pack them in my suitcase, so I'll have a dedicated hamper to organize my dirty clothes in my own personal hamper in my hotel room. Much better than using the plastic laundry bags the hotel supplies!This is a great product, and I can't recommend it highly enough.Only one thing - the first time, you're probably going to go crazy twisting the hamper exactly right to fold it back to the tiny flat circle that is its natural storage state. That's has nothing to do with these hampers, but the nature of a mobius strip. Twist one side toward you, the other way, like a figure-8 and then play with both sides until they fold into three concentric circles, about a quarter-inch thick. Actually, I'm perverse enough to believe that folding up mobious strips are fun - sort of like working a geometrical puzzle.Buy them. They're priced right and you won't be disappointed!

"The talented team of Shira Anthony and Aisling Mancy has produced an excellent novel, in fact, a near-perfect one. It’s not just a first-rate book, it’s an important book. It has much to recommend it.First, it’s not your typical gay romance novel. Almost completely devoid of the standard memes of the genre, “A Solitary Man” is an action/adventure/mystery that happens to star two gay men. The men are Xavier Constantine, an FBI agent who has spent too many years fighting human trafficking and trying to save children from monsters, sometimes successfully, sometimes not; and Evan “Chance” Fairchild, an ADA in a sleepy town in North Carolina who desperately wants to do good, but accepts that he’s going to have to do what’s politically expedient in order to do it.The one and only standard meme in the book is the two men “meeting cute”. Everything that comes after is unique, often stunning, moving, frightening and passionate.On his last case, Xavier lost two kids when the DEA screwed up the operation, sending just one chopper, instead of the two required, because of budget reductions. Those budget reductions resulted in the deaths of two pre-adolescent boys, who died in his arms as he fought to save them. He handed in his badge and took off for Dare’s Landing, North Carolina, because he could not get those kids, and his failure to save them, out of his mind. He took the failure, and the deaths of the boys, personally - so much so that he had their eyes tattooed over his heart, so he will never forget them. He’s determined to get justice for two boys taken way too early, and to save the lives of others like them. One of the boys had a bus ticket from LA to North Carolina, the only clue to who he was, the only lead to whoever put him in harm’s way. He signs on as a Deputy Sheriff in Dare’s Landing. It’s a perfect platform from which to investigate how these kids were kidnapped off the streets of a middle-class, coastal fishing town, with no one reporting them missing.Chance (only to his closest friends, to everyone else, he’s Evan) is determined to find out what’s happening in his town. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and Columbia Law, the son of a single, drug-addicted mother, he returned to coastal North Carolina because he thought he could make a difference. He’s finding that a lot tougher than he expected. He knows something terrible is going on in his county, and he knows it’s related to drugs, but he can’t get his boss, the D.A., to buy into it – he’s up for re-election and determined to deliver only good news to reflect his accomplishments, even if they’re just ephemeral.The two men meet, as strangers, at the gay bar closest to Dare’s Landing, hit it off, and move on to Xavier’s rented digs to act on their attraction. Chance is, obviously, not that good a judge of horseflesh, mistaking Xavier’s muscular build, sun-bleached hair and killer Harley as the hallmarks of a vapid California surfer. If he only knew. He does manage to piss Xavier off when he sneaks out without leaving a note or a word of farewell, as though he’d never been there and never slept with him - just a stranger evaporating into the night.It takes a day or two, but eventually, Chance finds out how wrong his initial impression was. Xavier is the new Deputy in town. And due to his vast Federal and international experience in combatting drugs and human trafficking, he’s expected to become a prime mover in local law enforcement, which means the two will be spending a lot of time together, like it or not.There is something major amiss in their little town and county. Almost twenty kids have disappeared in just a few months. Unaccounted for, with not a single lead related to their disappearance, the Sheriff’s department is at wit’s end. They have to deal with the distraught parents and even the Sheriff is stunned by the complete lack of official reaction and support from the State Police and the Feds. No one seems to care about these missing kids, especially the rest of the Criminal Justice system. Xavier cares.So does Chance, but for a different reason. Arrests on the I95 corridor have dropped to nearly nil, yet they’re seeing heroin showing up at the Middle Schools, and kids overdosing in the High School. Where are these drugs coming from? How are they getting in, and who is supplying them?Xavier makes the connection for him – drug running and human trafficking usually go hand-in-hand. Find who’s kidnapping the boys for sexual slavery, and you’ll find your drug pipeline. They start looking, together, joining forces, though Chance has to do it on the sly, because the D. A. has forbidden him to look into the drug trade, ostensibly for political reasons – or perhaps his reasons are more personal than political?The book moves along at a heart-pounding pace. More kids are missing. Kids are not being followed up on because someone has been purging them from the Federal database, so someone from law-enforcement is definitely involved, covering up for the cartel that’s spreading its stain over this small corner of North Carolina. These are violent people, and this book has violent acts. The authors quickly engage you through the thoughts and actions of Xavier and Chance, the honest and determined Sheriff, the handful of relatively inexperienced officers who become Xavier’s quickly-cobbled-together task force. There’s a host of vivid, admirable characters who will move you with their dedication and determination to protect the children, with their integrity and passion, especially in contrast to the political and criminal monsters who don’t give a damn about the kids.That’s why this book is important. It’s an elegant and heartwarming love story, an exciting thriller, but most important, it’s an expose of the national tragedy and disgrace of the trafficking of children. It’s astonishing how badly we allow kids in America (and much of the rest of the world) to be treated. “Good Christian” families turn their under-aged kids out on the streets, at their pastors’ urging, abandoning kids as young as 11 or 12 to the predators because they might be gay. Our Foster Care and homeless facilities for kids are abysmal. New York City has approximately 5000 homeless gay kids, and just three hundred beds to serve them. Why is that?Kids, boys and girls, gay and straight, get bartered, sold and passed around, with relative impunity, for the sexual pleasure of adults with money. That’s a crime against humanity. What I find most moving in “A Solitary Man” is the authors’ and the characters’ indignation that this is allowed to continue, that the resources and attention needed to stop the exploitation of children never seem to be a top priority in a nation that can well afford to do something to save them.“A Solitary Man” is beautifully written. This evocative novel will rip out your soul, but warm your heart with the certainty that things can get better. The authors don’t preach, they show. You get caught up in the action, the mystery, the stories of the characters, and propelled along a journey into the darkest hearts of men and into the souls of the kindest, most caring, most courageous of people. This book is a clarion call – we all need to put homeless and trafficked kids at the top of our list. We need to get to them and help them before they’re corrupted, destroyed or killed – all for some predator’s profits.I noted, earlier, that this book is “near perfect”, and it’s a shame that I can’t praise it without qualification, because I love this book, its prose, its message and its big heart. I love how Xavier and Chance discover, in each other, kindred spirits. However, I disagree with the authors’ depiction of the local arch-villain as a “She-Male”. I know the authors see a semantic difference between a “She-Male” and a “trans” person, but in my opinion, it’s a distinction without a difference.In the book, Xavier describes “Victor” thus:  “His high-quality breast job and ample package were obvious beneath the skimpy summer dress, clearly intended to advertise the services he offered.”The authors have him explain further:  “She-males work in the sex or pornography industries.”I found these comments jarring. I don’t believe the authors were being intentionally discriminatory, nor do I think they were being appropriately sensitive. They seem to be relying on an outdated term that, these days, is only used on porn sites. No one writing books about and for the LGBT community should use the term “She-Male”, knowing that trans people will find it offensive and hurtful. Plus, I got the distinct feeling that they made “Victor” a “She-Male” to depict her as thoroughly reprehensible. Even if their distinction is genuine, they are displaying their revulsion at sex workers, treating people who are prostitutes or work in the porn industry as less than fully human.What bothered me most is that “A Solitary Man” is such a brilliantly written book, such a powerful book, such a big-hearted and important book that it doesn’t need stereotyping to define its villains. If I were a trans person, prostitute, porn star or neither, I would be offended by this unnecessary characterization. Especially in a book about victims and those who save them – considering that trans people, no matter what their profession, are amongst the world’s most victimized and exploited people.Enough about that. My discomfort should not deter you from buying, reading, and being profoundly affected by this remarkable book. It’s a great adventure story, an exciting police procedural with great characters you can root for, and lessons you can take away from it. Perhaps it will inspire you to join in the fight to end the suffering and exploitation of our children. And if it does, the authors have done their job – and then some.Alan reviews gay fiction for the ""Suddenly Addicted..."" blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BZ3EP8KB0TDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017DY79SG#wasThisHelpful","R2BZ3EP8KB0TDF","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Drew Hamilton is a relatively new author. He seemed to pop up out of nowhere, a surprisinglyconfident and passionate young novelist. He’s already way beyond the majority of gay romancewriters, an author who produces superb and profoundly moving books - inventive and creativegay fiction that touches the soul.“Boulder Boys, Max & Sam” is a perfect example. At first, I saw it as a light fantasy about twoboys in love. Then I feared it was one of those endless epics (it covers almost a decade). It’sneither. What it is, is a remarkable book that defies and transcends its genre. It addresses bigissues: life, death, and beyond, overcoming evil with love and compassion, and loves both fatedand well-earned. It’s a spiritual book, one with a vision of Heaven, not as a place of judgment,fire and brimstone, but a gentle and generous alternate dimension of compassion that providesloving guidance and the reassurance of eternal life.Don’t let my description put you off. This is not really a paranormal or religious book. It’s adamned good tale of authentic, colorful and empathetic characters, of families that love andfamilies that hate, of redemption, not just of the main characters, but potentially, of allhumankind.The protagonists are a handful of boys in the process of growing into admirable young men.The book starts with just two brothers, Max and Morgan, recently relocated to Boulder,Colorado by their loving parents. Their dad is a former drill-sergeant who builds cabinets in ahome woodworking shop, their mother a respected psychiatrist. Though the boys are oftenmistaken for twins, Max is more than a year older than Morgan and they’re best friends whoroom together, by choice, in a basement bedroom. Mr. Hamilton has written some charming,snarky, brotherly dialogue, always careful to temper the friendly insults with the deep affectionand respect that defines them, not just as brothers, but as best friends. These boys arededicated to each other, two good boys, boys any parent would be proud to call their sons. Andthey are both gay.Max has a secret. He has been dreaming of a beautiful young man for years. He is the“imaginary friend” of his most private dreams, a phantasm so real that Max can’t really acceptthat he’s a figment of his horny imagination. As it turns out, he’s not. One day, a young mancomes knocking on his door in response to an ad his father posted for a workshop assistant, andMax is stunned. It’s the boy from his dream, real, live and standing, in the flesh, at Max’s frontdoor. Sam’s jaw drops just as Max’s does – they both know immediately that they have beendreaming of each other for years. It’s fate, kismet, dreams made flesh. Sam is hired by Max andMorgan’s dad and Sam and Max become lovers – each other’s first.The other main character is the haunted Buchanan house, a fire-ravaged and abandonedmansion right out of the Gilded Age. Rumor has it that two boys died in the house in a murder-suicide.Although it’s been declared off-limits by their parents, Max and Morgan are inquisitiveyoung men and there’s no way they can resist the temptation to explore it.What they find at the house astonishes them. Though the exterior is a deteriorating disaster,left to the elements for too many years, the back yard features a pristine pool, a patiosurrounded by marble balusters, an immaculate kitchen with shiny modern appliances,refrigerators stocked with an endless supply of fresh food, and cabinets replete with freshly-washedplates, silverware, pots and pans. Yet no one lives there. Oddly enough, the weather atthe house is always temperate, the sky always clear and blue, and time seems to stop whenthey are there. It doesn’t just seem to stop, it actually stops.Then there is Jason. A vivacious, wise and energetic young man who seems to appear out ofnowhere, a young man with the remarkable talent of making anything the boys wantmaterialize out of thin air. One of the most remarkable things he provides is an express track tothe house. In their dreams, Jason comes to both Sam and Max and tells them to go into theirclosets and close the door. When they do, they both appear, together, at the mansion. Sincetime stops when they’re there, no one even knows they’ve been gone.Jason works for “upstairs” and has come to make a deal with Max, Sam, Morgan and Morgan’snew boyfriend, Nate. They will have free reign of the house, and all it offers, as long as theyfollow certain basic rules. They are given a grave responsibility - the bosses “upstairs” wantthem to cleanse the stain from the house and the land it sits upon. Many years ago, youngnative “Two-Spirit” boys, who were highly respected, even revered, by their tribe, were literallymassacred, on this spot, by the Christian missionaries who found their love to be anabomination. Other gay people died there in the years that followed, and the site can only bepurified and redeemed through acts of love, respect and compassion.That task is both the core and the message of “Boulder Boys, Sam and Max”. The book followsalmost ten years of their lives, through school, military training (post 9/11), the pain of Don’tAsk-Don’t-Tell, death, separation, meeting the small group of young men who become theirlovers and friends, family rejections and religious bigotry. One of the great scenes in the book,is when Jason recounts the tale of Gabe (the Angel Gabriel) telling off a nasty religious bigot forthe perverseness of her spiritual convictions, hiding her hatred behind her religion. A littlebeating of wings and a couple of thunderous warnings turns the dreadful woman’s thinkingaround. As Jason says “It was taken care of.”The boys lose some people they love, they find others. They mature and grow, using the houseas a way-station for gay ex-military suffering PTSD, and others enduring the heartbreak of beingrejected by their families, churches and communities for being gay. They grow abundantflowers and plants from long-barren soil. They breed service dogs, but mostly they provide love,attention, healing and redemption to the lost and abandoned. The good boys have grown intogood men, at peace knowing there is an afterlife, and that, ultimately, they will never loseanyone they’ve loved and, most important, that their legacy of love and compassion has healeda broken and spoiled bit of the earth, and the people who inhabit it. Through all their trials andtribulations, these boys retain their innocence, still driven by hope, dedicated to a better world,believing that all broken people, hate and cruelty may still be fixed with kindness, compassionand caring.Mr. Hamilton is extraordinarily careful not to preach, to treat “upstairs” (or as Jason explains,not so much “upstairs”, as parallel) with humor and humanity. There’re no fire-breathing devils,no thunder and lightning spewing forth from an angry God. In fact the people from “upstairs”will not even discuss religion, because there are so many religions and so many conflictsbetween them, that they work hard to keep themselves neutral. They are the Deus ex Machinain the wings that constantly nudges humanity forward, always toward light and love, throughnurturing, and without threats.I must admit, “Boulder Boys, Max and Sam” is not at all what I expected. The spiritual andparanormal elements are handled with delicacy and humor. One of my favorite lines is whenJason admits that the people “upstairs” never miss an episode of the TV show, “Supernatural”.The show is hardly accurate, but they love the irreverent take on life, death, angels, devils andthose who fight to save humanity. They particularly love the irony of Castiel, traversing theEarth and the Heavens dressed in a trench coat – an angel disguised as Columbo? It’s nice toknow that Heaven has not only a sense of humor, but a well-developed appreciation of irony.How good is “Boulder Boys, Max and Sam”? One of the best books I’ve read in a while. Yearsago, when I was studying music, a friend of mine, a talented pianist, was playing aRachmaninoff Concerto in a university recital. Seated next to me was the head of the MusicDepartment. I loved my friend’s performance, but turned to Dr. Friedman to ask him what hethought of it. I expected an erudite technical critique. Instead, he turned to me and said: “Whatdid I think of it? It made my heart pound, and what more can be asked of any artist?”Mr. Hamilton made my heart pound, my eyes well up with tears, my laughter burst forth withjoyous abandon. What more can be asked of any artist?Alan reviews gay fiction for the ""Sinfully Addicted..."" blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDWVHT9Z0UYGT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017E0Z7SI#wasThisHelpful","RDWVHT9Z0UYGT","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, this bulb has been excellent. First, I'm an LED nut. They finally perfected LED lighting that holds its own against incandescent light for color and brightness, but far exceeds both incandescent and compact fluorescent in both efficiency and lifespan. Most LED lights are good for years. If you're like me, you probably bought a raft of those 5-yea incandescent or CFL bulbs, only to watch them blow out in a few months. Not so with LED bulbs. There's no guarantee, but they're thought to last ten years or more, and some manufacturers warrant them for exceedingly long periods.A little over a year ago, I switched my entire home to LED-only lighting and was amazed to see my electric bill cut in half as soon as I did. These bulbs are expensive, but with with the energy savings they provide and their longevity, they repay the investment handily, usually in the first year.Brightness:Some people took issue with the brightness of the bulb. For my usage, this Lohas bulb is just perfect. But is it a 60-watt bulb? After reading a number of reviews I went to Google to research what constitutes a 60 watt-equivalent bulb in LEDs. I hate to say this, but I still have no idea. The U. S. Department of Energy states that a 60w incandescent bulb should produce around 800 lumens.  But I found LED bulbs, by well-known manufacturers, all over the place. The input wattage of 60 watt-equivalent LED bulbs ranged from 5 to 8 watts and 450-600 lumens, far less than what the DOE considers the ideal lumen output for a 60 watt incandescent. On the other hand, most manufacturers rated their 40 watt-equivalent bulbs fairly consistently around 300 lumens, while the DOE claims 500 lumens for 60w incandescents.This Lohas bulb actually produces some of the top brightness results among the 60 watt-equivalent LED bulbs, at 550 lumens. So what's a consumer to do? Experiment. I'm not sure that the incandescent-equivalent ratings are at all meaningful for either LEDs or CFLs. Even worse, there appears to be almost no correlation between wattage drawn and lumen output - apparently, there's a wide variance in efficiency (lumens/watt) from bulb to bulb.Color Temperature:Again, I'm not entirely sure how much this matters. I'm using this bulb in a tabletop torchere, and it's pretty much perfect for my application. I call it my ""Skype Light"". It sits on my desk, off to the right, slightly behind my computer monitor, to provide illumination for my face in my Webcam and provide lighting for my desktop. The light it gives is a lovely warm color, softening and warming up flesh tones, accenting reds and yellows as opposed to blues, magentas and greens. It's a very friendly color, very natural, and very similar to incandescent bulbs, which is a big plus.Lifespan:I haven't had it long enough to know how long it will last. I'll update my review as they age in.Dimming:As far as dimming is concerned, the bulb is definitely dimmable, but there is always a caveat: LED bulbs do not dim the same way as incandescent bulbs do. An incandescent bulb just puts resistance into the line, reducing voltage as you turn the dimmer down. LEDs are much more complex. Dimmable LEDs are much more complex, requiring circuits to sense input voltage and control the brightness of the LED emitters, themselves. Dimming is not always smooth and sometimes produce flicker. It varies between different bulb designs. Some dim more smoothly, others have a tendency to ""step"" down and some can flicker. Even more important, not all dimmers work with all LED bulbs. In any case, LED dimming is miles ahead of dimmable fluorescents, which almost always flicker and are harsh on the eye when dimmed.I used an inline dimmer, an inexpensive dimmer that I generally use with my photography lighting. They're about eight dollars at the major hardware stores. The bulb dimmed just fine, very subtly, and without flicker until it was dimmed about 95%, just before shutoff, and then the bulb flickered like mad just before it dimmed down to completely off. Obviously, at the dimmest possible setting, the bulb's electronics were having problems functioning properly. That didn't bother me, either, as I can't think of any situation in which I would use the bulb at only 5% illumination. It's so close to off, it is, for all intents and purposes, off.Conclusion:I'm pretty impressed with this bulb. The color temperature, the effective dimming, the brightness were all exactly what I want and need for this application (see picture), and the price is not bad for what the bulb delivers.I was given one bulb to test with the promise of writing an honest and unbiased review. That was hardly a challenge, as I was suitably impressed with this little killer bulb. I do recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7YTNJ9HDCB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2P31VA#wasThisHelpful","R3T7YTNJ9HDCB3","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank heaven for LEDs. They're changing everything, lowering our utility bills, providing powerful low-power lighting, making new and useful products available at very reasonable prices.This LED rechargeable bike light set is a perfect example. It's all about safety and visibility - the rider seeing where he or she is going, drivers and others, seeing the rider, courtesy of the red tail light.The headlight is, basically, a powerful wide-lens LED flashlight that provides more than enough light for almost any rider, under almost any conditions, to avoid obstacles in his or her path, with effective clamps to attach it to the handlebars. The rear, red light is another powerful beam that works in three modes - always on, slow flash and fast flash. No driver will have any excuse for not seeing this bike, even in the difficult half-light of dusk or dawn.The system offers a host of power options, almost all included! There are rechargeable batteries for the headlamp plus an included charger for them (or you may use standard batteries in their own ""carrier"" (these batteries not included). The set comes with two rechargeables, and it only takes one to power the headlamp, so you can carry the second in a storage compartment on your bike, your backpack or your pocket. And if they're both dead? You can use any standard AAA batteries instead. The rear battery is not rechargeable, but comes with two backup batteries right out of the box. Fortunately, since LED bulbs draw so little current, the power options should all last a long time - my best guess (I did not test to failure) is that one set of the headlamp batteries is good for 6-8 hours. It's difficult to determine the rear lamp';s battery life, because a flashing LED consumes a great deal less power than one that's constantly on - and this light set gives you the option to determine how you want it to behave, so its battery life varies, depending on how you configure the lamp.Whether its you riding your bike at night, or your children, you really need this light set. It's one of the least expensive, most sophisticated and comprehensive bike-lighting systems available. It's all about safety, and it spares nothing to make sure that you see and are seen when out on the road or anywhere else on your bike in the dark.I was given a sample of this bike-light system to test in return for an honest review. I must say, giving this product a five-star review was not difficult. I was tremendously impressed with these lights, and with the lifetime no-questions-asked warranty.

"I love this beautiful instrument. I always keep a magnifier right near my computer, because there's always a phone number on the back of a debit/credit card, a serial number on a device, black raised plastic lettering on black plastic, and a host of little ""user manuals"" written in 6pt type to conserve paper, which are impossible to read by the unaided human eye. For years now, I've had a high-quality magnifier as part of my daily go-to tools. But not a lighted one. I had those little credit-card lighted magnifiers (the kind of magnifier you keep in your wallet), but though convenient, the optics stink and the light is too dim for any benefit.This magnifier is nothing like that, It's brilliant. It has three LED lights that light your target brilliantly, two for the large magnifier lens, one for the extreme close-up loupe lens below it. The lenses are distortion-free and crystal clear.This magnifier works a charm. Took me a few minutes to get the batteries right, but once I did, I was overjoyed with my dramatically improved vision for the small, closeup things I seem to always run across. The light is extremely even, casts few shadows, and lasts a long, long, time, since the LEDs demand so little power from the batteries.This is one of those products that, once you try it, you can't imagine how you live without it. I was given one in return for an honest review, and loved it so much, I'm about to place an order for a second one as a Christmas stocking-stuffer.

"These are not just top-flight straps, they're also one of those rare products that cause you to say ""Duh! I can't believe no one thought of those before"".First, they are heavy nylon straps with excellent end closures, and easy sizing. The package consists of two straps, one for vertical use, one for horizontal.And they're so useful! A few years back, my large suitcase came back from the airline with one of the sides cut open and all my clothing and belongings spilling out. Using this pair of straps might not have prevented the destruction of my luggage, but certainly would have held much of the contents in, minimizing the damage and loss.Second, I spend an anxious few minutes at baggage claim, waiting for my luggage and checking for my name tags or other identifying features (my luggage is black soft-side, like most of the luggage you see on airlines). Initially, I thought, why did they make these straps neon orange? The first time I used them, I realized why, they stand out from the crowd! It makes it much easier to see your luggage coming around the belt, so you can get in position to grab it, earlier, and the first time. I loved that!I've also used these straps for things other than luggage. I've had to move some heavy cartons to and from my car, and it was great to just wrap both belts around the box and uses the straps as a carry-handle without worrying that my heavy cartons (which contained photos framed in glass and chrome) might give way and the contents shatter.I even used them once on a hand-cart, wrapping the straps around the cart and the boxes I was lifting to keep them in place.This is one of those products that won't change the world, but it has certainly made my life a bit easier, and what more can I ask?I was given these luggage straps in return for an honest and unbiased review, and I'm proud to give them five stars, and I recommend them with utter conviction!

"65 Feet of lights - beautiful lights, LEDs each inside a beautiful, soft, frosted, diffusing globe. The colors are astonishing - soft blues, light-green, dark-green, cyan, reds and yellows that blink in a soft fade, fast chase, twinkling flicker and who knows what other patterns! It's hypnotic to watch, and I will be using it as my main Holiday lights this winter.My only complaint is that it has no controls, you can't pick the patterns or colors. But the upside is that it delivers a very random, lively pattern in which you can't identify the repeats, so its animation is totally unique. If it had control of the animation and/or color, I would likely have given it the full five stars.Still, it's worth every dime. As LEDs, they draw such a tiny amount of current that's it's economical to leave running 24/7, which means I won't have to drag out my light-sensitive timer to turn them on and off at dusk or dawn.Guaranteed, they will give you a beautiful and unique look - no one else's light strings will look like this one, and some of the combinations are so gorgeous they will take your breath away.I love these lights.

"LED lights have come a long way. When it comes to light strings for holiday, party or general outdoor decoration, they are miles beyond the older incandescent lights. They're much more reliable (they last for years), give off little heat, and deliver brilliant illumination at a very, very low cost.I thought that might be the single downside of these lights - that the string takes 3 C batteries, which are relatively expensive. But when you consider that the power drain from these LED lights is minuscule, that actually makes them less expensive to run than incandescents, and much more attractive.These are the most capable light strings I've ever encountered. Last year, I didn't even bother with seasonal lighting, because I had to hook up a huge lighting controller and a host of cables in order to get my choice of illumination patterns. But this string's built-in controller supports: Combination,In Waves,Sequential,Slo Glo,Chasing/Flash,Slow Fade, Twinkle/Flash, Steady On. And all but steady-on last for months, the steady-on setting, which provides 24/7 draws a lot more current, with the batteries lasting about one month.The combination is unbeatable. I love these lights, and I particularly love that they are white, which means they can be used for any festive occasion, or year-round (on bushes, for example), and you don't even need an outlet or extension cord to use them anywhere.I was given a string of these lights in return for an honest and unbiased review, and I must confess, that they would get my highest recommendation even had I paid more than full price for them. Beautiful lights with more animation options than I've ever seen before.Great lights, great value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCN4CO9T1QBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LMKNQ2#wasThisHelpful","R1OCN4CO9T1QBQ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally read or review short stories or novellas. There's not enough runway to develop the fully-fleshed out characters I love. But I desperately needed a Hollis Shiloh fix after reading a few very disappointing books, so I made an exception. I'm so happy I did.Unlike some others readers, I adored this book. The magician (let's call him ""John"") arrives at the almost-town Dustville with great mystery. No one knows why he has chosen to land in the middle of nowhere. The kindly Sheriff, Henry, takes a shine to the mysterious (and tiny) magician. They do manage the minimum of casual conversation at which time, the magician (the one we're calling ""John"") invites himself to have sex with Henry. He's pretty damned forward for a reticent man who normally doesn't have more than a word for anyone else.Over time, and with Sheriff Henry's tender ministrations, John begins to understand that this man really wants him. John is filled with self-loathing. Apparently his tiny stature and his tendency to look like a child, have made it difficult for anyone to take him seriously, except for the beautiful Henry, who is falling in love with him for whom he is, regardless of his stature and his often prickly nature. They fall in love. John does a few kindnesses for the town with his magic. He creates a barrier that the rustlers cannot cross to terrorize and vandalize Dustville, casts a spell to prevent any more children of dying of milk disease, finds strays, ensures, together with Henry, that the townspeople are kept safe.Until the day that a dying magician and his gunslinger-lover kidnap both of them, and to use John's magic to steal a train laden with gold. Hell ensues, almost literally.The sadistic, evil magician, uses his powers to launch a black spell that will, literally, rent the earth asunder, kill tens of thousands of people, destroy every town, village and ranch within miles (perhaps the entire territory) and ensure that no one can live there for thousands of years, maybe  forever.Henry, recovering from his kidnapping and injuries, and almost devoid of magic, races out to protect his lover, Henry, when his magic recovers enough to deliver a message - that he has to go and save him.Which he does, and so much more.This is a beautiful little book about a beautiful little man and the big, tender-hearted man who loves him so. What I most loved about it is the incredible power that John is able to gather unto himself to stop the evil spell. He launched all the spells he brought with him, but they seem to have disappeared without effect, and yet the earth righted itself and magic went back into equilibrium. Although John never figured out why, Henry, though not a magician, did. At the time that the black spell was spinning out of control and threatening the two lovers, not to mention everyone else within miles, they held each other tightly, willing to die, but to die together, taking their love with them. It was the love that gave his spells the strength, their passionate commitment to each other with their hearts so good and true that provided the power to beat the spell back. I love the message: the antidote to evil is love.What a beautiful resolution to a beautiful little story. Written as only Hollis Shiloh can, with her uncanny ability to place her readers in a time that never existed, but somewhere shortly after the civil war, and write it in a voice appropriate to the times, the cultural and the South, after it lost the war to the Union. Ms. Shiloh's touch never fails to lift my spirits. Her stories move me and her writing just reminds me, every time, of why I love to read.Do yourself a favor and take a few hours to dwell in one more vivid and moving world Ms. Shiloh has so excellently created.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YDX79H3TQV8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBZSTBE#wasThisHelpful","R2YDX79H3TQV8D","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ms. Harlow is a new author to me. Probably a new author to everyone who buys gay fiction from Amazon's Kindle Store because, apparently, she only has a single book listed in the gay genre.I can't encourage Ms. Harlow enough to PLEASE write more. I loved this book. I must admit I'm a fan of gay rock-n-roll novels. Several years ago, I got hooked on ""Daron's Guitar Chronicles"" by Cecilia Tan. Since then, I snap up every rock band romance I can get my hands on. Very few of them are in the same class as ""Daron"", but ""The Rhinoceros Conspiracy Live"" comes awfully close, which is pretty darned impressive for a first-time-gay, first-time-rock-n-roll author.I loved this book, almost entirely due to the author's writing. Ms. Harlow is an Aussie, currently living in Melbourne, a world away from American rock. Apparently not so far away as I might have thought. She handled her locations beautifully, by setting the book on a world tour by Rhinoceros Conspiracy, an indie rock band just starting to break into the big time. Each chapter starts in a different locale, including Europe, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan and several American states. The band is cosmopolitan too, with two members from England, two from the U. S., so the occasional accents, local food and an ongoing battle of U. S. Football vs. Football (Soccer, in the U. S.) make a lot of sense.There is sex, but it's not what makes this book stand out. In fact, there is no explicit sex, just thoughts, discussions, and reactions. Come to think of it, there really is no ""sex"", per se, just love-making, which makes an infinitely better story, because it's all about the hearts and souls of the characters, not the sweaty doings between the sheets.And ""heart and soul"" is what this book is all about. There are four members of the band, each beautifully developed and artfully rendered. Three of the main leads are long-time friends who got together and formed the band when they were just teenagers. Wes is the daddy, a recovering alcoholic madly in love with his girlfriend (which drives everyone else to distraction). He Skypes her love and kisses every night, without fail. Uri is the drummer. He's surprisingly taciturn, a loner who keeps to himself, but a powerhouse with his drumsticks in hand.Joe is the lead singer. A child of great privilege and wealth, he is not only self-confident, he's just more than a little bit crazy. His reputation as a slut is not manufactured. He has spent most of the last four years in bed with a succession of models, movie stars and singers. He's beautiful, sexy, incredibly charismatic onstage, and the darling of the tabloids.That leaves Zepp (short for Zeppelin - his parents were obviously cruel!), the newest member of the band (four years) and about to turn 22. Zepp suffers from anxiety disorder. It's not disabling (or only when things go really, really bad), and he's a fine guitarist. He undergoes the most amazing metamorphosis whenever he steps onstage, changing in an instant from an insecure, sensitive, somewhat OCD, young man, into a powerful, lyrical guitarist completely at home on the stage. Somehow the stage sets him free.Joe is ostensibly straight, Zepp is absolutely (but quietly) gay. Everyone in the band knows he's gay, management knows he's gay, the crew knows he's gay, only Joe doesn't know he's gay. Unfortunately, Zepp tends to get big crushes on unavailable (often straight) guys and Joe is no exception. A good portion of the book is the two of them finally falling into bed together (it turns out Joe is more bi than straight). It starts out with a little cuddling and ends up with passionate lovemaking and tender spooning through the night.Zepp knows better. Joe doesn't do relationships, never lasts with anyone longer than a month or two. He's also an irrepressible flirt. Zepp knows this cannot end well, but is willing to give it some time just to get what he can out of it, knowing he's going to be a mess when it ends - sooner, rather than later. What he doesn't count on is Joe's conviction that Zepp is the only one in the whole world who knows him for who he is, and loves him despite his craziness and flaws, or maybe because of them.This part of the story is more than 100 pages, a lot of pages to fall in love, so it should be pretty boring. It should, but it isn't. Ms. Harlow is simply brilliant at witty dialogue, smart and crazy badinage, absurd discussions that put a smile on Joe's face - and on the reader's. There wasn't an off moment, a boring paragraph, a single step out-of-character in the whole book. Think George Bernard Shaw writing a rock-n-roll story. Ms. Harlow has such a deft hand with her characters, that each one literally leaps off the page, and you can't help but look forward to whatever they get up to next.The boys have their share of ups-and-downs, all four of them. Joe and Zepp decide to be ""just friends"" and ""band-mates"", but that was never going to work, not when each one of them aches when they're together but not touching, and break when they're apart. Add in a dangerous stalker (you'll love how Zepp talks their kidnapper out of the kidnapping) and, of course, a positively beautiful Happily-Ever-After.""The Rhinoceros Conspiracy Live"" is one of my newest favorite books, and Ms. Harlow one of my newest favorite authors.  I just flat-out adored this book. I rooted for the boys, I wept for them, I laughed at their wit and craziness, I want to hear more from them (sequel, please!). If you love larger-than-life, but totally authentic characters, beautiful, lucid, smart writing, then this is the book for you! It was a surprise by an author I wasn't familiar with, but it made my day. Sometimes you just get lucky. Don't miss ""The Rhinoceros Conspiracy Live""!Alan reviews gay fiction for the Suddenly Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WAVRKZM0X6QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WJYKP0#wasThisHelpful","R2WAVRKZM0X6QH","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you read one book this year, “The Deep of the Sound” should be it. In the past, I’ve always been ambivalent about Amy Lane’s books, some I’ve liked, some not so much. The same might be said for the Bluewater Bay Series, a series by various authors (sort of “guest authors”) of varying combinations and quality.But “The Deep of the Sound” is one of the most profoundly beautiful books I’ve ever read. It left me with my heart lifted, my faith in life restored, my admiration for the characters enduring but, most of all, my opinion of Ms. Lane’s writing now beyond question – she is one of the great writers of gay fiction. And this book is an exercise in exquisite writing.The settings, characters, moods, conflicts, obstacles and loves, in this book, are each unique, beautifully rendered, vivid and authentic. Every word of dialogue, every action, every moment is both real and captivating. This is exactly how a gay romance novel should be written.The “Deep of the Sound” is the story of Cal McCorkle, a young man of half Native-American ancestry who is the sole support of his family – his brother, Keir, with his laundry list of psychiatric disabilities and his elderly great-uncle, Nasha, who suffers from Alzheimers. He is both their financial support and, for all intents and purposes, the adult of the family that lives together in his uncle’s ramshackle house on the shore of Bluewater Bay. It’s a really hard slough for Cal, who has neither the time nor the resources to have a life, and depends, for his only relief, on his boss’ occasional intimate moments with him. His parents had been washed away in a landslide some years ago, and Cal is all his family has to keep them alive and intact. He works at one of the local resort hotels as a busboy in a restaurant. That’s not enough money to pay for both his uncle’s and brother’s medications plus the payments on the house, utilities and food for the table, so he arises, every day, long before dawn, to fish the bay for the Cod he drags into town and sells to a local hotel restaurant. His dreams of college, meeting a beautiful young man and settling down to a happy life in Bluewater Bay are just a distant memory, washed off the mountain with his parents.It’s a hard life, but Cal is dedicated to his family, and never really complains unless things get out of hand, which they do at the very beginning of “The Deep of the Sound”, when something huge, something gigantic, snags his net and almost pulls him and his boat down into the depths of the bay. He fights the monster, which rips his leg open with the hard green bony protrusions on its back. He manages to kill it with a gaffe in its back and his pocket knife embedded in its brain. But this catch is useless, because Green Sturgeon is illegal to catch, protected under the Endangered Species Act, and they grow huge, a prehistoric sea fish covered in plates, rather than scales. No one would buy the meat from him. He didn’t mean to catch the damned fish, but that probably won’t prevent him being arrested or fined for the damned fish that, literally, jumped into his boat, nearly killing him. At very least, he’s going to have to replace his destroyed net, and he really is injured. If he can’t work, his family may starve. What a terrible start to a terrible day.Avery Kennedy, on the other hand, lives a much more comfortable life in North Hollywood. He’s not starving, doesn’t have to get up at dawn to fish, and isn’t responsible for other lives. But all things are not going well. He’s a writer. He’s not the author of the Great American Novel, but he makes a passable living writing commercial pieces and occasional magazine articles. Enough, at least, to support his leech of a boyfriend, who belittles his work and talent while living off its income, dressing fit-to-kill for his non-paying internship at a banking company, demanding more and more and more while giving less and less. Avery has pretty much had it and has made a life-altering decision. He’s going to Bluewater Bay, in Washington State. That otherwise bucolic backwater has, in recent years, exploded in fame and popularity, since the wildly popular Wolf’s Landing TV series started shooting on location in the small community. The presence of famous TV and movie stars, respected guest directors and hundreds of crew members means that Bluewater Bay is no longer sleepy. In fact, it’s about to host the annual “Wolf’s Landing” convention, and Avery has a line on a magazine willing to pay him to write about the experience. He’s been a long-time, avid fan of the show and has written some well-received fan fiction. Now’s his chance to meet the cast, the other fans, and eventually, someone else will pay for it. What’s life-changing is that (and nobody knows this yet), he’s not coming back. He hates his life in North Hollywood and he has no intention of returning to it.He has good reason to leave. After all, he can write from anywhere. His boyfriend is having oral sex with his boss, his parents keep treating him as a borderline brain-damaged twelve-year-old, even telling him that he can’t move to Washington because he’s too incompetent to drive to the California border, and all he needs is to meet the right girl… It’s definitely time for a new start, a new life.Unfortunately, his parents were almost right. He made it past the California border, past the Oregon and Washington borders and just outside of Bluewater Bay before his car breaks down, in a rainstorm at a godforsaken location without cell phone reception. Only one car comes down the road toward Avery, a beat-up old pickup truck driven by Cal, with Kier at his side, the two returning from their joint doctor visits, Cal for his infected shin and Kier for his normal appointment.And that’s where it all begins. For some reason, Cal takes the stranded Avery under his wing, helps him find an automobile repair shop whose owner owes him a favor or two, and drives Avery to his hotel to check in. Cal figures he’s done with Avery. He doesn’t know him. But he knows he’s a guest at the hotel where he’s a busboy, so he’s obviously well-off (wrong) and could never handle the poverty and responsibilities under which Cal lives, day-in and day-out.But something else passes between them - the beautiful part-Native-American boy with the beat-up truck and the geeky-but-attractive writer whose car died on the way into Bluewater Bay. Of course, they were meant to get together, and they do.They see each other, every day, at the hotel – the hotel they let Avery check into, despite the fact that his debit card was erroneously frozen and left him with just the cash in his pocket – and a bank that keeps promising the new card will arrive, pretty much every day, although it doesn’t. Fortunately, Avery has his online best-friend, another Wolf’s Landing fanfic writer, who insists on loaning him a few hundred dollars to tide him over until his card arrives – if it ever does.Avery and Cal steal a little time together, after Cal finishes work and between Avery’s conference sessions. Avery gets to see how Cal lives and doesn’t judge, but he does want to help. The proud Cal hates taking help, hates needing it, and can’t quite figure out what Avery wants. At some point, he actually comes to realize it’s him, and nothing more. Avery becomes a part of the family, a trusted friend. He even gets Cal to take him fishing.Avery is not out of his own deep water yet, either. His idiot bank sends his new debit card, not to the post office, as promised, but to his mother. His idiot mother, in turn, sends the card to Avery’s ex, the one who is servicing the banker. Using his banking connections and Avery’s card, Billy and his boss empty out Avery’s account. His life savings are gone, stolen by a conspiracy between his bank, his mother, his ex-boyfriend, and the bank executive he’s “servicing”. People will get fired over this. People may go to prison over this. But that doesn’t help Avery who is, now, as poor as Cal’s family.It’s nothing less than beautiful to watch these two young men fall in love and get over their distrusts, fears and insecurities. And the final resolution, engineered by Cal’s not-yet-quite-senile great-uncle is both sad and thrilling. It will make you smile; it will make you shed a few tears.I won’t get into detail because those pivotal moments must be experienced first-hand, through the descriptive and evocative prose of the exquisite writing of Amy Lane. I laughed, I cried, I held these two men and their damaged, but loving family members close to my heart, I prayed for their Happily-Ever-After, for these two certainly deserved it, for their kindness, their caring, their giving and their huge hearts. I love the last line of the book:“Sometimes, they got to be the heroes in their own lives.”I will never forget the profoundly moving experience of reading this book, a book that far transcends its modest gay Romance roots and moves into the loftier territory of fine literature, almost effortlessly.If you’re looking for a beautiful story, beautifully written, a story that will capture your heart from the first page and never let it go, don’t miss “The Deep of the Sound” by the pre-eminently gifted Ms. Amy Lane. It’s one of the best.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Sinfully Addicted blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AIIZYIAFK3BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMUO71G#wasThisHelpful","R3AIIZYIAFK3BR","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as I can tell, this is Ms. Ryan’s first book published on Amazon. I certainly hope it will not be her last. I was so taken with this beautifully-written, vivid and confident novel that I went looking for anything else by this talented author. I was disappointed not to find any other full-length novels, but equally excited to see what she comes up with next.This is a difficult story, a story about young adults, months away from high school graduation, their families, and the horrible abuse one of the main characters, Simon, suffers at home from his single-parent father. Simon is a talented and promising artist, but socially inept and constantly fearful, as well he might be, considering that his father, the alcoholic, often-unemployed loser whose only pleasure in life is torturing his son, treats him as a slave, an object of derision and a punching bag. Simon’s mother died, some years ago, in the midst of a violent confrontation with his father, who was not charged because, like so many abusers, he was adept at manipulating the system, and convincing those responsible for both justice and the safety of children that he was a sweet victim of his insane wife, just as his son was a frequent victim of terminal clumsiness. Or at least, that was the excuse for his many visits to the hospital with his injured son. Child Protective Services failed, once again. Simon grew up too terrified of the man he refers to as “The Bastard” to tell the truth to the authorities. Of course, it didn’t help that since he was fourteen (or younger), the man had terrified him with stories of the physical and sexual abuse he would endure, in the system, if he ever reported his father or tried to run away. Simon did run away, some years ago, but, of course, the police brought him right back home to his abuser, to face his worst beating ever.Simon is terribly damaged, living in fear of almost everything, imprisoned in his father’s home, forced to cook and clean for him and punished (and often denied food) for an endless variety of imagined slights and failings.So it’s almost a miracle that he manages to sustain a crush, from a distance, on the gorgeous, 6’ 5”, gentle giant that is Jimmy Bennett, a geek of epic proportions (if his T-shirts are any indication). Jimmy already knows he wants to be a teacher. He gets such pleasure out of sharing information, out of seeing the light bulb go off, at making even the most difficult and dense subjects simple, clear and understandable to someone wrestling to wrap his or her brain around them. Simon doesn’t even think Jimmy is gay, but the two occasionally share a broad smile across the dining room at lunch, and at occasional accidental encounters in the halls or the library.Everything changes when Simon goes to the tutoring center for help with his trigonometry class. He can’t imagine why he’s having such difficulty when he’d always done so well at math, even Advanced Algebra, but just can’t seem to “get” trigonometry. The tutor, of course, turns out to be Jimmy. A couple of hours alone with the gorgeous, smart young man, and he begins to really get a handle on the subject that, if he fails, would jeopardize the art scholarship he needs to pay for college next year.It’s not just trig he gets help with in the relatively brief tutoring session, but, unexpectedly, his entire life. The two boys fall in love, that day, though neither would think of saying so. I mean, this kind of thing just doesn’t happen that fast. Although, in Jimmy’s family it seems to happen all the time. His wonderful parents met in high school, fell in love on the spot, married shortly after graduation and have had a loving, happy marriage for more than twenty-some-odd years. Jimmy’s older sister, Amy, did the same with her boyfriend Dirk, and they’ve been happily married for more than seven years.The boys’ families could not be more different. Simon, raised in fear and pain, despised and exploited by his father, plagued with violence and twisted by endless assaults on his self-esteem, can’t even conceive of the words “family” and “happy” in the same sentence. Jimmy, on the other hand, raised in a loving, warm household, where everyone has respect for one another, openly demonstrating their mutual affection, enjoys an easy, confident life, always sure of his family’s love and protection.When these boys fall in love, something has to give. And it does, when Simon’s father breaks his ankle with a baseball bat. Jimmy is determined to get him out of that terrible house, and away from the endless abuse inflicted by Simon’s father.Jimmy’s family backs him up. They beg Simon to move in with them. They assure him that no one has to suffer that kind of abuse and that he would be cherished and loved, like their own child, if he would just agree to move in with them. Simon has no frame of reference. He can’t imagine why any family would be willing to take him in, why any normal family would want someone as damaged and undeserving as himself. But Jimmy’s horror, anger, protectiveness and love convince Simon to tell the Child Services caseworker the truth of how he received his injuries and of his years enduring similar acts of violence.Jimmy’s love sustains him, and gives him a glimpse of what life might be like. The Bennets accept him with open arms and show him what a family could and should be. Still, he is plagued with nightmares and insecurities and terrified that his father will show up and damage or kill Jimmy and his family, not to mention himself.The largest part of this book is dedicated to the daunting challenge of helping Simon heal, of giving him a safe space, security and love. Jimmy is almost insane with his need to help, and that causes some issues with Simon, who doesn’t want to be dependent, and is terrified that once he is not so needy, Jimmy will no longer love him.This book is about family abuse and surviving it. It is particularly meaningful since the abused boy happens to be gay. As if it’s not difficult enough to survive the challenges of just growing up, gay kids also have to deal with the unnecessary and painful burden of homophobia. But “The Geek and His Artist” is also about loving families, who treat each other with humor and open affection and willingly provide the patience and understanding required to help a loved one recover from long-term physical and emotional abuse.The author admits that she likes obstacles, happy endings and stories with gay characters. Trust me, there is a reason her first name is Hope. In fact, that’s what I liked most about the book. There is stomach-turning abuse for which you will feel terrible anger, but Ms. Ryan always holds out hope, kindness, compassion and love as the antidotes. Both boys’ high-school friends are accepting and kind, and Simon’s integration into the Bennett family will move you to tears – the kind of tears you get when witnessing acceptance and unconditional love first-hand.Ms. Ryan is a perfectly wonderful writer, delivering characters, descriptions and dialogue that are full-blown, vivid and deeply developed. Despite the difficult theme, there was not one moment in which I wanted to put the book down. In fact, I read it twice, which is most unusual for me. The depictions of the badinage between family members, including the embarrassment at frank discussions of very personal matters with one’s parents will have you chuckling with familiarity.“The Geek and His Artist” is a well-conceived and beautiful book. Don’t miss it. I give it my highest rating and my heartfelt recommendation to everyone who wants to read a moving, gentle, insightful book that’s ultimately, all about love.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Suddenly Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZU5UZWHIEJMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7J19RS#wasThisHelpful","RZU5UZWHIEJMY","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“How to Be a Normal Person”, by TJ Klune, is a terribly ironic, unbelievable, brilliantly-written, but utterly and totally strange book. I have never read a TJ Klune book that was not funny, smart, and heartfelt, and this is no exception. But I will readily admit that “How to Be a Normal Person” is a bit stranger than even Mr. Klune’s normal strange.It is a love story, an ironic indictment of everything hip, a radical condemnation of Michael Bey as the corrupter of all modern culture (anyone up for Transformers 137?), a condemnation of any car newer than 1994, a paean to Elderly Lesbian Sister Motorcycle Gang Threesomes, and a prodigious hosanna to pot, weed, the stronger the better, the more the merrier.Could it be that Mr. Klune smoked a bit too much while writing this adventure in modern surrealism, or is he just now demonstrating the perversity of his rather demented mind? Inquiring minds want to know!“Normal” (the title is entirely too long), is about Gustavo Tiberius, a young, reasonably attractive modern gay guy raised by his beloved, but almost perpetually stoned, single parent, Pastor Tommy (an incomprehensible title, since he was always a rather dedicated atheist), who managed two things despite his perpetual high: 1) he loved his son Gus, and let him always know that he was loved and perfect, exactly as is; and 2) managed to buy up almost the entire town of Abby, Oregon, immediately lowering the rents to the tenants and earning the love and respect of everyone in town.He was also rollicking good fun. Gus is not. He might have been had his mother not abandoned him before the age of 3, and his father not died and left him alone and bereft three years ago. This remarkably OCD young man (still not quite thirty) grew into the town curmudgeon, a guy who reads the encyclopedia Britannica every night before bed, wears a perpetual frown of disapproval each day, wakes up, telling himself “today will be an OK day”, flexes his almost-existent arm muscles in the bathroom mirror as he does his daily ablutions, eats the same breakfast, one red apple, before loading his pet ferret (Harry S. Truman) into his carrier, and heads out to get his plain black coffee at Lottie’s Lattes before walking to his video-rental store, a half-block away, Harry S. Truman firmly under his arm.Every day is an OK day for this eccentric voyager, because every day is almost exactly the same. A busy day at the video rental store consists of three-to-four customers, a normal day, maybe one or two. His retail category, one long dead, is kept alive by Gus, who hates change, which is why he drives a ’94 Ford Taurus (the greatest car ever manufactured). Even his customers are the same, depending on the day of the week. The three Elderly Lesbian Leather Cycle Sisters (no one knows if they are either sisters or Lesbians, but it seems likely), who terrorize the countryside on their trusty Vespas, when not renting DVDs in alphabetical order by title. Currently, they’re up to the ‘C’s. Gus’ lunch, each day, is brought over by Lottie, late of Lottie’s Lattes (oh my how he hates alliteration!), the tiny woman with the big drag-queen hair, and he lives in fear that she will betray him one day by including a pickle with his sandwich. He hates pickles.Gus’ routine is interrupted in the most offensive way possible. When he goes into Lottie’s Lattes, one morning, there is a young man, with unruly hair tied back in a messy little bun, and an incredibly scruffy beard, behind the counter. He can’t help himself (this is NOT happening!), but one look in his beautiful blue eyes, and the orderly world of the tongue-tied video-store-proprietor and landlord to almost the entire town, is upended, perhaps permanently. OMG, there’s a hipster serving him his coffee. This cannot be! What is that terribly annoying pounding sensation and constriction in his chest? Perhaps he’s coming down with something?The scruffy hot guy behind the counter is Lottie’s nephew, Casey, an asexual stoner hipster. Now Gus is no virgin. He’s hooked up at least three times, but all three occasions turned out to be meaningless one-night-stands, and not worth breaking up his routine for. Since Pastor Tommy died, Gus was pretty sure he doesn’t want to get too close to anyone, especially an asexual hipster working in his aunt Lottie’s coffee shop.But finally, he can’t help himself. He is fascinated with Casey, but lost as to what to do about it. Let’s just say that Casey’s social skills are not exactly highly developed. Oddly enough, his friends, the three elderly women in the Lesbian Vespa Motorcycle Gang, Lottie, and a few others around town understand that Gus really does love them under all his disapproving scowling and pouting, and he sometimes (not too often) admits he sort of likes them too - even if they are prone to alliteration (which he hates, despite the fact that often uses it, himself, in an ongoing battle of wits with everyone else in the world) and who may even like the occasional Michael Bey movie.Casey, as it turns out, is rather special. He is not the asexual shiftless stoner hipster he appears to be. Well, actually, he is, but he’s also a world-famous and wealthy best-selling author of young adult, post-apocalyptic, vampire/werewolf novels starring yet another threesome that he has no idea how to resolve. In fact, L. A. has gotten to him, and he came to take the mountain air in Abby, Oregon to recharge his batteries and “find himself” again, as any self-respecting hipster needs to do, from time to time.Unfortunately, Gus accidentally overhears a conversation between Casey and his aunt in which they discuss how strange, weird and not-normal Gus is. That hurts, because his fascination with Casey is growing instead of wearing off. He loves to make Casey smile. And his tongue-twisted, but brilliant perversion of the English language, and his huge heart, make Casey smile often.Thus begins the guts of this long and bizarre tale – in which our OCD hero decides that he needs to become normal, orders “the Internet” from his Cable Company and looks up “How to Become a Normal Person” in Google. Unfortunately, his first hit is a Tumblr porn blog and a video in which the naked, overdeveloped male lead keeps telling the hapless woman that he is going to make her mouth pregnant. That’s it, slam the lid on the laptop. This is NOT going to work.Fortunately (or not), he finds a site directly on point – how to come off as a normal person and interact with other normal people normally. It’s like 200 steps, each one more bizarre than the previous one.Note: This is a plot device, not a real site. It is a perfect parody of what the Internet is really like, a world in which information is often wrong, but worse, delivered irreverently. Being the literal OCD, but big-hearted and lonely young man he is, Gus follows the instructions to the letter. If the blog suggests discussing a topic or dressing a particular way, instead of using the suggestions as examples of what to do, he acts out each one. Which makes a number of conversations unutterably strange, but that still makes Casey smile, so that’s OK.Casey also smiles broadly when he discovers that Gus wears pajama pants with little faces of a well-known Palestinian terrorist on them:“You have sleep pants with tiny pictures of… is that Yasser Arafat? You have pajamas with a dead Palestinian leader’s face on them?”“Uh. Yeah. They’re my Yasser Arapants!”Note: Let’s be honest, who but TJ Klune would have the nerve to write those lines? Who, indeed!Similar insanity ensues. After all, the instructions on How to Become a Normal Person are virtually endless.Not a lot happens except for Gus wearing his deceased father’s loud Hawaiian print shirts and flip-flops (totally out of character), proposes to write a movie about a band of monkeys who are international detectives, four of Casey’s L. A. Hipster buddies show up, and commence to try to humiliate Gus who is rich enough to buy them all several times over, especially as they are all broke poseurs, and he’s smart and honest enough to expose all their hypocrisy and pretensions. He invites Casey on their first date, the town’s Strawberry Festival, only to find out that Casey is deadly allergic to strawberries.But the most important thing that happens is that Gus smiles. He actually cracks a smile, and in public, to boot, something no one had seen since Pastor Tommy passed away. Could it be, could Gus actually be happy for a fleeting moment? He’d swear it wasn’t true, he’d insist it was just an attack of stomach gas, but everyone knows. OMG, Gus was falling in love with the asexual stoner hipster! Will wonders never cease?In reviewing my notes on “How to Become a Normal Person”, I realized that there just isn’t much to be said about Mr. Klune. He is one of my top two or three favorite authors. His recent “The Lightning-Struck Heart” had me rolling on the floor. “Normal” is not, in my opinion, his best book, but you have to understand that TJ Klune’s worst writing is better than the best work of almost any other author. He applies his acerbic wit often at virtually the same moment that he tugs at your heartstrings. You will love Gus, and you will miss Pastor Tommy, and you’ll root for these two crazy young men to get it together, though you’ll doubt if they ever have sex, what with Casey being asexual and Gus loving Casey’s hugs with a true passion.And you will admire TJ’s remarkable aim. His ability to sight a likely target and tear it to pieces, exposing all of its pretensions and shallowness is legendary.I can’t help but feel that this book was an experiment on Mr. Klune’s part. It’s really not at all like most of his other books, which are jet-propelled, slapstick-inspired, and profoundly moving, all at the same time. This book was much slower (as befits the pace of its protagonist and the sleepy village in which it’s set). But I’m not entirely sure it was an always-successful experiment. After the first few “chapters” of the online advice site, in which he exposes the core of the craziness of the Internet, it got a bit old, just as it does in many of the real-world web sites I’ve surfed in recent years. I got lost, for hours, the other night, in an intense site on how to season a cast iron pan! As a plot device setting Gus up for his next grand faux pas, the “normal” blog worked, but I could have done with a bit less of it. On the other hand, his remarkable scene in which Gus orders a Web connection from his local cable company was so on point as to be hysterical – and maddeningly realistic. Gus thought he’d tear his hair out trying to communicate with a sales rep who refused to go off-script, and his installer insisted on three days’ paid vacation after installing the “Internet” for him.Aside from the slight tedium of the endless Internet guide to normalcy, it’s simply a brilliant book. It’s also a smart book. Trust me, you won’t identify with the characters, and you’re not supposed to. You’re supposed to delight in them, in their bumbling, tongue-tied intellectualism, yet revel in the big-heartedness and innocence at their core.Read it. After all, everyone deserves an occasional descent into friendly insanity, and no one does friendly insanity better than TJ Klune.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Suddenly Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDIUBISJI123F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VOHR0K#wasThisHelpful","RDIUBISJI123F","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Where the Grass is Greener” is a wonderful novel. In fact, it’s a bit of a relief – the characters do have their challenges, obstacles to overcome, a teenager who throws a wrench into the works, a relationship that spans two continents (much of which is a very big ocean), two ranches, and two cowboys, four thousand miles apart, who can’t quite seem to get together. It’s never the right time, never the right place. After all, this is a gay romance novel.But unlike the majority of gay romance novels, ”Where the Grass is Greener” does not depend on an excess of angst, it isn’t driven by lies that shouldn’t have been told, and there’s no horrendous childhoods to haunt either man. In fact, the book is filled with color and light. The settings are lush, verdant and filled with life, the characters are authentic and sincere, and the dialogue is exquisitely crafted, with its fluid, seamless shifts between the voices of the American, Chancey, and the Irishman, Seamus. To be honest, it’s just a lovely read, a beautiful excursion into the minds and hearts of two men destined to be together, two men who desperately need to find a way to share one life – and do.“Where the Grass Is Greener” opens with Seamus back in Ireland after five years working on a ranch in the American Midwest, and Chancey, his former foreman, drunk-dialing him in the middle of the night, all the way from Kansas. Fortunately, Seamus doesn’t pick up, but the next call, the next day, he does, and is stunned to hear Chancey’s familiar voice saying “I miss you, Shay”. They had been close once, all too briefly - intimately close - just before Seamus upped and disappeared back to Ireland without even the courtesy of a “good-bye”.That’s the simple part: a basic misunderstanding about how serious they really were about each other, with Seamus leaving furtively so he wouldn’t have to embarrass himself with a tearful good-bye and the end of a relationship that he assumed was more intense on his part than Chancey’s. He was wrong.Add to this equation a few more complications: Chancey has full custody of his daughter, Dee, the product of his marriage to ex-wife Kaylee, who is now an up-and-coming singer beginning to work her way up the Country-Western charts. She’s busy. Too busy to raise a daughter or acknowledge the man who is raising her, except when she shows up with a magazine reporter so she can “play the family card” for the press. Otherwise, she’s simply an ambitious singer and an atrocious, self-centered, absentee mother. Due to both necessity and inclination, Chancey is raising the pubescent Dee as a single parent, which has left him little time or opportunity to have a serious relationship. Until Seamus came along. He really thought they’d hit it off and wanted to see where their burgeoning relationship might lead. Apparently nowhere, with Seamus back in Ireland without so much as a word of farewell. Not even “talk to you soon”.As busy as he is, as foreman of a successful ranch, and parent of a talented and involved teenager, there are certain times of every day when Chancey really misses Seamus. Seamus, to be honest, misses Chancey just as much. They need to find a way to bridge the 4000 miles between them. Skype to the rescue! At the end of a day running crews on a cabbage farm, Seamus returns home to his new laptop with bated breath, anxiously awaiting the familiar Skype ring that signals that Chancey is online. It works. The two men carry on the 21st-Century version of a long-distance relationship, Skypeing and texting. It’s not like really being together, but it’s the next best thing. In fact, the Skype-sex is pretty damned hot. And the two men actually get to talk to one another.That doesn’t mean they’ve got the communicating thing quite down yet. There’s the time when Chancey calls and sees a hot young gay guy in Seamus’ house. Now he knows why he couldn’t get a return text from Seamus. Actually not. Michael is a ranch hand on the farm Seamus manages who was tossed out by his “good Christian” parents when they discovered their son was gay. Out of an abundance of compassion, Seamus lets him stay in his guest room, and he is a help around the house. They’re finally getting to all those little repairs that Seamus had been putting off. And, truth be told, it’s nice not to be alone all the time. But through the cloudy lens of distance, Chancey fears that Seamus has found himself a younger, hotter man to pass his time with, home in Ireland.Chancey has his turn on the long-distance firing line, when Seamus calls and discovers that Chancey’s miserable ex-wife has somehow wormed her way back into Chancey’s life. As it turns out, she only showed up to inform her ex and her daughter that she was getting married again. And, of course, she needs her daughter as window-dressing. After all, that’s all she ever wanted her daughter for. Seamus doesn’t know about the impending marriage, and thinks the former couple might be getting back together again for the sake of their daughter. It just proves that gay men can have the exact same miscommunication issues 4000 miles away from each other that they have living together side-by-side.Fortunately, the authors are gentle with us, and the periods of conflict and misunderstanding are brief and few and far-between.The turning point is Seamus’ brother’s wedding. For those who, like me, are big fans of the authors’ previous book, “Leaving Flowers”, Paddy and Aidan are back, and they’re getting married. Of course they’re not getting married in Ireland or Kansas, but in Pennsylvania, almost exactly midway between Ireland and Kansas – which is a pretty convenient occasion and location for the two men to get together, once more, in the flesh. And they do.The wedding is wonderful, light, moving, and a perfect coda to the drama and passion of “Leaving Flowers”, as well as a beautiful starting point for the burgeoning love between Paddy’s brother, Seamus, and Chancey, the man who loves him. All that’s left is to figure out how to be physically together, full time. These two men cannot stand being apart any longer. As well as Skype had worked for the couple, you can’t go to sleep and wake up spooning with a laptop. So where will they live? How will they get Dee to agree to such a big change in her life, and how will they hold off that miserable woman who is still Dee’s self-centered mother?That’s for you to discover. When I started writing this review, I was lost as to what I might say about “Where the Grass is Greener”, what new insights I might bring to the readers of a book I really enjoyed, a book written by two enormously gifted writers. And then I realized that, aside from introducing you to the characters and giving you a brief outline of the plot, there wasn’t much more to say. “Where the Grass is Greener” is not Shakespeare. The long-distance relationship is hardly a unique theme. And where their previous book, “Leaving Flowers” was a hard punch to the solar plexus with angst galore, “Where the Grass is Greener” is a much gentler, lighter and more endearing book. Dare I say it, and not as faint praise? This book is charming. It put a smile on my face to meet such engaging characters in prose that’s a pleasure to read. It’s like a breath of fresh air to live with normal, smart, good people for a few hours, to root for the happy ending you know they deserve, and you’re pretty darned sure they will get.Sometimes it’s nice to read a gay romance that doesn’t rip you apart, that delivers a lot more gentle smiles than sobs and tears, that transports you back-and-forth between Kansas and Ireland with vivid settings, sometimes-funny dialogue, and a few of the most likable characters you may have encountered in a very long time.Sometimes it’s nice to read just for superb writing and gentle characters whose story you experience, as though you’re really there. For that, and so much more, I recommend this book. It’s wonderful to see that the two books in this nascent series can share some of the same characters and history, but be as different from each other as night and day.That bodes well for a wide variety of well-written and heartwarming stories from Ms. McGowan and Ms. O’Tierney.

"“All the Things I’ve Lost” is a lovely small book. It’s either a long novella or a short book (121 pages), but it’s packed with meaning, allegory and love.I seem to be running into a lot of alien gay fiction lately, and I know why. When I was just a boy and first aware of my “errant” sexuality, I invented my own personal Alien. He was a beautiful young man with long, flowing blond hair who radiated absolute acceptance and validation. Though just a fantasy, he allowed me to believe that our world could be a better place, that tolerance, respect and love really would, someday, triumph over stupidity and bigotry.That’s exactly what Ms. Shiloh is telling us in “All the Things I’ve Lost”. Her main character is an alien, an alien who crash-landed on Earth more than 80 years ago. Lee never seems to age, is remarkably strong, impervious to disease, and seems to care passionately about the humans he lives with, interacts with, and saves from mayhem and murder on the streets.The problem is that he can’t remember. Apparently, as a result of the crash (which only he survived), he has forgotten where he came from, his language, his past, even his name. He’s spent the last 80 years constructing a human life, a human persona, someone who fits into human society, but without the hatred, intolerance and anger of too many of the people of the Earth. Over those 80 years, he has also saved a lot of money – his needs are minimal – and used it to relieve the suffering of many of the people around him.Then, one day, everything changes. He comes home to find a total stranger, a beautiful young man, has taken up residence in his apartment. Dion was like him, someone from his planet, someone who might be able to fill in the blanks. He is immediately physically attracted to the elegant man, and more important, he has been so lonely, for so long. He had stopped trying to be with human men when he accidentally killed the first man he tried to be intimate with. He didn’t understand his own strength, at first, nor the delicacy of the human body, and his passion was so intense, so physical, that it crushed this innocent young man. He held him in his arms as he died. Lee never forgave himself, and for 80 years, he never touched another person intimately, out of guilt and fear.Now here’s this gorgeous man, just as strong as he is, someone upon whom he can unleash his pent-up passion without fear of damaging or killing him. They make love, non-stop, for more than a week. They can’t stop touching each other. But, in fact, he doesn’t know Dion and, after a while, wonders what he’s doing, giving over his life to this man he knows nothing about, a perfect stranger.As it turns out, they were “paired” for life by virtue of those first days together. Lee is not happy. Somehow, he seems to have been tricked into gaining a husband, tricked into making a lifelong commitment, one he never intended. As the years move along (just the blink of an eye for men who live for centuries), Lee finds himself drifting away from Dion, trapped by this kind, but needy man he never chose. It breaks Dion’s heart.With the assistance of crystals that came to earth in Dion’s pod, Dion helps him locate debris from the site of Lee’s crash, in the hope of finding any scrap that might tell Lee a little more about who he was, where he came from, and whom he loved. It turns out that Lee was pretty well known on his home planet, where he was a member of a religion with radical beliefs – that all living beings are equally worthy, including men who love men, a novel concept on his planet. It takes so long for his people to reproduce, and reproduction is so rare, that anyone who refuses even the attempt, by pairing with a person of the same sex, is deemed inferior and unacceptable. As Mark Zubro recently wrote in his own alien epic, “Stupidity appears to be universal across the galaxies”.Ms. Shiloh’s main character obviously agrees, and though he came to earth seeking freedom, tolerance and kindness, Earth turns out not to be the paradise he hoped it might be. But still, he makes it his business to practice his beliefs, dedicating his life to helping others anonymously. Lee is often convinced he’s failed, but Dion reminds him that he has changed people’s lives, for the better, in countless ways over the years. Though changing the world might not be possible, trying counts, and that’s a big part of Ms. Shiloh’s message. These are both good men, and though they won’t be able to eradicate hatred and suffering on their own, they can make a dent in it, which is all that can be asked of all good people, both human and alien.A lot of the book revolves around the aliens’ love story. Their relationship is on-and-off-again as Lee sometimes feels trapped by Dion, at other times grateful for his concern and love. It’s only when they travel home again that Lee realizes that they have grown deeply in love, are truly paired, and that he has not been the best husband while he grieved for a past he couldn’t remember.What Ms. Shiloh makes abundantly clear, without preaching or political rants, is that love is love, has nothing to do with gender, and that its core is kindness, concern, caring, consoling and celebrating, whether here on Earth or in some alien galaxy. And she does it beautifully, through the attitudes, dialogue and thoughts of her two main characters, through their native desire to help and to prevent pain and suffering, and through their compulsion to bring love, safety, security and laughter to children.At a time of right-wing religious hate-mongers, a U. S. Presidential primary where all the candidates vie to out-hate each other, in order to pander to the worst elements of the electorate, in which religious groups in the Middle East imprison, hang and throw gays off the roofs of tall buildings, it is important to remember and treasure the author’s profound and beautiful message.This is a small book with a big theme, as only Hollis Shiloh can write it. She is an extraordinary writer, whose heart bleeds at injustice and exalts at love. She is a writer much to be admired, as is “All the Things I’ve Missed”. Don’t miss it. I gladly give it my highest and most heartfelt recommendation.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Suddenly Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH20BBP7WJROW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013M17MS6#wasThisHelpful","RH20BBP7WJROW","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Leta Blake's for some time now. But this is my first exposure to Indra Vaughn. This dynamic duo is unstoppable. ""Vespertine"" is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. There were tears in my eyes almost all the way through, but none of them were tears of sadness. The authors invest the main characters with a depth of beauty and a love so profound that almost every single page is a revelation.Nicky Blumfeld, better known as Nico Blue, is one of the top rock stars in the world, achieving brilliant success on the back of Vespertine's first two albums, albums of music fraught with pain and separation. Nicky knows all about pain and separation - too intimately. Nicky was an abandoned baby, found by a homeless man in a dumpster where his crack-addict mother threw him, discarded as an inconvenience to her life of drugs and prostitution.He knocked around, for a few of his formative years until taken in by a couple with all the love in the world to spare. The Blumfelds gave him a home, a family and a good life. But it was almost too late. He couldn't love his parents the way they loved him. His Reactive Attachment Disorder made it very difficult to trust and love his parents. They never gave up, and they were always there for him, but he felt like he lived in a cage, one in which other people could not reach him, and he could not reach out to others. His only real connection to life was music. He was a child prodigy, teaching himself to play piano before he even entered school, taking up one instrument after another, mastering each within only days. Music was his solace, his communion, the only mode of expression available to him. Even as a young child, he composed serious music.As ""Vespertine"" opens, Nicky is headed home. He just finished a stint in rehab. He'd spent the last few years doing every drug he could get his hands on, and everyone he could get his hands on, losing the few connections he had to the soul-deadening addictions that blunted his pain, but also blunted his music. The last two albums sold pretty well, but he hated their music, as did all the other coked-up members of the band except for their remarkably talented (and drug-free) lady-drummer.He knew that coming home would be extraordinarily difficult because he'd have to face the source of his excruciating pain for the last seventeen years. Jazz is the only man he ever loved - the man he'd been in love with since they were both nine, the man who abandoned him to his pain, the subject of every song Nicky wrote for Vespertine. The problem is that Jazz is now Father Jaspar, a Catholic priest, an open, but celibate, gay man, a man who gave up both the man he loved and love itself in order to dedicate himself to God.He didn't warn Nicky. He never even hinted. He just informed him he was going to seminary and left. He left Nicky in pieces.These two boys were always fated to be with each other, and Jazz tore that apart, tearing apart Nicky's heart in the process. Jazz had been the only one who broke through the cage of Nicky's heart and mind. They say that kids who suffer Reactive Attachment Disorder can't love, can't have relationships, but that's not true. Jazz grounded Nicky in a way that gave his life meaning, that taught him the meaning of joy. He was the first one to touch him, both his heart and body, the first one to show him the possibilities that lie in the hope of love. And he was suddenly gone.Now Nicky's back home, and he'll have no choice but to deal with ""Father Jazz"". Jaspar has marked out his own world without Nicky in it.He founded a shelter in an abandoned Diocese school called ""Blue Oasis"", a shelter dedicated to LGBTQ kids, a safe space where they can thrive away from bullying, humiliation, and the families who tossed them out like garbage because they might be gay.The authors pay a lot of attention to the secondary characters, using them to explain, underline and illuminate the themes of family, love and self-acceptance. They're awfully good at it. Nicky and Jaspar are exquisitely-crafted characters, but so are the secondary characters,  even a crazy yellow cat who adopts both of them, while driving them a bit crazy with her gifts of torn-up wildlife, bloody floors, and body parts strewn throughout Jaspar's house. Jaspar's mother, the renowned surgeon, is brilliant, successful and cold. She was, in fact, one of the reasons that Jaspar became ""Father Jazz"", though she wasn't too happy about that, either - she hoped to have raised another renowned doctor. But she understood Reactive Attachment Disorder and warned her son to stay far away from Nicky as possible, adamant that Nicky could not and would not love him because his disorder would prevent that from ever happening. Nicky could not love, and therefore, Nicky would not love.""Vespertine"" is the beautiful story of these boys (now young men) taking up where they left off, dwelling a lot in the past as they build a future, the love between them rekindled, though each were afraid it would be just another hiatus with a heartbreaking ending. Fortunately, it doesn't turn out to be that - but, rather, an interrupted love story that continues on, despite their best efforts to deny and derail it.One of the things I found most moving about this beautiful love story is the sheer goodness of both men. Despite their missteps and loneliness, despite Nicky's drug addiction and Jaspar's seventeen years without human affection, without simple human touch (and we wonder why Priests succumb to such terrible predatory acts - researchers say that the lack of human touch causes serious mental illness), they are both always looking to do the right thing. As much as he still loves Jazz, Nicky doesn't want to be the temptation that tears him away from his calling. And Jaspar wrestles with his motives, with his reasons for becoming a priest, his vanity in his position, his service to God. These conflicts play out in front of the reader, and they will both intrigue you and overwhelm you with their beauty.Nicky desperately needs to break away from the endless road touring, the label whose management keeps them stoned enough to rock onstage, heedless of the addictions they're creating and feeding in their artists, yet making endless demands based on the terrible contract the band signed as kids, virtual slaves to the suits and their money machine. He knows he will not be able to stay clean and sober if he is forced to go back to the road and the studio and a record label steeped in drugs and exploitation.""Father Jazz"", on the other hand, has to figure out what God's plan for him is, sick at the thought of abandoning his oaths and commitments to God and the church. At some point, the more certain he becomes that the love he shares with Nicky, both the spiritual love and the physical love may, indeed, be exactly what God had planned all along - and that his priestly vows may well have been an act of hubris on this part, and perhaps even flight from the man he was told could never love him. If only he had trusted his gut and his heart. Jazz has to get to the point of accepting that, although he loves God, he loves Nicky more - and perhaps that is exactly what he was destined to do.This is a quintessential gay romance, not a tragedy. So you know they will find a way to each other. And when they do, the sheer rightness of it, the sheer passiono of their long-enduring love, and even the holiness of their bond, lead Jazz to his inevitable decision.There's a brilliant climax that will have you on the edge of your seat, wondering if either one will survive their tragedies, but the authors, in the spirit of generosity that permeates this book, don't torture the reader with the worst possibilities, but deliver them back into each others' arms, where they belong, and bless the reader with one of the most satisfying and beautiful endings I've read in quite some time.This is an exquisitely-written novel. Its characters are authentic and indelible. ""Vespertine"" is a story to warm your heart and evoke an occasional tear without ever falling in to cheap sentimentality.If you're looking for a book to read that will move you, an intelligent book that weaves serious and heartrending themes into its love story, a book with challenges galore, yet driven by inevitability, you must read ""Vespertine"".I promise you won't regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUOKGF6DCGFXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153YLK5Q#wasThisHelpful","RUOKGF6DCGFXH","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started reading “Leaving Flowers”, I confess that I didn’t hold out much hope for this book. The main character, Aidan, came off as one of those infantilized men you run across in mediocre gay novels – more like a 12-year-old prepubescent girl than an adult gay man. And, to be honest, I just hate that.But I withheld judgment (sometimes I actually do something reasonably smart) and, by the time I finished this beautiful novel, I understood and appreciated where the authors were coming from, and what they had accomplished.The other main character is Patrick (Paddy), a thoroughly Irish, beautiful young man with a gorgeous body, covered in freckles from head-to-toe, which goes perfectly with his fire-red hair. His most endearing characteristic is his upbeat personality. Despite being a cemetery groundskeeper, he’s almost always happy. Dealing with an endless stream of grief-stricken mourners, he never stops appreciating and loving the lush, life-affirming landscape he nurtures, offering survivors a brief glimpse of color, promise and beauty. And he smiles, almost all the time.The two meet when Patrick is closing the cemetery, one evening, and has to ask Aidan to leave. The rest is history. Two beautiful men, in a cemetery, of all places, eyes meet, instant love, or at least lust, or perhaps just strong attraction. Over the next few weeks, they conspire to meet “accidentally” until Aidan gets up the nerve to ask Paddy out on a “friendship” date, not yet ready to admit to the undeniable and intense attraction between the two men.The date goes well. The dialogue they share is charming, witty, and expresses the growing affection between them, without ever using the actual words.Well, this is a gay romance novel, so all does not, of course, go well. As Patrick discovers who Aidan is, he begins to understand the dreadful issues Aidan is suffering through. The grave he’s visiting is his twin sister’s, who died in childbirth, and Aidan just can’t seem to move on from his memories and his grief. It’s ruining his life and any chance at a good one, a fulfilling one, or even the remotest possibility of love.The relationship continues, becoming even more intense the more they know about each other, the more experiences they share, and with every passionate, intimate encounter. The authors put it much better than I can. As Aidan mulls the ardent, persistent, yet gentle love that Patrick offers him, he muses:“Patrick Williams had been witness to Aidan’s few ups, his many, many downs, and a whole bushel of crazy. And yet, he’s stayed…”It’s a perfect description of the dysfunctional relationship that develops between the two men – dysfunctional on Aidan’s part, but refreshingly functional, steady and determined on Patrick’s.This book is about the journey that Aidan takes to get a life, a life apart from his beloved sister. A life that moves on without forgetting:  “…learning to let go of Nadia without losing Nadia.”My initial impression of Aidan was not entirely off-base. He was undoubtedly suffering a bad case of arrested development, even before Nadia died, only three years ago. He’s a 27-year-old virgin, but the timeline means that he was a 24-year-old virgin, even before his twin sister passed away. What changed my initial dismay was the fact that his arrested development was entirely intentional, used by the authors to express a dynamic between twins that is not always positive, especially when one is dominant and the other passive. One twin comes to rule both lives, which is never a good thing. In Aidan’s case, he was left with guilt, loss and grief, but none of the internal drive or tools to live, grow and make his own decisions.You would think that he would just substitute Patrick for Nadia, passively accepting Patrick’s guidance and decisions. But you’d be wrong. Aidan comes to life under Patrick’s patient love, as a full and equal partner, as a strong adult man charting out his own future. That’s Patrick’s special gift, not to dominate Aidan (thank heavens, there’s none of that is this gentle book), but to grow the other man’s soul and independence, just as he plants and nurtures the flowers he lovingly cultures.In lesser hands than Ms. O’Tierney’s and Ms. McGowan’s, “Leaving Flowers” could easily have devolved into melodrama. But they’re both accomplished and talented authors whose prose, settings and dialogue are virtually flawless, and whose characters are, ultimately, endearing and moving.Yes, there were a few obligatory gay-romance memes, such as a hospitalization and a sexual assault, but most fortunately, no wrestling with orientation, oppression, coming out, or any of the rest of the panoply of standard gay-romance clichés. I applaud the authors for their sensitivity and the authenticity of the emotions they evoke so exquisitely and subtly.The book left me in tears of joy, just for the simple love and compassion of these very special characters and the talented authors who so lovingly nourished them.If you’re looking for a book that’s different, and moves you without manipulating you, then I can highly and heartily recommend “Leaving Flowers”. It won’t disappoint.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Suddenly Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGBZYSX7M9FU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UY86QUG#wasThisHelpful","RGBZYSX7M9FU5","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Louise Lyons is a talented author. She writes gently and lovingly about her characters, no matter how much angst they survive, no matter what the vicissitudes of life throw in their way. And she really, deeply understands gay men, their feelings, their experiences, their dreams. But most important, she writes beautiful lyrical prose that is a pure pleasure to read.Beautiful Thunder is no exception.This is the story of two men who couldn’t be much more different, nor any less likely fated to be together. Lindsey is a delicate, beautiful young guitarist, whose silken hair, lithe, sexy body and powerful music belie his inherent shyness and tendency to barely speak, if at all. Alex, on the other hand, is a much more confident young man. Unrelentingly heterosexual for most of his life, he’s also a surprisingly well-off young man with a high-end “maisonette” in Nottingham, and a beloved BMW to tool around town in.Alex and his sister have been on their own for the past decade, since their parents died. Being a bit older, Anna raised Alex through his teenage years. Although they both inherited their parents’ fortune, and neither needs to work a day for the rest of their lives, Anna always needed something meaningful to do with her life, and hence, works long hours as a dedicated nurse. That works well, because Alex still needs quite a bit of mothering, usually forgetting to shop for food, often skipping meals and barely taking care of himself. He’s content to drift, not just without a career, but bouncing from one-night-stand to one-night-stand, usually with nameless chicks he picks up in a local rock club.But beneath it all, Alex does actually harbor a dream: to sing with a band, help them write their music, to perform in front of appreciative audiences. Fortunately, he’s gifted with a powerful, beautiful voice, so it’s not just a pipe dream – Alex has the power to back it up if he can just grab hold of an opportunity and ride it for all it’s worth.There’s not a lot of successful rock bands in Nottingham, though, surprisingly, the area does sport a number of clubs with great music, sometimes featuring well-known performers, which spawn a surprising number of hopeful bands, all seeking recognition, fame and fortune. So every day, Alex sits with the local classified and responds to ads from bands seeking new members.One of those bands gives him an impromptu try-out over the phone, and invites him in for a face-to-face audition. He kills it. The River Rats is just at the starting blocks, but the band was beginning to gain some traction performing a number of well-received gigs when their lead singer upped and quit. Alex is a perfect fit.It’s at this live audition that Alex meets the shy, talented guitar god, Lindsey. So reticent, Alex doesn’t think Lindsey even likes him, but when the music starts, he morphs into an incredibly expressive, powerful performer who projects both passion and pure sex.It isn’t until Alex (literally) bumps into him at Rock City, the top local music club, and barely recognizes him that things start to spin out of Alex’s control. Lindsey’s in heavy makeup, glitter, skin-tight red spandex pants and hot leather boots. At first, Alex mistakes him for a girl. But the spandex pants prove that nothing could be further from the truth. His heart skips a beat when his immediate reaction is “hot!” In his head, Alex desperately repeats his reassuring mantra: “I’m not gay, men are not hot”. It doesn’t work. Alex is struck dumb, and never thinks of Lindsey the same way again, especially not in his fantasies, at night in bed alone, or standing beside him rehearsing late into the evenings. Alex is clearly smitten, and he has no idea what to do with that. His knee-jerk reaction is to reassure himself through anonymous hookups with nameless girls, but that doesn’t work. He’s obsessed with Lindsey. No one else will do.Eventually, they kiss and it turns it turns into more. Still confused, and afraid of being outed as a gay man, their relationship is off to a rocky start. It doesn’t get better when they have an HIV scare (it was 1991, and the outcome of AIDS was nowhere near as hopeful as it is today), and in a fit of stupidity, Alex blames Lindsey, and fails to offer the support he should to the equally-terrified young man. He’s so afraid of what they have together, that he can’t bring himself to tell Lindsey the truth – that he has fallen madly in love with him, and probably is gay (he’d had one experience with his best friend in High School). In a sea of miscommunication and non-communication, they separate. Lindsey leaves to join a band in London and Alex is destroyed.He soldiers on, though his heart is barely in it, until his band starts to fall apart, not even due to his issues with Lindsey. But it’s almost a relief. He hooks up, as an acoustic duo, with the cute guitarist (just friends) who replaced Lindsey in the River Rats. They do meet with some success in the local clubs, but it isn’t the same. Nothing is the same without Lindsey.It’s not a spoiler to let you know that Beautiful Thunder does supply a well-earned Happily-Ever-After. As I said, Ms. Lyons treats her characters gently, and with love. It’s much the same way she treats the reader, with her vivid descriptions, authentic dialogue, realistic situations and lyrical prose. I once managed a rock band (hence my affinity for the subject matter) and I can vouch that she got it exactly right. It’s always interpersonal relationships that break up bands, almost never the music, the tours or the money. And they do tend to just fly apart from their own momentum, with the individual artists moving on to other bands and opportunities. That’s exactly how she leaves Alex and Lindsey – together again, the seeds of success planted and growing, and the reader with a satisfying sense that the boys will be just fine.Beautiful Thunder is not a story of tortured men. There are a few challenging moments, including homophobic incidents and a bad case of domestic abuse, but nothing that isn’t recovered from in a reasonably short time. Ms. Lyons doesn’t dwell. The reader is not endlessly tossed-about on waves of manufactured angst, just gently moved from early days, through doubts, insecurities, and challenges, to a promising future, with souls intact and the boys still beautiful. It’s not the plot, it’s the beauty of the journey that propels Beautiful Thunder. I don’t know about you, but sometimes I just need to read for pleasure, times when I’m not in the mood for tortured souls, relentless pain and crushing despair. This book delivers exactly that kind of gentle, moving experience, without sacrificing quality, empathy, believability and passion. Ms. Lyons manages a delicate and exquisite balancing act in Beautiful Thunder.If you like reading about musicians, particularly gay, up-and-coming rock-stars, you might just want to get your hands on Beautiful Thunder. It’s a lovely read that will touch your soul, as it did mine, a gripping story by an incredibly talented and confident author. I recommend this book most highly.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Sinfully Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8SZMPO5D143/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I2B0QS#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8SZMPO5D143","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate giving bad reviews. Really. Normally, if a book is just plain bad, I don't bother reviewing it because that just gives it more attention than it deserves.But I occasionally will review a book that's poorly written if I believe the author has some talent and both she, and her readers, need to be made aware of her issues so that maybe, she will improve and grow and become an author I adore. That has happened more than once. The first books of N. R. Walker struck me as being pretty much amateur fan fiction. It turned out that's exactly what they were, fan fiction that got published. However, over the course of just a year-or-so, N. R. Walker developed into one of the finest authors of gay fiction writing today. I would never have guessed it had I only read the first couple of books, but her later books and series (""Red Dirt Heart"" and ""Cronin's Key"") are among the finest fiction, of any genre, I've ever read.Hence, I''m willing to take the time to seriously consider this other Walker's (Aimee Nicole Walker - no relation, as far as I know) book, Chasing Mr. Wright. Beneath the surface I see the glimmer of talent trying to break through. Some paragraphs, even whole sections, display hints of elegance and promise, and I hope that, with an appropriate editor and guidance, Ms. Walker will shine through and show us her potential, fulfilled.First of all, in the interest of full disclosure, let me state that I was unable to finish reading Chasing Mr. Wright. About half way through this long tome, I gave up and skimmed to the end. I had to stop for one reason - the editing was nothing less than abhorrent. To me, the book was unreadable. I was so mired in all the Middle School spelling errors, grammar errors, and word-misuse, that I just couldn't keep my head in the story anymore. And that's a terrible shame because, although it was overlong, derivative and rarely credible, I was hooked by the story and saw possibilities for the characters, despite their stupid 12-year-old-girl behavior. I saw a glimmer of something interesting in Ms. Walker's intentions, an outline for a really good tale, characters who were almost charismatic and empathetic and situations with great potential (such as the MC's ""Gram"" being a famous gay romance author - but where else have I read that meme before?).There are days when I wonder if half the authors of gay fiction (or just self-published authors of gay fiction) don't bother editing at all, or share the same incompetent editor, because they all seem to make the identical errors: ""you're"" for ""your"", apostrophes in plurals (never, never, never!), bad hyphenation (""button down shirt"" wrong. ""button-down shirt"" right.) Authors misspell their own characters' names (in this book, ""Ava"" seems to morph to ""Ave"" and back again, sometimes in the same sentence). Almost every self-published author uses this phrase wrong: ""It didn't phase him"", which should be ""it didn't faze him"". But one of my favorites from this book is when the MC is asked to design a birthday cake for an old lady's anniversary. Hey, Ms. Walker, if the cake is for a 50th anniversary, it's an anniversary cake, not a birthday cake.This book was rife with disturbing, near-illiterate writing, such as ""I listened aptly..."" instead of ""I listened raptly"", and (arrrgggghhh) ""I could have went straight home"" instead of ""gone straight home"". That's the kind of mistake that makes the speaker sound completely illiterate. And, speaking of education, her MC, who is a graphic artist who designs logos, etc. has just gotten his MBA degree? Why would an artist get an advanced business degree - planning to be a stock trader while painting in his atelier? The graduate degree a graphic artist would get would be an MFA (Master of Fine Arts), not MBA (Master of Business Administration). What is this, Donald Trump with a paintbrush?Of course, none of that is much worse than the MC exclaiming ""I smiled at the site before me"". I'm sure Ms. Walker was not writing about a construction project, she just used ""site"" where she should have used ""sight"". One of the most annoying tics of this manuscript (it is certainly not a completed book) was the author's tendency to insert the letter ""a"" before days of the week, such as ""I'll be returning at the end of the week on a Friday"", or ""When a Monday came..."". What is with that? I can't even imagine the logic of that particular oft-repeated construction.The examples I gave are just a handful among hundreds in Chasing Mr. Wright. Look, I know that quite a few brilliant authors are not great at spelling and basic grammar, which is why they use editors. What baffles me is how few independent authors even bother to use spell check, let alone hire an editor. Spelling and grammar checkers can't find everything, but they can find perhaps 70% of the issues. The rest is why you have an editor, an actual human being who can read, spell and correct. If Ms. Walker used an editor, he or she should probably be shot. I got through approximately 100 pages of this embarrassing writing and just couldn't continue on. I felt too bad for the author.Let's be honest, if this were any Amazon product other than a book, it would be returned with loud complaints and a demand for a refund. Books are about language, and if that's true, Chasing Mr. Wright is just a highly defective product.Please, Ms. Walker, this book is so damaged it is harming your reputation. Yes, you got quite a number of five-star reviews (though honestly, I can't figure out how that was possible), but a nearly equal number of 1- and 2-star reviews, each and every one of which complained about the execrable editing. You owe it to yourself, your talent and your readers to publish your best work, or at very least a finished work.A book is not finished until it is edited - and more than once. I'm not returning this book for a refund, because I got it free on Kindle Unlimited, but if I had paid, I'd be returning it now.Re-edit, polish and re-publish the book - I'll look forward to reading it again, from the top.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Sinfully Addicted... blog.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8J53KKOKQTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT7TBTS#wasThisHelpful","R8J53KKOKQTP","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carry the Ocean is nothing less than brilliant. It is Heidi Cullinan at her very best, writing exquisite memorable characters triumphing over obstacles, learning and finding love with each other. But this one has its own unique perspective: the two main characters suffer disabilities - in fact, the three main characters do.But trust me, this is not some exploitative ""weepie"", it's a smart, deep. well-researched and honest look at disability from the inside out. This masterful writer takes you deeply inside the hearts and souls of two precious young men who have just completed High School and live back-to-back across a set of train tracks in Ames, Iowa.Emmet lives along the Autism Spectrum. Very high-functioning, he still has to struggle with each hour of every day. Though we tend to think of Autistics as people who cannot feel, the reality is quite the opposite - their brain is wired in such a way that input is much more intense than in a ""normal"" person's brain. They hear more and better, they see colors more vividly, subtle smells are like a sledgehammer to them. The downside is that the world is often too loud to process, the sounds cacophonous, the sights eye-singeing and the feelings too intense to endure. So they develop protective mechanisms to shield themselves from the endless assault of stimuli, such as the familiar rocking behavior, avoiding groups of people or loud ones, never looking directly at anything or anyone, but viewing the world through their softer and less vivid peripheral vision.The problem is the so-called ""normal people"", who see their behaviors and assume ""retarded"" (the dreaded and cruel ""R"" word), or ""crazy"" or ""offensive"". Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Emmett is a physics and math genius, granted a full scholarship by Iowa State, a genius who sees the patterns in math and software algorithms that escape more ""normal"" minds. Emmett is fortunate enough to have great parents. His mother's a physician, his father's a scientist, and both love and celebrate their son.The only problem is, will they be able to cut the apron strings? Will they be able to let Emmett grow up into a self-sufficient, independent man?The other boy is Jeremey, the boy Emmet's only seen from a distance when he goes out in the back yard to count the rail cars as the trains pass by. Several months before gradulation, Jeremy was sent home in the midst of a full-blown panic attack. He suffers from both Clinical Depression and Anxiety Disorder. He also suffers from parents who have done everything they can to make him worse. His mother is a terror - a woman who berates her son for not acting ""normal"", for embarrassing her everywhere they go. She can't even take him shopping any more because he humiliates her with his tears, fear and hyperventilation in very public places. And though Jeremy has been diagnosed, his parents refuse to allow any kind of treatment, either therapy or a drug regime - because they refuse to admit that Jeremey is ill. They just want him to ""be a man"" and ""straighten himself out"".One day, shortly after graduation, the neighborhood throws a block party and Emmett decides it would be the perfect opportunity to meet the man he's had a longtime crush on. He walks up to Jeremy, who looks like he's about to run or faint, starting to fall into a full-blown panic attack because his parents have forced him to attend this loud, crowded disaster. Autistics are often not very good at social interaction, so Emmett had been rehearsing facial expressions, approaches and dialogue to use when he finally meets Jeremy. And he does start out with that, but once he sees how terrified Jeremy is, he walks him away from the crowd to a place where they can be quiet and alone. He knows, intuitively, that they will both be better off someplace away from the intense stimulus of the party and the crowds.And that begins a truly epic, stirring and profoundly moving romance as the two boys learn each other's triggers, fears, likes, dislikes, signals and expressions and become pretty much everything for each other, - and eventually, devoted lovers.It takes a near-suicide, tons of therapy, the patience of a saint (for both of them) and an enduring and unconditional love for them to be what each other needs, including knowing when to leave each other alone (without taking it as an affront), when to gently rub circles in each other's backs, how to touch each other both lovingly and passionately and communicate communicate in ways other than speech.Even Emmett's loving mother has issues with the thought of her son, although 19, actually having a sexual partner, and it's exquisite when Emmett stands up for the couple and demands of his mother that if they are, indeed ""normal but different"", then why is their having a sex life not normal? There's no answer to that pure and passionate question. In fact, the whole message of the book is that these boys, with two different kind of mental ""disabilities"", are not boys, but full-fledged adults with minds of their own and entitled to be treated as such, not like pets or children. They deserve to make their own choices and have them respected. They demand that, and that's what they get. It is beautiful to watch these two young men grow into admirable, faithful and caring adulltsThere's not really much plot here, and there's not supposed to be. It's just a short journey these two young men take, a journey of months, not years, but it's also a journey of extraordinary distance, from dependent young men, dismissed by much of the world as children, into a loving family who share more, more intimately, than most ""normal"" couples ever do.Ms. Cullinan has painted her characters in such vivid, yet subtle, shades that they come to life on the page. They travel on a road whose signposts are feelings and internal growth, a journey of two men whose hearts are as beautiful as any you'll ever meet, whose commitment, loyalty and connection defy the odds and the obstacles.I must admit that Carry the Ocean moved me profoundly. There is not a word or thought that's exploitative in this extraordinary novel because it's not about disability, but about ability. It's about the universal quest for true home - a life shared with the one you love.I don't just recommend this book, I urge you to add it to your ""must read"" list immediately. If you miss this one, you will surely be poorer for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA23CLDYKVK3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW6FYLY#wasThisHelpful","RA23CLDYKVK3R","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these gloves in exchange for an honest review, and I must say, I'm so happy I did.In fact, I was thinking of passing these on to a young guy who does a lot more bicycling than I can do any more, but once I got my hands on them, there was no way these are going to anyone else. They're staying on MY hands.First, the looks is spectacular. The photos don't do the gloves justice because you only see them from the rear. They are incredibly stylish and fun gloves.Second, the gloves are beautifully designed and engineered. I don't know exactly how many different fabrics were employed on the various surfaces, but they had a number of panels to ensure comfortable fit and no-slide performance, and others (like the glossy palms) that offer both padding and a no-slip surface for excellent grip.The first thing I noticed, right off the bat, was the wonderful, snug-but-comfortable fit of the gloves. I have fat fingers from years of lifting weights and glove fit is always a problem for me. As for Winter gloves, I usually have to go with Isotoners because their stretch fit is the only thing that allows gloves to slip on and off my hands easily without being so big they slide right off, or billow around my fingers. These gloves went on perfectly, the first time. The finger sections grabbed my fingers, but didn't cut off circulation. The area between fingers simply expanded to hold the gloves snug, no matter how much I flexed my hands. They never bound between my fingers, nor did they tend to pull or slide off between my digits.I ordered the Extra-Large and worried that some parts of the glove would fit well, others would be too snug or too loose, but neither was the case. They fit my hands perfectly, moved with great ease, and well, they just fit like a second skin.I even found a new use for them, aside from riding. I happened to be bring my 35 mm DLSR with me while riding (the leaves are just beginning to change color) and the design of the gloves let me get at all the controls as though I weren't even wearing gloves, and they were flexible enough to hold and manipulate my heavy camera and lens without even thinking about them. That's unusual, because when I'm normally out with my camera (often), I have to adjust or remove the gloves to operate my camera or pull something from my camera bag.All in all, I couldn't be happier with these gloves, nor could I recommend them higher.Now I know one gift I'll be getting quite a few of for Christmas stocking stuffers this year. To be hones, you just can't go wrong with these, and for the price, they're one of the biggest bargains around. Thanks, Zookki, for these wonderful gloves. I don't think I've ever before owned gloves that have been so comfortable and useful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVYBK8DPU2IDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116PKT4O#wasThisHelpful","RVYBK8DPU2IDG","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really surprised. I've become a huge fan of Mel Bossa. I recently read, and reviewed Craving's Creek for the Sinfully Addicted to All Male Romance blog, and liked it so much that I immediately read Suite 19. Both were excellent, tautly written, beautifully edited, great characters, settings and plot. Both were very dark.Thus I picked up Blue Dreams, assuming it would be equally engaging, but was hugely disappointed. I guess it just proved how far Ms. Bossa has come since her work of just a few years ago. Blue Dreams was dreadfully, and annoyingly edited. There were constant errors in spelling and word usage. ""she had great wit and dept"" (depth); he had tones of that (tons); constantly misusing ""anymore"", which only refers to continuing time dating from the past, and instead using what should be two words: ""I can't take anymore of that"" (any more of that); double negatives: ""I don't want no one to touch you"" (anyone to touch you); a Norwegian character slipping into Scots or Irish: ""since he was a wee lad...""; misuse of ""past"": ""Derek past Ethan, going to his bedroom."" (passed Ethan); and mixed tenses: ""Myles had already... ran off..."" (run off).The terrible editing made her characters (and the author) seem a bit illiterate. Granted, Nick is dyslexic, but I don't believe the editing was intentionally poor to reflect his issue, especially since the book was written from Ethan's point of view, not Nick's.I have to admit I didn't like the plot much, nor the main character. Ethan is supposed to be such a good man, but he just can't keep it in his pants. He even attempts a foursome with his best friend, Nick, his lover Myles and Nick's husband, that wrecks all the relationships.It's quite simple to me - Nick and Ethan just cheated on their significant others, and did it right in front of them, with Myles joining in and Derek running away in a fury of betrayal.What was Ms. Bossa thinking? At times I found it hard to even think of the main characters as men, except for Nick, who was often aggressively masculine to the point of a lingering sense of imminent violence.Except for Derek, the innocent in all this, and the one who didn't betray his husband, the rest of them were reprehensible, caring only about getting off with their beautiful friends, without the slightest consideration for how badly it would damage their relationships.What baffles me is how such a talented writer as Ms. Bossa could have penned this exploitative, poorly-penned book. It is beyond me that the same author could have written Craving's Creek and Suite 19.Be warned, this book is not complete. It has no ending, not even an interim ending. It just stops, as though it hit a wall, and then warns ""to be continued"".I honestly can't recommend this book. I didn't much like it, and apparently, I'm not the only one.But don't let this put you off her other books. She is really a talented, brilliant author, and thousands of times better than you might gather if this were the only book of hers you've read.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJ1CW7THBZGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GF24NFK#wasThisHelpful","R2DJ1CW7THBZGR","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keira Andrews is a new author for me, and after reading ""Valor on the Move"", I don't know how I missed her. She is a strikingly talented writer. Despite the over-the-top concept, the book doesn't have a single misstep, not in plot, description, characters, dialogue or theme. Her writing is eloquent and elegant. This is one of those rare books I just couldn't put down. I read it in a single sitting.""Valor"" is a story of two men, Rafa (short for Rafael), the young adult son of the President of the United States, and Shane, a Secret Service agent attached to ""Valor's"" protection detail. There  is nothing about the two men that would justify a romantic interest between them. Rafa is an understated student at UVA, dedicated to being invisible to protect his father's career and fulfill his position as the ""other one"", not the daughter who is always in the tabloids, the brother who's about to become a political power in his own right (the ""perfect"" son) or the slightly older brother who is a world-class swimmer. He's just a bland kid at college with a big secret: his girlfriend is not his girlfriend, she's his beard. And he's hers. Best friends, they are both gay, both living in fear of their parents' disapproval, and both determined to execute their own plan for freedom and honesty, as soon as Rafa finishes school and his parents leave the White House.Shane, on the other hand, is a professional field agent with the Secret Service who worked his way up through a whole series of out-of-the-way postings until he finally reached one of the plum jobs - a protective detail in the White House. He's big, muscular, gorgeous and almost twice Rafa's age, about to turn forty. He loves his job but carries some serious baggage. His beloved parents passed away six years ago in an electrical house fire. He blames himself for their deaths, as he was supposed to be with them, at home, the weekend they died, but was called in by the agency and was unable to make the trip. Something died inside him when his parents passed away. He's consumed with guilt for not being there and not saving them. He stopped living life, and just inhabited it, without passion or commitment. He's also an out gay man and could be the poster boy for Secret Service recruitment, he's so muscular, masculine and yet looks elegant as hell in a well-tailored suit. But his love life? Occasional one-night-stands and rare encounters with a sex buddy he's had for years.But these two men, so different, so weighted with angst and drama, fall in love at first kiss. It's a kiss that cannot happen. It's an unthinkable conflict for an agent to get emotionally involved with a protectee. Yet there it is, all the same, no matter how much both men decide it can't happen, it does.Rafa is going through a particularly hard time. His father is a right-wing Republican who has toed the conservative line and promoted every anti-gay bill that comes up for a vote. There was one moment, in particular, that devastated Rafa. He was required, without warning, to attend an event where he would stand on the stage, in the harsh glare of the TV lights, waving and smiling, supporting his father, not knowing he would be announcing his support for an anti-gay Constitutional Amendment to banish all same-sex marriage nationwide. He was devastated. And later, when he found out that this parents, the ones committed to denying basic civil rights to gays, knew he was gay (or at least suspected) since he was very young, making him stand up on a stage, smiling like a moron as his own father demanded that Rafa's human rights and equality be revoked. His own parents!Rafa goes insane. Sick of being a prisoner of the White House, and furious at the betrayal of his own parents, he runs. Shane chases after him in an agency SUV, follows him into another state and confronts him, to convince him to return to the White House when he stops at a deserted highway rest stop. The unthinkable happens and Rafa is taken when Shane is downed by a bullet that grazes his head. Shane must find him, rescue him and make sure no one ever hurts his Rafa again.I'll leave the rest of the action-adventure story for you to discover in Ms. Andrews' propulsive prose. Rest assured, it's a page-turner, and although you're always pretty sure that Rafa will be rescued, there's no similar confidence that the two men will ever have the opportunity to be together, or to share their love and lives, and that is, perhaps, the most engrossing and engaging part of ""Valor on the Move"".Though the premise, at first, may strike you as being a bit over-the-top, rest assured that Ms. Andrews' writing makes it all feel all too believable. Her characters are deeply and beautifully drawn, even the bad guys, and Rafa's heartless mother, the First Lady. We eventually find out why she is so uptight, and how much and deeply she really does love her son. These characters are deep, vivid and believable. The dialogue and badinage are always real, as is the glacially slow and uncaring bureaucracy that is any Federal agency. The action is brief, but heart-stopping, and the love between the men, heart-warming and moving.If you like a love story with a little action-adventure, and characters who are bigger than life, you'll love ""Valor on the Move"". I know I did, which is why I recommend it with all my heart.

"What a great lantern. I don't know what I expected, as I have never had any light source like an LED lantern, but I love LED lighting and have amassed a large collection of flashlights with power banks, other lights that recharge off my USB ports and every single lamp in my home sports LED bulbs.This lantern is not rechargeable. In fact, it's powered by three AA batteries.So what recommends it? Light, huge amounts of light. I believe there are 30 LEDs in this light sitting in front of chrome reflectors and it.s amazingly powerful. The lantern is not lensed, so it does not deliver a focused beam that's illuminates things at great distances. What it does  fits its purpose perfectly - it provides a circle of general illumination, bright ambient light, in a radius of approximately 6-7 feet out from the source. This is incredibly useful for a stationary or hanging lantern, because the applications for the lantern are almost unlimited.It's touted as a camping lantern, and it's brilliant for that. However, I don't go camping, so what use is it to me? Tons. I'm a photographer and I do a lot of shooting at night. I sit or stand on the grass or sand, screwing brackets into my tripod and the base of the camera, digging filters and lens caps out of my bag, finding my shutter remote, or searching desperately for my wipes whenever I accidentally touch the lens. For years, I've carried a small LED flashlight to make it easier to set up. Unfortunately, that never worked really well, because the flashlight beam is so focused that I had to use one hand to hold and steady the light while I try to do two-handed operations. Imagine trying to hold a tripod steady, affix a heavy DSLR to it while rummaging through a camera case? Impossible! Not with the Ultra Bright LED Camping lantern. I can either just plop it on the ground, hang it from a tree, or an S-hook on my tripod, and my hands are free to do whatever I need to do with brilliant ambient light to see exactly what I'm doing.This was a revelation to me. Ever had to fuss looking around your trunk for something at night with those really dim bulbs the manufacturers provide for illumination? Now, when I'm running an errand that might need some rummaging in the trunk, I take the Ultra Bright LED Lantern with me and just pop it open when I need to see.And it's equally useful when I'm at home, whether I use it while rummaging around in one of my two storage closets, or prepare food in the section of my countertop where the overhead light never seems to reach. In fact, I removed a fairly new under-cabinet fluorescent fixture and just leave the lantern on the counter and pop the top to turn it on.The form factor of this light is truly elegant. This is a really-well-designed piece of equipment. The base is a screw-on lid. Just unscrew it and there's a flat compartment that takes your batteries - no awkward covers to snap in (or break off), no secret way to slide them in on top of each other. It doesn't get easier.To turn the light on, just pull up on the top lid, and as soon as the LEDs are exposed, they automatically light up. No switch required or provided!And the handy metal spring clips hold the unit securely closed when not in use, provide a carry handle when walking, and provide an easy solution to hanging the lantern in your tent or from a convenient tree branch, ladder, or anything else available to hang it from.One more idea - my next outdoor party, I'm going to put one right in the middle of the food table, and another on the drinks table. Tailgating? You really want to have one or more of these available - parking lot lighting is not conducive to outdoor entertaining!I was concerned, at first, that the lamp was not rechargeable, so I ran a test, and all my concerns evaporated. I left the lantern full illuminated for 31 hours straight on the same three batteries, and the lamp never died, it just got a bit dimmer in the last hour. That's remarkable, and entirely due to the amazing efficiency of LED lighting.I was given a copy of this lantern, at no cost, in return for a fair and honest review. Easiest thing I've ever done. I'm so taken with this elegant and powerful lantern that I'm about to buy a couple more, just so I don't have to remember to take it with me when I leave the house.This is definitely a five-star purchase - a great product at a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IDE2CP2V396K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0129GYC5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3IDE2CP2V396K","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Fret"" is right in my wheelhouse. I love gay rock-band romance. I read everything I can get my hands on.Fortunately, ""Fret"" is the first in a series. Rock band romance is always fertile ground for a series - each subsequent book gets to focus on another member of the band and the wonderful discovery that a member thought to be absolutely straight isn't. Lots of opportunity for romance, obstacles, fear and self-discovery.As the first in the series, this one didn't have to bother with the ""otherwise straight"" guys jumping into bed with another man, but it does second best: Axel Blaze is 6' - 5"", a former Navy Seal, and as butch as they come. He's hardly a virgin, but he's never had any kind of relationship. In fact, he's never kissed anyone, male or female. As a Military brat, he was never in one place long enough to get close to anyone, and when he joined the Seals, there was a host of reasons why he couldn't have a relationship. First, he's an assassin (but on the side of freedom and right); second, his work is almost always classified; third, he has to leave on a moment's notice, can't tell anyone where he's going, doesn't know when he'll be back, and doesn't even know if he'll survive the next assignment. Not a great basis for a relationship.His best friend and boss in the civilian world, Mac, asks him to take on a bodyguard job. It's what Axel calls ""babysitting"" and he just hates holding the hand of some obnoxious, spoiled rich kid who may or may not be about to be kidnapped. But this time, he takes the job: protecting the lead singer of Skull Blasters, a top-of-the-chart Heavy Metal band. Gareth Wolf recently came out as gay, after spending several years bedding women to keep his cover intact, and he's now receiving serious death threats - and even a few actual attempts.Axel takes the job. His first day is full of good news. Axel is gorgeous and talented. He's also not spoiled. His brother, Ransom, and several of their friends from the neighborhood, founded the band, and none of them has forgotten where they came from. Because his and Ransom's father is currently in prison for dealing Meth, and used to be a lush, the band has a no-drug, no-drunk policy and the boys keep their rock-star reputations strictly in the realm of fan fiction. They are all serious musicians, and the last thing they want to do is jeopardize their success. It was too hard-won.Gareth got into the band in a fairly odd way. He's a few years younger than the other members, so he used to just hang around with them while they rehearsed and played in local bars, acting as their roadie and picking up guitar by osmosis - and native talent. A couple of years ago, the lead guitar of the Skulls smashed his hand in a car accident and Gareth was asked to step in for him - at least he knew all the music. And an amazing thing happened: the shy Gareth, who'd always been content to work as a roadie, came alive onstage. Feeding off the energy of the audience, Gareth became a guitar god. His energy and his sexy good looks pushed the band from being an opening act to being a headliner on sold-out tours.Now someone wants him dead, and Axel has to keep him alive. Oddly enough, both Axel and Gareth are sort of virgins. Axel has had quickie sex with near strangers, but never kissed. Gareth has neither kissed nor had sex with another man, despite his very public coming out. At the moment, they're both celibate, Alex because he's with Gareth 24/7 until he catches the stalker and because Gareth has wormed his way into Axel's previously cold heart. Gareth really wants Axel to be his first man, but isn't he straight? Wow, no he isn't? He's just unavailable because he's on the job. Or is he unavailable?I'm sure you can guess where this is going - into parallel stories of two men falling in love (how do you know you're in love?) and finding and stopping the stalker who threatens Gareth's life.If you've read much rock fiction, you already know that the ""rock-star and bodyguard who fall in love"" is hardly unique to the genre. In fact, Whitney Houston's movie, ""The Bodyguard"" is not far afield from ""Fret"". So why bother with this story? Because it's extremely well-written. Ms. Gasq-Dion obviously loves her characters. She treats them with dignity, affection and respect. They are evocative adults, not neurotic young men making their own obstacles. There's also some lovely, vivid travelogue, particularly when the band tours Europe, that paints beautiful pictures of romantic locations with a laudable economy of prose.""Fret"" is really well done. The mystery is not exactly Agatha Christie, but it's enough to make your heart skip a few beats, what with racing cars aimed at Gareth, out-of-control pyrotechnics exploding in his face, a house fire that almost takes out both men, and even a gunshot or two. The identity of the stalker is telegraphed pretty early in the book, but repeatedly dismissed due to lack of opportunity and a bulletproof alibi - or maybe not.I really liked this book and I plan to read the forthcoming books in this series. I am honored to give Ms. Gasq-Dion’s book the five stars it deserves, because ""Fret"" is an awfully well-written book, a propulsive read, and a book where I identified deeply with the characters.I recommend this book very highly. It's an excellent read. If you’re a fan of good writing, rock-stars, bodyguards, sexy men, action-adventure, mystery, men falling in love for the first time in their lives, and good characters who care deeply (and show it), you’ll love “Fret”.P.S. I’m also pleased to compliment Ms. Gasq-Dion for her integrity as an author. An author who cares about her readers is a very special thing. Some errors had been pointed out in a recent review of “Fret”, and she immediately corrected them and re-published this book. Too many gay romance authors put out slapdash novels with poor editing and no concern for their readers. All authors owe their readers their very best – after all, the reader is the customer. It is refreshing and heartwarming to run across an author like Ms. Gasq-Dion who shows the pride in her work and concern for her readers that she does. Kudos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25GQZVMZ0A1Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RHMFMC#wasThisHelpful","R25GQZVMZ0A1Z0","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't often take a second look at re-released books. Re-releases are generally for new readers. There's almost never enough new material, in most re-releases, to merit a new take on (or a new purchase of) a book I've already read.But ""Dance With Me"" blew me away when I first read it. Rarely have I been as moved (and aroused) as I was by the relationship between the two main characters and the vivid, sensual descriptions of them, how they moved, dressed, expressed themselves in both words and dance. At first glance, the theme seemed pretty trite, what with one macho almost-straight guy and another who is not just gay, but an artist, a dancer, someone who seems to hold the music of the spheres within his soul. Oil and water, of course, but not for long. There's not a false step in the entire book, not a word out-of-character, the emotional highs just keep on coming. In sum, ""Dance With Me"" is an exquisitely-written book filled with beauty, poetry and insight, well-worth re-releasing, over and over again, as far as I'm concerned.All too rarely, a book surfaces that is so far beyond the rest of my normal fare, that I am awed at the power and talent of the author. This is one of those. Yes, it has all the requisite Gay Romance elements: financial trouble, physical infirmity, emotional disability, life-altering events. It is also, in some ways, a conventional love story: boy meets boy cute, boys fight, boys fall in love. Been there, done that - but never before as beautifully and evocatively as Ms. Cullinan does it in ""Dance With Me"".This book offers another whole dimension beyond the expected, one that touched me deeply - a new, expressive vocabulary that I've never before encountered in any form of literature: dance.More than once, she moved me to tears, her descriptions of emotions expressed and shared through the language of the body in motion. She deeply understands the joy, the power and the grace of movement. She extols the celebration of the male body as an instrument of art and expression, of beauty, elegance and passion that could (and often did) leave me breathless.More than three decades ago, I was involved with dance, first as a stage designer, then as a producer of several dance companies, including the Downtown Ballet of New York. Not qualified by training or body to be a dancer, I nurtured my passion for dance by enabling those who do. It was a transcendent time of my life.Music and art can make my heart soar. But nothing transports me as completely, deeply and spiritually as seeing those exquisite bodies fly through space while telling a tale or sharing their passion, pain and hope. It is truly a great gift. It is also almost unbearably sexy.Ms. Cullinan gets this. The dance in this book is much more than the literal dance depicted in the scenes. It is also a metaphor for the trials and love of the main characters.I regret only that my words, in this review, fall far short of expressing the joy, the beauty, the pure flight, the love, the passion of the dance and the dancers that Ms. Cullinan seems to express so easily, with prose that is often inspired.Of course, that's why she is the writer and I, just a reader - a reader who loved this book.Thank you, Ms. Cullinan for writing this brilliant book, and for releasing it once again. Anyone who misses this extraordinary book will also miss one of life's great reading experiences.

"I wish I liked this book more than I do. The characters were rich, vivid and easy to identify with. The plot, though over the top, was exciting and the ending, heart-pounding. But there are some major flaws that keep me from being ecstatic over ""The Temptation"", which is surprising, because I have a veritable fetish for books about gay rock stars. Add in a hot doctor, and it should be perfection. It isn't.""The Temptation"" is the story of Connor Taylor, a young doctor from the Midwest and his new-found lover, Liam, the (Scottish or British?) lead singer of the enormously popular rock band, Prowler. The two met, only recently, at his sister's wedding to one of Liam's band-mates, Tommy. Was it love at first sight, or just a rebound relationship, with Connor barely weeks away from his breakup with his cheating, long-time boyfriend, Jeff?At the beginning of the book, Connor is moving to New York (Brooklyn, to be precise). His sister lives in Manhattan, and Connor had just been hired to work at a small local clinic. That clinic is associated with a pharmacy that shares its building. The owner of the pharmacy, Ron, is about to retire, leaving his two grown kids in charge of the shop. Amber is an MBA who is out to modernize the pharmacy by combining the latest in business technology with a loyal clientele fed to the business by the clinic that shares their common space.Her brother Dave has been diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder. His big problem is that either he doesn't have one, or that the personality he does have is so repugnant that it does him no good. He is a gay man who, apparently, never scores. He doesn't seem to like people, and they don't much like him, either. However, one look at the new doctor and Dave decides he's in love, and has to have Connor, whether Connor consents or not. Thus begins his stalking, his break-ins of Connor's apartment, and his stockpiling of narcotics to sell and to feed Connor so that he can make him his, regardless of the fact that Connor is so obviously in love with Liam.Kidnap is afoot. And this is where the problems I have with this book begin.First, characters do really stupid things. No one likes or trust Dave, but they all share schedules and other personal information with him. Hey, this guy is a nut-job, and an obviously evil one, to boot, so why do people keep leaving their keys and drinks on a table, all alone with Dave? Why do people keep using this unreliable, nasty piece of work to pass along messages about where they're going to be? And when Liam accuses Connor of being too unaware of what's going on around him for his own good, Connor goes into a rage and is about to dump the man he loves - but not enough to work out their differences. One little snit, and Connor is convinced that Liam is cheating on him, was just a rebound relationship, and refuses to take his calls. This is love?Second, there is much here that is simply unbelievable. Dave, the unlovable loser, is smart enough to line up a dangerous drug dealer to buy his stolen drugs,  knowing that if anything goes wrong, the drug dealer is going to kill Connor to punish Dave. Of course, the dealer only knows about Connor because Dave thought it was a smart move to describe Connor and where he works to him. He's not just crazy, he's also, apparently, stupid. At times, Connor seems equally dense. Why does he keep asking, with incredulity, ""how did that picture get on the Internet?"". Like, duh, you're an educated physician and you have to keep repeatedly asking such a question? The answer is, the same way everything else in the universe gets on the Internet, and if you're surprised that pictures taken in public show up on the Internet, well, been living under a rock for a while?Third (and this was the most serious problem for me), is how can such an accomplished and prolific author as Ms. Lane allow her book to be released with such poor editing?Tenses are wrong all over the place, making characters seem to be stupid or illiterate: ""Tonight he had sang in one of his favorite cities..."" (should be ""he had sung..."") or ""Don't ever mistaken me for someone you could call a friend."" (should be ""ever mistake me""). Dialogue with such glaringly basic errors as these make it seem like a ten-year-old kid is talking, not a sophisticated adult.There are also embarrassing basic technical issues: ""He realized he had forgotten film for his camera"". Huh, I thought this book took place today, not in 1980. It's not even consistent. When Dave kidnaps Connor, he photographs him naked using his cell phone - hey,welcome to the 21st Century. And Ms.Lane's description of a cruise ship displays her lack of even the most rudimentary familiarity with nautical terms. People don't stay in ""rooms"" on a ship, they stay in ""cabins"". And what the heck is the ""bottom"" of a ship?: ""He'll start complaining about our little room in the bottom of the ship.""Unfortunately, Ms. Lane doesn't restrict her incorrect nomenclature to technical issues: ""That was a special edition to our suite."" (should be ""addition"", not ""edition""). There's also no shortage of stilted dialogue leaning hard on the passive voice: ""wanted to show you a picture of him so he could be recognized when he arrives"" (should be ""so you can recognize him when he arrives). Or how about ""he didn't even lock the door back""? How do you lock the main door to your suite ""back""? Ms. Lane also frequently uses ""joined"" versions of words when they clearly should be separate: ""where they would stay for awhile"" (should be ""stay for a while"") and ""couldn't have been anymore perfect"" (should be ""any more perfect""). She is even guilty of the most infamous and common transgression of the gay romance genre, confusing ""your"" with ""you're"": ""Because your Liam's boyfriend"" (should be ""Because you're Liam's boyfriend."")Sorry, don't want to seem like I'm the grammar police, but I find that bad editing ruins my appreciation of any book. Anything that rips me out of my imagination, or stops me in my tracks, is a grave distraction. Enough of these, and I drop the book. Not to mention that the lack of decent editing offends me as a paying reader.It's a terrible shame that Melody Lane allowed her book to be released unfinished. With a good editor, ""The Temptation"" might have been a four- or five-star read. I gave her three stars for her imagination and her vividly-rendered characters.If you don't mind bad editing and occasional stilted dialogue, you might really enjoy ""The Temptation"". It is a good story. If, on the other hand, you really don't like having to decipher what the author meant, as opposed to what she wrote, then I might skip this one until, hopefully, a re-edited second edition is released.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Sinfully Addicted... blog.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z7V3509A17J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NW72XO#wasThisHelpful","R2Z7V3509A17J4","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As far as I can determine, It’s Never Over is only the second book Ms. Wagner has published on Amazon. And if that’s true, we have a lot to look forward to. Her first offering, In Front of God and Everyone, impressed me enormously and moved me deeply. Her assured prose, brilliant life-like characters, men who really love men (and mean it), authentic people, settings and situations plus the pure pleasure of reading such well-written prose and dialogue, is what I would have expected from a much more seasoned author with many more books under her belt.It’s Never Over is the second in a series called “Pay It forward”. It’s not a sequel, because the main characters are entirely different from those in the first book, although the beloved refugees from a Christian cult whom Ms. Wagner introduced us to in In Front of God… do return for several brief appearances at different point in this book. It doesn’t matter how you define the two books, as a series or a book and sequel, or just two loosely-related books, this is obviously a follow-up to her remarkable first book, and that is a very good thing. Every now and again we’re lucky enough to stumble across a new author, someone we’d never read before, and we are sucked into her characters, stories and memes so deeply, that we can’t put the book down. That happened to me when I read In Front of God and Everyone. The good news is that It’s Never Over grabbed me the exact same way. Her first book was not a fluke; this is one seriously talented and insightful author.I suspect the reason I loved these books so much is that Ms. Wagner is a gentle writer. I don’t mean that the stories are without violence, pain, suffering and angst (they’re not), but that the characters are so appealing because they are gentle spirits, trying to do what’s right and not always succeeding because it’s just so damned hard, in the real world, to figure out what the right thing is and how to make it happen.Alex is a recently-graduated marketing whiz looking for employment. His field is sports, and he’s decided to look for a position at the collegiate level.

As part of his decision process, he sits glued to his TV, watching the broadcasts of each school’s teams, checking out their stadiums, media presence, and fans, trying to get some insight into which one might provide the best opportunities and the best fit. Keep in mind, it has to be a pretty liberal school, because he’s not going back into the closet, for anyone. That’s never really been a problem for him and he’s not about to let it become one now.As the camera pans over the fans behind the school’s bench, he thinks he sees… no, it can’t be… oh my God, it is… the only man he ever loved - and they were not even men when they loved each other, they were 16-year-old boys. Cax was his best friend, his camp-buddy, the one he got caught with by a minister (it was a religious camp), fooling around in the woods. His mother, who’s both a single parent and an unreconstructed Hippie, thinks it’s the funniest thing she’s ever heard and tells him it’s fine. But it didn’t turn out to be fine, because he never saw Cax again. He wasn’t back in school in the Fall. In fact, he no longer even lived in the same town. Over the next six-and-half years, Alex had never seen, heard from, or even heard anything about Cax, and here he was, on the sidelines of one of the schools who offered him a job. That’s it. Decision made, he heads up to rural Western Massachusetts and the rest of his life.Alex attends the very first game of his career as the marketing guy, doing live, online, play-by-play, punctuating it with sarcastic animated .gifs and totally into selling his team to the public, boosters, alumni and the college community – and doing it most effectively. That is, when he’s not sneaking a glance, over his shoulder, at the man with the pretty girl and three younger boys sitting exactly three rows behind him. Cax has filled out well since they were both 16 and, to be honest, so had he. Alex had to dial back his more-and-more obvious staring and stalking because he was finding it increasingly difficult to concentrate on the game.Cax is having a much more difficult time of it, once he realizes who’s sitting at the table not three rows away. In fact, he’s terrified. The only reason he went to college here and remains here, to this date, is to protect his brothers from their repugnant, violent, hate-filled father. No, he doesn’t beat his younger brothers – not yet, at least. But he didn’t beat Cax, either, until he did, and then he never stopped. Cax is determined that he will never leave them at his father’s mercy without his protection. The old man can’t beat him now, because he’s big enough and strong enough to bring him down, and would be more than willing to do just that. The first time the old bastard touched one of his brothers, Cax would knock him on his ass, without a second thought. The reason Cax is terrified of Alex is that he knows just seeing the other man would make his father go ballistic and he might try to cut off all contact between him and his brothers. And yes, he would do it without a second thought, just to hurt Cax. This guy is definitely not Father of The Year material.Alex finds out later that Cax is a graduate teaching assistant at the college that also employs his father, and the girl is Amy, not his girlfriend, but his best friend. They were involved, a long time ago, for all of two fumbling nights before they mutually decided they had better prospects as friends than lovers – and Amy is the only one in town who knows why. Cax has built his closet strong to protect his brothers from his vicious, homophobic father.I won’t belabor the plot. It’s much better watching it unfold, patiently, as the love between the two men reignites despite the desperate obstacles that keep them apart. The biggest one is still Cax’s father. Alex is being sabotaged everywhere he turns, including an “anonymous” accusation of child molesting received by the college Dean. Both boys know exactly who did this, but because Cax’s father is a respected member of the college community, he tends to be believed – at least until he gets more and more out of control. One of his stupider moves was to slip another accusatory letter into Alex’s landlords’ mailbox – which is pretty ineffectual as the two men who own the house are the lifelong lovers from Ms. Wagner’s first book, and they’re not buying one word of the letter.It all comes to a head when an almost-successful attempt is made on Alex’s life that leaves him badly injured in the hospital – and the perpetrator so obvious that no one can deny it anymore, especially as the cops can’t even find Cax’s father. He’s in the wind. But that’s it, one way or another, Cax’s father is out of their lives, permanently, and going to prison once he’s hunted down and arrested. New obstacles: Cax inherits an intact family of three younger brothers for whom he’s entirely responsible, and a house he cannot afford to maintain.But what a lovely obstacle to have – a family, a peaceful family coming to grips with the newly-out Cax and his cherished boyfriend, Alex. Those obstacles can and will be overcome with patience and love, which both men share in abundance – after all, it was more than six years without a word between the two, and their love survived even that – so nothing short of the Apocalypse will keep them apart now.It’s really a pretty simple story, with no dramatic background like Ms. Wagner’s previous book, but similar themes – the hideous, awful combination of homophobia, religion and violence, plus the wondrous process of abused and oppressed gay people forming their own families, created not by blood or birth, but out of love.As I said, Ms. Wagners’ characters are gentle souls. If they fight, they fight for each other, and they fight against a world determined to oppress them and keep them apart. And the best part is that they succeed, which is a heart-warming object lesson for those of us who read this author’s wonderful books.The next book from Ms. Wagner? I have no idea what’s in the hopper, but I do know I’ll be first in line to get my hands on a copy. What a wonderful, generous writer she is, sharing with her readers such deeply-felt journeys through the souls of very good people in a sometimes very dark and challenging world.Read this one. You won’t be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SV6OAELDBDYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116HSMRS#wasThisHelpful","R2SV6OAELDBDYZ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marrywindix provided me with a free sample of this hanger in return for an honest review.I am pleased to report that it was easy to give it an honest review, because I love this thing. I'm always impressed with simple, inexpensive items that solve a major problem with simplicity and elegance, and this is definitely one of those.I hung it over the bathroom door (there really is no installation, just hang it up) and used it to hold a bathrobe and clothing I will change into after a shower. For years, I've walked in the cold air from shower to bedroom to retrieve my clothes and change. Not that I couldn't have brought it into the bathroom with me, but I hate putting freshly-dry-cleaned clothing folded up on a toilet seat - there's no room on my tiny bathroom counter (I live in an apartment) and I never wanted to put holes in the wall to hang a rack - it would destroy the wallpaper and I'd have to restore it before I moved.Well here's this very simple, lightweight widget that just fits over the door, yet doesn't seem to have any issues securely hanging a heavy terry robe and a day's clothing. And the decorate scrollwork at the top adds just enough style to give it a personality without being too busy or overdone.I recommend this wonderful little hanger with no reservations. Thank you, Marrywindix.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZT65M34ZAMJL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7CQQA0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZT65M34ZAMJL","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Lightning-Struck Heart"" is a huge book, more than 530 pages. Yet it was still not enough for me. I read it in a single sitting (with an occasional bathroom break), and couldn't put it down. The reason I couldn't put it down was that I was laughing too hard to get up from my seat for anything but a dire emergency. I didn't just titter, I guffawed. Some of the humor was so over-the-top, so replete with bad puns, some of the settings, scenes and descriptions so beyond the pale that I just couldn't bear coming back to reality for even a moment. This book, like all the books by TJ Klune. was nothing less than sheer genius, a shining star so bright, it lit up my day.When we speak of gay fiction, we usually mean books filled with angst, pain, religious persecution, self-discovery, love, obstacles overcome and Happily-Ever-Afters. And yes, ""The Lightning-Struck Heart"" has all of these, so it definitely qualifies as gay fiction. But how many of these artful, moving novels include a gay talking Unicorn with a missing horn, who regularly belches rainbows, sweats glitter when angry, whose poop smells of flowers and cookies, with colored sequins sparkling in the air when he passes gas? And even better, the Unicorn is named Gary and is a screaming queen who talks nothing but camp? Then there's the magical half-giant, only ten-feet-tall (a full size giant is closer to 20) who tends to destroy anyone who threatens any member of the lively band of gay magical beings who populate this book.The head of this gayer-than-gay merry band is Sam of the Wilds. As an 11-year-old goody-goody from the slums, Sam recovers a bag of fabric that a band of teenage toughs stole from his elderly next-door neighbor-lady (who uses said fabric for charity purposes, primarily to make ugly oversized pants for obese people). Cornered in a blind alley by the bigger,  older, teen toughs, he turns to face them, knowing he's about to meet his maker. A glint of green and gold passes across his field of vision and, lo-and-behold, the criminals-to-be turn to stone, frozen with their mouths wide open, their legs in mid-flight and their arms poised in the air to beat the hell out of little Sam.As it turns out, Sam is a wizard. He'd never been a wizard before, that he knew of, and there are no magical people in his family (though his mother is an ex-gypsy, so who knows?) and he has a major inherited defect - he can't stop talking, and everything he thinks simply pours out his mouth in an endless regurgitation of thoughts, statements, and observations that is enough to drive any listener insane. Sam is sort of the stream-of-consciousness Wizard.The reader is immediately treated to an episode of Sam's startling grandiloquence as soon as he turns the boys to stone. A canny old man in Wizard's robes (in fact, the Wizard to the beloved King), happened to be passing by when he noticed the boys turned to stone. He stops to question this remarkably talented first-time-11-year-old-mini-wizard to find out what incantations he used to bring about his own rescue by magic. All Sam can talk about is those amazing pointy pink satin shoes that the old Wizard is wearing, and he really, really wants a pair. Eleven years old, and already a fashion queen. Who would have thought it possible?In fact, it appears that Sam has been aware of his orientation since he was very young. He recounts the crush he had on a school chum, and how he almost kissed the boy:""He did kiss me two weeks later, but then he also kissed Jessica, David, Megan, Rhonda and Robert. Derek turned out to be a bit of a whore.""Anyway, the mild-mannered, wise old King's Wizard, demands that he return the boys to their previous state. With not a clue how to accomplish that magical feat, Sam tries a few incantations, such as ""Flora Bora Slam""and ""Abra Wham"", adding, when they don't work:  ""...it might have gone better in my head."" The wise Wizard replies ""I have a feeling that sums up your life perfectly"".And indeed it does. Sam and his parents (passionately devoted to each other and to Sam, though he'd rather see less evidence of their embarrassing passion for each other) are moved into the Castle where he becomes the official Apprentice Wizard. It's also where he becomes best buddies with the King, whom he is constantly correcting and playing pranks upon. How does he get away with this, between his motormouth affliction and being fashion-forward, especially toward the powerful Monarch? Well, he may be garrulous and not always appropriate, but everyone loves him. He makes them laugh. He treats everyone as a regular old human, even the King. Of course, he's in the process of becoming the most powerful Wizard ever (doesn't even need incantations, he can just think magic and it happens), but most important, he has this huge, innocent heart that no one (with the exception of the jealous and snarky prince) can resist.His heart is so big that, at the age of 14, he is sent, on a quest, into the Dark Wood, a dangerous place where all kinds of malevolent magic reigns. His task is to bring back something ""totally unexpected"". Well, he does indeed accomplish that when he hears these plaintive cries from some kind of magical creatures, approaches them in a clearing, and there's this Unicorn with a missing horn, and this half-giant, in tears, whose back is striped by lashes from the whip. Turns out, they were kept caged by a traveling sideshow, barely fed and whipped to keep them in line. When the evil owner of the show tracks them down to return them to captivity, Sam uses his magic to turn the nasty old carnival owner's whip into a trail of butterflies as it is about to land on Sam's face. This fourteen-year-old Apprentice Wizard scares the pants off this miserable exploiter and his roughnecks, who flee in fear. Sam leads Gary the Unicorn and Tiggy the Half-Giant back to the Castle with him, rescuing them from a life of pain and demeaning exhibition in front of the paying populace into a life of fabulousness, riches and unending loyalty. The three of them would (and do) lay down their lives for each other, and become an inseparable band of magical adventurers. Which is rather convenient, since the Most Powerful Apprentice Wizard In The Known World has the nasty habit of being captured by a wide variety of villains. Every one of them ticks Sam off because, being villains, they find it necessary to monologue incessantly, regaling their victims with highly-detailed recitations of their plans for global domination, before they actually kill their captives. Sam just hates all that monologuing. It's a good thing though, because at some time during these endless, boring lectures, Tiggy manages to bash a villain or two through a wall, Gary kicks the heck out of them with his powerful hind legs and blue-painted hooves, Sam encases them in stone up to their necks, or unleashes a horde of fire-breathing geckos upon them, as they run for their lives.Then there is the love story (not to mention a talking dragon, who can only communicate when Sam's around) that adds more humor, a little bit of sex (Sam is a virgin until page 500-or-so) and a huge amount of cute crushing and deep loving. His new man-crush is the dashing and gorgeous Knight, Ryan who is soon to become a Knight Commander, and worse, to be betrothed to the King's snarky son, Prince Justin. Ryan is so gorgeous, so sexy, that there are fan clubs that meet in the town square (which Sam attends, incognito, as the bearded Mervin) including the one run by the mean twelve-year-old girl with whom he trades insults every time they're within spitting distance of each other (he'll triumph over the evil 12-year-old yet!), complete with shipping names, such as ""RyanSam"" or ""Rystin"". He's in love with Ryan, and though Ryan won't say the words, Ryan is in love with Sam, too. The King is very sad that he encouraged his son's engagement, because he didn't know how Ryan and Sam felt about each other, even though they danced three waltzes, in public, at Ryan's engagement party - something that is just not done!Even worse, the engagement of Knight and Prince is a potential disaster for humanity - a potential disaster of epic proportions. A great good Wizard has someone destined for his heart, called his ""Cornerstone"", who keeps him from being consumed by his growing power lest he become a totally-corrupt Dark Wizard. It is only through the Cornerstone that a great Wizard (and Sam is destined to be one of the greatest) can realize his true potential. All Wizards have a natural limit to their magic. But so far, no one has ever found Sam's, so his mentors are terrified that, without his Cornerstone, Sam will eventually devolve into a nasty, evil, powerful and corrupt Magician who will need to be put down for the safety of humanity. I warned you it was really, really epic, didn't I?There's so much more to this richly detailed and heartwarming book, including (among other things), exploding nipples, the six-inch-tall King of the Fairies who has the hots for the virgin Sam and kidnaps him to force him to marry him (Gary, the hornless Unicorn, kicks in some heads to rescue Sam), Ryan (the Knight) molested by a tree, exploding corn that sets off fireworks to let the farmers know when the corn is ready to be harvested that, unfortunately, also sets the fields on fire, and the older lady-mayor of a village who kidnaps Sam as a sacrifice to the Dragon God of a religious cult she created and populated in only 57 days, and (spoiler alert!) ends up getting eaten by the Dragon when he refuses to kill for her (the dragon bemoans how painful it's going to be when he has to pass all those old bones and other body parts).OK, enough. If I continue writing this review, you won't have to read the book, and that would be a terrible shame, because TJ Klune is nothing less than a brilliant, inspired writer, and one of the great gay novelists of this or any other age. Proust and Milton are both amateurs when compared to Mr. Klune.To be serious for a moment (what a letdown, after reading this book), Mr. Klune reliably delivers what I read books for - wonderful engaging characters (and they really all are characters!), unbelievable but enjoyable situations and settings, dialogue that is incomparable (and not far from what you'd hear in any serious drag bar), love, family, boundless humor and, most important of all, magic.I didn't anticipate a fantasy from Mr. Klune, who is best known for his ""Bear, Otter and the Kid"" books, also funny but absurdly poignant and beautiful stories, but apparently neither did he. He wrote recently, on his blog, that he never intended Sam and his crew to be an epic, but the world he spun kept growing and growing until it got so big, and so full of possibilities, that he has decided to turn it into a new series.I can't wait. And you shouldn't, either. If you're looking for a book that will warm your heart, tickle your funny bone, stretch your imagination and destroy any possible disbelief, this is the one to read. ""The Lightning-Struck Heart"" is a work of art, a work of genius, but most important, a sheer delight to read. I would give it more than five stars, if I could.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Sinfully Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39KGYU21DWLPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PVYANK#wasThisHelpful","R39KGYU21DWLPV","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m not usually a great fan of fantasy, especially fantasy about demons and fairies. On the other hand, my tastes have been challenged, more than once, by some of my favorite authors of gay fiction occasionally taking a detour into the netherworld. There’s something about the opportunity for unlimited metaphor, about plumbing the depths of emotion without being tethered to mundane reality that seems to set these writers’ imaginations free.Ms. Blake is one of those wondrously imaginative writers, and “Sweet” is one of those books.Written with a deft hand and prose that, at times, verges on poetry, “Sweet” captivated me, grabbed ahold of my heart and wouldn’t let go until the very last page. I bought the book because I love rock-star romance and had read (and loved) this author’s earlier rock epic, “The Far Away Years”. “Sweet” however, isn’t so much about rock-and-roll. It’s about the supernatural world, alive and hiding just beneath the surface of the real one - the world of demons and fairies.It’s the story of Connor and David. Connor is a young incubus, not yet grown into his powers, who sees the beautiful David – he of the long golden hair and silver eyes – asleep on a branch of the huge Magnolia tree in the yard across the street. Though both boys are only 13, it’s love at first sight. Both are too young to know it, but that fateful moment defines the intimate friendship that will dominate the next decade-or-so of the young men’s lives.As demons go, Incubi are, perhaps the least threatening. As Ms. Blake writes, “Men live on bread. Vampires on blood. Incubi on sex. And the fey live on dreams…”  “Fey” is the preferred term for fairies, those almost-extinct creatures of nature and light, the beautiful ones who are the keepers of the last vestiges of magic in the modern world. David is fey. Though ethereal, elegant, and as elusive as smoke, fairies are also enormously strong, very difficult to kill,  yet also in a race toward oblivion, as they continue to marry humans and give birth to half, quarter and eighth fairies, such as David. In the process, they lost their immortality. David’s grandmother is, perhaps, the last of the pure fairies, finally aging and facing death at the end of a life of more than a thousand years.The boys grow into adulthood as devoted best friends. David capitalizes on his other-worldly beauty to become not just one of high fashion’s most popular models, but also a talented designer with his own fashion line. Connor used his power of seduction to become one of the world’s top rock-stars, selling his sex, his raw energy and the music of the night to millions across the globe. His job and his raw sexuality afford unlimited opportunities to feed from fans of either sex, but still, there’s only one person in the world to whom he tells his secrets, his own wants and desires, and that’s David.David’s time has been a bit rockier. He’s had a number of lovers, including one who lasted four years. His career is not doing well, either. The astonishing beauty that captivated photographers, designers and fashionistas isn’t working any more. Much to his chagrin, he actually has fine lines radiating from the corners of his eyes. At the ripe old age of 26, he’s starting to age – he’s not becoming an old hag overnight, by any means, but he’s aging like a normal human. Unlike his pure-bred forebears, he is not blessed with their timeless beauty. And in the world of high-fashion, there’s always someone a year or two younger waiting in the wings to take advantage of the inevitable disintegration of the stars who came before them. It’s the cruelty at the core of the fashion business, its endless flirtation with youth. To make matters worse, David has found solace in booze and prescription drugs. With a little help from his “friends”, he’s still young, beautiful and never, ever lonely.David’s big problem is that he’s never realized that, laugh-lines included, he is still beautiful and magical, or would be, if he hadn’t given up on himself.“Sweet” is a book about love built on a framework of supernatural powers and incompatible beings. It delves very deeply into what love is, how we search for it, lament its absence, and often don’t recognize when it’s standing right in front of us. It’s also about distinguishing love from need, passion from lust, comfort from boredom and courage from fear. Connor is afraid he’ll never deserve David. Let’s face it, fidelity is not in his lexicon. He has to screw around to survive. It is his nature.And David, on the other hand, is so terrified that the devotion Connor has always saved just for him was, in fact, just another seductive manipulation that allowed him to get close enough to feed on him. Or was it? How often has Connor sucked the essence out of his soul to slake his hunger, or have his ministrations, his concern, his help and care been an authentic expression of his love?Ms. Blake explores these areas authentically, yet with poetry. Love is probably a better subject for poetry than prose, but even that’s not enough for Ms. Blake. She evokes emotions, apparently effortlessly, with color, smell, light, music and taste. A sample:“His eyes were the most incredible shade of gray, almost blue in the dim light. They made Connor think of hidden woodland springs, of dew caught on blades of grass. He lowered his mouth deliberately to David’s, expecting to taste cool water. Instead, David was all sunshine, rich honeyed tones laid over warm flesh.”In this simple, short paragraph, Ms. Blake captures David’s fey connection to the earth, Connor’s wonder at the colors, tastes and tones that express his love more than any possible overt act ever could, and it provides the reader with some real insight into the goodness that lies at the core of the incubus, who is, ostensibly, supposed to be a manipulative predator.But even more important, the very words are a joy to read. And it’s those words that make “Sweet” such a profoundly moving, unique and powerful book. There are innumerable examples of Ms. Blake’s sheer genius with words. She draws vivid pictures of settings, characters, and their thoughts and feelings. She brings them to life with elegance and passion. Who would have thought that a supernatural romance could have been such an exquisite reading experience? Not me. I stand corrected.This is a five-star book that I recommend from the depths of my heart. It is an esthetic and emotional experience built on unique and inventive premises and history. It is beyond allegory. If you enjoy love, poetry, and beautiful writing, you must not miss this one.Alan reviews gay fiction for the Sinfully Addicted... blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FJ0C4YHCSAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012U0OTTK#wasThisHelpful","R18FJ0C4YHCSAJ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cardeno C. has an amazing body of work covering almost every genre of gay fiction. A truly accomplished author with a host of five-star books and VIP partnerships, Strange Bedfellows, is a bit of a departure from much of her other work - a little lighter, a little more clever, a little more fun to read. It is, in fact, exactly what I was looking for to brighten up my week.The story is very simple, but also fairly unique. It features two characters involved in politics, a 37-year-old U. S. Representative from Missouri and Trevor Mago, the son of the Democratic President of The United States. Adding even more levels of recognition, accomplishment (and, in some cases, shackles), Trevor is also a brilliant self-made billionaire, five years older than Ford, and Ford, in turn, is the son of one of the two U. S. Senators from Missouri. Both of the men are gay, which adds some major wrinkles to their non-existent love lives. Trevor finds it incredibly difficult to deal with what his hook-ups want from him, more often than not, money, a job, a contact within the White House. Ford is bedeviled by his family's relentless right-wing family values and their conservative disapproval of gays and same-sex marriage.These men were raised in more-than-unusual families that went a long way to influencing their beliefs, attitudes and the obstacles they are still battling to live a successful, fulfilling life. Trevor hates the idea of relationships, seeing that both his parents had long entertained a bevy of bed-mates in their open marriage, and lies about relationships because of the political necessity of keeping mum about their multiple infidelities. Trevor was raised believing there were only three people any of them could ever trust - each other, father, mother and son. Ford was raised in his evangelical church, raised to believe he was an evil sinner who couldn't control his same-sex urges, no matter how hard he tried, destined to be celibate or unhappy his entire life, until he finally reconciled his beliefs, as an adult - that he was exactly as God made him, and denying that is to deny the intentions of God Himself.Trevor has stayed as far away as he possibly could from politics, knowing, first-hand and up-close, that there was no integrity in the profession, no truth, no innocence and no honesty. So what's the likelihood that a religiously-up-tight closeted Republican House Member and the billionaire son of the Liberal First Family, who trusts no one and hates politics with a passion, would ever be able to get together? Slim-to-none. But it happens, nonetheless.The men hooked up in dark gay bar in Washington DC and went back to Trevor's place to get it on. Which they did, to great satisfaction. It's not until the lights come on in Trevor's penthouse condo, that Ford realizes who he just slept with - a man who could now blackmail him with the destruction of his political career, a man who is the son of the opposition. As Trevor politely points out, he's already got enough first-hand ammunition to blackmail him forever, so what has he got to lose by jumping back into bed with him again? Which he does.Surprisingly, this produces almost no angst. These men sincerely like each other, their banter is funny, clever and endearing, they make each other laugh, they make each other horny and they love being together. Nice to get all that stuff out of the way right off the bat. What's left is whether Ford will have to guts to come out (of course, he will), and both men facing both sets of parents and the insane pressures they put on their only sons, all in the name of family-loyalty, political party and, in Ford's case, the church he's betraying by being openly gay.That's it, I don't want to give away much more, not because I don't want to reveal incredibly clever twists in the ensuing plot, but because there aren't incredibly clever twists in the plot. The plot itself is not exactly an edge-of-your-seat page-turner - but the characters are. The interplay between the men is beautifully written (to be expected from Cardeno C.), there are moments of laugh-out-loud humor, one fight that breaks the couple up (for less than 24 hours), and the endless, stereotypical but heartwarming bickering when the Democratic President and the right-wing Republican Senator work to merge their families and their political campaigns - a feat that staggers the imagination.Strange Bedfellows offers a lovely happily-ever-after for these two empathetic characters. Are they authentic and believable? - not really, because they're both bigger than life, but their inner light is so lovely, and they make such a wonderful couple that you'll be rooting for them page after page, without exception.This is another lovely story by Cardeno C., one that I recommend for a few hours' light reading on the beach, or indoors on a rainy day. The author provides almost no heartache, but lots of tender, funny, intimate and sexy dialogue that exquisitely expresses the story of these two men falling in love. Don't miss it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JW1JDN7212RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZMPE1ZS#wasThisHelpful","R2JW1JDN7212RB","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh lucky me. For those familiar with my reviews, you must be thinking: he’s losing his mind, all those five-star reviews, one after another. But no, I’ve just gotten lucky. The last few books I’ve read were special, each unique in its own way, and that’s extraordinary in a genre that often relies on formula instead of imagination.At first glance, “Thirty Things” might strike you as just another formula book – the gay road trip. I’ve read more than a few of those. But, as always, first glances can be deceiving. This is a lovely journey, lovingly and beautifully written, a great experience for the characters, an even more rewarding one for the lucky reader.Nate and Finn are roommates, best friends, and companions since they were both eight years old. Finn is gay and out, Nate appears to be relentlessly straight (if his regular conquests are any indication). Finn, however, is still a virgin. He has a problem, a major impediment to a rich and fulfilling sex life – he’s been in love with Nate since he was thirteen years old, and no other man stacks up to him.Finn has been extraordinarily careful in hiding his attraction and passion for Nate. He’s just about to turn 30, and he’s become so used to living an unrequited love that he can’t even consider other possibilities. He’s also deathly afraid that Nate will find out, because it might destroy the incredibly close friendship the two have shared for most of their lives. His other great fear is Nate falling in love with one of the girls he beds. A serious relationship would not only make Finn a fifth wheel, but Nate would, inevitably, move out and move along. Finn isn’t sure he could bear that.For the last two weeks, Nate has been secretive, which is totally out of character. The two men always share everything. Finally, Finn demands to know what’s going on, and Nate relents. He’s been putting together Finn’s birthday gift – a road trip across the country with a list of 30 things to do before turning thirty. He’s accumulated a bucket list of all the things he knows that Finn always wanted to do, but never found the time or the confidence to tackle. Oh yes, Finn has a bit of a disability. When they were kids, Finn fell out of a tree in Nate’s yard and got run over by a car as he dropped out of the sky right in front of a hapless driver who couldn’t avoid him. The accident crushed his pelvis and part of his legs. He’s undergone years of therapy, but he still walks with a limp and has trouble remaining standing when he’s fatigued or he’s overexerted himself. Nate is always there to catch him, encouraging his independence, but watching his back to make sure he’s OK. That’s one of the reasons that Finn works from the small house he shares with Nate. He loves his work as a book editor, and can do it from anywhere. No need to commute to an office or wend his way through a cubicle farm.As luck would have it, Nate is a published author. He too works from home. They are a matched pair except, of course, in the romance department.The birthday road trip is scheduled to last a month, and at each stop, Nate gives Finn an envelope containing the “dare” for the day. Some of them are just lovely events, like horseback riding, sleeping in a tree house (at a lovely resort built 25 feet above the ground), watching a meteor shower, attending his first rock concert or taking his first trip to Disneyland.Others are real challenges to help Finn face down his fears, such as bungee-jumping over a thousand-foot gorge in Colorado or touring the Portland coast in a glass-bottomed helicopter. Finn accepts all the challenges because of his absolute trust in Nate, and gets to experience so many things that he might never have had the courage or ambition to try, were he to try them alone.That constitutes the bulk of the book. It is truly a travelogue, with lush descriptions of some of the most beautiful and quirkiest places in America, plus glimpses of the evolving relationship between the two men.About a third of the way through the trip, the inevitable happens: Nate cuddles up with Finn in bed, and later plants the most passionate but tender kiss on him. It rocks Finn’s world. He’s sure he’s dreaming, but doesn’t want to wake up. This is all he ever wanted his whole life, and the reality is infinitely better than his dreamsOf course, into even the loveliest lives, a little angst must fall, and the cause of it is Finn’s confusion. It sure feels like Nate loves him. But just a couple of weeks ago, Nate was straight. Is this just a “vacation fling”, or a “pity thing”, or just some elaborate “experiment”? He is haunted by the possibility that the day this road trip ends, Nate goes back to dating girls and Finn will have to find a way to live with a shattered heart.Fortunately for us, he’s wrong. He should have trusted Nate. It’s one of those old “communication” issues wherein both men had passionate feelings for each other, but neither would mention it in fear of killing their perfect friendship.I won’t give it away, but trust me, there is a happily-ever-after to be had in “Thirty Things”, and you’ll probably guess it before Nate gets to the last envelope at the last stop.That doesn’t matter. Like the road trip, the pleasure of “Thirty Things” is in the journey, not the goal. And with a writer as adept as Cate Ashwood, getting there isn’t half the fun, it’s most of it. Her brilliant descriptions evoke vivid and memorable settings. Her dialogue is both credible and charming. The men are both so endearing - without a hint of malice or self-absorption - that you’ll love them both from the very first page. You’ll root for these authentic, sincere, talented men. You’ll share their love. You’ll cheer for them at every stop along the way. And, don’t worry; this road trip is not exactly chaste. As it turns out, Ms. Ashwood is also really good at writing hot (but tasteful and romantic) sex. To be honest, there’s nothing I could find in “Thirty Things” that she didn’t do well.If you want to read a sincere, beautifully-written and beautiful book, this is the one to read. Ms. Ashwood is an amazingly gifted writer.

"Brilliant, just brilliant. This lovely, beautiful book is special in its simplicity, its honesty, and how the lead character - the young, inexperienced, fledgling dancer, Charlie - grows before your very eyes. How he starts as a terrified, self-loathing teen about to graduate high school (but only if he survives his final gay-bashing) and move on to a life no less bleak than the one he's been living for the last four years.Charlie is different. He's gay, though he has never once admitted it, even to himself. He's also a brilliant dancer with impeccable technique and stunning athleticism. In Beacon, South Dakota, that's two major strikes against him, and has turned him into the target of choice for the relentless bullies, losers whose reason for existence is to cause pain in other people, so they can somehow feel superior. And being both gay (even closeted) and a dancer? That's like having a target painted on his back.Charlie survives his torture by cutting. The razor gives him some control over his life and his feelings, over both the pain and the endorphins that wash the pain away. And by dancing, which lets him fly, escaping his reality, soaring on the music and the very air.He lives with his mother, a single parent, who works several jobs to make ends meet, and he tries to help out any way he can. His plan is to graduate high school and get a job, a dead-end job in a retail store or factory, anything he can to take some of the weight off his mother's shoulders. He's a good son, a great dancer, and a boy absolutely devoid of hope.Everything changes when an envelope arrives from New York. A well-known dance company is offering Charlie a full scholarship for a Summer Intensive, an almost round-the-clock series of classes, dance and critiques designed to prepare young people for a professional dance career. Charlie can't believe it, but he knows he can't go. That is until his mother shows up with his plane tickets and starts packing his suitcase - he's going to go to New York because it is a brilliant opportunity for her talented son, a son she wants only the best for.With great trepidation, Charlie faces a host of firsts on this new adventure. He's never flown before. In fact, he's never been out of South Dakota. He's never been to a big city, like New York, and he's never been in such a potentially competitive situation with so many talented, more-experienced dancers sharing his classes and studios.He arrives at his Aunt Ginny's apartment, which will be his home-away-from-home, with both anticipation and fear. His very first day at the studio, and he will have to take the subway, for the first time, navigate the streets of lower Manhattan, for the first time, and meet his teachers, choreographers and fellow students, for the first time. For Charlie, this is an advanced case of sensory overload, but he manages it, seems to get everything right, meets so many talented people, especially one junior instructor, Max, a gorgeous young man who is a dancer in the company and part-time instructor over the Summer. Their eyes lock. Max is the most beautiful, confident, graceful and generous man Charlie has ever met, and his patience with him is extraordinary.It's a patience that's demonstrated in so many ways - the two boys working together to choreograph a duet that they'll perform at the huge LGBT festival at the end of the Summer, Max exposing Charlie to all kinds of new experiences, from the ethnic foods available on almost every street in New York, to Nathan's hot dogs, to a day at Coney Island for Charlie's first visit to an amusement park.But most important, Max is teaching Charlie how to be true to himself, and how to love. The growing passion between these two beautiful, talented, young dancers is glorious to behold. It's not just the passion they discover in each other, but the innocence that Charlie brings to every act, the sincerity of every kiss, the magical connection that grows between the two.But hanging over both their heads is the end of the Summer, when Charlie needs to go back home to Beacon and help his mother out. It's the end of his dreams, the end of the love he shares with Max, the end of dancing - and he's just too damned talented to let that talent waste away in the boredom and bigotry of Beacon, South Dakota.I certainly won't give away the ending, but Charlie does find a way. He finds a way back to Max, he finds a way for his mother to thrive, he finds a way to hope, love, and success, and it's a wondrous journey for the reader.Cate Ashwood is a top-flight writer, and The Storm Before The Calm is a top-flight book. The angst the characters face feels very real - the responsibility of ""being a grown up"" and ""being a good son"", the loss of the first and maybe only love of his life, the potential loss of the art he's been perfecting his entire life, the art that stokes his passions and brings him both peace and a deep sense of accomplishment.There are not a lot of tears until the ending, when you'll be weeping for joy, for seeing this innocent and special young man find his way to being an independent, passionate, creative adult with an unlimited future.There's no great lyrical odes in The Storm Before The Calm, just masterful writing with some beautiful descriptions of the dance and elegant glimpses of Charlie's soul. The characters and setting are simple, because that's all they need to be, to tell a simple, beautiful and authentic story of a very different kind of coming-of-age. Brava, Ms. Ashwood, you did a brilliant job on this book, and I will savor and remember it for some time to come.I recommend this book, wholeheartedly, to anyone who wants to experience a moving and beautiful story of a young, gay man finding himself and his art. If there ever was a five-star book, this is it.Alan is also a reviewer for the Sinfully Addicted blog...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSO22OYQRHFP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHHHJZ6#wasThisHelpful","RSO22OYQRHFP5","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 StarsHere I am again, swimming against the tide of 5-star reviews, wondering if we've all been reading the same book. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Riley Hart's. I love her characters, her settings, the love that jumps out from every page. I gave every other book in this series (and quite a few others), enthusiastic five-star reviews. She left me, as she always does at the end of her books, with eyes filled, threatening to spill, and my chest swelling with happiness and love for the characters.But I didn't much like getting there. As far as I can see (and remember, I'm an outlier, not the prevalent opinion here), Crossroads is a short story or novella that was obsessively padded out with highly-detailed sex scenes. To be honest, I liked the book much better before the two men started getting it on. I loved watching these two straight (as far as they knew) hot young men fall in love with each other. Not lust, that came later. Ms. Hart does such an excellent job in expressing love, and in this case, by the laughter they evoke in each other. That is, when they were not worrying about, or fighting with their two families, who just hated the idea that their sons were not living the life they envisioned for them. I promise you, you've never met two more mother-whipped boys at, or over the age of thirty, except for those pathetic bow-tie-wearing virgins who live with mother until she passes away. They're not that, but this is definitely one case where the mothers rule everyone's life around them, whether its through their children's desperate need for their approval, guilt, or their more proactive efforts to marry them off to a woman they find more suitable - as if there were one for their precious sons.The problem with the book (and I'm surprised to see this in a book from one of the most accomplished and lyrical authors I know), is the endless gratuitous sex. It starts with a low-key sex scene, probably just rubbing against each other. Then there's a page or two of dialogue followed by another sex scene, but now they're actually touching each other over the clothes. Then a couple of pages of meeting with one of the families, and then, the shaken boys try oral sex. After they wake up, they try 69. The preparation for anal sex seems to go on forever through excruciating detail about how many fingers were inserted and what one or the other man did with them. Then they out themselves at work, come home, and finally do a full insertion, but only on one of the guys, because the other one's just too damned big. Then they get ""caught"" kissing by family for a few paragraphs, followed by a trip to an Adult novelty store and a long session of using dildos and butt plugs on each other to stretch themselves (too much detail yet?). It's only when they finally get through a half dozen pages of out-and-out angst when they finally switch it up, and the other guy finally takes it.I mean, it was endless, boring, overly-detailed, and after the first few scenes, not even slightly hot any more - at least to me. To be honest, I couldn't wait to get to the end to see how things are resolved and how they get their HEA but it just wasn't worth it, at least to me, to wade through all the endless, repetitive sex to get to the HEA.This is so unlike Riley Hart, who is a master of story-telling and character development. So, I was at least a bit disappointed, and found I couldn't, in good conscience, give Crossroads my highest recommendation. For me, this book rates 3.5 starts out of 5, but since Amazon doesn't offer partial stars, I rounded it up to 4.I didn't want to be too far out of the mainstream and, obviously, I'm missing something in this book that most other readers just adore. I haven't figured out what that is, despite reading more than 80 reviews here.Sadly, this one just didn't do it for me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1YNBRY1Q8LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BTIZPY#wasThisHelpful","RL1YNBRY1Q8LJ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m not sure there is a more consistently excellent author writing gay fiction today. Book after book, Ms. Land manages to combine humor, pathos, authenticity and passion in a huge (and growing) cast of characters. Each book in the “Firsts and Forever Series” provides a colorful, yet seamless introduction to the ongoing characters and settings of the series, as well as a rich, detailed backdrop for the new characters, situations and message. It’s an incredibly elegant and clever way to combine familiarity and continuity with new people, stories and themes. So, while each book serves as an ongoing chapter of her epic narrative, it also stands alone as a potent expression of the particular book’s themes and her rich panoply of engrossing, believable characters who, ultimately, are very much like us.From a former Mafia family (the Dombrusos) to a world-famous rock star who disappeared at the height of his fame, Ms. Land manages to paint the most vivid, empathetic characters, including, and especially, the ordinary, everyday “lost boys” who get rescued from obscurity, danger, loneliness and lives of quiet despair. In Ms. Land’s world, the rich, the famous, the successful, the old, the young, the kids on the street are essentially all the same, looking for acceptance, love, self-worth, safety and family.And this series has more than its share of families - including the Italian dynasty that started the series, an extended Irish family populated by an outsized share of cops, the scion of the Russian Mafia and a growing group of discarded and disaffected gay people who create their own families. There are artists, potential artists, rich people, destitute young people, people with no education, people with advanced college degrees, disabled vets, even a spare porn star or two, and sitting atop all of that is Nana Dombruso, the 80-year-old matriarch who has adopted what seems, at times, the entire gay population of San Francisco - with a dedication to equality that is so pure and passionate, that she is a one-woman activist organization as likely to leave you in tears, as rolling on the floor in uncontrollable laughter.How many rich 80-year-olds do you know who carry a 45 in their purse, broadcast a cable cooking show that has become a monster hit, perhaps because of the infamous mishaps that always result in some kind of phallic symbol being wrestled around the kitchen in the most “innocent” way? How many rich 80-year-olds do you know whose hearts are as big as the city and world they inhabit? Nana Dombruso is the best of who we are, or aspire to be, without filter, without excuses for inequality, discrimination and persecution, our avatar for doing the right thing relentlessly, breaking all the rules, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!And what she and our talented author are most dedicated to is family, especially for young people. Like many of us, she is incensed by throwaway kids, abandoned by parents driven more by religious fervor than the love it’s supposed to promote, more obsessed by sin than dedicated to the safety, security and growth of their own children. Nana and Ms. Land are equally obsessed with the runaways, kids who escape abuse only to find themselves alone on the streets, without support, or a roof over their heads, forced to sell their innocence to put a meal on the table and clothes on their back.This is where the rubber meets the road in this novel – the national tragedy in how America, its political institutions, and its shameful religious leaders abandon tens of thousands of young kids to abuse and death. Most authorities estimate the gay population of America to be somewhere between 4 - 10% of the general population. If that’s so, then why are gay kids 40% of all homeless youth?This is what comes from supposedly good, scripture-quoting religious family values in America – young kids exploited by sick adults for their sexual pleasure, young kids dead in alleys of violence and drug overdoses, young kids killed by their own hand? This is a crime against humanity – and this is Ms. Land’s particular gift: to present their stories with the compassion and humanity that has been so sorely missing in their lives.A lot of these kids are survivors, to be admired just for making it through another day. What Ms. Land brings them is home, love, acceptance and self-respect, the basic needs of all healthy humans, the needs their families and an uncaring society have so cruelly denied them.She guides you through their troubles with such sympathy and authenticity, she shows them, and you, another world, a better solution, and she leavens the horror and suffering with humor, discovery, redemption and families created out of thin air, shared deprivation, common enemies, and unconditional love. Ms. Land is a genius.Each of her books in this series deals with the different obstacles, personal, familial and professional, that gay people face in their basic desire to live, be equal, and hope for the love, respect and acceptance all human beings deserve. Coming home is all about parents, abuse and throwing away children, even grown ones, because they might be gay.This is Chance’s story. He appeared as a critical character in a previous installment, saving Christian, the brilliant street artist, from arrest by posing as his boyfriend as the cops chase him for vandalism. Chance is a prostitute and has been for a dozen years, ever since he ran away from home at the age of 14, after outing his abuser and not being believed by anyone, including his own mother. They all accused him of lying to harm the richest, most powerful man in town – an innocent 14-year-old with no support from the adults who should have known better, should have cared about him and for him, abandoned by his family, community and the institutions charged with keeping him safe.He runs to San Francisco and does what he has to do to stay alive, for more than a decade. And what a waste: Chance is a remarkably talented photographer, both technically excellent and an artist with a great, evocative eye. But he can’t trust, and with good reason. His only close friend is another hustler who lives across the hall from his tiny apartment; they provide each other the only comfort either boy finds in this life, though they are not lovers. They are the beginning of each other’s family, their love as real and valid as any biological family, and perhaps deeper because they love by choice, not by familial obligation.Because of his strange meeting with Christian, running from the law, he is exposed to another world – a world of open, accepted young gay people helping each other find their way in a difficult world, providing the emotional support and sustenance they don’t find anywhere else – except, of course, for the Dombruso Clan, where Nana celebrates, out and proud, each new addition to her “gay homosexual” family, some from her own biological clan, others she found on the streets, in the trades, among neighbors and fellow-travelers.But Chance is also his own worst enemy. He’s the only one who doesn’t believe in his talent, he finds it impossible to ask for or accept help, and he doesn’t really trust the motives of others – after all, no one has ever wanted him for whom he is, no one else has ever really “seen” him.That is, until he volunteers to shoot Christian’s wedding to his boyfriend, Shea, a cop who adores him more than life itself. Chance figures he owes Christian because, after their escape from the law, Christian bought him his first high-end state-of-the-art 35 mm camera and all the lenses he could possibly need for it. All Chance can offer Christian, as his wedding gift to the couple, is the best photos he can take – memories to last a lifetime.At the wedding, he keeps shooting this beautiful sad-eyed young man who turns out to be Shea’s brother, Finn, also a police officer, but the one known to be the “stable” one, the “reliable” one, the one who still lives at home with his parents, saving money to invest in a house.I don’t want to get too deeply into the story (Ms. Land does just fine without my help), but Finn ends up hiring Chance for his sexual services, to bring this unhappy, closeted man out of the prison of his own making, and he pays Chance generously. Chance works hard to keep his heart separate from his work – if nothing else, his profession has taught him how to separate sex from feelings, his profession from his heart. It’s the only way he can deal with what he does. But, little by little, he fails. He starts to look forward more and more to his assignations with Finn. He’d broken his cardinal rule, fallen in love, and has to break it off before he can allow it to destroy him.For some time, Chance has been planning a road trip to Wyoming to visit his mother and brother and seek out the father he’s never met. He’s not expecting much other than closure. He just needs to know who his father was. He uses the trip as an excuse to break off his relationship with Finn, and even leaves him an envelope with all the money Finn had paid him that summer for his “services”. He just couldn’t be Finn’s “whore” any more.His road trip does not go well. He finds his baby brother (now 16) living in terrible squalor with his skittish boyfriend, a young kid on the lam from family sexual abuse, and terrified of everyone except Cole. Things go from bad to worse when Chance’s camera, clothes and money disappear when his car is stolen as he sleeps, unaware, in a fleabag motel. Destitute and without resources (even his cell phone is dying), he does what he knows, and tries to hustle truck drivers in the seedy truck stop next door. What else can he do? He finally answers one of Finn’s desperate calls just as his battery dies, begging for help, for the first time in his life. Knowing he’s too late, Finn is too far away, and not expecting immediate help from any quarter, he continues to hustle the truckers. Just when things turn as bleak as they can be, a drunken trucker threatening to rape or kill him, Finn shows up and brings down the guy with his badge, his prodigious muscles and his gun.Chance is about to learn an invaluable lesson – how to trust, how to believe in someone, how to ask for and accept help from someone who loves you. It’s not easy for him, and it’s going to take time, but Chance’s lesson eventually gets paid forward over and over, as his newfound confidence and trust is sent out in ever-expanding circles like the ripples that emanate from a rock dropped into the still surface of a pond. It is beautiful to watch, beautiful to experience, and a redemption long-past earned.Alexa Land is a great writer of gay fiction. She is one of the very best. Each installment, I keep thinking she’ll run out of characters, humor, inventiveness and her patented compassion and hope, and fall back on what she’s done before. But it never seems to happen, for which I’ll forever be grateful.Each book is a unique journey through the human experience, profoundly redefining both unconditional love and family. She has the uncanny ability to highlight what’s wrong with our society, in the ways we discriminate, in our creative new approaches to hating one-another, yet leaving the reader with hope, a smile, and a tear. She is an extraordinarily talented author. Her words have moved me to the depths of my soul, yet with a lightness of touch that is most extraordinary.Life would be less rich without Ms. Land in it. If she didn’t exist, the gay community would have to create her. With this book, she has taken the bull by the horns and applied her considerable talent and skills to the national tragedy of homeless gay youth, without preaching, humanizing the kids, and making their lives and challenges as real and empathetic as can be. I cannot recommend this book, or any of her books, highly enough. Read Coming Home, it will make your life better.A personal note: Ms. Land’s remarkable book, Coming Home, exposes the tragedy of the tens of thousands of homeless, throwaway and runaway, gay kids who live on our streets.

"Megan Erickson is a prolific and well-respected author, but until her new “In Focus” series, she wrote primarily straight romance. With Focus on Me and Trust the Focus, she brings her amazing talent and rich characters to the Gay side. I’m so glad she did. I have quickly become one of her most ardent and dedicated fans.It’s not just because of her brilliant writing and vivid characters. It’s not just because her themes are so personal and deeply-felt. It’s not just because her characters are passionate and hot. It’s also because her books are deep, they work on many levels, are rife with metaphor and meaning, but also engage both the heart and the mind – or perhaps more accurately, they engage the mind through the heart.Both books share a couple of intriguing themes: road trips and photography. I must admit, I’m not a big fan of road trip books. I sometimes feel like I’m reading a sex tour of exotic locales in some kind of Gay road atlas. But Ms. Erickson has managed to take what should be mundane, what should be a boring look at the everyday lives of two relatively ordinary young men and imbues them with incredible power and fascination. Somehow, the author crawled right inside their heads and hearts and brought them to life, so vividly, that I was rooted to the page. I couldn’t put either “In focus” book downFrom time-to-time, I’ve worked as a semi-professional photographer or written about photography which is, perhaps, why I found this second metaphor so resonant. I’ve always viewed photography as the art of taking the ordinary, the things we never pay much attention to, the things not obvious, and focusing in tightly on them to expose the extraordinary beauty within.In Focus on Me, this is exactly what Ms. Erickson has done. She takes her characters, Colin and Riley, on a trip across the United States, and exposes the souls of both of these remarkable young men as she focuses tightly in on their shared experiences and internal conversations. This is a journey on the roads of America and a journey of discovery between these two and into the truths of their own souls, a journey neither knew he was on when they met, as strangers, in the California-Nevada desert.Their story starts in a gas station on the side of a dusty, little-traveled road, heading east from California. Riley, the breathtakingly beautiful, but delicate and out-of-place young man, is arguing with the gas station clerk, who informs him that there is no longer a bus station there, or a taxi service, and he doesn’t want him to loiter, he needs to move along. How? With no bus, car or taxi service, he is stranded in the middle of nowhere.As fortune would have it, Colin is standing right behind him in line, waiting to pay for his gas. He offers the stranded Riley a ride. Colin, the recently ex-college-football-player is heading home to North Carolina after giving up on his education and his sport when he realized he didn’t really want either. College and football were the expectations others imposed upon him, not his own dreams. His were much humbler. He was the typical small-town football star, the local hero who shouldn’t “waste his talent”. But in his heart, he is just a rather ordinary young gay man who wants nothing more out of life than someone to love and a life helping to run his family’s popular restaurant.Both boys fell into a success they thought they should want, but turned out to be a burden, rather than a blessing. One way or another, they’re both on their way “home”, which adds another level to their story: they do indeed find home, but it wasn’t “where” they were looking, it was “with whom”.Colin and Riley are both keeping secrets, some from each other, some from themselves. Riley is not well. He is seriously clinically depressed which leads to the most important theme, one that Ms. Erickson handles with accuracy, delicacy and empathy – mental illness. Trust me; this is no simple road trip. On the other hand, neither is Focus on Me a “heavy” book laden with nothing but deep truths, shared pain and internal discovery. It’s beautifully written by the assured hand of a master, with moments of levity, revelation, great beauty, and a passionate love that grows, mile-by-mile, as the pair travels on toward the East Coast.They share many first-time experiences together, from The Grand Canyon to a Native American Sweat Lodge. With each mile, they also share a little bit more of themselves with each other, both wary, neither believing that anything will ever be possible between them. Colin can’t believe that someone as attractive as Riley could be happy with him. Riley just can’t feel. He really can feel almost nothing. He’s not even really sure he’s alive except that being with Colin has made him want. When they make love, he can feel the passion. But beyond that, he feels only irrational jealousy and out-of-control lust, lust borne of desperation and fear. At the same time, he knows that Colin deserves more, more than Riley can give him.Colin is more and more baffled by this beautiful young man whose confusing and inconsistent behavior leaves him adrift, without a clue as to what’s happening, how this man he’s grown to care so deeply about, perhaps to love, can become so remote that it’s almost as though he’s left the room, or doesn’t even recognize him anymore.I’ll leave the rest for you to discover. They arrive in North Carolina, Colin realizes Riley needs help, he doesn’t quite know what to do, with his love for Riley and his fear for him battling constantly. Very slowly and gently, Ms. Erikson unpeels the onion, showing us all the hope that always lays just beneath her narrative, like the beautiful photo waiting to be exposed, the truth waiting to be revealed.And it is a beautiful sight to behold. I hope I haven’t left you with the impression that Focus on Me is a purely intellectual exercise, devoted to metaphor and technical feats of legerdemain. It is so much more. Yes, I love her books for the many levels on which they work, but none of them work without the humanity, authenticity and love that she invests in her stories and her characters.So, whether you’re looking just for great writing by an accomplished author, or the whole package – a story that will move you to joy and tears, a story about love, a story about finding yourself, you simply cannot do better than this one.Alan reviews gay fiction for the ""Sinfully Addicted"" blog, who provided a copy of this book in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20B4J5315W1NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGLXUC#wasThisHelpful","R20B4J5315W1NV","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, reading any book by J. L. Merrow is like coming home. She was the first author I read when I started reading gay romance, a few years back. And how fortunate I was - sometimes the fates favor the ignorant. I had no idea who this remarkably talented, warm-spirited writer was, and I was prepared to reject gay romance as a genre not fitting a reasonably literate, adult gay reader. All my preconceptions were shattered, in one fell swoop, and I spent the next few weeks immersed in all her books available in the Kindle Store, at the time.Well, 800-or-so titles later, here I am back with another elegant J. L. Merrow book, loving every word of it, laughing, occasionally choked up, but absolutely at home with her vivid, often eccentric, but all-too-human characters. That is what defines a J. L. Merrow book, its humanity. Whether the characters are born low or high (she obviously prefers her characters humble, the humbler the better), each of them is Everyman, driven by the same basic need to be loved, fear of being rejected, misunderstanding things all over the place, but pure of heart and kind of soul.Her books are gentle. If you're looking for earth-shattering drama, or standard gay romance memes, look somewhere else. Her characters are actors heading home to a job in daddy's business, handymen, pest-control engineers, plumbers, bicycle repairmen, teachers. Their challenges are basic: putting food on the table, buying a new car or television, keeping a job, trying to make a go of relationships and messing them up royally, as only we flawed humans can do. However, the author is a romantic, and love always wins out.Ms. Merrow is also one of the most original and authentic writers in the genre. The characters, locations (the town or village is almost always a major character) and situations, though ordinary, are always unique and vividly rendered. They're believable, but wonderful at the the same time. I must confess, I've never been disappointed by a J. L. Merrow book, and ""Played"" is no exception.Played is the second installment in the Shamwell Tales. At the time I read the first installment, I didn't know it was the first installment in a new series, so when someone, knowing my predisposition for anything Merrow, gifted me this book, I didn't even realize it was a sequel to the last Merrow book I read. Talk about ""coming home"" - this book delivered it in spades and on many levels: first, as I said, it's a Merrow book, which is always a coming-home for me; second, it's set in Shamwell, a village 25 miles from London that might as well be hundreds of miles, and decades distant that I well recall from the previous book; and third, I was immediately greeted with the pest-control engineer, Sean, of the previous book, his lover, Rob, and their dynamite, gorgeous, mixed-race friend, Heather.The whole gang is back with two fascinating new characters, Tristan, the gorgeous, Jewish, recent graduate of Cambridge and a major drama school and Con, the dyslexic handyman who's also a giant who looks like a god and has a heart of gold. Tristan is in Shamwell because his nanny, Nanna Geary, has left this moral coil, and in her departure, left her house to Tristan. Con has been living locally for a year-or-so, satisfied with his life, but only because his handicap leads him to believe that it's not likely that he'll ever do any better.They meet when Con is referred to Tristan to do some of the minor repairs Tristan needs to have done in order to get the house ready for market. Instant fireworks, but it's hard to tell because Tristan is so condescending, so verbose, so besotted with his own cleverness that almost every word he utters is a quote from a play. Of course, this verbal assault and his intentional superficiality are masks for his unhappiness, particularly his wealthy father's demand that he grow up, move to New York, and take a position in his successful financial empire - a future that Tristan can't bear to even think about. He is an actor, and a good one, and successful or not, it's what he was born to do. But he is too much of a coward, in the face of his father's disapproval, to stand up for himself and make his own choices for his own life.Con is attracted, mightily, to Tristan, but he is not interested in casual sex. He is up for the long term, for the heart, not the nether regions, and will not succumb to the temptation of the flesh without his heart being involved - something that's impossible with Tristan as he's only in Shamwell for a couple of months before he is forced back to New York and a life of desperate unhappiness.Meanwhile, Tristan is determined to ""land"" Con before he leaves, part bravado, part a bet with his obnoxious friend Amanda, who is in Hong Kong, trying to get rich, and who bets him 50 Quid that he won't get the ignorant oaf in bed. You can tell what's happening in Tristan's heart as he starts getting more an more pissed off at Amanda's condescension and her endless putdowns of Con.They are thrown together in a local drama club, which is about to produce Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. They have no one to play Bottom (which character name provides endless opportunities for any number of shameless puns by Ms. Merrow in the guise of Tristan), and Tristan gets impressed into the job. Con has been designing and building their stage sets and props, so the two are thrown together unavoidably. They're forced into an even more direct intimacy when their Puck breaks his leg, Tristan moves into that role, and starts training Con to perform the role of Bottom. Con does not act, what with the dyslexia and all, but, oddly enough, the terrified Con is actually a gifted natural actor, and takes on the role, makes it his own, and begins to understand what drives Tristan. Of course, the men are falling in love.The rest is a comedy of errors leading to the two of them getting together, as was destined from the very first page of Played. Though there's not a lot of guesswork or suspense in a Merrow book, the joy is in getting there, and in her remarkable and beautiful mastery of prose. There were times, when reading Played, that I guffawed, out loud, others when I had a lump in my throat, and often when I experienced both simultaneously.But above it all, my sheer admiration for the Author's writing gave me hours of pleasure from a book I couldn't put down. For example:""Tristan struggled awake from confused and vaguely horrifying dreams of his father dressed as Oberon, ordering him to give up Con, who was improbably attired in an oriental pageboy outfit several sizes too small.""and:""His face felt funny, as if stretched into a besotted, lovesick smile, which closer inspection in the bathroom mirror revealed was, in fact, the case. It was a touch unnerving to find his face doing things like that without consulting him first...""and this may be my favorite run-on sentence of all time - Con describing the feeling the first time he kissed Tristan:""...when he got up in the night to use the loo, which was a several-times-a-night thing, him having an eighty-three-year-old prostate, plus there was the risk he’d try and change the fitting himself, and fall off the chair and basically die, so Con had said he’d do it in the end, and she’d said bless you, and went to turn off the mains, except she’d flipped the wrong switch in the fuse box by mistake and Con had touched the live wire and then he’d fallen off the chair but being twenty-three and not eighty-three, he’d escaped with just a few bruises and a weird feeling right through his body for hours afterwards. Yeah. It was something like that.""Nobody but the talented, colorful, gentle yet passionate J. L. Merrow could have written those lines. Each one put a smile on my face as I read this virtuoso riffing on the English language in the midst of a sweet, loving, gay romance!Played is a homecoming to be devoutly wished. I recommend it from somewhere very deep in my heart. For a light, brilliant romp with kind people and true love, you just can't do better than Played.Alan reviews gay romance titles for the ""Sinfully Addicted"" blog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGQK5WMGRR1NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U3M60TU#wasThisHelpful","RGQK5WMGRR1NJ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great shower curtain at a great price. I used to be an architect, so I'm particularly sensitive to my interior environment. I don't have to have a name brand, I don't have to have the ""high-priced-spread"", all I need is quality and esthetics. And this curtain delivers both, in spades.The curtain is a silk-like polyester blend with a white translucent background. You'll probably need a white liner to go inside the tub, but it's not absolutely required - the blurry white background gives you plenty of privacy and hides the tub when not in use. One of the things I liked most about this shower curtain is the way it diffused the light, filtering a very bright but ""gentle"" light that softens harsh shadows. The print is a full-curtain size image of a leafless tree, almost like a silhouette against the background. It's very restful, natural-feeling, and artistic, to-boot. In fact, I had looked at something similar online about a year ago, but the quality was nowhere near as good as this one, and the price more than double.So I was asked to take a look at this one and submit an honest review, which is what this is. I never, ever give a favorable review, upon request. If I'm asked to look at a product, I evaluate it as though it were something I really wanted and was willing to pay serious bucks for. If it falls short, I'll either be absolutely truthful, but if I feel the vendor had good intentions and just missed the mark, I'll just decline writing a review.This one was easy, I had no second thoughts. (See the photo of my bathroom, attached). The quality was superb, and although it's all synthetic fabric (a good thing for a shower curtain!) it has the look and feel of a high-end silk. Plus, I even liked the curtain hooks, which are plastic ovals with an opening on the side that you just move slightly to put it over the rod or through the curtain loops, and it springs back to its original alignment, as soon as you let it go.My only complaint is so minor that it's barely worth mentioning, but I was a bit confused when I first opened the package because the ""opening"" in the curtain hooks wasn't open. They have that little bit of ""remainder"" plastic that you have to break before you can separate the two edges of the hooks. Took me a few minutes and a small utility scissor before I solved that one, but a little paper instruction might have been helpful.What I love about the hooks is that they're white, to match the background of the curtain, unobtrusive, and the curtain and liner never, every fall off the hooks, like my previous S-hook hangers did.I confess I love this curtain and would have bought it, especially at this price, with no questions asked even if they hadn't asked me to review it. When all is said and done, I'm glad they did.I recommend this curtain without reservation. Check out the picture, and see how well the curtain works with a toilet seat decal I also recently purchased here on Amazon. Trust me, you can't go wrong with this one, and you'll never match the price at any local department store or hardware store. I know, I looked!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3BLKVIC1F1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O7CPJNU#wasThisHelpful","R2A3BLKVIC1F1I","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this charger/stand/dock in return for a fair and honest review. Unlike many other similar offers, I'm sincerely pleased to have received this one, because it works, as advertised, and is nothing less than first-rate - in other words, a gadget that lives up to, and exceeds, all of my expectations.It's a most effective charging stand. It does not come with an AC-Adapter, but you've probably already got one of those that came with your phone. Just plug this stand into it, and it's a perfect tabletop charging station.It does, however, come with a computer USB cable, which means you can not just charge the phone, but browse it as a drive, or run it live as it sits on your desk, charging.The fit with the S6 is near-perfect. The phone hooks into its port effortlessly and sits gently in the cradle. Some people complain that they couldn't use it with their current case, but when you consider the infinite variety of design and thickness that third-party cases feature, that's not a big surprise. The cradle base does have a pull-out that you can remove to get more room for the phone, but not all cases will work with this stand.Fortunately, I don't generally use a third-party case with my phone, so it's not an issue for me. There's another benefit: I tried both the Galaxy S5 and S4 in the same base, and they work just fine. A little extra for multiple-Galaxy families, like mine.I do recommend this base unreservedly. Don't get me wrong, it will not cure world hunger, it is just a cell phone stand, but it's handy, well-designed and priced reasonably.What more could you ask for?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KNZHJIRUBMZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV9IWSM#wasThisHelpful","R2KNZHJIRUBMZM","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just one of those products that comes out of nowhere and you think ""why didn't I think of that""?For the last couple of years, I've been struggling with my shower curtain hooks - they're the open bronze-finish, fancy design ""S"" hooks and they hold a beautiful cloth shower curtain and a heavy plastic liner. When I shower, I throw a large bath-towel over the shower curtain rod.Two things happen:Every time I get in or out of the shower, at least one of the hooks works loose and ends up in the tub or on the bathroom floor.Every time I pull the towel off the curtain rod, two or three of the ""S"" hooks fall off on the bathroom floor.I've had it with shower curtain hooks - something I shouldn't even have to THINK about!Then I was asked to try these, evaluate them, and write an honest review. And I'm glad I was. I loved these hooks. The top loop, that goes over the shower curtain rod, has ball-bearing-like rollers on the top so that it they glide effortlessly and noiselessly over the rod. The bottom half is a spring catch, similar to the the spring closures on the end of belt hooks and key hooks. When they're closed, they're really closed, and there's virtually no possibility of them accidentally popping open or off.These hooks will not cure world hunger, cure cancer or bring about world peace. They are not a big thing. But they're a wonderful, simple, elegant little solution to a mundane, and sometimes annoying, problem that shouldn't be one.I'll never go back to the old kind of ""S"" hooks again. These are doing exactly what I need - holding up my shower curtains and moving back and forth with ease, something I will never have to think about again. Thank Heavens. By the way, they look very cool in an ""industrial"" way, too.I can't recommend these clever hooks highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A26VJ02NCJJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX4UD5I#wasThisHelpful","R3A26VJ02NCJJM","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this artwork. It's a photo printed on semi-gloss canvas, broken up into a 3-panel triptych, with the outside inch-or-so of each panel wrapped around the stretcher as a self-framing edge.It's not so much the print on canvas, though the quality is excellent. It's the quality of the art that surprised and delighted me. I have been a semi-professional photographer for more than 30 years, and I must admit that I wish this were a photo I had taken. When I was first asked to review this piece, I had sort of anticipated ""motel art"", those terribly vapid generic landscapes that are designed, above all, not to offend - to be bland and totally acceptable to everyone.That wasn't the case. This scene is nothing less than superb, with beautifully saturated color really capturing the last few moments of sunset, my favorite time of day. The picture is evocative, cool, evening, peace and has a certain lonely beauty to it. I have hung it on my living room wall, alongside my own favorite work, and it holds its own as art, not commercial decor.I have also, in the past, recommended photo art for offices, particularly large medical facilities. They always tended to suffer from the ""decor"" problem, unremarkable enough that the works could be wallpaper instead of fine art. I wish I'd had these to work with, back then. They offer the best of all possible worlds - affordable, serious art, professionally presented with evocative subjects and moods. So yes, if you're looking for art either for your office (or other facility), or for your personal space, these prints are ideal.This is definitely a five-star product for the quality of the art, the print, the mounting and the extremely reasonable pricing. I recommend it most highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VNIJHJSHMRMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U5VYAJ6#wasThisHelpful","R2VNIJHJSHMRMJ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for some light reading. In fact, I was desperate for it. I’d just finished two gay romance novels, one of which was awful, and the other, near-suicidally depressing. This light romance by Australian author, Ms. Nic Starr, was exactly what I’d hoped to find.It is a love story with some tension, but not driven by overwhelming angst. It’s a story of two young professionals, Charlie, an elementary school teacher who left town to go to college (and to get away from the small-town atmosphere) but came back; and Josh, who never left, an incredibly beautiful and sensitive young man who is a dedicated EMS technician working for the fire department.The book starts, as these types of books are wont to do, with a “meet cute”. One of Charlie’s students, a young second-grade girl, has fallen and broken her leg. While he rounds up the other kids (like herding cats) to keep them out of the way and prevent panic, his eyes meet the most beautiful, caring, eyes he’s ever seen in his life and, well, the story is about to begin. Yes, love-at-first-sight. Don’t be cynical, it can happen – not often, but sometimes.The problem however, is if that happens, where do you go from there? These two gorgeous, well-built, lithe, muscular, well-endowed and gorgeous men start out in love – there’s just no real estate left for a falling-in-love saga, for them to overcome the daunting obstacles to their once-in-a-lifetime love, for the reader to wonder if they will ever be together? The answer is clear from page one – absolutely they will.So what is there left to write about? Well, sex, of course, tons of endless sex, all throughout the book. And the author has added just enough angst to make their relationship plausible, even though you know it’s not going to fail, no matter what.For Charlie, Ms. Starr supplies a couple of despicable parents who have refused to speak to their own son ever since they found out he was gay. On the few occasions he runs across them in town, they stand up and walk out of the room, food court, or grocery store with a stiff back, lips pursed in disapproval and their air of self-righteous superiority intact. Stupid people, awful parents.For Josh, Ms. Starr provides his own baseless fears. He’s out and proud at work, and almost every place else in town, but not at home, where he lives with his older brother, Andrew (also gorgeous, hugely muscled and generously endowed, one assumes), who raised him after their father died, and who he’s terrified will find out that he’s gay. Not that he’s ever indicated that he was homophobic, except for one single time, many years ago, when Andrew’s best friend tells him he’s gay and dating someone. Andrew goes ballistic and never speaks to Tanner again. Josh, of course, becomes terrified that he’ll lose his only remaining family member, as Charlie did his parents.Of course, that’s all in Josh’s mind. You can tell because Ms. Starr has telegraphed the fact, early on, that Andrew’s is the next installment in this series about gay men. That doesn’t make it impossible that Andrew’s a homophobe, just very, very unlikely.I need to say, right up front, that Ms. Starr is an excellent writer, adept at exactly the kind of angst-light I look for, from time to time, to sort of clear my palate between more melodramatic reads. Her writing is fluid, descriptions sparse but still evocative, and every character has a distinct and unique voice.But I had some issues with Charlie’s Hero, mostly its length. I looked up Ms. Starr’s currently published Kindle books on Amazon, and all of them are short form – short stories and novellas, except for Charlie’s Hero. This was either her first, or one of her first, full-length novels.The problem is, it isn’t. At most, it’s a novella. As a novella, Charlie’s Hero would have been near-perfect, just enough character development to get involved with Charlie and Josh, colorful secondary characters who pop-up for brief appearances, and the main characters living out a relatively uncomplicated story that has its roadblocks, But only minor ones.But it’s a novel only because it’s been padded with endless, repetitive and boring sex scenes, plus a 30-page “preview” of Andrew’s story (the next installment).There’s nothing wrong with having sex or writing about it. But when it does nothing to drive the plot or flesh out the characters, it’s just filler. The first two or three sex scenes? Yep, they did exactly that. After that it was just more of the same. I ended up doing something I almost never do – skimming through the sex scenes to get to some actual plot or characterization.One more thing struck me wrong in Charlie’s Hero and it is definitely not the author’s fault. Dreamspinner Press is one of the top publishers of gay fiction in the world and nails presentation and editing every time, without fail – except, perhaps, this time.It’s the cover of the book. What were they thinking? Did they use the wrong one, or just pull an unrelated cover out of a file drawer?  I would normally avoid saying anything about a cover because, well you know, not judging a book by its cover? But in this case, I was anticipating, throughout the entire book, a new character, an ugly, older guy with a pot belly and suspenders and wondering why he hadn’t appeared yet. Was there a last-minute villain waiting in the wings, an epilogue set fifty years into the future? It was baffling and distracting.Every male character in this book, straight or gay, is in-shape or totally hot, muscular, gym-built, and therefore a thoroughly modern young man concerned with his appearance.So why did they promote the book with the fat CPA in suspenders and an underweight, but flabby street hustler? If anyone knows, let me know, because I’m still baffled by it. You can rest easy when you read this book knowing that no one on the cover is actually in it.I wish I could give this book five stars because I liked both the writing and the characters so much. If it had been either cut down to size or expanded up to size, instead of padded, I would have given it one of my highest recommendations.Still, if you’re looking for something light and reasonably uncomplicated, something without any tears, but that delivers a few warm smiles, by all means read Charlie’s Hero. And perhaps, as Ms. Starr gets a little more comfortable with the larger format of her new series, subsequent installments will grow to fit its real estate with more sophistication and depth.This review written for Sinfully Addicted To All Male Romance.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TV9ROY81PMEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZM6GLRS#wasThisHelpful","R3TV9ROY81PMEV","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are just brilliant.Every now and then something comes along so simple, so obvious, that one can't help but wonder why no one had created it before. It's not quite as earth-shattering as the first light bulb or the first computer. It's just one of those little things that is such an obvious and effective solution to a problem, that's it's just a joy to discover them and think ""oh goody!"".And the timing could not have been better. This vendor sent me a set of these tags to evaluate at just about the time I was putting my tomato garden in. Now it's not a garden as you might expect it, it's a series of 14"" self-watering pots filled with potting soil and peat moss that sit on my balcony from late spring to mid-fall, the tomato growing season here in the Northeast.I would prefer to have a full-blown garden, but I live in an apartment in upstate New York. It's certainly not ""the big city"", but still there's no ground available to the tenants for planting - but I've just plain given up on the tasteless grocery-store tomatoes and nothing, but nothing, tastes like a vine-ripened home-grown tomato. Tomatoes are, believe it or not, my favorite food.The only way to hone my crop, extend it, and get a decent crop all Summer long is to experiment with different cultivars, and every Summer, I hone my garden by experimenting with new types of tomatoes. I must be doing something right, as they've only been in the ground a little over a month, and the tiny seedlings are now pretty much all 6-feet-tall and bearing fruit. My balcony now appears to have a solid green six-foot wall of greenery around two sides of it.I tailor my watering, feeding, etc. based on which cultivar is in which pot, which means it's critical to know which pot has which cultivar, or the whole summer-long experiment is wasted. One year, I made my own little signs to put down in the soil in the pot, but the watering, rain and wind did them in. I had been looking for garden stakes I could write on - and though I'd already bought tomato cages and 6 foot long garden stakes to wire the rangiest vines to, you can't write a label on a six-foot-long, round, dark green, textured stake.Last year, I brought out my DYMO label-maker and printed up a transparent label for each pot, but as the sun began to beat down on the wet plastic, it took on a nasty propensity for bubbling, stretching and fogging, make the labels harder and harder to read as time went on.Then I was offered these tags and, voila!, the perfect solution. These ""natural-looking"" concrete-colored, slightly bendable, but-stiff-enough-to-push-down-in-thesoil garden tags are perfect. They blend so well with my slate-green pots and the color of the main trunks of the vines, that they blend in beautifully while remaining bright enough for high readability. And since they're not printed or colored, they don't look like annoying advertising - the kind of label you get when you buy cuttings in garden store.If I label them with my DYMO Labelmaker, they're a lot more readable than my current labels due to the light background, and if I letter them with a sharpie, they're readable all the way across the balcony. At the end of the season, if I use the DYMO labels on them, I can just remove them and the plastic tag is good as new. Or, if I use the sharpie, I can just leave it for next year, or the year after, because I'm always going to repeat at least a few cultivars from season-to-season, and you just can't rub off, blur or run the sharpie once you've applied it to the tagsEither way, they're a godsend, and a brilliant solution to a nagging little problem. For the last eight years, I've had to jury-rig my own amateur solution instead of a slick, elegant solution like this one.I recommend these tags MOST highly. I know it's just a little thing, but I must admit that I smile each time I go out and in my balcony garden and marvel at just how clever these things are. Won't change your world, but it will make it a bit easier to make it orderly, and perhaps, like it does to me, put a little a smile on your face as a bonus.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4Q9H4DOA9RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTH45IG#wasThisHelpful","R2W4Q9H4DOA9RF","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Superb spread. Now I admit I'm a huge fan of hazelnuts, and the combination of hazelnuts and chocolate makes me ecstatic. But combine hazelnuts, cocoa and sugar-free low carb/low calorie, and I'm a fan for life! Even better is that this spread doesn't taste anything like a ""diet"" product. It's rich and creamy with a beautiful, delicate hazelnut aftertaste. It's way beyond Nutella or any other chocolate-hazelnut spread around. In fact, it's a gourmet treat.I was given a few packets to try and asked to post an honest review. Trust me, a few packets of spread is not going to make me compromise my reputation and compromise my review, so my gushing here is just an honest expression of the absolute delight I experienced in discovering this wonderful product - one to which I give my highest recommendation.If you don't need the portability of these individual-serving packs, I suggest you save a few dollars and take a look at the 11 oz. jar.

"I certainly didn't expect to like this book, let alone love it. When it comes to this sub-genre, gay shifters, I'm a dedicated no-show. Nothing personal, the whole concept doesn't ring my bell, yet if you throw a high-school quarterback, a rock-star, a couple high school wrestlers in Spandex or a billionaire, or two ,at me, I'm in my glory. But shifters? There's just something so... bestial about it?And then when I realized this is about birds who shift to human form, I sorta got intrigued with it, and went with Masked Booby, and I mean really went with it. This parody of shifter novels, this brilliant take on birds cum humans, is nothing less than purely delightful. The plot almost doesn't matter because the writing is so witty, stylish, self-referential, over-the-top, and the endless puns so side-splitting, at times, that I can't remember having this much fun reading and laughing since my last Alexa Land novel!Masked Booby captured me from the very first paragraph, in which the zookeeper (Irwin) is lamenting the drugging of his very best friend, a Tufted Puffin, who was under his care in the zoo's breeding labs. Atticus and Irwin had grown close (not in that way, keep your dirty mind in check!) as Atticus shifted to his human form and the two spent the evenings in deep discussion, sharing their lives and stories, thoughts and philosophies as only best friends do. But Atticus keeps getting himself in trouble. Every time they put him in a breeding cage with an aggressive female, Atticus screams, screeches, stomps and attacks, resulting in some (minor) injury to the females. To make him more cooperative, the dodos who run the breeding program thought it would make Atticus more amenable to mating if they drugged him to make him more compliant. Now that was stupid on two counts: any male human will tell you that taking downers is not amenable to mating (Viagra anyone?); and what the hell did they expect a gay bird to do when accosted by attacking females? Irwin keeps trying to get him to be more cooperative so he won't be punished any more, but really, Irwin is gay, and he should certainly know better.They finally up the dose so much that Atticus is left unconscious, around the clock. And that's not the worst, because now that they consider him a danger to the flock, they've applied for permission to euthanize him. Irwin has to do something to save Atty, but he doesn't have a clue what. So, like all good, tuned-in young men, he Googles the problem, and finds an international group of bird-shifter rescuers that goes by the name ""UC Peckers"", for Undercover Peckers (just imagine all the puns on THAT name, and the authors don't miss a single one). They specialize in avian-shifter rescues. Headed by Sebastion , the renowned Avian expert, who happens to be married to Louis, the bird-shifter he both saved and married, UC Peckers is on its way to Australia to save the hapless Atticus.I'm sure you get the drift by now. The authors (they are also a parody, since Jacques N. Hoff are actually two people who admit they're ""authors who shouldn’t be allowed to interact with each other (at least in public). It was either co-write hot pecker porn or plot world domination."" After reading Masked Booby, I'm not sure exactly which one they chose.This is a fabulous book (in the gayest sense of the term ""fabulous""), that includes an ironic, funny or side-splitting take on almost every trite meme of the entire gay fiction genre: there is a love story between Irwin and Mickey, a Masked Booby shifter, who has never let anyone get close to him because of the terrible cruelty of his own species (the ""I'm not worthy"" meme); a lovey-dovey pair, one shifter, one not (""gay -shifter -  for you""), a twin brother who doesn't have a clue and is, of course, completely straight (straight, but understanding brother), condemnations of those who are too ignorant to think rationally and hence attack anything different from themselves (religious bigotry); and a host of other trite, but wonderful, excursions into this bizarre looking-glass take on the standard gay romance (shifter) novel.The book is short, which I don't normally like, but jokes shouldn't go on for hours, so it's quite OK. Plus there are two earlier books in the Peckers series, and, I'm sure, much more to come - which is why the authors left everything but the love story hanging. Must be a happily-ever-after to the love story, even if everything else goes to hell, right?If you're even vaguely interested in a wild, strange, charming and sexy journey to the wild side, make absolutely sure you don't miss Masked Booby. It's precious and silly - in a very smart way. And then do what I'm about to do, get my hands on the two prequels as fast as I can. God knows my life could always use a few laughs, not to mention an endless supply of groan-inducing avian and ""pecker"" puns.For fun alone, Masked Booby definitely gets a happy, five-star recommendation from me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BAM8MDVM7KJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z22K47A#wasThisHelpful","R1BAM8MDVM7KJU","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book by Keelan Ellis I’ve read. Even after I’d gotten through the first chapter, I was not quite sure I’d like it – I’m not a big fan of ghost stories. But I just couldn’t put it down. The more I read, the better it got, the more the characters reached out and grabbed me, the more the parallels between the two stories converged, the more sense the ghosts made to me.What Ms. Ellis has done, in a most remarkable way, was traced the astonishing progress toward humanity, civil rights and self-respect (no, pride) that LGBT people have finally won, especially over the years since Stonewall, in 1969.It has been an unparalleled journey from shame to self-acceptance, from disdain and dismissal to a civil rights movement which has accomplished more, faster, than any other ever has. And this journey is encapsulated in the touching tales of two gay couples whose stories stretch nearly a century, one of the couples dead, the other trying to find their place in life and with each other.Clay and Silas are two young men who died in 1968, in a brothel - a brothel they owned and managed, successfully, for years. They both came from nothing, alienated from their families at a very young age, forced to find their paths in a world that didn’t want them. They sold themselves to survive; they brought in others but treated them with dignity, compassion and respect. They built a family of similarly situated men and women whom society wanted no part of and to whom it offered neither safety net nor even the most basic of civil rights, the right to love the person you love. Ultimately, they were murdered by a closet case, one of their married customers who couldn’t stand that these two men openly shared the love he did not dare.Jess and Eli are another couple, but not at the beginning of the book. The two boys (because that’s exactly what they are when the book opens) could not be less alike, but have been best friends since they first met, back in 2002, when both were 12. They’ve been inseparable ever since. Eli has known for a long time that he’s different, and that he wants more than friendship from Jess, but he could never bring himself to say a word. Once he was old enough to know what those feeling meant, he knew that it could not be. He could not be “that way” because it would ruin every important relationship in his life, his family, his future, and even his friendship with Jess.They make it through high school as the closest of friends. But then one night, a strange incident ruins everything for them. Jess takes Eli, and a bottle of booze, to an abandoned house nearby, that’s rumored to be haunted. Of course, it’s the house in which Clay and Silas died. When they discover the master bedroom, left as it was the day of the murders, everything goes awry. They’re suddenly both intolerably horny. Out of control, they drag each other to the bloodstained bed and begin to ravish each other, but not as Eli and Jess. Some part of them recognizes each other, but when they look in each other’s faces, they don’t recognize the men they’re seeing, and as they climax, they call out names of people they don’t even know, Clay and Silas.Yep, believe it or not, rape by ghostly possession. This is almost offensive when it first occurs in the book. Two boys who, obviously, had a growing relationship neither wants to acknowledge, find themselves sharing full-on sex, but not as themselves. Disturbing? Certainly, but not as disturbing for the reader as it was for the boys. Their lifelong friendship shattered, Eli is so terrified of being gay that he enlists in the Army (following in his father’s footsteps), and Jess locks himself away to lick his wounds.Skip ahead four years. Eli comes out in the newly tolerant U. S. Army in Afghanistan, and then back stateside in Maryland. Returning home to decide what to do with the next phase of his life, his number one order of business has long been his greatest fear – coming out to his parents. It goes surprisingly well. It’s certainly not immediate and total acceptance, and his father is more distant than ever, but his mother is making a serious effort to come to terms with this new reality.His next task is to hook up with Jess and confess how he has felt all these years. Even in the Armed Forces, Jess was never far from his thoughts, and it’s time for them to, finally, get together. But there’s the rub: Jess is engaged to marry their former best friend, Cassie. Obviously, things are pretty messed up.The bulk of the book is the unraveling of Jess and Cassie’s plans, the growing love between Jess and Eli, and creating a future in an uptight small town with the assistance of a pair of helpful, and now-welcome, ghosts.I don’t want to give too much away, but imagine a gorgeous old haunted home, once a brothel, now one of the most successful gay wedding venues in the state. Marriage Equality is good to these boys, and they are good for each other. But no more sex with ghosts – though they might let them watch, a little, from time to time.What struck me most about I’ll Still be There is how Ms. Ellis weaves tragic history, teen angst, coming out, the military, same-sex marriage and a pair of ghostly rapists together in a beautifully wrought story that tracks the history of gay rights from the second half of the 20th Century to today – without being obvious about it. The story is, at turns, funny, wry, passionate, moving and charming. Despite the over-the-top conceit of the dead lovers, each and every one of the characters is drawn true, with depth and empathy, the struggles they go through are so very real (and common) and yet their courage a beautiful sight to behold.I’ll Still Be There is extremely well-written. There‘s not a boring moment in the book, not one. The prose is written fluidly, but with an admirable economy of words. It’s much more “show me” than “tell me” and much more “move me” than “recite history”. All, in all, it’s a major accomplishment, but even better, a great read. I didn’t put it down once, from first page to last. And that is, perhaps, the highest recommendation I can give any book. I’ll be looking for more great writing from Keelan Ellis.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZT3GFCR2Z0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7I78II#wasThisHelpful","R1XZT3GFCR2Z0K","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"N.R. Walker is one of the very best. She is the top of the game, working in that rarefied air where the truly gifted and dedicated writers dwell. I met her when I chanced across the Red Dirt Heart series. It blew me away. The premise, the souls of the characters, all of it, was as dramatic as it was gentle.Somehow she managed to carry that touch, that uncanny ability to reach out to the reader’s heart, into her vampire series, Cronin’s Key. For me, that’s huge. I am not a big fan of vampires, shape-shifters or werewolves. Yet here I sit, just finished with Cronin’s Key II with tears of joy welling in my eyes, a huge smile across my face, moved more than I ever thought possible. It’s not that it’s vampires. It’s not that it’s powerful creatures of the night. It’s that Ms. Walker has very few peers who can explicate, express and command love on the page, as she does, no matter who the subjects are. Cronin’s Key is about violent creatures in violent situations, but redeemed by their relentless drive to do good, the depth of their hearts, and the essential gentleness that is their incredible power withheld and channeled into constructive, kind and generous intent.This is the second book in the series, and I’m thrilled to death that the last page of the book announces the forthcoming Cronin’s Key III. I honestly can’t wait.Cronin is a vampire, a very young vampire, less than a thousand years old, give or take. Alec (the Key) is a 29 year old human, a former New York City cop who was literally swept off his feet in the middle of the police station, in the plain view of security cameras and cell phones, by the mysterious and gorgeous vampire with the talent to transport, instantaneously, to any location on earth. The two men disappear in a most public way, which is the start of this epic journey, and the end of Alec’s career as a New York City detective.Despite his fairly ordinary profession, Alec is rather special. He’s very smart. In fact, he has a fully-retentive photographic memory. He reads a lot of history. He also seems to heal a lot faster than normal mortals and has been protected by a guardian angel who saved him from both the minor scrapes of childhood and his brushes with major disasters as an adult. No one ever saw this angel, but he’s always there whenever Alec gets in trouble. In fact, just recently (and there’s video of this too), he was shot in the face, at point-blank-range, by a criminal he was trying to arrest. The bullet sped relentlessly toward his head, but just before the moment of impact, it changed path and nicked him in the leg, saving him from certain death. Yes, his guardian angel at work, once again.In the first Cronin’s Key, Alec gets to know the fabulously wealthy and erudite vampire who is his “fated”. He feels it, as much as Cronin does, that force, that destiny that reaches across the generations to ensure that the two shall be joined together as intended. Sex is a bit of a problem, because vampires bite when they climax, and biting will kill or turn Alec, so they have to be careful of their physical relationship – which drives them both nearly insane.There’s a fabulous assortment of supporting characters with all kinds of talents and personalities. Eiji and Jodis are the closest to Cronin. Eiji is a Japanese vampire, older than Cronin, yet younger, as vampires keep the look and body they had when they were turned. He has the normal skills of a vampire, including incredible speed and strength, but his special talent is tracing the DNA of anyone he touches, both backward and forward through time. It’s an invaluable talent when you need to know the background of either friend or enemy. He is Cronin’s best friend and brother. He’s also the mysterious “guardian angel” who has protected Alec, since birth, dedicated to preserving and protecting his brother’s fated one.Jodis is Eiji’s fated, a beautiful woman whose major talent is ice – controlling water and freezing almost any fluid with a glance or a touch. Then there’s Eleanor, the older woman, turned when she was already 60. Though she’s completely blind, she is a gifted seer. She sees with her mind, her dreams, her soul, almost infinitely better than others can with a perfect pair of eyes. She can get around a room or a city without a cane or a guide, and plays a mean game of chess. She’s invaluable to Cronin, Alec, Eiji and Jodis, as she can see far enough into the future (though often indistinctly) to warn them against their enemies and foretell their success and survival.Kole is Alec’s completely human father, a dyed-in-the-wool Scotsman, which works out well, since Cronin, in his previous life, was a Scottish warrior who regularly slips into Gaelic, especially to express his love to Alec. Alec had no idea that his father already knows Eiji, who approached him shortly after Alec’s birth, when Alec’s mother was killed, and Eiji saved Alec from the murdering vampires who would have taken or killed him as well. Alec is stunned to learn that his very ordinary, smart, but unprepossessing father has known about the whole vampire thing for the 29 years that Alec has been alive, and approves of his relationship with Cronin, immediately. Talk about accepting parents!There’s one very special new character in Cronin’s Key II, Jorge. Jorge is a relatively old vampire who lives in the six-year-old body he occupied when he was killed and turned. He was executed by his own tribe because he appeared to be two people in a single body, multiple personalities warring for center stage, or so it appeared. Out of fear of the unknown and the different, his tribe put him to death and a vampire resurrected him. Most other vampires are terrified of him. When he moves from personality-to-personality, his eyes change and his face goes from an innocent boy to an evil monster, thousands of years old. Or so it seems. Jorge is not what he appears to be, and he will be the key to the solution of their current challenge, the seer who brings the future about, saving Alec, Cronin and a huge swathe of humanity.And yes, that is the point. For a variety of reasons, some self-serving (avoiding detection), others purely altruistic (they are dedicated to protecting and saving humanity), they battle some of the most terrifying forces of all time to turn back the unthinkable. Cronin surprises Alec with his historic revisionism: Black Plague: not a disease, a band of rogue vampires killing millions; the Pyramids, not built to honor the dead, but to keep ancient Egyptian vampires from wreaking havoc on the human world; Genghis Kahn and Jack-The-Ripper, vampires; Jesus Christ, not.In the previous book in the Cronin’s Key series, this intrepid band of vampires and humans, with the assistance of covens from all over the world, battled a demented vampire who is resurrecting an ancient Egyptian Empress so she can control her and take over the word. In this book, it’s Genghis Kahn and his Terra Cotta army, buried in an underground crypt in Mongolia alongside a great and ancient King of China (also a vampire), who are out to take over the world. Or is it just a trap to lure Alec to the crypt to kill him?Alec is suspicious of the whole thing. He just doesn’t believe the Genghis Kahn bit, nor does he now believe the Ancient Egyptian Queen bit, either. He is convinced that someone is manufacturing these distractions, someone who needs the “key”, and the key is Alec, and his blood.What drives these stories is the fact that Alec’s blood is like none the world has ever before known. It has the power of the most powerful vampires in it, yet is entirely human. When he begs Cronin to turn him, so they can be together forever – he is desperate to be one with Cronin, to share not just their sex and kisses, but their blood – Cronin tries but, astonishingly, Alec doesn’t turn. Cronin drinks enough of Alec’s blood to kill six men and turn a dozen vampires, but Alec doesn’t change at all. He doesn’t even get tired, or faint, or ill, or suffer a bad case of anemia. In fact, he feels better. Alec’s blood is something different, indeed, and because of it, Alec is the “Key”.There are two notable things I particularly loved about Cronin’s Key II (among many). The first is the way Ms. Walker treats their growing love. Normally, even vampire “fated” relationships wane a bit, after a while, as human relationships do. They start out with intense love, and then level off to respect, admiration and affection. Not these two. Every day, they become closer; every day it gets harder for them to be apart for even a moment; every day their lust tries to consume them; and every day both their powers grow, as they can hear each other’s thoughts without speaking and feel each other’s proximity or distance without touching or seeing. They are actually becoming one. Alec is showing growing vampire skills, though he remains doggedly human. The love between these two characters grows so huge and so intense throughout this book that it virtually rises up from the page and into the reader’s heart. Stunning - and sexy as hell.The other thing I loved about this book is that it unravels all. Ms. Walker doesn’t play any games with the reader. Alec finds out why he’s the Key, what made him different, and who he is to become – one of the most powerful and beneficent creatures the world has ever known. Ms. Walker doesn’t keep us hanging by our fingernails to keep us coming back for more. She delivers a totally complete, fulfilling saga with all questions answered and all loose ends tied up. Alec even gets a visitation from the loving mother he never knew, and Jorge, who seemed such a terrifying enigma, but to Alec still a boy to whom he showed concern and love (something all too rare in Jorge’s long, but tortured life) is revealed not as a mental case, but as a seer to top them all, a visionary, in conversation not with an evil doppelganger, but with the future and the past.The action, the grand finale, is brief and nowhere near as dramatic as it was in Cronin’s Key I, but the emotional power, the joy, the blinding love is almost overwhelming, which is way more satisfying.Anyone can write a good fight scene. But only a master, like N.R. Walker, can weave a web of love, acceptance, brotherhood and triumph for several hundred pages without one word out of place, or one moment of flagging energy.I am so relieved that these wonderful characters will not disappear now that the author has revealed all the secrets, all the destinies. We need more time with them. We need more adventures, but most of all, we need more of the lyrical, gentle spirit with which Ms. Walker imbues her incredible characters, and which reaches out right into the heart of the reader.When I say this book has my most heartfelt recommendation, I mean that - literally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R274B3DVK6D8MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XMCQS6S#wasThisHelpful","R274B3DVK6D8MD","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I approached this title with a bit of trepidation. It's almost entirely a Road Trip, not my favorite genre. Road Trip books can get awfully claustrophobic, especially ones like ""Trust The Focus"" that only feature two main characters. Plus, secondary characters tend to come and go with little depth or impact.But what I hadn't anticipated was Ms. Erickson's deft hand at the helm. She grabbed me from the very first paragraph and never let me go. This is the story of two young men who just graduated from college together. What's remarkable about them is that they've been best friends since they were twelve, and at least one of them is openly gay. Landry is an artist, an out-and-proud gay man with a passionate and sophisticated talent for drawing and illustration. Justin is virtually the other side of the coin - a first-rate college baseball pitcher majoring in Political Science with a minor in Photography. He's also known as a straight-shooter, his future preordained - going to work with his mother (she's running for the Senate from Pennsylvania), and finding a nice young girl to settle down with and raise babies.The problem is that his mother (he calls her ""The Cold Bitch"") has never given two minutes' consideration to what he wants to do with his own life. And, to be quite honest, he's too much of a coward to object, or even consider his own goals separate from his mother's self-serving plans for his life.The two young men set out on a road trip to scatter Justin's father's ashes. He died, unexpectedly, before father and son could do all the things they promised to do together. Justin's dad was a highly-respected freelance nature photographer who spent most of his time traveling America, photographing the most beautiful places in the nation, living in a small, ratty, but reliable RV named Sally as he drifted from state to state. In his memory, Justin is determined to take to the road in Sally, revisit the places at which his father shot his most celebrated photos, and scatter some of his ashes at each location - finally sharing the trip across country that his father had always promised him. He invites his best friend, Landry, to accompany him on this summer-long journey before Justin has to settle down to the bleak, joyless life his mother demands of him.And therein lies the rub. Justin's been in the closet for a decade, living up to everyone else's expectations but his own. And he's been in love with Landry that whole time, though he's never breathed a word of it to anyone. How would they manage to live in such close quarters, sharing the same bed, spending their time together 24/7 and still keep up the fiction that they are just good friends?They don't. At some point, their mutual attraction and affection make it impossible to live the lies they've nurtured to cover up their absolute dedication to each other, to the exclusion of everyone and everything else. And then, all hell breaks loose. Some of that ""hell"" is them both acknowledging that they've been in love with each other, pretty much forever. The other part is Justin's self-loathing and anger at his own cowardice and that almost-uncontrollable need to meet everyone's expectations, no matter how much they hurt him and a possible future with Landry.The couple loves, fights, separates and comes back together several times throughout the trip. Mom ""gets the message"" from a photo they post on a blog that follows their progress through Landry's text and Justin's brilliant photos, including a selfie that exposes the love in their eyes, their happiness with each other, the truth of who they are, and who they need to be. Mom orders Justin home, immediately. For once, he refuses, but not without throwing another temper tantrum with Landry as the object of his anger at himself, the demands his mother is making upon him, and the endless conflict between what he wants and needs and who he thinks he's ""supposed to be"".Needless to say, Ms. Erickson provides a suitable and lovely happily-ever-after, so they do, finally, work it out. And that's a good thing, because the way this incredibly talented writer evokes the deep affection and devotion these two young men share is one of the most beautiful and moving depictions of love I've ever read. It's not the sex (especially as they come to each other as, practically, virgins), but the fit - the way their bodies, together, become one, the way each man can finish the others' thoughts. It's the Platonic thing - they are two halves of one person, only complete when together.It's an exquisitely-told tale, a beautiful story with engaging and realistic characters. It's a book not to be missed. You will love these young men, their journey and the subtlety and simplicity with which Ms. Erickson tells their tale.No matter what you do, don't miss this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NM3KB15Z6X3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGLZPU#wasThisHelpful","R1NM3KB15Z6X3B","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rhys Ford is nothing less than amazing. I’ve been a fan of hers from the very first time I picked up one of her books. That appreciation, that admiration just keeps growing with each subsequent title.In each book, she introduces us to a large cast of unique, vivid and touching characters, settings and over-the-top action, adventure and humor. Murder and Mayhem is a fast-paced, rollicking ride from start to finish, peopled with characters you quickly come to believe in and care about. Ms. Ford is one of that rare pantheon of writers who manages to combine, color, pathos, humor and action in every book she writes, and blend them elegantly, seamlessly, and apparently, effortlessly.The book opens in the middle of the action. Rook Stevens, a former celebrated con-artist who’s gone straight, unlocks the door to his high-end movie memorabilia and collectible kitsch store, only to find a dead body in the middle of his showroom floor. Bending to the corpse, he realizes that he knows her and doesn’t much like her. She was not a good person. He also gets her blood on him. Oh my, you know exactly how that works: he just became the prime suspect – recently-dead body in his shop, the victim, a former adversary, and he’s covered in her blood.The next thing he knows, a small army of men uniformed in black, from head to toe, is pouring through the front window, guns blazing and bullets whizzing by his head. He runs out the back door, through the alley, moving as fast as he can to escape the army trying to kill him, when he’s tackled, driven to the ground by a huge man, zip ties already circling his wrists. He sees the gun and badge, so he’s not so worried about getting killed right now, but then he discovers that his worst nightmare has become all too real.The man on top of him, the man holding him at gunpoint is Detective Dante Montoya, the man who most wants him dead or in prison for life. This is not his first meeting with the hot detective. The last time Montoya took him down, Rook escaped prosecution because Dante’s partner (and mentor) manufactured evidence to convict Rook, and got caught at it. All charges were dropped, Vince (the older detective) was fired in disgrace, and died soon after. So Dante wants Rook bad. He wasn’t going to let this carney kid ruin his life again, no way. He was going to nail him this time. And therein lies the rub – that despite his distaste for the ridiculously successful con man and thief, he really did want to nail him, and not as a cop, but as a man who continues to be obsessed with this hot, handsome young thief.But Montoya’s got a problem too. Rook really has gone “straight” and is making a small fortune from rich, obsessed memorabilia collectors out of his very successful shop. Unfortunately, the cops made a total mess of his showroom, and not just because of the dead body on the floor, but because the young cop who took the first shot into the darkened interior swore he saw someone inside raising a gun. The person he saw inside? An eight-foot tall Chewbacca statue that is now all shot to hell. Boy is this trigger-happy cop in a world of hurt. He led an armed assault on a furry statue before they even knew anyone was dead inside, and in the process, destroyed tens of thousands of dollars of valuable merchandise and display cabinets – not to mention almost killed Rook Stevens. Yes, the police department considered Rook a very bad guy, but murdering an unarmed suspect who is legally on his own premises, with Chewbacca as an excuse, is not a very good thing for one’s career.Neither is Dante’s pathetic attempt at questioning Rook. After all, Rook was raised in the carnival. Brought there and abandoned when his mother ran off with the first hot guy she could find, Rook became a child of the carney. He could read a mark from a mile away. Trick Rook into a confession? Isn’t going to happen. Not in this lifetime.But even that doesn’t matter, as a whole team of top-flight lawyers shows up at the precinct and springs him within minutes. Whoever paid for the high-priced representation apparently has a lot of clout, because they’ve got everybody from the Mayor on down demanding Rook’s release. What the hell is going on here?Rook thinks it’s time to book, run away and hide from the murder rap – for a murder he didn’t commit – but his assistant, Charlene, a bimbo, but a loyal one, convinces him to stay and fight the bastards. So he does, catching a cab to his grandfather’s house. He needs a place to stay, but can’t go back to his apartment, because it’s the floor above his shop, and it’s all now a crime scene.The next day, when Dante and his partner arrive at Rook’s new temporary address to question him further, they can’t believe their eyes. There must be some mistake. The address is a castle, one of the biggest, richest mansions in Hollywood, which appears to inhabit its own private park. This can’t be the right address. They knock on the door, ask for Rook, they’re asked for their IDs, and once invited in, confront a cantankerous 80-something-year-old man with a nasty disposition and an air of pure power. He asks: “what do you want with my grandson?”And the book is off-and-running. Rook didn’t know his grandfather until he went straight. Some functionary contacted him, and the two met for the first time. Turns out his mother had run away from the old billionaire’s stifling, disapproving presence, to find herself. No one knows what she found, but she definitely lost Rook along the way.You’ll have to read the book to appreciate the incredible badinage between the two men. Grandpa (Archibald Rook) is constantly demanding his way, threatening to write everyone out of his will, moaning and complaining as only the very old and rich can do. But he gets on really well with Rook, because Rook’s reaction is always “go stuff it, grandpa” and “you don’t have anything I want, so keep your damned will”. In fact, Grandpa has come to treasure his spirited grandson, as one of the only members of his family not running around kissing his butt, waiting for him to die, so they can get their hands on his money. There is a beautiful and poignant undercurrent running through the book of two independent men who respect each other for the sheer force of their wills, and grow to realize that they really do care, deeply, about one another. Rook finally has family, even if he is an old curmudgeon, and Grandpa finally has family, even if he despairs of his favorite (though gay) grandson ever producing an heir. Of course, there is always surrogacy. This conflict provides fertile ground for an ongoing battle between the two men always at each other’s throats, but always having each other’s backs.Two things happen that occupy most of the book. The first is the mystery, as Rook and Dante team up to find the killer who’s leaving bodies all over town. The second is Dante and Rook falling, inevitably, deeply in love.And what a journey both things are, from mortal enemies to dedicated lovers, from suspected killer to potential victim. You’ll wonder who the villain is, up until the very last pages, when all the other red-herrings have either been killed or alibied out. Both the mystery and the love story are wonderful fun.Rhys Ford is nothing but brilliant with characters. She reminds me, so much, of another of my favorite authors, Alexa Land. Though they write very different books and characters, they both create the most colorful, yet believable and empathetic, characters who just grab you by the heart and don’t let go. Dante, Rook and Grandpa are three of those. Add in a whole regiment of carney-types and grifters of all persuasions and talents, and you’re almost overwhelmed by the sheer creativity of Rhys Ford’s world. You really don’t want the book to end, her world to go away, the vivid colors to return to shades of grey.Murder and Mayhem has it all - beautiful writing, rich, deeply-rendered, evocative characters, colorful settings exquisitely described, action, murder, mayhem, carney, developing romantic and family love and, to top it all off, the cherry on the sundae, lots of irony and occasional side-splitting humor. There is just nothing left to ask for. Ms. Ford delivers the whole package, every single time. This is the work of a master.Though the plot and action will not change your life (let’s face it, it’s all escapism, isn’t it?), Ms. Ford will give you a few hours of marvelous and beautiful travel through her incredible imagination, a bunch of laughs and even a tear or two.Don’t miss this book. Murder and Mayhem is nothing, if not a near-perfect reading experience, a pleasure for the soul and the heart.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35W0TCMS409I1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YB8PG8S#wasThisHelpful","R35W0TCMS409I1","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Updated: 6/29/2015)I am now undecided. I don't know if it's the extender or some other factor, but since I installed it, more than 2 dozen HG video clips have downloaded with corruption that freezes the video partway through. The videos were from various sources and with different browsers, so it's not the source files or sites. I have turned off the extender, and so far, had more than a dozen successful re-downloads, but I did have one more bad one, so I have no idea if it's the extender or not. I'll update again as soon as I experiment some more.(End Update)(Original Review - with my apologies)Perfect. Absolutely love this. My all-in-one cable modem (phone, too) hooked up flawlessly, the very first time. Absolutely no setup in the computer to get it to work, just pair it with your modem/router using WPS (push-button) and it BECOMES your router, at least in terms of visibility. I can always tell when I'm connected to the WA850RE, because my Wi-Fi throughput jumps from 78mbps to 130 mbps the minute I connect to this versatile range-extender - and my signal goes up two bars, the moment I do.I love this. I've had great luck with TP-Link products. They're often the least expensive, but the easiest to install and set up, and reliable as can be. I've replaced much more expensive routers and extenders with TP-Link, for a fraction of the price, and gotten better performance and reliability than I did with the high-cost, big-name product.For $20, you can't go wrong with this reliable, effective and attractive Wi-Fi appliance.(End of original review.

"Good clock. Reliable and loud. Not much different from other really loud bell-alarm clocks, but with better illumination and a really nice looking and readable clock face.My only disappointment (and why I gave it four, rather than five stars) is that the snooze button (which is also the illumination button) is a small white button on the back of the clock that you can't find by feel - it's almost flush to the case. So, to snooze or light the clock, I literally have to turn the whole clock to the back side and find the snooze button. When you're only half awake (which is what the snooze button is for, after all) it's not that easy to find it - at least for me in my semi-comatose state. A nice big button on the top would have been a heck of a lot better, or even a big button on the side. But a flush, round, 3/8"" button on the back of the clock? Not so good.If the snooze button isn't important to you, you'll love the clock.

"This clock does exactly what it's supposed to do, keep the time and ring really loud and annoyingly. If soft sea breezes wake you up, this clock is not for you. But if you're like me and you need the sound of a tractor-trailer backing up to get you out of bed, the annoying mechanical bells on this clock are perfect! Easy to set, well-illuminated, very visible face and the battery lasts a long, long time. Well done.I only have one complaint and it's why I docked the Impecca Bell Alarm Clock one star. It's not a big deal, and it's a problem shared with almost every other clock I've ever owned - the alarm goes off when I try to set it for the very near future. In other words, if I want to set the alarm for fifteen minutes from now, it goes off while I'm setting it. Half hour from now? No problem.It's not a big deal. The snooze button works fine after the first alarm goes off, and it illuminates the clock face when you hit it - and I don't often need to set the alarm for some time in the next ten minutes, but still, I'd like to see some of the clock manufacturers address this slightly annoying issue.I do recommentd it.

"The claims for this remarkable product barely really understated the case. We used it, recently, to cut some branches from trees at the perimeter of our property. Keep in mind, we do have a chainsaw, but I was given a free Survival Pocket Chainsaw to test, and so we did. WOW!It performed both beautifully and effortlessly. The description doesn't do it justice. We used it all day, despite the gas-driven chainsaw, and it cut through the branches like a knife through butter. I know it wasn't meant for that kind of full-time use, but the fact that it weighs almost nothing, is sharper than our real chainsaw, and there's no refueling smell and noise made a pleasure of what had been an onerous task. We were working on a ladder, so there was no carting heavy equipment up and down, no fatigued shoulders from holding heavy equipment at chest level.The case is really elegant, too, much better-made and handier than I expected it to be.Hence, a five-star review of a product that actually outperformed my expectations. Brilliant.

"“Conflict of Interest” was my first introduction to a truly talented writer, Zahra Owens. This is the first book of hers I’ve read, and I promise you it will not be the last.It’s so rare that any single book gets gay romance, crime mystery and courtroom drama not just right, but in perfect harmony, where the personal story and the courtroom story actually build upon each other, rather than vying with each other to drive the book. “Conflict of Interest” gets that balance exactly right, and it’s even more of a surprise as it’s set in Great Britain, where the courtroom etiquette, procedure and rules differ profoundly from America’s. At first, I feared I might get lost, or bogged down in detail, and miss the drama of the crime, the investigation and the courtroom. But such is the talent of Ms. Owens, that pretty much everything explains itself, without a lot of description or exposition. The characters just go through their days, their routines, their work, and all becomes clear through their experiences, reactions and dialogue. It is elegantly accomplished. Even an American reader with no experience of the British legal system quickly gets accustomed to its nomenclature, quirks, challenges and occasional triumphs.“Conflict” is the story of a smart, young, but accomplished Crown Prosecutor, Finn DeHavilland, and an ambitious and dedicated detective, Tommy Drummond, who has worked as the investigator (with his female partner, Stevie) on a number of Finn’s cases. That’s just fine with Tommy, because Tommy has been crushing on Finn, from a distance, for ages. Any opportunity to work in the same room, or even the same courtroom, with Finn, is more than welcome.When the book opens, Finn is interviewing a witness on the stand, the mother of a violently, sexually abused boy. The accused is her sometime-boyfriend who has skated on any number of prior bad acts. But this time, Finn is about to nail him for good. Until, that is, the mother completely changes her testimony and sings the praises of the monster who repeatedly assaulted and raped her young son. It’s all about fear. Somehow he got to the witness and now she’s too terrified to testify against him.Finn bears in on her. He approaches her (without the permission of the bench), he appears about to strike her. This most reasonable, collected and steady man is, to be blunt, losing it in front of the whole courtroom. Tommy sees this happening. At a loss for any way of saving Finn, discreetly, from the hole he’s digging for himself, he walks down to the well of the Court, puts his arm around Finn and leads him out of the room. The case is dead, and it looks like Finn’s career is about to follow. Finn has had some kind of breakdown. The unrelenting march of child abusers and murderers who often walked, only to repeat their crimes with fresh victims, has taken its toll. It has somehow all become more than Finn can bear. He lost it. Who can blame him?While he isn’t fired or demoted, he is sidelined for a bit, and forced to undergo therapy. As therapist, he chooses a smart, insightful lady who has testified for him, more than once, as his psychological expert. At least she’s better than a complete stranger, and Finn hopes to be reinstated as soon as possible, with a quick recommendation from a friendly expert. That is not to be. Ayse Kartal is not about to compromise her ethics with a bogus diagnosis. More important, she really likes Finn and is bound and determined to help him sort out his issues and find peace.Finn’s exile is eased, just a bit, when Ayse manages to get him back into the office, but not into court. He will now supervise his associates, but will plead no cases and take no leads until he is fully cleared and no longer at risk of losing it in front of a judge.Finn has never had a relationship with another man (or woman, for that matter). He hasn’t been able to manage it, he hasn’t wanted it, and he’s convinced himself he doesn’t need it. Scarred by events that happened in his youth, he can’t help associating both sex and affection with filth and guilt. Tommy, ever patient and gentle, worms his way, ever so slowly, under Finn’s skin, and into his heart. It’s not all fancy dinners and roses, there are a number of authentic obstacles, and all of the angst and fear rings true. Nothing feels manufactured. This forced interruption, this critical time away from the worst demands of the job, his regular sessions with Ayse and his growing affection for Tommy, all conspire to force him to confront his terrifying fears and guilt.Somehow, this strange moment in his life gets all bound up with a crime, a serial killer who has been plying his evil under-the-radar. Smart enough to make sure that he always commits his rape-killings in far and disparate locations, so they won’t be connected by the police, he also seems to have some kind of knowledge of police and court procedures that a run-of-the-mill killer should not have. Perhaps the killer is a cop, or someone associated with the Criminal Justice system.This is perfect for Finn. Still exiled from the courtroom, Finn’s got the requisite skills, resources and time to lead an inquiry, with Tommy and his partner, Stevie, as his investigators. I won’t tell you a lot of what happens, lest I inadvertently disclose some spoilers, but what follows is an exhaustive, sometimes frustrating, search for the culprit, and the mole who is protecting him. The three (plus Ayse, who assists), become an undercover agency of justice, working as a tightly-knit team, as Finn begins to open up a bit to Tommy, who falls in love with him, without reservation.Someone close to them is exposed as the mole, there are some very close brushes with death for more than one of our characters, and our relentless foursome eventually triumphs over evil and Finn, over his long-buried past.If you’re looking for a happily-ever-after, you’ll find this book most satisfying. If you’re also looking for an extraordinarily well-written book, with scenes that seem to set themselves, evocative characters who jump off the pages, a total lack of melodrama and artifice in a surprisingly moving story, you’ll simply love “Conflict of Interest”. I know I did, and I recommend it with all my heart. This is a subtle, beautifully-written and exciting story that introduced me to a remarkably talented author whom I hope to read for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNJ5KXSNSW2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUDF966#wasThisHelpful","R3DNJ5KXSNSW2F","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an amazingly polished, cogent, beautiful story that is much more sophisticated than I would normally expect from a first-time author. But Kate Fierro is not your normal first-time author. With a notable career behind her as a book translator and editor, she certainly knows her way around the English language. Even more impressive is the fact that, according to her Bio, she’s writing in her second language, not her native one. I would never have guessed.She’s also based in Europe, which is another surprising fact because she absolutely nails Minnesota, American idioms, slang, and (praise heaven, probably the first time this has ever happened) is even fluent in IT and Internet Security speak – I know, the Web is my day job – and there’s not a false step, misused term or inappropriate acronym anywhere to be found. Great job and, for a debut novel, almost unbelievable.She weaves a charming story. First, there’s Micah Geller, nerd extraordinaire, who’s carving out an impressive niche for himself in the Corporate Security industry, leveraging his experience as a teenage hacker into a great reputation as security consultant, trainer and author. But his personal life? Not so impressive. He’s one of those cases whose first lover abused him – not physically, but endlessly found fault, hated any kind of display of affection and was terrible in bed, while blaming Micah for their erotic failures. Micah had come to believe that what he and Brian had was love, and that he didn’t really want any part of it. Instead of going through the endless machinations and insecurities of a relationship, he has decided to be a celibate hermit. He works twelve hours a day, seven days a week, without weekends or vacations off. And he likes it. He doesn’t feel like he’s missing much because, when he did have a relationship, it didn’t make him even the slightest bit happy.His BFF, tired of his reconstituted virginity, gives him a business card for a brilliant high-end escort who specializes in fulfilling fantasies. Well, Micah can well afford it; his star is rising and so is his income. So, in a moment of weakness, he calls and makes an appointment.The time he spends with the gorgeous Angel turns out to have been a great investment. They don’t even have sex. They go to dinner, they cuddle, they kiss a little. Micah had never before realized how much touch matters, how much intimacy brings light and joy to life. But he’s well aware that this is just a fantasy – the one he requested: that Angel show him what it feels like to really be loved, since he’s sure he’s never experienced it before.Unfortunately, he’s spotted by a friend of his sister’s while on his date with Angel, so his family attacks with a vengeance. They so want him to be happy, to have someone, to be in love, like them, that he doesn’t have the heart to tell them that Angel isn’t a real boyfriend, but a hired escort.Like most lies, this one builds on itself, requiring more and more dates as Micah brings Angel to his parents’ 30th Anniversary weekend and to Thanksgiving. His parents love Angel, which makes it even more difficult to reveal his little fraud, so they continue maintaining this paid-for “relationship”.And, of course, they find they really like being together, that they’re quite compatible, and that they’re both coming to care for the other. That’s a bad thing. Angel (whose real name turns out to be Adrien), believes that Micah deserves a real relationship, not a pale imitation. He knows he has to move on, for Micah’s sake. Micah, on the other hand, is happy to settle for friendship.Which is how they leave things, spending a lot of time together as friends, but not boyfriends. That is, until something really dangerous happens that threatens Aiden’s very life. Micah will not accept it, he refuses to let a terrible, dangerous, situation continue, but Aiden doesn’t want his situation to threaten Micah, so he walks away from him, perhaps permanently.Micah is left to confront two big issues in his otherwise charmed life. The first is the fact that he’s fallen in love with an escort. The other is that Micah has long been a coward, as far as his heart is concerned. He took Brian’s garbage, without complaint, until Brian confessed to sleeping with other men, and it still took Brian to end their relationship. Micah has always been conflict-averse, and thus suffered whatever came his way without fighting back or fighting for more.He can’t afford to be a coward any more, and he doesn’t really care what Aiden did to put himself through law school. He is finally passionate, and it’s time for him to fight for what he wants.I don’t want my synopsis to drift dangerously close to spoilers, so let me stop here and just reassure you that this is a gay romance, and it does have a happy ending - as it should. The great joy of this book is seeing how the two men get past their bizarre beginning and painful pasts to negotiate a life together that works for both of them.Kate Fierro is an author to watch. She doesn’t do pyrotechnics, jut straightforward, fluent writing. Her prose has a rhythm to it that’s superb, her settings are realistic, her dialogue absolutely believable (some that’s downright clever), and her characters so real it feels like they will step, any moment, right off the page.And this talented author doesn’t take any shortcuts. There are no standard gay fiction memes, no predictable characters, it’s as though she wrote in longhand and loved every word she wrote. As I mentioned, at the start, this book is unusually mature for a debut novel, which leaves me wondering how good she’ll get with more books under her belt? Is there any limit for her? Somehow I doubt it.Therefore, I suggest you read anything by the remarkable Kate Fierro you can get your hands on, and I sincerely recommend, from the bottom of my heart, that you read “Love Starved”.A final note: I’m not sure the book cover does justice to the author’s writing. At first glance, I assumed it was a heterosexual novel because the depiction of Micah is so feminine (I don’t mean effeminate) that I could have sworn he was a woman. To be honest, I think he was a woman on the cover. But take heart. Ms. Fierro’s descriptions are so subtly evoked, yet vivid, that I hasten to reassure you that Micah looks thoroughly nerdy-masculine, and nothing like the glamorous woman on the cover!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAB4GXHGEGBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2FVJYW#wasThisHelpful","R1LAB4GXHGEGBR","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As best I can ascertain, Ms. Dunn is a first-time published author. If that’s indeed the case, I am both surprised and impressed. This excellent book sports an assurance, a polish, an almost perfect pace and balance that I would never have expected from a first-time author. This is an author to watch out for, because she’s hugely talented.Linemates is the story of two young men who are both players in the NHL. Derek is on the LA Knights, not exactly a top-ranked hockey team, but enough to fulfill Derek’s dream of being a professional hockey player - and he earns a substantial living at it. Trevor, on the other hand, is a star on the Detroit Wheels, one of the top teams in the NHL, but his performance has been a bit lackluster over the last year or so.Much to Derek’s chagrin, he is suddenly traded by the Knights to the Wheels, which uproots his entire life in a single day. He’s headed to the airport before he even gets to wrap his head around the sudden change in fortune, and baffled as to why Detroit paid a small fortune and gave up draft picks to get him. He’s a good player, but hardly a star meriting that kind of trade.Then he realizes what it is - Trevor. The guys go back to the Junior World Championships in Finland, five years ago. They were both players on the Canadian team and the press dubbed them the “Wonder Twins” (after a kids’ superhero cartoon). There was something magical about the two on the ice. They could sense each other, without even looking, and no one could stop them. They were also lovers, for one brief night. Trevor claimed to be straight, but after a few drinks, he couldn’t keep his hands off Derek. They ended up making love through the night – a first for Trevor and the first time Derek had ever fallen in love. Come morning, Trevor was gone, and Derek never heard from him again.That is, until now, when he’s winging his way to Detroit, where a team awaits the miracle of the Wonder Twins and harbors hopes of riding this amazing team right to the Stanley Cup.Derek’s reception in Detroit is a mixed bag. The city seems to be comprised of nothing but hockey fans, so Derek becomes an instant celebrity. That’s a lot of pressure, especially added to the cold shoulder and constant disdain he gets from Trevor. Trevor, obviously, doesn’t want him there. He’s dating a well-known local weather girl and is terrified that Derek will out him – although, of course, he isn’t gay. Well not very gay. Actually, he can’t be gay, it would threaten all of his dreams.The two men endure a roller-coaster relationship, sometimes friendly, sometimes not. Trevor is all over the place, and his girlfriend makes no bones about hating Derek on sight. Trevor goes out of his way to avoid Derek and even sabotages the team by refusing to pass to him, no matter what. It’s ugly and it’s not working.Their coach, thoroughly disgusted with the immediate failure of his brilliant strategy to bring the two men together, has had it with this childish and counterproductive behavior. He forces them to room together on all road trips. They’re going to have to learn to get along, whether they like it or not.A good chunk of the rest of the book is devoted to the frustrating hot-and-cold relationship between the two men, both on and off the ice. Though they’re both in the closet to protect their careers, Derek is angry because Trevor won’t admit he’s gay, even to himself. He’s taking a major stab at denial, which leaves Trevor out in the cold, playing with a linemate who won’t communicate and lives in mortal fear that Derek will out him.Sometimes they get their act together and dazzle the fans and the opposing teams. Sometimes, they don’t click at all, when Trevor becomes distant – even on the ice.I don’t want to give away any spoilers, but by the end of the book, Derek finds out why Trevor has avoided him. It appears Trevor hasn’t ever gotten over, or forgotten, that one night five years ago, either. I’ll leave you to discover how this all works out.There is something just remarkable in the simplicity, pacing and plot of Ms. Dunn’s writing. Her prose is hardly florid, and she assiduously avoids standard gay romance or sports memes, which makes the story of these two young men much more authentic and original. She’s created two wonderful, empathetic characters, who balance each other like Yin and Yang. Trevor is the impetuous, moody one, who’s easily angered and just as easily depressed. Derek overthinks everything, never trusting his gut, and hence never quite believing that Trevor is being honest when he’s kind or flirty. But Trevor centers him, balances him, and just by being there, dissipates his fear and anxiety. Together, they are perfect, each complementing the other, each enhancing the other – almost as though they were destined to be together, though Ms. Dunn has too much class and subtlety to claim that.Perhaps that’s the best way of describing this book, “classy”. No cheap emotion here, no self-generated angst, just authentic emotions shown, not told, by an author with an incredible feel for prose. Descriptions are sparse, but vivid, and the action is heart-stopping – and that’s from someone who never really got into hockey. There is a rare, but evocative, use of sex scenes that are beautifully written to be, simultaneously, hot, moving and tasteful.It doesn’t matter whether you know hockey, love it, or despise it, Ms. Dunn makes it very real and powerfully compelling. It’s almost as though the hockey were a subtle metaphor for the reignited relationship between the two men.I can’t recommend Linemates, or its brilliant author, more highly or more fervently. This book is a must-read for anyone who loves well-written gay fiction.Although it ends happily, it doesn’t end “ever after”. I devoutly hope that means there will be a sequel or series to follow. Honestly, I just can’t wait. Ms. Dunn has just made it near the top of my “must buy” list. Put her on yours, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H7DPJWF7TH7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKHDFWA#wasThisHelpful","R1H7DPJWF7TH7S","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beneath the Stain almost defies description. I’ve been a sometime-fan of Ms. Lane’s work. Some of it I really like; some I could live without. But this book simply and plainly blew me away. In fact, when I realized I’d neglected to write a review when I’d first read the book, I took a quick look to refresh my memory, and broke my cardinal rule – I read it for a second time, cover to cover, word for word. I hate reruns, but this time I made an exception, and I’m oh so glad I did.After reading just the first few lines of the first paragraph, I was hooked anew and couldn’t stop until I’d gotten to the very last page of this long, brilliant, profoundly moving novel. Ms. Lane’s book really is long – almost 500 pages – but, to be perfectly honest, I’d be glad to read another five hundred. I didn’t want it to end.I’m not sure you can call Beneath the Stain a gay romance. There is gay romance in it, but it’s a book about much larger themes. It’s a book that delves deeply into bigoted small towns, supposedly Christian towns that are quick to judge anyone who’s not like everyone else, while hiding its own deep and dirty secrets. It’s about the stifling boredom and low expectations of small towns, content to let the world pass them by as they demolish the high expectations and hopes of their young people. It’s a book about the music industry, and the way it chews up young, promising talent with the lure of impossible riches, lubricated by a constant stream of booze and drugs.Beneath the Stain is a book about families – the families we are born into and the families we create, the people we love and those who stand by us, the ones who love us even when we’re ugly, impatient, unkind, hung over and ill.But above all else, Beneath the Stain is a book about love, learning to love and learning to be loved -  the latter often the more difficult of the two.There are two main characters and tracks throughout the book. Trav is a former military MP, battle-hardened and disciplined to a fault. He comes from a loving family, but spent years under Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, hiding who he is, walking away from any possibility of affection (or even lust), just to keep his secret. And his secret is not just that he’s gay, but that he’s almost fatally attracted to creative men, artists, men who live the passion of vision and emotion, pretty much the opposite of Travis, himself. The book opens on his breakup with his current boyfriend of several years, Terry. He comes home to find him shacking up with a younger man, oblivious to the fact that he’d just abandoned Terry for several weeks while he went off on an assignment, without even a call or text message. Trav can’t quite understand why Terry would be angry with him, or lonely enough to find solace in someone else’s arms. Everything in Trav’s life is black-and-white, and betrayal is betrayal, period.The other main character is Mackey (real name: McKay), a young, unbelievably precocious and brilliantly talented boy, a musician, a songwriter and performer of the type who only appear once a generation, if that. One of four brothers of a single mother and four different fathers, he organized his brothers and a close friend of theirs into a killer rock band at the age of 14. He trained the others, as musicians, arranged their covers, wrote their new material and drilled them mercilessly until they were first-rate, all without a clue as to how special he was. He’s always known he was different. Gay and too smart for his own good, he hid it all behind aggression and attitude. His bigger brothers often had to defend him, which they were glad to do, even though they knew very well that everyone who knows Mackey long enough wants to punch him in the head at some time, including themselves.What none of them know is that Mackey is not a virgin. From the age of 14, until he was forced to move on at 19, Grant, best friend of his oldest brother Kell (and lead guitar in the band) had been his lover. Furtive, stolen moments in parked cars or dark corners were all they were able share. Perhaps an hour or two on a blanket, at night, in a deserted park provided a few moments of touch, affection and some pale intimation of love, but left Mackey in despair of ever having a real life or relationship.  Grant and the music were the only things that kept Mackey alive. And the music was where he lived, where he went to be himself. The music was his heart and his soul, and he was the music. Only with a guitar in hand, a microphone in front of him, the young, insecure, lonely Mackey became a god – and more important, was truly happy.That all came crashing down when a record company executive caught a performance by their band, Outbreak Monkey, that had been arranged by Grant. A short time later, they gather to sign their very first record deal. It’s only then that they find out that Grant won’t be with them. His “girlfriend” is pregnant, and he’s succumbed to the family pressure to stay in Tyson and take on a “normal” life with wife, child, and his father’s car dealerships. Mackey is crushed. So crushed, in fact, that he never really gets over it. The only intimate love he’s ever known, snatched away from him, leaving him alone, vulnerable, surrounded by the secrets he has kept from his family and everyone else. Though his brothers will still protect him, even they don’t really know him. There is no one left who knows him. No one.A year with their aging, addicted manager builds the band into a huge success, with a top-selling album, a world tour and millions of fans. Most of that is accomplished on the back of Mackey’s prodigious output as a songwriter, band director, singer and performer. He’s only 5’ 6”, but he’s an incredibly powerful and sexy giant on stage, touching his audience in ways that few other performers can. Each song he sings becomes their song. His pain becomes their pain, his lost loves, their lost loves, his hopes and dreams, their own.How does a 20-year-old who’d never been out of the tiny town of Tyson cope with sudden international fame, huge amounts of money, running a band, writing the music, touring, performing as frontman, and dealing with everyone else’s problems? Xanax. Uppers, downers, cocaine all provided by the band’s well-meaning, but totally addicted manager. Yes, the old man really does have the band’s best interest at heart, but he’s killing its lead singer and songwriter, the energy behind Outbreak Monkey, the glue that holds it together.The manager dies, victim of his own medications. Mackey finds his body. The whole thing begins to fall apart. Mackey spends his nights wedged between his bed and the wall, beneath a mountain of bedding, the only place he ever feels safe enough to sleep. He still wakes up in the middle of the night and pens new songs and arrangements in his ever-present notebooks, and almost never sleeps through till morning. Then he drops from exhaustion, wakes up, pops some pills, picks up a stranger, brings him back to his room in a desperate attempt at human contact and medicates himself back into oblivion.Heath, the owner and founder of the record company, is a true mentor of musicians. He doesn’t run the label for the money (he has family money), but for the love of music and young musicians. He sees the band falling apart (he didn’t know quite how bad it had gotten) and calls in his closest Army buddy, Trav, to whip them back into shape and perhaps, even save their lives.Trav arrives at the band’s hotel and finds Mackey hidden in his pile of bedding between the bed and the wall, semi-conscious, unwashed (he hadn’t bathed in days), skinny as a rail (hadn’t eaten, either), suffering from malnutrition and drug addiction. He tosses him over his shoulder and carries Mackey into the shower where he bathes him like a baby, dresses him in clean clothes, grabs the rest of the band and lays down the law. Drugs are over. 24/7 partying is over. Exercise is in. It’s time to get real or lose it all, including, possibly, their lives. The drill master is on board, and everyone will shape up. Period. No questions asked.This auspicious meeting begins the core of the story – how Travis, the black-and-white-only, military man comes to understand and care for his young charges, respect their unlimited talent, commitment and energy, and fall in love with Mackey.But more important, this is the story of how Outbreak Monkey changes Trav and how he changes them. He is the rock, the foundation on which all the boys depend for their sustenance and survival. Through him, they have the first “father” any of them has ever known, a man who they can depend upon, who loves them unconditionally, who catches them when they fall. But this is also the story of how loving Mackey, the difficult, deep, extraordinarily talented and beautiful young man, changes Trav, makes him cherish family more, adds a million shades of gray to his core of black-and-white, and most important, opens up his heart to love and commitment, as never before.It is a beautiful journey, but not an easy one. It includes three bouts of rehab, reconciliation with the ones they loved who got left behind, and a million lessons on dealing with the pain and joy of life and love. Ms. Lane has populated this journey with exquisitely rendered people, even when they’re neither good nor nice. She brings the band back to Tyson to deal with tragedy, a tragedy that forces all the players to grow up, to deal with reality, to acknowledge their love and forgive old trespasses.And every moment of this is wrought with tears, pain, enlightenment and, sometimes, self-awareness.In the hands of a lesser author, Beneath the Stain would have been melodrama. The ups, the downs, the joys, the depression, the addictions, the successes, each one tugs at your heartstrings without even a shred of manipulation. What impressed me and moved me most, however, was Trav’s gut-level understanding of the relationship between Mackey and music. There are some real insights there. Mackey is the music, the music is Mackey. Where others see pictures and words, Mackey sees melodies and lyrics. It is his language,  the beat of his heart, the resonance of his soul made real and naked, for all the world to see.There is much, also, about what coming out really means – about the corrosive secrets and infernal loneliness that define the closet and destroy the soul – and the freedom to finally be yourself, to be truthful, to stop hiding, to come into the light, despite the dreadful religious bigots who wish you nothing but harm and destruction. Grant is destroyed. Mackey survives. Trav discovers what love really means, and the brothers find a new depth and a more open appreciation for each other and the bonds that keep them together and make them a great, successful  band, not to mention a strong, loving and unbreakable family.Beneath the Stain is a masterwork. The emotional moments (and there are many), might have been maudlin, but in Ms. Lane’s deft hands and with her undeniable sincerity, come across as authentic and powerful. You can’t read this book without being profoundly moved. The characters reach out and demand your empathy, which you gladly give as you begin to root for their triumphs against the terrible odds of damaging childhoods in a dreadful environment filled with hate and discrimination of all sorts. Ms. Lane forces you to invest your time, concern and compassion in these beautifully-written characters and it doesn’t stop until the very last words on the very last page.If you’re looking for a moving, exciting experience with some attractive, innocent, nave, but truly talented musicians - if you’re looking for a great read, top-flight prose, perfectly believable dialogue and a unique and special reading experience - if you’re looking for a truly beautiful book, you must not miss Beneath the Stain.It is nothing less than absolutely stunning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N3UYMH1QKOY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLBCS8G#wasThisHelpful","R3N3UYMH1QKOY2","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crash & Burn is the ninth and last installment of the iconic Cut & Run series. With this book, Ms. Roux ends the saga that started as a collaboration with her co-author, Madeleine Urban, and became a solo effort following book 4. We learn, in the author’s notes, that the original division of labor between the two authors was that one wrote Ty, the other wrote Zane. Starting with book five, Ms. Roux took on both and, I must say, the transition was pretty much seamless.For those who don’t already know, Ty and Zane are Federal Agents (FBI), both of whom are gay, though initially, deep in the closet. In the first book, Cut & Run, Zane is just coming off a profoundly disturbing and unsettling long-term undercover operation, posing as the lover of the head of the most notorious drug cartel operating in South Florida. Lots of people want him dead. Ty is the hand-picked right arm of Director Richard Burns, a close friend of Ty’s father - their friendship was forged in the crucible of Vietnam. Burns is virtually a father to Ty. I suppose the partnership between Ty and Zane was supposed to be the pairing of opposites. That turns out not to quite be the case, as we discover in Crash & Burn. Burns was not a good guy.That’s the beauty of this final book in the series: it turns out that not much was as it seemed throughout the first eight books, and all is finally revealed. The talented Ms. Roux handles this wrap-up with energy, aplomb and polish. I worried about how she would handle it, aware of the risk that this final book could devolve into a less-than-satisfying compilation of flashbacks, but she avoids that trap most adroitly. All the action in this book is action moving forwards, and the past is explained and illuminated only by what is happening now. Behind-the-scenes manipulations, unforgivable motivations and a callous disregard for human life (even of those you’re supposed to love) all rear their ugly heads as Crash & Burn races to its exciting climax.For many of us, Cut & Run was our introduction to a whole new world of possibilities in gay fiction. Defying all romance traditions, this whole series is an amazing epic consisting of national and international crime thrillers and deadly high-speed action. Good thrillers, I might add, with impressive villains, rogue agencies, drug cartels and players who, until this very last book, don’t reveal whether they’re heroes or villains. The fact that the men are gay? That’s a side issue. These books were not gay action thrillers, these were action thrillers that just happened to feature a powerful, smart and occasionally ruthless (when required) pair of gay men. They not only learn to get along, but to build a life together, share a love that ripens from the violent lust of their first encounters into the mature affection and passion of people who have been together for a long time and love and trust each other without reservation. As we journey from book-to-book, we get to know their histories, their families, their dreams (both individual and shared), their friends, their strong moral code and we get to watch them grow and develop as agents, men, and as a committed couple.I’m working really hard not to give away any spoilers in this review, but let’s just say Ty and Zane get to finally express their commitment to one another in a most surprising and moving scene set in the Baltimore Harbor. It’s a gem of writing, and the culmination of more than 8 years of adventure, danger, death and love.It almost goes without saying that Ms. Roux is an extraordinarily talented author. The characters she has created are so vivid and real, they jump off the page at the reader. More than once, I had an almost irresistible desire to duck to avoid a punch or bullet that seemed to come out of my Kindle, right at my face. I survived. So do Ty And Zane.Some long-time characters do not, however, in the final conflict between Ty and Zane, Ty’s former military team (The Sidewinders), the CIA, the NRI, the Cartel and even the Miami police. And some characters whom you will assume to be dead, miraculously end up in a hospital healing, slowly, but healing nonetheless.Aside from Abigail Roux, not many authors could have come up with the colorful Appalachian family that loves their son, Ty, unconditionally, including his grandfather, Chester, who, even at an advanced age, trounces evildoers with the garden shovel he keeps on his person at all times. He’s the crazy old coot who always speaks the truth, regardless of the consequences.Add to that a whole platoon of former Force Recon soldiers who served under Ty in some dangerous, secret operations in unnamed foreign countries, and who still function as a multi-talented, perfectly-trained and -tuned family of soldiers who protect each other at the risk of their own lives. These are men who come running to help, even when they haven’t been asked. They’re so cool, so complex and so powerful, that Ms. Roux has spun them off into their own series, the “Sidewinder” books. They’re back for the grand finale of Cut & Run.Despite all the macho posturing, marine loyalty, guns, bombs and physical conflict, Ms. Roux is also a great master at weaving moving moments of love and affection into the heart-stopping action. It is nothing less than beautiful to see the attraction that started out as fistfights between these two powerful, independent men, grown into an exquisite, uncomplicated and utterly unbreakable love. If it doesn’t move you, you may not have a heart.There are many ways that Ms. Roux could have ended this brilliant and path-blazing series. She could have just let the clock run out, killed one of the beloved characters off, or just phoned in one final thriller. Thankfully, she did none of those. Instead, she delivered a brand new, fresh, thriller leavened with a perfect balance of love, friendship and commitment that evokes thrills, fears, anger, disappointment, tears and even occasional laughter. She created a “perfect ending” by making the final book in this series one of its best.Thank you, Ms. Roux for eight years of wonderful reading, brilliant characters and a perfect ending.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BA0WVORA5VR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VDSTU7M#wasThisHelpful","R1BA0WVORA5VR4","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If it weren't for a few notable obstacles, I might have rated this book much higher. Others have noted that ""Silver & Black"" is similar to 50 Shades of Grey. I didn't think so. There was no third-rate BDSM, for which I will be eternally grateful.The main storyline is about a college student (Greyson Black) working as a Barista, and the man who steals his heart (Brian Silver - get it, Silver and Black?) - who just happens to be the billionaire CEO of the ersatz Starbucks-like chain for which the boy works. Greyson has trust issues due to the father who threw him out of his home when he found out he was gay, and the lover (Derrek, his father's drug buddy and a devoted pedophile) who introduces him to a twisted version of love and sex.To be honest, I liked the characters, I believed in them, and I was fascinated by their interaction. The book is long, but I like long books in which the characters develop over time. And there's a lot of meaningful development in both the boy and the billionaire.What I didn't like, and what cost Ms. May a couple of stars in my review, is the embarrassing editing. Bad editing is a ""thing"" for me, because anything that rips me out of the fantasy and flow of the story is a ""thing"" for me. I wouldn't say that the book was poorly edited. I don't believe it was edited at all. I know it's hard for a ""starving"" self-published author to pay for a professional editor. But there must be family members, friends, acquaintances, beta readers who would be more than glad to help out. But not even bothering to edit? That's an insult to the reader, and the kiss of death for a writing career.And I do think that Ms. May has a writing career in her future, but not until she finds an effective editor. It's hard to take back a book that ticked off its readers. It's harder still, to sell them another.What baffles me is why so many gay romance writers make the exact same errors. Either there is a great gap in our English education or there's only one editor for the whole industry and he/she is illiterate. For example:The constant confusion between ""you're"" and ""your"" virtually ensures that the two words are each used wrong, almost every time they appear. Plurals with apostrophes? Never! And the most baffling one of all, the ""missing words"", as in ""I'm going to store"" (missing ""the""), and all the incorrectly used ""little words"", such as ""I'm not the one who studied in dramatic arts"". No, no. no. You can ""study dramatic arts"", you can ""major in dramatic arts"" but you cannot ""study in dramatic arts"". The author constantly made similar errors: ""Will be paid from employer"" should, of course, be ""will be paid by employer"". Ms. May includes the actual language of an employment contract in the book. It is unreadable.Even worse, is the misuse of the words used to describe the business world. Silver mentions that one person ""worked in one of my chains"". There is only one chain, the person could work in one of its stores, or one of its franchises, but not in ""one of his chains"". Nor is one particular store the ""best performing store in the suburbs of New York"". You can tell no one involved in this book ever lived in New York. If they had, they'd know that Brooklyn is NOT a suburb of New York. It is one of the five boroughs (counties) that comprise New York City. The suburbs are on Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey, not Brooklyn. A little basic research might have helped. The cab driver pulled out onto New York Road. There is no such road. There's the Henry Hudson Parkway, the West Side Highway, the East River Drive (the FDR), the numbered streets, the lettered avenues, the named streets in lower Manhattan, but there is no New York Road. Next time, check with Google maps before publishing the name a road that doesn't exist. There's more than eight million people who would immediately catch this kind of error.But worst of all was a whole series of incomprehensible sentences:""He then made his own corporate owning: Silver Inc."" What the heck is a ""corporate owning""?""I have my saddlebag thrown over my shoulder"". What, did they just time-travel to the Old West? It was probably a backpack, maybe even a messenger bag, but having a saddlebag in Manhattan? Where's the horse?""I don't think my sister will take that excuse for appropriate tardiness"". Try ""I don't think my sister will take that as an appropriate excuse for tardiness"".""The decorations and flowers illuminate in the night"". Really? Do flowers glow in the dark? In any case, a reflection can ""illuminate the night"", but not ""in the night"". Illumination requires an object that is illuminated.And this sentence fragment, my favorite:""The plane was already started, and after the woman checked the doors one last time."" Yep, that's the whole sentence. And after.... she did what???I know I'm belaboring the point, and I don't really mean to do that. I'm expending so much time and energy on detail because of my frustration. I really liked this book. I would have loved it if I didn't have to struggle with the language, almost continuously, throughout the entire book. Talk about distractions.Please, Ms. May, you obviously have talent, next time, give us a completed book, not an annoying rough draft. I beg of you. Find a new publisher or demand a better editor. Feel free to contact me before you publish. I'll be glad to take a few hours to review your manuscript and give you at least a cursory edit. Anything would be an improvement over ""Silver & Black"".None of this is Ms. May's fault, by the way. She has a publisher and the publisher provided the editor. Unfortunately, the publisher provided a clearly incompetent editor. Ms. May deserves better.As much as I liked this story (and I really did), I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book. Hopefully, the next one will be a more polished and less frustrating reading experience.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIPT5IZPCS1BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U33M5HA#wasThisHelpful","RIPT5IZPCS1BO","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know it's unusual for me (I tend to be really wordy), but this review will be mercifully brief. Brief, because there is little I can add to all the other heartfelt five-star reviews.I shouldn't admit this, but every John Inman book is an automatic five-star review for me, ""Payback"" included. It's not his most creative or unique work to date, the characters are not all that unusual, the settings all are in upscale middle-class San Diego neighborhoods. But none of that matters. Once the words start to flow, I am transported to wherever Mr. Inman wants to take me. He is a true master. His writing is so evocative without being self-conscious, so powerful without being maudlin, his characters so vivid, without really trying.Most important is that whatever emotions he's decided to explore are so damned authentic, real, powerful and moving. When Tyler is angry, you are. When he's grieving, you fear your heart might break. And when he falls in love, you soar with hope and sigh with relief that, ultimately, all will be well. The connection between the characters and the reader is immediate and profound, something that only the very best authors manage to accomplish, and few who do it so effortlessly as Mr. Inman.""Payback"" is about unexpected violent death, grief, anger, vengeance and redemption. There were times when I feared I might not be able to finish the book, the emotion was so heartbreaking and real. But I'm so glad I soldiered on to witness the metamorphosis, the recovery, the joy of Tyler and Chris, the detective assigned to his case, who took an immediate interest (and perhaps more) the first time he saw Tyler being wheeled into the Emergency Room, near death. Some connection just happened. Not ""insta-love"", but some deep caring, empathy, some core understanding of the injustice of something to terrible happening to someone so young, who deserved only the best life had to offer. He made Tyler his mission, that very day, and with incredible patience, slid into his life and his heart.At the end, there is justice, and there is love. Perhaps even a tear or two as you smile at the two men demonstrating that life goes on, no matter what, which is exactly as it should be.There's no question, ""Payback"" is another remarkable, powerful book from John Inman. I've yet to find one of his that wasn't. Don't shy away from it because of the heavy themes and the tragedy that launches them - I promise you that all that horror and pain will be paid back in witnessing Tyler's journey back from the brink and into the next phase of his life. As Chris tells him, you will never love again as you did Spencer. But you will love differently, and that can be as special, wonderful and enduring as what you had with Spencer, in its own way.If I could give John Inman more than five stars, I would, without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OER9IXA55YT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SQOS41O#wasThisHelpful","R1OER9IXA55YT1","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit I was really disappointed. I liked the plot concept. I sort of liked the main character, Edward, although he must be the dumbest gay man to ever walk the planet. He's portrayed as a naif, a man whose only sexual experience was getting decked by his high school crush when his sadistic brother catches them in bed, and the closeted quarterback-boyfriend punches his face in as he claims Edward was raping him. His family calls him an abomination so, of course, Edward runs from North Carolina to L. A. to ""find himself"".The book opens with Edward in a gay bar. He gets himself in trouble, right off the bat, by telling the hot (but obnoxious) tattooed guy, Herbie, to get his hands off him, he'd just met him, and he's being too damned intimate for someone Edward just met. Not five minutes later, he's melting into an erotic kiss with Alex, the Hispanic young man he meets as he escapes Herbie. Of course, he actually knew Herbie longer than he knew Alex, but Edward has no problem burying his tongue down Alex's throat. A little inconsistent, no? Trust me, it doesn't get better.Meanwhile, Edward lives in an apartment with two roommates. They're both slobs (as this author so gracelessly comments ""well, I guess it's not true that every gay man is house proud""), but Kevin ignores him, while his snarky, nasty other roommate, Troy, actively insults him - that is, when he's not recovering from his regular drug overdoses.Edward goes home with Alex, for hot sex, fifteen minutes after meeting him. Talk about ""insta-lust""! Alex (short for Alejandro, which Alex seems to believe people have trouble remembering or pronouncing - he must know a lot of stupid people) is a PR person pushing and protecting some major stars. His best friend is one of the cinema's top actresses, one who married the man Alex loved... for convenience, of course. Beard falls in love with gay husband, lover is kicked out of the picture, but remains besties with the woman who stole his man.I hate to say it, but there is almost nothing in this book that is even passably believable, including the stilted and charmless dialogue, which sometimes reads like a Victorian melodrama and, at other times, like a convention of illiterates ""D'you want to go?"". Don't get me wrong, there is little technically wrong with the words and grammar. It just doesn't read like anything that any reasonably intelligent person would ever say, and especially not using the words the author supplied.There is an obligatory hospital thing with Edward badly injured after making two or three of the dumbest moves in the history of gay fiction, the redemption of the snarky roommate, Troy, who tries to save Edward from a fate worse than death, and a big, butch, hardened detective who immediately falls for Troy as he lies, swathed in bandages, in a hospital bed. In other words, unbelievable stupid characters taking part in every trite gay romance theme (even the closeted high-school quarterback) except for being packed off to a ""reparative therapy"" camp. Even worse, all this manufactured angst is telegraphed long in advance so that you know exactly what's coming, chapters before it appears on the page.Add some really awkward writing to all those patently incredible characterizations, dialogue and situations, and ""All I'll Ever Need"" is definitely a two-star review, at least for me.Obviously, other reviewers liked this book better than I did. So maybe it's just me. Perhaps we're not reading the same novel? I could barely get through this one - I had to force myself. Therefore, I do not recommend it. I only gave it two stars because the plot had promise - promise that was not fulfilled by ""All I'll Ever Need"".","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16OGZCFC7JL9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UN60O0W#wasThisHelpful","R16OGZCFC7JL9G","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There you go, another Alexa Land novel, the newest installment of her “Firsts and Forever” series. In fact, it’s not just the eighth book in the series, it’s eight in a row for Ms. Land – eight remarkable books, each of which is nothing less than amazing. That’s quite unusual. Often, writers experience a sophomore slump. And certainly, after seven wildly inventive and moving novels, it’s not unusual for the author and the series to just run out of steam. Not happening!I don’t know where Ms. Land gets the creativity, the resources, or energy from, but she seems to have a bottomless well of imagination, humor and love. Her characters are so vivid, they tug at the reader’s heartstrings and charm with their offbeat lives. You can’t help but get swept up in them, even when they’re uproariously absurd and totally unpredictable.And that’s where Ms. Land’s talent really lies: in her uncanny ability to wring both pathos and belly laughs out of any situation. There were more than a few times, when reading “Belonging”, that I found myself doubled over in laughter, with tears of both happiness and heartbreak running down my face.She also brings back many of the characters from the previous books into each new one, so the reader gets to catch up on the lives they’ve already invested so much time and affection in. It’s like meeting up with old friends while making new ones, and getting caught up in their triumphs and challenges. And surprisingly, Ms. Land has maintained, throughout the entire series, a consistent quality, pace and flow that never disappoints.All of the action revolves around an unlikely Deus-Ex-Machina, Nana Dombruso. The 80-year-old, gun-packing matriarch of a former Mafia family, she is the driving force behind some of the most outrageous moments in contemporary gay literature, and the surrogate mother to every alienated or lonely gay man in San Francisco. Wealthy as a legacy of the “family business”, she is also the producer and chef of a cable cooking show, which provides unlimited opportunities for things to go wrong, blow up, burn, fall and provoke all kinds of chaos – but always against the backdrop of hysterically funny, vaguely obscene double-entendre.“Belonging” is the story of Zan (Alexander), a wealthy, world-famous rock star who disappeared from the stage in the middle of a concert thirteen years ago, and Gianni, Nana’s grandson, a man sorely lacking in self-confidence or any noteworthy ability to choose an appropriate partner. Gianni is a lonely young man, hoping for the “one”, but not doing much about it, drifting through a life that he can’t seem to quite get a handle on.In the previous book in the “Firsts and Forever” series, Zan’s son, Christian, hired Gianni to care for his reclusive father. Zan hasn’t left his isolated house in years, so someone needs to do his shopping and take care of his property. Gianni, currently without direction or employment, and living at home with Nana, is happy to help out. He shows up two or three days a week to ensure the health, safety and groceries of the cranky older man (he’s 48). Zan will barely talk to him, and the beautiful, but feckless, Gianni is convinced that Zan hates him, and only tolerates his presence because, without him, he wouldn’t be able to survive.Things come to a head when Gianni hooks up with a famous movie and TV star he meets at a party, and agrees to move to New York as his kept boy-toy. Zan finds out that he’s about to lose Gianni, and all hell breaks loose. For the first time in thirteen years, Zan finally ventures from his house to go save Gianni from his own disastrous decision-making. In typical Alexa Land fashion, this entails a long, slow trip to the nearest town on a riding lawnmower, the only transportation on Alexander’s property that still runs after thirteen years of neglect.Well, this is a gay romance novel, so you’d be safe to assume that the two men “get together”. In an airport scene that will have you laughing and crying, Zan races to Gianni’s departure gate to save him from a fate worse than death, only to be surrounded by an aggressive, growing and adoring crowd of fans impeding his progress to rescue Gianni. Eventually, Gianni makes his way into Zan’s arms to the accompaniment of hundreds of smart phones photographing and video-recording the tender moment. Within hours, the resurrection of Zan (whom many thought dead) has more than a million hits on YouTube, and the paparazzi descend en masse.Welcome to Zan’s world, and why he rejected it, thirteen years ago. The entire Dombruso clan, plus Zan, all their friends, and the new “puppy” Nana recently acquitted (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Sasquatch except for the whole eating-feet thing) are virtually held hostage, in Nana’s house, by an out-of-control press (helicopters included), hundreds of paparazzi and a growing mob of fans.The rest of the book is dedicated to the growing love between the two men, dealing with their age difference, the overwhelming and relentless attention that Zan fears will ruin his beloved Gianni’s life, and a huge dose of humor that is typical Alexa Land and a delight to behold.Early in the book, Nana decides she wanted to shape the tall bushes that border her property. They were basically square. She wanted them round. So, in a fit of over-the-top topiary, the combination of tall, cylindrical bushes with smaller, round, ground-hugging ones produces a totally unanticipated visual that comes to be called “Cockhenge”.Shooting her cable show in her kitchen, the expected happens, and Tom Selleck (the Chewbacca dog) runs amok when trays of raw meat are placed on the counter, resulting in a veritable tornado of sausage and meatballs, again, with predictable (but hysterical) visual results – take one sausage together with two meat balls…Nana’s instructions in kneading dough are priceless: “Don’t be afraid to wrap your hand around it and really squeeze it. Now work it! Up and down, up and down.”One of the moments that, literally, had me rolling on the floor, was the attack of the paparazzi. Each question gets more and more absurd “it is true that you were just released from a Mexican prison?”, “Have you really been in rehab for thirteen years?”, “Is it true you’ve been running a goat farm in the middle of Idaho?” It is funny, but it’s also a stinging indictment of the press and its absurd obsession with the private lives of celebrities.Nobody can assemble a great read from slapstick, tenderness and insight like Alexa Land does. And she does it over and over again. I always look forward to her next book, knowing that I will have a great time reading it, be moved to laughter and tears, and be left wanting more.Alexa Land is one of the main reasons I read gay fiction. I can recommend every one of her books with absolute sincerity and heartfelt gratitude for the hours of reading pleasure she delivers, without fail, every time. Do yourself a favor, read “Belonging”. You won’t regret it, I promise you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EK6C6XMJ8HX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6LLIJI#wasThisHelpful","R3EK6C6XMJ8HX9","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without any doubt, Adrienne Wilder is one of the finest authors writing today. Count me a fan.No matter what her subject matter, she writes with a depth and subtlety that is literary, highly personal and powerfully evocative. She moves me in ways that few other authors do, and leaves me richer for having read her work. This book is a perfect example, even though its theme is difficult, daunting and a bit uncomfortable: autism. This is not a medical drama, a ""persecution of the handicapped"" book, nor a ""disability of the week"" novel. It is, in fact, a celebration of the remarkable talents and humanity that often lurk beneath the surface of mental challenges. And it poses some interesting and important questions.First among these is why we have such a marked propensity to dismiss people whose behaviors and thought processes are different from what we consider ""normal"" or appropriate - in other words, our own. We have an unfortunate tendency to treat those with all kinds of disabilities as, somehow, less than human. Their tics, or missing limbs, or twisted grimaces often make us forget that there is a thinking, feeling human being inhabiting those twisted, sometimes out-of-control bodies. I know this for a fact, so Ms. Wilder's premise hit me right between the eyes the moment I realized where she was going with ""In The Absence of Light"". My beloved mother, one of the smartest, most aware human beings it's ever been my pleasure to know (even if she were not my mother), suffered a devastating stroke some years back. I stood in her hospital room a day after her stroke while my family and my mother's supposedly brilliant neurosurgeon discussed her future prospects right in front of her, as though she weren't there. I was infuriated, and I shouted (quite embarrassingly) at them to stop! I reminded them, in no uncertain terms: ""You know, Lottie is in there. She hasn't lost her hearing or her mind, and yet you exclude her as if she were a piece of furniture or the family dog. How dare you?"" A couple of years later, after I'd nursed her back from the effects of her stroke and she returned to independent living, she took me aside and thanked me. She told me how much she loved me, but never so much as when I stood up for her in that hospital room. She described how she felt so incredibly helpless, with all those people talking about her as though she were already dead, and that she was so happy and proud that I'd made them stop and insisted that she be the one to make the decisions about her own health and future. It's what gave her hope to go on. And she did, indeed.Lottie is no longer with us, but I have worked with other handicapped and ""mentally challenged"" people, over the years, and came to the depressing realization that most people treat people unlike themselves as though they were less than human, as though their hopes and souls were somehow less than their own. On another level, it's exactly what we see today in the homophobes who are out to deny and destroy same-sex families. Gay people are different, and therefore don't deserve the respect, admiration and human rights we reserve for ""people like us"". It's all cut from the same cloth. Perhaps I'm projecting, but I strongly doubt that it's an unintended metaphor - Ms. Wilder is just too accomplished and perceptive an author to have stumbled blindly into the parallels.Her treatment of the autistic main character is so deep and empathetic that I wouldn't be surprised if Ms. Wilder has had a similar experience with someone close to her. Not only does she really ""get"" this, she expresses it with humor, beauty and love. This is not the first time she's broached a similar subject. It's a major plot point in her stunning trilogy ""My Brother's Keeper"" and even her more recent ""Complementary Colors"". Her ""special"" people all have remarkable talents, deep souls, artistic abilities, and insights beyond what ""normal"" people possess. In ""In The Absence of Light"", Morgan, who is a high-functioning autistic, hears the light, the same way that most of the rest of us hear music. It speaks to him. And, because light travels at well... the speed of light, it sometimes reveals events that have not yet happened, and words and feelings not yet expressed by those he cares about.Don't worry. This is not a paranormal thriller, just a novel about about a remarkably talented, beautiful and loving young man who is seen by the world as ""less"", but who is, in fact, much much more. Grant is the young man who brings the light out of Morgan and cherishes it. He's a few years older than Morgan and, at first, feels guilty as hell for his immediate sexual attraction to this beautiful, yet different, young man. He's terrified that he's taking advantage of someone who is too  innocent, vulnerable and damaged to consent. Morgan, with his wonderful, sarcastic humor, and his voracious appetite for sex, disabuses Grant of that notion in no time flat.Grant has come to this one-horse-town to escape Chicago, where he fears his welcome has worn thin - and, apparently, it has. He's made tons of money as a ""shipping agent"" who doesn't ask questions about the provenance of the goods, art, antiques and exotic cars he arranges to have shipped around the world for his wealthy clients. He's not a criminal (officially), but the FBI is desperate to get their hands on his client records so that they can use him to get at his clients. In order to accomplish that, they set him up with an undercover agent, who spends three years in Grant's life and bed, until Grant discovers that his ""beloved"" is, in fact, just an FBI agent out to entrap him. His heart broken, his ability to trust destroyed, he ""retires"" at the age of 32 and moves to the small rural town where Morgan lives. Fortunately, the FBI has been unable to pin anything on him, as his records and taxes are absolutely pristine. There's not even enough evidence to subpoena his records or search his properties. He knows he has to lay low for a couple of years before he can move on to a tropical island, where he can live a life of peace, safety and luxury because of the fat offshore bank accounts in which he has hidden most of his profits from his relatively long and successful career.Want to make God laugh? Make a plan. The monkey wrench in this particular plan is the wonderful Morgan, who steals Grant's heart and soul within just a few days, perhaps even upon first sight. One of the most beautiful recurring themes of this beautiful book is how much Grant learns about himself, the world and its possibilities, from Morgan, despite what others see as his ""handicap"". This is a true two-way street, in which each man brings to the table exactly what the other needs. It was almost fated.It's not all as romantic as I make it sound. Ms. Wilder is a genius at maintaining a believable balance. The stunning love between these two men, a love neither expected, is just part of a much larger plot involving corrupt FBI agents, big-time killers, and a relative of Morgan's who fears that he is out to steal his business and loot his bank accounts. There is even a hellacious shoot-out in a church in Chicago, not to mention some of the hottest sex scenes I've read in years.But dominating everything else is the brilliant writing of author, Adrienne Wilder. She is just so gifted, so fluent in the written word, that every location jumps vividly to mind, dialogue is so subtly handled as to not only be absolutely believable, but uses ""voices"" so unique that you can recognize who's speaking just from the cadence of each character's words.Beautiful, evocative, moving, brilliant. I don't have enough superlatives to express what a wonderful experience it is to read an Adrienne Wilder novel, and ""In The Absence of Light"" is certainly no exception. If you love great writing, empathetic characters, plots that grab your mind and heart from the very first page, you owe it to yourself to get this book and read it. You won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7EO7BY44FFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7MU406#wasThisHelpful","R1V7EO7BY44FFB","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Light From The Dark"" is a book that should have been better, and might have been, with a competent editor. This is a compelling, creative story with engaging characters and a lot of hot (and sometimes long) sex scenes.It's a love story between the hideously damaged Kit (Christopher) Auberon and the equally damaged Micah Beasley (AKA ""Beastly""). Micah is hired to be head of security for the mysterious, agoraphobic, but gorgeous Kit, the final heir to a huge family fortune. His parents were murdered right before his eyes, when he was only  eight, his house set on fire and Kit, himself, kidnapped. He has not spoken a word since that day, and has been locked away in his palatial (but terribly lonely) estate out in the middle of nowhere. He's also a genius, the secret power behind creating some of the most popular video games of his time. ""Beastly"" suffers from PTSD, and has spent the last year hiding out from family, friends and work in a tiny apartment on the beach. He's hiding out because his last mission as a U. S. Marshal ended up with the death of his partner, the young girl he was protecting, and the girl's mother - who was actually the murderer. To hush up their incredible incompetence, the Marshals Service gave him a fat check to keep him quiet and cleared his name. Once over his injuries (his face is terribly scarred on one side), Beastly drops out of life. That is, until a summons comes for an interview as the head of security for Chris (Kit), who has been receiving repeated threats to his life, not to mention the break-ins that baffle everyone, since it appears that the perimeter security was always turned off, and the attack dogs locked down. Some security.Reluctantly, Beasley takes on the assignment, after quoting a huge fee that he thought might get him out of what he considered a high-paid babysitting job. At first, Beasley and Kit are like oil and water. But, of course, this is a romance novel, so the inevitable happens, they fall in love. It's particularly intriguing since Kit had never had sex, couldn't have an erection, appeared to be asexual and uninterested. Beasley, on the other hand was intrigued with, and attracted to, the brilliant, gorgeous young guy with the pure-white hair.The plot of ""Light From The Dark"" is dramatic as can be. There are break-ins, lost memories, distant family members appearing out of the woodwork, as that night, eighteen years ago, comes back to haunt everyone and immerse the estate and its inhabitants in an endless miasma of terror and violence.Unfortunately, there are also some pretty big plot holes. Beasley is supposed to be a highly-trained military and law-enforcement veteran. Yet he doesn't even investigate why the perimeter alarms aren't working and the dogs never seem to be around when needed. When Kit identifies an armed stalker through his sanctuary's bullet-proof windows, Beasley runs to check out the intruder, unarmed and unprepared. At the crucial climax of the story, he races out to rescue the once-again-kidnapped, hapless Kit, gun-in hand, but gets so distracted thinking about Kit that he (get this) forgets to fire it. Twice. Some bodyguard. The guy he's guarding has to rescue him!And, although the book is basically really well-written and the dialogue believable (and sometimes even charming), it is so poorly edited as to leave me scratching my head, wondering if either the author or editor (if there was one) is actually dyslexic. There are pages in this book that read like a Junior High School essay, in which grammar and spelling errors abound. There are other places in the book, in which the author seems to forget who the characters are. ""Beastly"" is the nickname Kit comes up with for Micah. So it's perfectly normal for his dialogue to refer to him using that name. It is not quite normal for the author to forget and use it herself, as in ""This is not good, Beastly thought"". I also suspect that whoever edited this book had a missing hyphen key on his or her keyboard. There's not a single hyphen in the entire book, so the reader is treated to a bizarre take on compound adjectives and nouns, some missing a dash, others single words, incorrectly broken up into two: ""other worldly"", ""sound proofed"", ""live in maid"", ""button down shirt"", ""data bases"", ""by passed"". These were legion throughout the book. Even more dismaying is the abuse done to ""little words"", like ""to"" or ""of"": ""rested his forehead to Micah's"" (on Micah's), ""Was I supposed too?"", ""on a data base"" (in a database), ""if they didn't have too"", ""point me in the right place"" (to the right place). There was a constant misuse of words: ""courser beard"", ""a very interesting fete"" (feat or fate), ""I'm ass hurt over it too"".  Those types of errors were endemic, as were the usual misuse of apostrophes and verb tenses.Some sentences were so messed up the result was an unintelligible mangling of the English language: ""There were no words were in the mix of hoarse grunts"" and ""That's date asking like a boss, Chris.""And one last gripe - it's important for writers to get at least their geography right. As the two men stand on the West Side of Manhattan, and gaze at New Jersey, Kit asks ""what's beyond that"". Micah answers ""France, England, Italy..."". Umm, what's beyond New Jersey is Ohio, Indiana and the Midwest. Turn around boys, you're facing the wrong direction!Enough. I know I have a tendency to be particularly critical about badly-edited self-published books. But this accomplished author owes  her readers an apology and a fully-edited re-release. I hate being ripped from an engaging story by obvious and annoying errors that should have been caught. And I hate being insulted with the cavalier attitude toward me, as a reader, who, unwittingly, pays money to read an unedited rough draft.I'm often alone in my complaints about bad editing. In this case, there are quite a few other readers who apparently agree with me that this book was unforgivably edited and made it abundantly clear in their reviews.If you don't mind tripping over the language, I recommend this book, enthusiastically to you. The plot and characters were unforgettable, the growing love between them beautiful to behold. It's a long book, but it covers a lot of territory and moves along with speed and excitement. Were it not for the editing, I might have given ""Light From The Dark"" four or five stars, but Ms. Celeste is an accomplished and successful author, from whom I expect more.If this book is re-edited and re-released, I will be happy to reconsider my rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLHBWUEP07H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBV1LT2#wasThisHelpful","RLHBWUEP07H5","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The River Leith"" is a perfectly lovely book. The title is a play on the Greek myth of the River Lethe, the ""river of forgetfulness"", the river that takes away the memories of their lifetimes from the dead as they move on. And it's an appropriate name. Leith was a promising young boxer, on his way to the New York State Boxing Championship, until an illegal blow from his opponent sent him, instead, to the ICU with brain damage. His critical faculties remained intact, but his memory not so much. He has completely lost the last three years of his life. It's called Retrograde Amnesia and robbed him of the knowledge of his father's death, his friends, his career aspirations, and the man he loved more than life. In fact, when asked during his intake exam, he informed his doctors that he's 100% heterosexual.A questionable decision by his doctors and friends comes back to haunt both Leith and his lover, Zach. The wisdom of the day was that, since Leith has lost all memory of Zach, they would wait to tell him that the two were a committed couple until he might be able to handle it better. When he finally does ""meet"" Zach (Zach had been by his side during the worst of it, but not in the early stages of recovery), he doesn't remember him at all. For Leith, he's meeting someone for the first time. He can't quite understand why he constantly wants to touch Zach, why he checks out his butt every time he bends over, why Zach's presence brings him the first and only peace and joy he's known since his brain was damaged.Ms. Blake spends a lot of the book walking the reader through the recovery process. Perhaps ""recovery"" is not a good word, as he will never regain his memory. However, he needs to learn how to deal with other people, how to deal with the great gaps in his history and knowledge, and how to control the violence that rears its ugly head as Leith deals with the frustration of ""knowing he should know"" things and people he cannot remember. Most important, Zach and Leith have to fall in love again - from scratch.Zach is, of course, devastated that his lover doesn't even recognize him. Yet there is something growing between the two men - as though the brain has forgotten Leith's lover, but not his love. All he knows is that Zach and only Zach can put a smile on his face, bring joy to his heart, and he misses him terribly when he's not around. He's about to leave the hospital and he'll have to deal with the real world, the people, places and events he's forgotten, and plot out a new future for himself - or better, one for himself and Zach.Ms. Blake does a wonderful job plumbing the psychology of victims of brain damage, thinking about the big picture, the known and unknowable universe, and the very nature of love. It's wonderful to read, to experience vicariously, and her writing is more than up to the task. She has Leith's hospital psychiatrist wax philosophical and metaphorical, which gives Ms. Blake the opportunity to show how beautifully creative her thinking and writing are. In offering Zach a different way of looking as his missing years:""Not lost, but found. In wonder.""These words are one of the best descriptions of love I've read in a very long time:""...the crazy feeling that overwhelmed him - the thing that was like happiness and comfort and want and need and God-so-good all in one - made them both feel whole again.I originally intended to give ""The River Leith"" only four stars. Yes, I loved it, but it didn't initially strike me as a very important or exceptional addition to the M/M genre, just a good book. When I went back to the two lines I quoted above, I changed my rating to five stars for the engaging characters, the realistic and charming dialogue,  the unique concept, the depth of Ms. Blake's understanding of the brain, but most of all, for the sheer beauty of her writing. She ""gets"" love, and ""gets"" it both deeply and movingly. Which leaves ""The River Leith"" not just a good book, but a beautiful one.My highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13K8MM1Y6FK26/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCR6LXQ#wasThisHelpful","R13K8MM1Y6FK26","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I see that more than one reviewer is convinced that J. D. Robb (AKA Nora Roberts) did not write this book. I disagree.""Concealed in Death"" is a departure from many of the books that preceded it in the ""In Death"" series. It doesn't dwell as much on the future, its technology, fashions and culture, and it doesn't have the biting edge that characterized everything about Eve Dallas since she first appeared on the scene, so many years ago.But, as far as I can see, that's not about a different writer, it's a brilliant and subtle nod to the growth in the estimable Lieutenant. This story is not about her abhorrent childhood, and all the adults (including Homeland Security) who enabled her horrible abuse, or covered it up, allowing it to continue (shades of the Catholic Church). But her childhood informs everything she does, just not so obviously. When twelve bodies of young (12-14 years of age) street girls are discovered behind a fake wall in what used to be a sanctuary for homeless kids, she dives right in, bringing her own experiences to bear, understanding these kids (and the survivors) in ways that no other policeman or policewoman could. It helps her build a scenario in her head, a story so dreadful that it's almost too much to bear.Instead of her nightmares being flashbacks to her childhood, they are now dreams of the victims talking to each other and to her, bringing insight and understanding rather than terror.Eve is growing into her own skin. Still prickly, she has softened around the edges, finally moved by the beauty of what she sees around her, and the spectacular life she is only now beginning to understand and cherish. And Ms. Roberts has outdone herself. She is, of course, a brilliant writer, and this new direction for Eve Dallas allows her the freedom to weave exquisite emotion into events and words that once might have been exciting, but not moving like they are in ""Concealed In Death"".  She moved me to tears more than once. Her incredible respect, no love, for Mavis and Leonardo and Mira and Dennis fills her heart, and the reader's. One of the best lines about love I've ever read was in this book:""Those eyes, those wild blue eyes met hers. He didn't have to say a thing to say everything""Dallas has gotten beyond her surprising discovery that she was worthy of love, and that love is a wonderful thing. She has learned to accept it, and revel in it. The byplay between her and her husband, Roark is peppered with ""he understands"" and ""he gets me"", the acknowledgement of two souls deeply entangled, all flaws exposed, all things open and vulnerable and the sheer luck (or fate) that has put her with someone whom she knows loves her, without having to hear the words. Just think of it, she even likes Christmas now.This is where Eve Dallas needed to grow to. And, though the cases and the culprits may be a little less vicious (and less cartoonish), her relationships with others, including her victims, are deeper, more knowing, and more compassionate. It's a wonderful thing to see. Ms. Robb has done well.I commend her, just as I recommend this book without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRLXYYYQOOVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGZKJ9I#wasThisHelpful","R1QRLXYYYQOOVN","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just loved this book. J. D. Robb has kept up the quality that made her (AKA Nora. Roberts) and Eve Dallas icons of the police procedural genre.I've read every book in this series except the last few, and decided it was time to catch up. I guess it's been a couple of years since I spent an Afternoon with Eve Dallas, the prickly and wonderful super-detective (she who stands for the dead) and her fabulous, gorgeous ,billionaire husband, Roark. ""Celebrity In Death"" was just like coming home, or like slipping into an old comfortable pair of shoes. Not that there isn't angst, galore, murder and mayhem in abundance, but it's got a lot less of Dallas' personal back-story than the last few I've read. It seems that Eve is finally learning to cope with her past, with the horrors that turned an abused 8-year-old into the estimable Lt. Eve Dallas of the NYPSD. This allows Ms. Robb to concentrate more on the victims and suspects than on Eve's internal struggles.And Ms. Robb does that, here, in spades. There are more red herrings, more suspects, more motives, faked alibis, and both evil and innocent victims than in most of the previous books in this series. I sorta knew who was likely to be the killer early on, but there was just enough misdirection and red-herrings to never be entirely sure until the light bulb flicks on over Eve's head. The motive was not what one might expect, for it turns out that one of her suspects is, in reality, a serial killer who has been getting away with murder for years.I also like that ""Celebrity In Death"" is about celebrities. It gives Ms. Robb the opportunity to paint much more vivid and plentiful suspects than she normally does - and all of it related back to a movie about Eve and her partner, Peabody, which sort of makes it a ""play within a play"", a set of nested Faberge eggs, with an unusual and ironic depth to the plot that has existed in no other Eve Dallas book.This review is a bit late (by about three years) to be meaningful to many people, but I just enjoyed this book and Ms. Robb's masterful writing so much, that I wanted to share it with others. You might say I was ""compelled"" to write this review by a book that both fascinated and moved me.I'm off to read another one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDDBHZHH2NCAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GSZIZS#wasThisHelpful","RDDBHZHH2NCAQ","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate being the first reviewer of a book. I intensely dislike the idea that I may influence potential readers of an author who may end up being an important one, an author with a great deal to say.And I particularly dislike doing that when my review will not be remotely positive, and the price (free on Kindle Unlimited) is a real bargain. It's like looking a gift horse in the mouth.I gave this book two stars because I loved the premise, the imaginative idea of a young gallery owner, son of a controlling rich man (who financed him), finally deciding to break the shackles that have turned him sour on the whole art thing. You've heard of ""mama's boys"", well this man has a serious, almost pathological, daddy fixation, down to wearing a suit and tie to breakfast to show him respect. All this despite the fact that the old man has never shown him a bit of affection, and insists he is always right, even when he's terribly wrong. There is no discussion with the old bastard, you just nod and smile as he lectures you.The other reason I'm not comfortable writing this review is that I didn't finish the book. I couldn't, I just couldn't. The author, Lucas Price, desperately needs an editor. It reads not like a beta pre-release, but like an early rough draft that even the author, himself, never bothered to read all the way through. Every page, perhaps even every paragraph, has annoyingly huge and obvious grammatical errors. It made it impossible for me to continue reading when my anger at the insult of an author publishing a bad rough draft finally overcame my interest in both characters and plot.Yes, it's really that bad. First of all, why do so many self-published authors insist on putting apostrophes in plurals? Didn't they teach, in Junior High School, that plurals NEVER take apostrophes? They did in mine.Yet this author blithely writes such stuff as""taking snapshots with their phone's."" (Odd, no apostrophe in ""snapshots"". Must be something special about the word ""phone"", I guess?)He continually uses the wrong pronouns. That's common among a lot of gay fiction writers who don't seem to understand that there are special pronouns designed for use specifically when referencing human beings: ""who"" and ""whom"". ""That"" and ""which"" do NOT apply to humans, only inanimate things. You don't say ""He is the kind of person that..."", you say ""He is the kind of person who..."" But this goes way beyond that, with regular use of inappropriate pronouns.This is one my true favorites:""But,"" his Father said, pointing his finger, ""this may backfire. And if you do..."" (What, is his son about to backfire? It's the plan that's about to backfire, in which case it should read ""And if it does..."").""A woman of your age should be deciding what their future is going to be"". (Did his daughter clone herself? How did it become ""their"" future. It should read ""what her future is going to be"". Amateur error.)""I thought it would be different than the reality"" (Should read ""from the reality"")Though there is little metaphor or simile in what I did manage to read, the little there was left me scratching my head:""If this was an office, showing up ten minutes late would get you a disciplinary hearing."" ( First of all, ""was"" should be ""were"", it's conditional. But the inappropriateness is built into the simile - do offices have disciplinary hearings? I know that corrupt politicians and police do, as does the military, but I've never before heard of a business office with disciplinary hearings, as though they had tribunals with three wise old judges sitting up on a platform, behind a broad wooden bench.)Or this sentence so riddled with errors that it's virtually incomprehensible:""And I'm also point out that you haven't liked anyone since him"" (""I'm also point out that..."" What language is this?)This use of entirely the wrong word actually made me laugh out loud:""My father made it very plain that he pulls the purse strings here, even though I supposedly have anatomy..."" (""Anatomy""? Everyone has anatomy. What he didn't have was ""autonomy"". Talk about bad editing!)One last one, one of the more embarrassing sentences I encountered in ""Mixing Colors"":""Don't you get tired of putting on showing for all the artists you Father tells you to..."" (Where do I start? ""showing"" should read ""exhibits"" - a word someone writing about an art gallery should be familiar with, but Mr. Price apparently is not. ""you Father"" should read ""your father"". Honestly, I don't have the patience or time to decode the intent of more than half the sentences in this book! I read for pleasure.)I won't belabor the point (though I probably already have). All the errors I quoted above were the highlights of just three pages. There were plenty more on those few pages and innumerable others on the pages I managed to get through. I shudder to imagine slogging through a whole book like this. I'm embarrassed for the author. Please, please, do not release unedited books. It makes you look incompetent, not to mention illiterate. It also shows disrespect for your readers and their investment of both money and time in your work. If you can't afford an editor, find a sister-in-law to check it out for you, or offer it free as a ""beta"" for readers to edit. Just do something. Anything.I hate being a stick-in-the-mud. You may have real talent (you certainly have great imagination), but the writing, editing, stilted and awkward dialogue, the almost total lack of description and the barely believable relationships prevent me from taking your writing seriously.If Mr. Price re-releases an edited version, I'll be more than happy to read it, and upgrade my review. Until that time, I strongly suggest that, unless you don't care about reading a book that mangles the English language, you avoid ""Mixing Colors"" at all costs.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SEL0H8WMERRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFNRK60#wasThisHelpful","R3SEL0H8WMERRA","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that ""Guarding January"" was, in places, a bit too slow for me. In fact, the whole book was a little more internalized than I might have preferred.It's the story of two men: ""Lord January"" (LJ), a rock star, whose real name is Jeff Smart  - though he's somehow lost track of that person beneath the image of the very public rock star; and Rye, who is not a man, he's a mountain, a gorgeous mountain, of course, hired to be LJ's babysitter/bodyguard. LJ has spent the last ten months in rehab after he almost died (twice) from a combination of too many drugs, too little food, and burning the candle at both ends. No, he's not your typical live fast/die young rock star, he just can't summon the energy and concentration needed to don his vampire alter-ego any more without chemical assistance. Rye's job is to keep Jeff off drugs and alive through rehearsals and a 30-week national tour.To cut to the chase, the two men, of course, fall in love. But in spite of that, Rye's main job is not keeping Jeff alive (though there are occasional threats), but keeping him from being consumed by his stage character, ""Lord January"".There are a few potential (and actual) catastrophes to deal with along the way, including an incident at a performance that injures many people, and fans so crazy they rip LJ's hair out of his head in great patches, as souvenirs, right in the middle of the disaster. These aren't fans, they're sociopaths. And then there is the death of a band member which, despite its tragedy, may actually free Jeff up to have a life.My problem with this book is that there are few dramatic moments, and much of the rest is the weeks Rye spends trying to get Jeff to eat, leave the house, or (even rarer) smile. There is something terribly repetitive in Jeff's depression. The phrases that repeat, endlessly, throughout the book are ""I'm tired"" and ""I'm not hungry"". Therein lies the issue. How to have your main character endlessly exhausted, uninterested in life, food or anything except Rye (barely even interested in his music any more), without exhausting and boring the reader?Sadly, though the book was well-written and beautifully edited, I can't seem to escape the feeling that the author never found a solution to that issue - I was bored, at times annoyed at the endless repetition of the same internal angst, with little change or improvement until the very end of the book. There's little that explains why Jeff was so neurotic, and precious little background on Rye. There was interminable exhaustion, without introspection, peppered with bouts of very detailed sex.It must have been the pacing, but I had a hard time empathizing with either main character, and was left with the feeling that ""Guarding January"" would have made a better short story than full-length book.I'm sure others will view this book differently. Perhaps it was just not the kind of theme I expected. I'm a big fan of gay rock star fiction, but not such a big fan of morose characters wallowing throughout most of a book. I like the excitement, the intensity of the music and the performances, the reaching for success and recognition. This book didn't have much of those things. But if slowly recovering from low-key depression is something that presses your buttons, you might enjoy this novel a lot more than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KA144CNAOW3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXXJLRS#wasThisHelpful","R2KA144CNAOW3J","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish I liked Unexpected Dreams more. I liked it enough to empathize with the characters, though there were times I wanted to strangle the main character, Greg.Greg is a 45-year-old man whose divorce from his wife of twenty years is about to become final. They have three grown kids together, but Elizabeth recently decided she needed ""more"" and walked out of their marriage, leaving Greg adrift and second-guessing his life and his choices. Into this vacuum is dropped a gorgeous 38-year-old soccer star with perfect abs, an incredibly hot body, and a smile to die for. And that's just what Greg does.After forty-five years as a skirt-chaser, faithful husband to his wife, proud father of his bright and self-sufficient kids and partner in a very successful financial management firm he founded with his friend, Aaron, he suddenly realizes he's gay. As an active supporter of Prop 8 (the anti-gay-marriage amendment) and raised a rabid Catholic taught to hate anyone or anything gay, he can't quite believe what's happening to him. But, as the days go on, he becomes more and more enamored of Tanner, the soccer star, and realizes he can't even get it up for women any more. Talk about a mid-life crisis!I must admit that it strikes me as not quite realistic. The author even has Greg say ""How does a man get to forty-five years old and suddenly have those feelings? Preposterous!""I agree, it is. No checking out boys in the locker room. No looking at males while watching straight porn. Not even a ""gay for you"" thing with Tanner (he can't get aroused by ANY women, any more). He is either the most un-self-aware man who ever lived, or he's been fooling himself. The author suggests that he had completely suppressed his real attractions because of his parents' endless condemnations of gay people and the death of a schoolmate from a gay-bashing when he came out. Maybe. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. But still, this is all rather sudden and not all that credible. After all, he had no problem sleeping with his wife for twenty years, or fathering three kids. It reminds me of those movies where a misogynist suddenly wakes up in a female body, forced to learn a lesson the hard way. There's no subtlety here.Once you get beyond the big reveal, most of the rest of the book is a rather long coming-out process punctuated with extremely detailed and lengthy sex scenes. Ultimately he does ""sort of"" come out, sharing his love of Tanner with his closest friends and family, but still skittish in public. Most of it goes well except for his parents, who tearfully, and with much religious recrimination, wash their hands of their son. He's well done with them. Their loss.Unexpected Dreams is reasonably well-written, but in absolutely desperate need of a competent editor. The editing is so bad, in places, that I wasn't sure I'd be willing to finish reading it. I understand that most independent authors can barely afford a decent editor, but why not put it out as a ""beta"" to friends, family, and respected reviewers on Amazon? I sure do hate paying for a rough draft. And this one was sometimes pretty rough.The author has a major hyphenation problem, adding them where they don't belong (""gay-dar"", ""pre-mature""and ""blow-hard"") and omitting them when needed, or even breaking a single word up into two (""afore mentioned"", ""high end"", ""pressure treated"". ""clear headed"" ""gay friendly"" and ""every day""). There were dozens of similar errors throughout the book.She also seems to have an aversion to ""who"" and ""whom"" and refers to people, unfailingly, as ""that"": ""using the nickname I'd given the guy that decked Tanner"" (who decked Tanner), ""The man that smiled at her"" (the man who smiled at her), ""the guy in the red tank top that was working the squat machine"" (the guy in the red tank top who was working [on] the squat machine) and ""the men that made love"" (the men who made love).There is also an annoying and recurring use of inappropriate words: ""the soccer team for Toledo"" (in Toledo or the Toledo soccer team),  ""St. Thomas The Aquinas"" (there is no ""The"" between first and last names - in fact, his name was Thomas of Aquino), ""in preparation of"" (in preparation for) and ""his enthusiasm of the game"" (for the game).Sometimes, the wrong word or phrase was used that left me scratching my head, or reversed the intended meaning: ""I could only get medium hard. I could get an erection"" (medium-hard and couldn't get an erection), ""voted in favor of Prop 8 every time it hit the ballot"" (that would be exactly once!) and ""dually noted"" (what, noted twice? Duly noted!).There were other sentences, even entire paragraphs that were just awkward or unintelligible:""Julie, the goalie's girlfriend, and a couple of guys I couldn't remember their names."" (a couple of guys whose names I couldn't remember).""Maybe it was that I'd officially divorced for pretty much the entire summer"" (What, a divorce every day throughout the summer? Perhaps ""been officially divorced""?)""The two met when her father was divorced..."" (unfortunately, there's no conceivable ""her"" in this paragraph).""We play again Wednesday, then following Saturday"" (the following Saturday).I know I'm beating a dead horse (and I apologize for going on and on), but I want other readers who are ""sensitive"" to bad editing to be aware of some of what you have to slog through to get to the character development, plot points and the happily-ever-after. This won't bother some people, but it does, indeed, bother me. Each error pops me out of the story and back into Junior High School English.That's not to say this book is bad. It isn't. It has its issues, but I did end up engaged with the characters, many of whom will be back for the next book in this series, as the author promises at the end of this one. It didn't move me to tears, but I was intrigued, and am still interested in where all these intersecting lives end up. I will definitely take a look at the next book, but I will be more careful to assure that the editing has improved or I'll move along to something else. I hope Ms. Peterson finds a good editor, in the interim, because she certainly is a promising writer. I wish her all the best.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXFUN3FNG4ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PMC2LV2#wasThisHelpful","R1IXFUN3FNG4ZW","A3O2UZACDPCGZ5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O2UZACDPCGZ5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Joshua's mother, Miriam, was forced into taking over decision making for the family after her husband, Abraham, was hurt in an accident​.  This was totally out of character for a woman who was Plain.Joshua endured his father's abuse just because that was the right thing to do when you were Plain.  He completely feared his father, but had no recourse but to run away to avoid more abuse since he knew his father would blame him for the accident.Joshua ran away to California and had to deal with and live with the English.  Joshua found some good English as well as bad.Miriam had to deal with and live with the reality that her son was gone even though she knew he was not dead, but out there somewhere even though everyone said he couldn't have survived the accident that had maimed his father.In my opinion, Joshua endured more hardships than he had at home and more than Miriam endured even though losing a child is the worst thing in the world.We follow Joshua as he finds work and families to live with.  He was a sweet character, but felt guilty about not letting his mother know he was alive.  He couldn't let her know for fear of having to face his father's wrath because he would send someone to find him​.  Miriam was a dedicated wife and mother even though she lived with the hope her son was alive, but presumed dead.  Abraham was a character that I did not like at all.STONES IN THE ROAD takes us into homes and the way of living in the 1800's whether it was a Plain home or an English home.

Ms. Moore's writing style was beautiful along with wonderful description.I would recommend STONES IN THE ROAD to those folks who want to know more about the customs of Plain people as well as see first-hand the hardships they had every day as well as the hardships of traveling across the country in a wagon train.  4/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17N7MHDXDSLDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469992#wasThisHelpful","R17N7MHDXDSLDN","A1T9P4HXF0F2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T9P4HXF0F2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As a child she made me nervous with decisions she made.  I loved her father, Graham, and his caregiver, Russell.  The other characters were sort of in the background but kept the story line connected.PRETENDING TO DANCE does drag a bit, but if you have read any of Ms. Chamberlain's other books, she always incorporates social issues into her books in a very intriguing way.PRETENDING TO DANCE wasn't a favorite for me, but it did feel like a mystery as I thought about all of the secrets Molly had to keep and that we had to find out and how Molly needed to pretend to be able to cope with issues.I love the title of the book....very pertinent.The ending was very emotional.

"What really did happen the night of the accident?Ronny kept asking himself over and over if it was his fault or if Matt caused his own death. Ronny and Matt had been friends throughout high school but now Ronny was a police officer and Matt was still the trouble-making kid he had always been.DARKNESS THE COLOR OF SNOW takes the reader from present day back to Ronnie and Matt's high school days letting us in on their antics and how they fell apart and where they are today.DARKNESS THE COLOR OF SNOW also touches on the topic of small towns and the way corruption can occur with its officials.I truly did not like Martin who was the head of the town council.  He was a corrupt official who was doing illegal things, but made himself appear to be the good guy to the public.Ronny was a sweet kid who seemed to always get the short end of the deal.Matt was not a nice person and someone who caused Ronny grief during their teenage years as well as their adult years.DARKNESS THE COLOR OF SNOW was a tense read, but very good.  I am actually going to classify it as a psychological thriller.  The situation and the characters kept me glued to the pages but also had me nervous for the decisions the characters made.I was trying to figure out the significance of the title of DARKNESS THE COLOR OF SNOW and came up with the idea that the book had dark things happening in the small town of Lydell and the snow that was always falling made it a cold place to live.Let me know what you think of the book and the significance of the title if you read the book.I did enjoy the read.

"Peter Morrow hadn't returned after the year he and Clara had agreed upon for his return so the search for Peter began. Of course, Armand Gamache was asked to be involved even though he had retired from the police force.THE LONG WAY HOME has the well-known, well-loved residents of Three Pines we all are familiar with and the residents that make Louise Penny's books ones I enjoy reading.THE LONG WAY HOME was a bit different from her other books.  Instead of solving a murder, the Three Pines residents were working together to find Peter.This book was different because of the way the investigation took place.  Gamache actually was not in charge; Clara was.  It discussed muses and different art terms.  It was more about artists than the solving of a regular murder mystery, but the characters as always worked beautifully together.​I can't say I didn't like THE LONG WAY HOME, but it is quite different from her other books and took a bit of getting used to.  Regardless of the style and plot, though, THE LONG WAY HOME still had the pull all of her books have on you. ​​Ms. Penny's books usually involve emotions.

All was hush, hush about how that happened, and Riley didn't find out why until after both her parents had passed away.As Riley was cleaning out her parents' home, talking to different neighbors, and talking to folks her father had left things to in his will, she had her share of surprises and shocking revelations.THE SILENT SISTER has twists that keep you turning the pages as you learn of  secrets that had been kept for years and secrets that only a few folks knew about. How could anyone keep a secret like that?  How could anyone live his/her entire life worrying that the secret might accidentally be revealed?The characters were well developed, but a lot of them were unlikeable.  Riley was a likeable character because she had to deal with everything, and she was  the character that had to deal with these​ secrets alone.  Danny, her brother, was not likeable at all.  He was too unpredictable.  Riley's parents were not active characters and to me not likeable​, but they, especially her father, carried the storyline and its suspense.I always enjoy Ms. Chamberlain's books, and this was no exception.

A trip that was supposed to give them a better life.The writing in AN UNSEEMLY WIFE is beautiful, and Ms. Moore smoothly and masterfully moves from one time period to the other revealing what Ruth's life was before marrying Aaron and what it was like now.  As the journey west continued, Ruth realized that her life with Aaron would never be the same.  She had no family close by, and the people they met were not like her Fold at home.AN UNSEEMLY WIFE is actually an account of the author's great grandmother.  I enjoyed this book because I do like historical fiction, but definitely wouldn't want to be living in the 1800's as a woman.AN UNSEEMLY WIFE did drag a bit, though, but it was quite educational to see the difficulties of traveling in and living in a covered wagon along with the hardships of everyday life. You will feel the family's pain as sad things happen, and all the characters definitely grow on you.  The children were so innocent and good.  Ruth was obedient and a very good mother.

The characters in the story ""grow"" on you, and you become attached to them.​Ava was sweet, but aloof.  Wash was very likeable.  Macon, Ava's dad, was different.

"The first two words in the title of the book is the way Ms. Murphy began many sentences in THIS IS THE WATER, and it seems to be her writing style.

Will his children be there to greet him or have they forgotten him as they did when he was in prison?THE LAST BREATH moves from past to present telling the story of Ella Mae's life before she was suffocated with Saran Wrap and her daughter's life as her father comes home.While Gia Andrews struggles with coming home and having to face the shame of what happened sixteen years ago and finding out if her father really did kill her mother, you also follow her through her sexual romps.

"THE STORY OF LAND AND SEA is beautifully written with exquisite prose.​The main character is Helen whose story is told before and after her death along with the tale of her husband, her father, her daughter, and Moll, a slave from the plantation and Helen's friend.You will follow the characters through their lives on a plantation, on a ship, and in a regular household.  The characters are an odd sort but ones with depth and with feelings that ooze through the pages simply because of Ms. Smith’s elegant writing style.THE STORY OF LAND AND SEA takes the reader through complex situations with the reader being put directly into the story and being carried along with the characters and feeling every emotion especially their pain of loss.I was a bit confused at first, but Ms. Smith writes so beautifully and so poignantly that you can't help but want to continue. THE STORY OF LAND AND SEA is a book unlike any other I have read simply because of the storyline and the time in history.​​The confusion came about because of the time frame and order of dates.  The book moves back and forth from past to present day in Helen and John's life but seemed to be out of order.Despite the confusion, the book definitely will keep your interest and will keep you reading.  Ms. Smith has written a thoughtful book in a time period that I wasn't familiar with and therefore  made THE STORY OF LAND AND SEA even more intriguing and interesting.I would recommend this book solely on the premise of the marvelous writing style Ms. Smith has and the background she gave as to why she wrote the book.  The beauty of the reason Ms. Smith wrote the book makes THE STORY OF LAND AND SEA a stunning debut.  4/5 (See her video below)This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review.​","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CZ6LXS1DSTW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062335944#wasThisHelpful","R2CZ6LXS1DSTW0","A1T9P4HXF0F2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T9P4HXF0F2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It was a harsh life for her as well as the entire Indian community.  Despite the hardships, Mary blended in well and was protected by an Englishman.You will follow Mary as she transforms from a Puritan English woman into an Indian woman. She loved her transformation and found the link to nature and peace that she didn't have as the wife of a strict Puritan minister.FLIGHT OF THE SPARROW was very well researched and held my interest.  At first I didn't realize FLIGHT OF THE SPARROW was based on an actual person.  Once I found that out, the book became even more intriguing.I have never read any book about this time period in American history, but want to find out more.  FLIGHT OF THE SPARROW ​is a gripping account of Early America, and history buffs will not be disappointed.​I recommend this book to anyone who loves a well-researched, historical novel.​I can't divulge any more without telling the story, but take the time to read FLIGHT OF THE SPARROW.

"Mary, Lane, and Michael.  Three marvelous and completely different characters when put together make the pages of THE WISHING TIDE come alive.Lane owns a Bed & Breakfast, Mary is homeless, and Michael is the mysterious, unwanted guest who arrives during a storm for what appears to be for reasons other than not having any other place to stay for the night.All three characters blend together with things in common that they don't know about, and they fill the pages of THE WISHING TIDE with a splendid, beautifully told story.There is something about Mary that you can't help liking. Could it be her elusiveness,  her purple bag, her ability to read a person, or just her constant presence?Lane is a character you will feel sorry for even though she seems to have it all.Michael seemed sinister, and is someone who appeared on the scene more than by chance and with secrets of his own to work out.​THE WISHING TIDE is an emotional ride about life's lessons, personal secrets, and personal relationships.The writing was beautiful, detailed, and flowed nicely. The descriptions have you hearing the sea, smelling the sea air, and feeling the sand as well as vividly visualizing the buildings,  the quaint town, and every scene.I enjoyed THE WISHING TIDE simply because it was a cozy, comforting read with outstanding characters, an intriguing storyline, and a magnificent setting.The entire book and especially the ending wraps you up in a warm, homey cocoon.

"From New York City to Tennessee?Was Cassie making the right move?  She thought so, but meeting family members she hadn't seen since she was three was frightening as well as disillusioning.  She had to find out her roots, to find out what happened to her mother, and to find out why her mother really didn't want to live in Sweetwater, Tennessee, and why her grandfather left her the family home and 60 acres​.  What could the reason possibly be when she never knew him?Cassie is an interesting character that you will love and one that pairs up with an absorbing story that unfolds as alternating ​voices from one generation to the next tell their tale in this splendid story.  SWEET WATER smoothly flows from Grandmother Clyde's narrations to Cassie's retelling, reliving, and revealing of the secrets the Clyde family held.Ms. Kline has this time written a marvelous book about families, roots, and life-changing secrets. Every family member was good at keeping secrets especially the one that Grandmother Clyde kept for 20 years and the secret that ate at her for her entire life.  Did Grandfather Clyde want Cassie to find something out?  Perhaps the secret?I really enjoyed ​SWEET WATER because of the characters and the way Ms. Kline ​just pulled you in with her terrific, creative, thought-provoking storyline.My rating is a 4/5 because SWEET WATER is a read you won't want to stop reading once you get going.​  If you have read any of Ms. Kline’s other books, you know what a treat you are in for when you read SWEET WATER.The only thing that is holding me back from giving the book a 5/5 is that it was difficult to figure out who the one narrator was until a number of pages into the book and also because of the peculiar love story.  I am not sure how this love story fits in with the storyline except perhaps to prove how dysfunctional the Clyde family was.Don't miss reading this newest addition to Ms. Kline's already fantastic lineup.​I received this book free of charge and without compensation from the publisher in return for an honest review.​","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Z4T9SIGQPXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062361007#wasThisHelpful","R25Z4T9SIGQPXS","A1T9P4HXF0F2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T9P4HXF0F2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In fact, she managed very well.  The children fell in love with her and so did her brother-in-law.  Or did he really fall in love with her or was she simply a convenience?​Sigmund Freud ​betrayed ​​his wife, ​and Minna betrayed her sister.  The affair started out with ​early evening and some ​late night meetings that included flirting and drugs.  Did his wife know about the affair or was she too addicted to opium to even notice?You will definitely dislike Sigmund Freud as a person and question his thinking about why people develop psychological disorders. He was arrogant, a smooth operator, apparently quite good looking,​ and he used his field of study to his advantage. He was not a kind man especially to women, but he knew how to seduce Minna.  He had no regard for his wife who had six children with him.Minna, “the mistress,"" was actually likable because even though she knew she couldn't stop herself about wanting to be with Freud, she did feel guilty. ​ It was funny to be reminded that women of that era were so set on only finding a husband and no career per say except as domestic help, a companion for another woman, or caring for children.FREUD’S MISTRESS was enjoyable and very well written. The book flowed nicely, and you could actually visualize everything and feel the characters' emotions and moods because of Ms. Mack’s and Ms. Kaufman’s marvelous writing skills.​Some of the characters and some of the situations were comical.

"Bullying and prison life were the main themes in THAT NIGHT.The main character, Toni, had been bullied in high school because she was not in the ""in"" crowd.  This bullying influenced her life in a negative way.  Toni was very disliked by a group of girls in high school, and they kept after her for no other reason than to be mean.Being accused of murdering her sweet sister and having the folks that bullied her testify that she always lied about things definitely didn't help her defense.  She and her boyfriend were accused of the murder even though they were innocent and victims themselves and were sent to prison for 15 years.Prison wasn't any better for Toni.  Prison seemed like an extension of her high school problems.THAT NIGHT is the second book I read by Chevy Stevens.  To me it was not as good as the other book I read, but it did send a very powerful message​.As I was reading, I was truly frightened which most likely was the author's purpose in getting across the points of the damaging and horrible aspects of bullying.I really wasn't pulled in because of the beginning pages, but I kept coming back to learn about bullying and the repercussions of how it ruins a person's  life.  Stevens did a great deal of research and did a marvelous job of having the reader feel the fear caused by the bullying.To me Ms. Steven's was unquestionably raising the awareness of bullying and excellently conveyed it in her book.The book was very frightening as I was visualizing the scenes and thinking about what reaction I would have had in a bullying situation.  If you have been bullied, you won't want to read this book; it will bring back too many unsettling memories. I never was bullied,  but I was very shaken upon seeing how people act and the cruel things they do.My rating is mainly affected by the first 200 pages that only talked of high school antics and their jealousy of each other. If you can get past the first 200 pages of high school drama and adolescent problems, the final pages are quite good.I would have given the book a 2/5 because of the beginning pages, but I am changing the rating to a 3/5.This rating is changed mainly because the ending pages were excellent as the true story of the murder became revealed and because bullying needs to be addressed.  The public's awareness of bullying needs to be more in the open and needs to make the public realize this issue does exist and is a major social problem.This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PUHKDDJM1264/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250034604#wasThisHelpful","R1PUHKDDJM1264","A1T9P4HXF0F2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T9P4HXF0F2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As Vivian and Nowell settle into a family home they are going to renovate and as they ​meet their neighbors, Vivian questions Nowell's past as well as the neighbors' pasts.You will also get a glimpse into Vivian's teenage years as the author takes you back and forth in time.

Do the neighbors really know each other? What was it that happened years ago that has everyone suspicious of each other?Throughout the book there is a tension that the author perfectly conveys through her amazing writing style.

"Angela was the beginning and Ilonka was the end....two amazing women in DEGREES OF  COURAGE.Angela Bohaczek's life was put on hold at the age of 18 when her mother died.  She had to take care of her nine brothers and sisters and her father since she was the oldest and her father had no interest in taking care of the family.You will follow Angela's life through this ordeal as well as many other situations both pleasant and unpleasant. Angela's daughter, Lensie/Ilonka, is the other major character along with her children.The book flows nicely and has very interesting characters who will win your heart as well as make you hate some of them.  Ilonka was my favorite because of the love she had for her family and how she carried on through thick and thin times.  Ilonka's life was the main focus of the book.Ms. Vester did a fantastic job of keeping my interest and creating an excellent storyline for the entire 600 pages. You will love the family saga and the historical facts about Europe and Hungary from the year 1900 to 1970.  DEGREES OF COURAGE did get a bit slow with all the political topics, but they were necessary for the gist of the book.Despite the political aspect, it is well worth the 600-page read because of the storyline and because of the characters, the excellent writing, and the detailed descriptions. The book was mainly in the narrative style.  You will feel as though you are with the characters sharing all their love, their turmoil, their sadness, and their happy times.DEGREES OF COURAGE is about strong women who unquestioningly loved their families.  I loved the old-fashioned dating with chaperones that was part of the book and the homey feeling the story and the characters gave the reader.I also really liked the way the author would make a statement at the end of a chapter that was stating something that was to come in upcoming pages of the book.  It kept up the suspense.The characters were wonderful, and when the book was over or when I put the book down, I missed them and wanted to know what was going to happen next.  I became very attached and interested in their lives, and it was sad to close the last page.I enjoyed DEGREES OF COURAGE and am going to rate the book a 4/5.My rating of a 4/5 is because of the book’s length and the political information, but DEGREES OF COURAGE was excellent because the marvelous characters drew you in and kept you reading.This book was given to me free of charge by the author and publisher in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127BLE2U68Q2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF2XLKW#wasThisHelpful","R127BLE2U68Q2C","A1T9P4HXF0F2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T9P4HXF0F2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah Grimke and Handful were complete opposites in the society of the 1800's.Sarah was the daughter of a plantation owner, and Handful was her maid.  Both were strong women regardless of their station in life.Sarah didn't want to have a maid, and Handful didn't want to be a maid.  She wanted to sew just like her mother did.  She wanted to be a seamstress, but in reality, she wanted to be free.  Charlotte, Handful's mother, made all the clothes for the household including the slaves.  She was a bit of of a handful herself.Through the beautiful storytelling of Ms. Kidd, you will follow the Grimke family through the decades of life on the plantation.  You will meet Missus who was the wife of the plantation owner and who was in charge of of the slaves. She was very cruel.The main characters, Sarah, Handful, Charlotte, and Missus will keep you up late reading about the day's activities either covert or in plain sight and either cruel or humane. These characters and their bond as well as their differences will be pulling at your heartstrings.Historical Fiction at its best will be yours when you pick up THE INVENTION OF WINGS.  There is a lot of profound thinking and pondering in every paragraph.  I wasn't aware of Sarah's role in the abolitionist movement, and was pleasantly surprised to find information about her and her sister, Angeline, as I did some research of my own.The storyline of THE INVENTION OF WINGS flows easily and masterfully as Ms. Kidd brings to life Southern living, the horrors of slavery, and tells of the people who worked toward abolishing slavery.Don't miss this well-written, researched book of Ms. Kidd.  Ms. Kidd’s notes at the end of the book were very helpful as she explained how she took the basis of history and fictionalized key parts of it for her book.

"When Rose moved from a balmy, beautiful Martinique plantation to a cold, stark Paris, her life followed suit.She went from a loving, warm family to a husband and a life that was cold and distant.Rose's arranged marriage was supposed to be one that would be a wonderful new chapter in her life, but it was totally opposite.  Her husband, Alexandre, was a philanderer and very critical of Rose. He thought she was beneath his social stature.When the French Revolution broke out both Rose and Alexandre were imprisoned in a filthy, demeaning prison.After her release, Rose was determined to change her life and never want for anything again.  She worked at and reached that goal.  Rose/Josephine was a very determined woman and led quite an interesting social life as she again looked for a husband. It is difficult to believe how she ""hopped"" from man to man.BECOMING JOSEPHINE was very well written and kept my interest despite some of the political aspects.  I would recommend BECOMING JOSEPHINE if you are a fan of historical fiction.  It is historical fiction at its best.  Ms. Webb definitely did her research.I truly enjoy this time period in history with all the fashion.  The strict rules about the rights of women during these times is always puzzling since there was no problem with the women and their sexual behavior.

"A war, a woman, and memories plagued Edward for years and became more intense after he and his wife went back to France for a dedication ceremony for the company he was in during WWI.UNRAVELLED goes back and forth from past to present revealing feelings, desires, and regrets. The characters are likable but not lovable. Edward does the unthinkable when he is in France and ruins his life as well as his wife's life.UNRAVELLED is the perfect title for this book because of the war and the personal situations that cause people to become undone. You will share the pain of losing a family member or a friend to war or to infidelity and coping with the loss along with the characters.The author did a marvelous job researching both WWI and WWII and brought the characters' feelings in all situations masterfully to the surface. The war information dragged on a bit despite the themes of marriage and infidelity even though the wars and what they do to the survivors, the wounded, and families left with or without their loved ones was the main emphasis.If you enjoy love and war which actually can't be separated, you will enjoy UNRAVELLED.  I honestly have to say it was good, but it also lacked some pizzazz - it seemed to run on an even keel without too much suspense.  I skimmed through some sections.UNRAVELLED was good, but needed to be a bit shorter and not as detailed with the war information.  If you enjoy detailed war strategies, though, you will definitely enjoy UNRAVELLED.  3.5/5This book was given to me free of charge by the author and without compensation by the author in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12K8MX718XDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIJPJ5U#wasThisHelpful","R12K8MX718XDX","A1T9P4HXF0F2NS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T9P4HXF0F2NS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Owen McKenna is back again breaking hearts, breaking jaws, breaking rules, and solving murders.Murders that were made to look like accidents were plaguing this ski town, and all the reasons for the murders were pointing back to one man, Joe, who was opposing the building of another ski resort.  Could this be the real reason or was it a diversion?Why would someone want to hurt or kill anyone associated with Joe and especially his sweet wife?  Joe had no idea, and Owen was on the trail as one person after another kept being eliminated.  It wasn't an easy trail to follow even in ski country.The characters are well developed as in Mr. Borg's other books, and most are likable and pleasant, especially Owen. The book also brought up domestic abuse and psychological issues along with the murders.  Every facet was very well researched.The tension of the investigation isn't one that will have you chewing your fingernails, but I liked it that way.  It is a good mystery that will have you guessing until the end about who the murderer is. TAHOE CHASE has a good twist on who the murderer turns out to be.  I thought I definitely knew, but did not guess correctly.  I actually had two suspects in mind, and neither was correct.  :)TAHOE CHASE was an easy, smooth read with skiing as a major theme.  If you are a skiing fan, you will be drooling over the details...they were phenomenal, but the skiing detail was a bit too much for me, though.  It actually was overwhelming in the sense that it wasn’t of interest.I am going to rate this book a 4/5.

"A rook was the beginning and the end for William Bellman.Black was the color of the day for this book along with rooks, who according to the author never forget.BELLMAN & BLACK was an unusual read with the premise of death, darkness, black birds (rooks), the color black, and black events...namely funerals and mourning goods.William Bellman inherited a cloth mill and made it very successful, but when a deathly illness plagued and overran his town, he had another business in mind partnering with the mysterious man in a black cloak.Who was the cloaked man who took all the light away at Will's mother's funeral?  Why was this man always around when there was a funeral?Was this cloaked man and all the deaths in Will's family the result of Will's killing a rook when he was ten? Was this man with the black cloak Bellman's inspiration, success, or his downfall? Why were these rooks always hanging around?BELLMAN & BLACK is a bit dark, but it still held my interest.  Ms. Setterfield has a way with words and dark themes, but despite holding my interest, BELLMAN & BLACK was a bit dragged out hearing about William's life and then his new-found wealth.I didn't seem to find the ""ghost"" in this ghost story until the very end.  The ""ghost"" was a subtle theme even though it was to be the main theme.  You will enjoy the wrapup in the ending pages....they were very unique.Ms. Setterfield definitely did her research when it came to rooks.  The different names that a collection of rooks can be called was quite interesting.I am going to rate BELLMAN & BLACK a 3.5/5 even though Ms. Setterfield does draw you in with her excellent writing skills, her fantastic descriptions of scenes, her brilliance, and her amazing creativity because something just seemed to be off the mark a bit in this novel.If you like dark themes, and you don't mind being told every detail of someone's life, you will enjoy this book.

"""We must never allow the world to forget."" Page 179That quote says it all, and Ben Solomon vowed to follow through on this edict, and he definitely was following through.ONCE WE WERE BROTHERS is a powerful, well-researched first novel that will have you glued to the pages as Ben tells his story of hatred, horror, and the annihilation of his and other Jewish families during WWII.Telling the story of the horrors of the Nazi occupation of Poland was stressful for the 83-year-old main character, Ben, but he had to tell it all, and Catherine, his attorney, wanted to be the one to help arrest Elliott/Otto.Ben knew he knew Elliott Rosenzweig was not really Elliott Rosenzweig, but Otto Piatek, his brother turned Nazi during the war, and the person who was not accused of his horrific war crimes but living in the United States as a billionaire philanthropist.ONCE WE WERE BROTHERS moves from present day to WWII in Poland as Ben Solomon tells how his family had to live and survive under Nazi occupation as a Jewish family.ONCE WE WERE BROTHERS tells how Otto, a German boy, was left with the Solomon family, a Jewish family, because his mother couldn't take care of him.  Otto became part of the Jewish home and loved the Solomons like his own family until his mother showed up and insisted he join the Germans.Mr. Balson did a fantastic job researching for his first book and detailing every scene.  ONCE WE WERE BROTHERS is a beautiful way to tell a horrible historical story.You will feel as though you are inside the pages of the book and connecting with the characters both present and past. This book was amazing.I am always in awe of the strength of the Europeans during this time period.  How did they survive and deal with all that was going on especially the Jewish population?This compelling WWII book is one you will want to read.  It is perfectly relayed, phenomenal, and a part of history that again reveals what WWII was about.  I finished this book in ONE day, and that is unusual for me.Don't miss reading ONCE WE WERE BROTHERS.

"It's the Wild West with a prostitute and an inexperienced lawman running loose.Lucinda Carter and Nate Cannon will take you on a ride through the 1870's as they try to make a new life for themselves.  They both wanted to start over, but they both ended up doing the same thing they always did.Lucinda went from being a prostitute to being a teacher, and Nate is trying his hand at being a lawman to make a better life for his family.Lucinda isn't an upstanding character, but her profession made her that way.  She stole money from her landlady who is also the owner of the brothel she escaped from.  Lucinda is only interested in herself and finding something that a friend told her was in the town she moved to.  Lucinda was difficult to like simply because you knew she wasn't on the up and up.Nate is a good man trying to fit in even though he is a greenhorn.  I liked him because of his innocence and loyalty.The book took a while for me to get interested because I wasn't sure where it was heading and how these two characters and their stories were connected.  Each chapter went back and forth between the two characters.  When you find out the connection between the two main characters, you will be surprised.THE OUTCASTS became a bit better as you followed Lucinda around the classroom and back to her old ways and as you followed Nate around the countryside, but it still wasn't a wow.  It actually wasn’t a favorite read.I do have to say, though, that the writing is very descriptive allowing you to clearly see the scenes and activities of both characters.The cover definitely pulled me in, and I was hoping for a better-connected story, but I wasn't ""dying"" to get back to the book .Give it a try, though, if you like the Wild West.

"It's the Roaring 20's.Prohibition, speakeasies, gangsters, the rich and the poor.  DOLLFACE portrays the life of those living in Chicago during this time.  No one was exempt from what was going on.Vera Abramowitz worked in the typing pool of an insurance firm and also as a telephone operator to make ends meet, and she still made next to nothing.  She didn't want to do this for her entire life and then met Shep Green, a gangster.  She also met Tony Liolli who also was a gangster. She began dating both men, even though she knew she was playing with fire by dating both of them at the same time.Despite the danger she was putting herself in, she couldn't help herself.  Tony was fun, Shep had power, and she didn't want to turn out like her mother....poor and still working in the slaughterhouse.  Then something happened and she found out who the ""real"" man was and who the ""real"" slacker was.DOLLFACE is written in an easy style that grabs you as you want to learn more about this time period.  The characters are definitely authentic, and the activity at that time appears to be right on.You will love following Vera from rags to riches and then through a rough time, but Vera was tough. You will be shocked at what she does as a woman in the 1920's as well as bite your fingernails as you see what risky things she gets herself into. Vera carries this fabulous story along even though it is difficult to like her or to agree with what she does.I really enjoyed DOLLFACE.  The reality of events was terrific.

"“Faith, Reason, and the New Mass Translation,” by Author John Wilhelmsson is an interesting read that helped me gain a deeper view on my own faith as a Catholic. In essence, this book for me is centered on the Eucharistic change and the changes surrounding the Mass today. In a comprehensive fashion, that is easy to follow and easy to understand Author John Wilhelmsson provides a unique an original perspective on the mass today. Through blogs and other means of research he has in thoroughly explained ""Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi,” which is to say the law of praying [is] the law of believing. This is important because it refers to the relationship between worship and belief, that is an ancient Christian principle that provides a measure for developing the ancient Christian creeds.In closing, this book is eye opening and certainly thought provoking. The Authors points I felt are on track and point with how Mass is conducted today. The examples and theological study is on point and well written. If you are Catholic and are looking for a book that give you a deeper insight on your faith and then look no further this is the book for you. 4 Stars…I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AOMO2XAL7DWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0MIIQU#wasThisHelpful","R3AOMO2XAL7DWX","A3UIFZOXHKADII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UIFZOXHKADII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“What Men Secretly Want from Women: Link to Bonus Video and Audio Included with Your Purchase! (How to Make a Man Fall in Love in 90 Days or Less!

If you are able to do that, and he in tern will stop and care how you feel, think, act and can somehow meet you on some middle ground.

"I finished reading ""Rebeca's First Pet,"" with my two twin boys (age three). I am happy to report that they loved it and where asking me to read it again. The eBook Cover is  illustrated perfectly painting a beautiful picture that sets the stage for the storyline and plot theme, which I personally felt was original and unique. Definitely made our night time reading so much fun for the three of us. I should mention that both my boys are now getting into reading, or a least trying to read, and well this book captivated their imagination in an amazing fashion that was simply impressive to say the least. Their love for animals I think was the key that sparked their creative bubbles allowing the story to flow effortlessly in a memorable way. The questions / quiz at the end of the book was an added plus that helped engage the story and message all the more. This is a must read for all parents and children.5 Stars for Author Alicia Ellison Grant.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI1XD3QJI0U7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BF0FZOA#wasThisHelpful","RI1XD3QJI0U7F","A3UIFZOXHKADII","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3UIFZOXHKADII?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Master Detective Toolkit is a great gift for kids who want to go a little beyond merely playing cops and robbers. In many ways the toolkit is more like a Gilbert's Chemistry set than anything resembling a badge and gun. The kit contains a lot of stickers for different uses from sealing a ""crime scene"" to marking evidence. Some fingerprint powder and tape to transfer them to is pretty much like the real McCoy...along with the mess they make. (Actual crime scenes after the techs are finished are very messy, as well. So plus one for realism!)It's been quite a while since plaster molds have been made of shoe prints and tire tracks by actual CSI units, but the kit includes all of the ingredients for making plaster molds. As I former kid who made molds from raccoon tracks, I can attest to the fact that they're a lot of fun. (Plaster molds tend to distort sunken foot and tire prints to the point that defense attorneys could compare his client's shoe compared to a plaster mold to convince a jury that the mold shoe was much larger.)This is a thinking kid's detective kit, and while most criminalists would cringe at both the contents and some of the folksy advice to budding detectives that the instructions give, it's a lot of fun. Further the kid's imagination can far outweigh any of the shortcomings in the kit. Caution does need to be used with the ultraviolet flashlight (for viewing invisible evidence), but the biggest danger in this kid is the mess that it can happily generate in a young detective's imagination.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RWWBLBYL20OG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8Z7NS#wasThisHelpful","R1RWWBLBYL20OG","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At criminology conferences the members would complain that no one listened to them. After spending years--and indeed careers--studying one aspect of crime or another; their findings were ignored. Sometimes, politicians would cherry pick pieces of unrelated findings and cobble together a program to ""fight crime"" that was ""based on science."" However, they would totally ignore the cause and effect aspects of theory that provided a path to removing the cause. Some early criminologists, most notably the 19th century Cesare Lombroso (who was both a physician and criminologists),  was convinced that criminality was an inherited trait. From at least the mid-20th century his theories have been rejected simply because they don't hold up under the light of rigorous research. (They don't even hold up under casual research.) Nevertheless, biogenic causes are still trotted out on occasions to explain crime.A few years back while serving on a National Science Foundation panel, one of the fellow panelists was telling us about how he had been on a different NSF panel that funded a biogenic proposal for researching certain types of crime. I asked him if the request for funding included a sample of white collar criminals, and he  bristled at the notion that the sub-typed even ""counted."" It turned out that the proposal was well formed and used known biological concepts and clearly tested independent and dependent variables. Biologists are good at that because they have been taught how to use the scientific method correctly.  However, what's probably more important is the mind-set that crime, a politically and culturally defined norm violation, is actually hard-wired by DNA or God. What at one time was explained by demons and Satan (who invaded the law-abiding body) was upgraded to biogenic spirits (who invaded the law-abiding body). Neither seems to hold water but still persist.With the rise in Islamic fundamentalism that favors Sharia law (in more than a single flavor), it's surprising that biogenic origins are still sought when the laws are clearly cultural in origin. Besides,  a woman stoned under Sharia law for dishonoring her husband or family by having an affair is a Sharia crime making the woman a criminal. That kind of behavior is expected at Web sites like Ashley Madison dot com. It sounds goofy to start looking for biological causes for that behavior if under one cultural standard (Sharia law) it's criminal and under another (secular Western law) is merely naughty.Richard Perry, an anthropologist, is not rooting for social-cultural explanations of behavior; he's trying to explain the difference between good and bad scientific research and causal relationships. He's got no problem with biologists, but he does have a problem with those (biologists or not) who attempt to plant biogenic causes to behaviors that have no (primary) biogenic cause. The most common and irksome kind of biogenic nonsense is that relating groups of people based on religion or ""race"". Hitler's ""scientific explanations"" of race were spread by the effective propaganda of Joseph Goebbels. If he could find a crackpot professor to aid his cause, he would be recruited. However, most of the ""science"" was anything but. Rather, Joseph Goebbels would take phrase (now called a ""sound bite"") and repeat it over and over. In that way, phone-baloney ""science"" became a fact or what politicians love to call ""common sense."" It was common sense that the Slavs were Untermenschen, so it was ok to invade the USSR and enslave or kill Slavs.Beginning with the Enlightenment, Perry steps through the eras of reasoning and un-reasoning, science and the misuse of science. His key target are those who make leaps of logic from one field to another, especially primatologists, who explain a very complex human social system based on observations of apes. Likewise, William Shockley, who won the Nobel prize for his work in transistors, decided he was an expert in intelligence testing and concluded certain races were dumber than others. (It's something like asking a brilliant psychologist to re-wire your computer's motherboard. The results would be equally dysfunctional.)One of the disappointing realities of a book like this is the fact that we have to be reminded again and again that concepts like ""race"" are faulty in so many ways that they are next to useless. Europeans and Asians share some DNA with Denisovans and Neandertals, two pre-modern species of humans. That is, our ancestors were mating with cave men and women. So we're part cave man. What about those of African origin? Nah. They never went far enough north to meet with Alley Oop. They're pure modern man. Now, tell me again about race purity of the Aryans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ESPBUUMUVB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1421417510#wasThisHelpful","R15ESPBUUMUVB5","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In general I like this sleeping bag. It does indeed keep out the cold, and while I'd probably avoid using it in zero-degree weather, I'd have no qualms in doing so in freezing weather (below 32 F). It's very light, a little over 4 points (2 kg), and medium bulky. It's Chinese manufactured using 100% polyester on all materials--even the zipper ( which I guessed was nylon), and you can machine wash it.The bag's cap is held in place by a velcro strap once pulled on, but I was unable to zip up the bag  all the way using the big bright orange zipper from inside the bag. The zipper has pulls inside and out, but despite this convenience, I still could not get it to fully zip. I'd suggest going with someone who could pull up the zipper and fully  cocoon you in the bag from the outside.Once fully wrapped into the bag, it's snugly warm and comfortable. However, like all such sleeping bags, you'll need an air mattress or cot. The ground is just as hard. Inside the bag is the nylon carrying bag.

"The WORX WG303.1 16-Inch Chain Saw, 3.5 HP  was recommended in a review of light duty, economical electric chain saws I read online. Besides doing exactly what it's designed to do, it has an automatic bar oil distributor. Instead of having to press a little pump, all you need to do is to make sure you have the bar oil reservoir filled. (The saw even comes with a small bottle of bar oil.) It's just plug and saw.I also have a  Husqvarna Rancher for bigger jobs--cutting up a fallen tree or even cutting down a tree. However, I needed something to cut branches from over-grown trees where I have to lift up the saw overhead, and the Rancher is just too big that kind of job. (By the way the Rancher is an outstanding chain saw.) For cutting back bushes and tree branches, the Worx is simple to use and safe. I had considered getting a chain saw with a re-chargable battery, but those batteries are heavy and even you've been going to the gym a lot, they can wear you out. Having a cord attached to a chain saw is not fun, and you have to be careful not to cut the cord, but otherwise, it's a snap to use and while a bit hefty, it's nowhere near as heavy as those with battery packs.All of the safety features are in place, and I got so used to pressing the lock lever forward after use, that it became second nature. So, if you are in the market for a light duty chain saw at a very reasonable price, I can recommend this saw hands down over the competition (some of which are more expensive!)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20RX9AVZUMDJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NITD9O#wasThisHelpful","R20RX9AVZUMDJK","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed reading this book. Like all thriller novels, this one requires a suspension of doubt about several key elements of the story and even life in general. First of all, you need to buy into the concept of a 'photographic memory' (eidetic memory). Whether eidetic memory is real or not is an interesting debate, and while there are some notable examples (and many of which are urban rumors), you need to forget the debate and just assume that some people can see a page of computer code and memorize it. They don't need to understand it; just recall it exactly as they saw it. Second, I generally consider conspiracy theories a substitute for thinking fostered by half-wits on the Internet. But, sometimes the paranoids are right, and 'they' are out to get us. Besides,  enough real examples exist to illustrate that we should listen to some of the paranoids. Earlier this year (January 2015) Alberto Nisman, the chief prosecutor investigating the 1994 car bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos Aires was found dead in his apartment of an apparent suicide. Since Nisman was about to release information that the Argentine government had made a favorable trade deal with Iran to cover up Iranian involvement in the bombing of the Jewish center, his death was considered suspicious and it is under investigation. Conspiracy? Most Argentinians think so. Lots of other examples abound; so, while conspiracies is not a general way to look at everything, sometimes the paranoids are right.A third major feature of the book involves computer programming, and ""back doors."" A back door in a program is a hidden entry point where those who know where the back door is and how to access it can get into a program's data processing or database even though it has restricted access. A back door into the firmware in a computer chip has further potential for unauthorized access to anything on the computer. If all of the computer chips have the same firmware, anyone with the key to a back door in the firmware can (possibly) access all of the programs processed on the chip. Recent examples abound -- North Koreans into Sony's database; Chinese into the Pentagon; and everyone's credit card data by Russians—whether or not these entries were through a ""back door"" in a chip's firmware is not the issue; they got in somehow. (Intel's chip assembly/testing sites include China, Vietnam and two in Malaysia. (Close to 1,000,000 Malaysian Muslims believe that Islamic terrorist attacks are justified if Islam is offended.)The fun part about Robin Burcell's book is how she pulls together eidetic memory, a power conspiracy inside the U.S. government and ""The Devil's Key"" —code to get into the back door of just about any computer. The Key is pursued by both the bad guys (powerful government conspirators) and good guys, a potpourri of government spooks and agents. A young punked out girl (with black and pink hair) sees the code, memorizes it in her photographic mind, and the other copies of the code are lost; so she's the only one with the code. The adventure is the attempt by the good guys to protect the girl from the bad guys.Another interesting (and worrying) aspect of the story is the ""kill order."" This is a governmental order to have someone killed. The most famous recent example is Osama Bin Laden; the order was given, and he was iced. A more debatable example was Anwar al-Awlaki's son. Anwar al-Awlaki was an American citizen living in Yemen inciting acts of terrorism against the U.S. and responsible for actual attempts. No one was too upset about his demise when a drone blew him up. Two weeks later his 16-year old son was killed by a U.S. drone. This killing was a bit more controversial since he was not on the kill list but apparently was with others who had been on the kill list.If you mix in a little conspiracy theory with a kill order and an item that could unleash a worldwide eruption (The Devil's Key), you can build a very creative and fun adventure. I've been quite busy lately, and I had to take my time reading it—a little every evening. It was easy to pick up and put down. There wasn't an abundance of characters; good guys and bad guys were clearly drawn and the supporting case was interesting but not obscured by complexity. There wasn't a great deal of depth to the characters but enough to let you know who they were. The romance was tepid but added a bit of tension to the plot and all of the loose ends were neatly tied up at the conclusion.At the end of the story, the author includes a blurb about ""real"" conspiracies. That was unnecessary and in a work of fiction like this a bit overdrawn. In historical fiction, an appendix by the author detailing historical events adds context, but in this kind of novel, the author would have been better served by letting the book end at the end of her story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0J9EQ3I0JYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006227371X#wasThisHelpful","RA0J9EQ3I0JYS","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found out that I have pretty good posture if I sit and work on programming or writing, but in other situations, like meal preparation, I slouch over the sink or cutting boards. I now know that thanks to Lumo Lift. I didn't think I'd like Lumo Lift when I first opened the package and was assailed by a bunch of magnets, but once I was able to get it sorted out, I use just one magnet that holds the posture & step-recorder in place.Lumo Lift requires an app that I downloaded free from the Apple Store (I believe there is now an Android version as well), and installed it in my iPhone. After charging the Lumo Lift wearable device--slouch/step detector--I put it on my shirt and synched it with the app--easy. I turned the ""Coach"" to ""On"" and went to work on a writing and video recording project. For the most part my Lumo Lift didn't do anything, and then while working in the kitchen making compote (slicing up a lot of plums, apples and peaches) it went off.  I straightened up, and it was happily quiet again. The device buzzed several times as I changed postures, but by the time I was finished with the compote, I was standing straighter than a Prussian general. So, if you want to improve on your posture, this thing really works.The directions suggest that you wear ""fitting"" clothes--like a collared shirt. However, I wear comfortable shirts (usually without collars), and it worked just fine with them. I even put it on a bath robe, and it worked; so don't worry about only wearing the device in a business suit. It seems pretty flexible with clothes.For the first 14 days after I got it set up and registered on the Lumo app and Web site, I got daily emails from The Lumo Team. They showed examples of good and bad posture, and that's important because the Lumo Lift system is based on your setting the device (double-click it) from what you deemed good posture. This is just a matter of sitting up straight, double-clicking the device inside your shirt or bra-strap. By positioning the device near your collar bone and sitting up straight, it keeps tabs on when you're upright or slouching. That's why, after getting it positioned by sitting up straight in my office chair, it started going off when I bent over to slice the fruit for the compote.The instructions that come with it are pretty bad (minimalist like the kind Apple gives you when you get their products), but online, there's a great set of instructions; so don't be dismayed by the initial figuring out how to use it. The charger is a little disc-shaped holder with a horseshoe shaped indentation where you put the Lumo Lift device to be charged. It glows orange until it's charged and then turns green. Since I also wear a Fitbit, I was able to compare the step counter with it, and the two devices were very close; so it does a good job in counting the steps you take as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW02YDD3F2RRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9P8GMW#wasThisHelpful","RW02YDD3F2RRU","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:14 Mins I wanted a good microphone for creating online courses. The CAD Audio was recommended, and so I ordered the CAD Audio GXL2600USB Large Diaphragm Cardioid Condenser Microphone. It comes with a shock mount, desk stand and USB cable (10 feet). It is very easy to set up; essentially plug and play. Initially I had problems getting it to work the way I wanted with Adobe Premiere Elements, but I discovered additional controls in APE that allowed me to adjust the sound level to an acceptable one. I would imagine that a microphone like this would need some kind of amplifier, and that would be a welcome addition.

"There's a lot to recommend this chip. First, and most impressive to me, I was able to read the ingredients without a bio-chemical dictionary at my side. The ingredients are all regular foods and not added chemicals for color, preservation or taste. As the name implies, they're made with black beans and backup up with corn, oil (canola & sunflower) brown rice flour, flax seed, and some other seeds and flavorings. In other words, you know what you're getting and it's gluten free.My wife and I tried them, and they taste ok. I tried them with basil tomato soup (dipping) and plain. The taste was a little bland but not offensive. As such, they'd probably be good with a more tasty dip with onion, clam, garlic, chives, or even humus. Also, with dietary restrictions on certain foods, especially those containing gluten, they would be a good addition to any party where guests may not be able to have regular chips. Sodium content is 80mg, which isn't bad for a single serving of 5 chips, but with 4 servings 320mg may be a bit high for some.Often people confuse healthy, which these chips certainly appear to be, with low fat/calorie. The basic serving of 5 chips is 130 calories with 6g of fat. One serving isn't going to break anyone's scale, but the problem with chips is that one serving usually isn't what anyone eats. Calculating the Weight Watchers value, it was 3 points—not bad; not great. Better to fill up on carrots and celery sticks.So overall, the chips appear to meet high healthy standards, and each serving is reasonable as fat, sodium, and calories are concerned, but these chips are not to be gobbled up wholesale. The taste is unremarkable and a chip might be recommended as a shovel for bean dip or other dips with distinctive flavors.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWOEABEJBWOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFNI0S#wasThisHelpful","R3NWOEABEJBWOB","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the Tektronix TBS 1202B with the primary focus of working with experiments using the Raspberry Pi computer and different experimental boards with which I would be able to work on some hardware/software projects. While the Tektronix Courseware Raspberry Pi Labs was intended for the  TBS1000B-Edu series, there's nothing preventing them from working on the regular TSB 1000B series other than the fact that you pay a little more for the non-Edu version. ( Some Edu editions of software restrict commercial development; so I assumed that hardware may have similar restrictions.) So, the software element of the oscilloscope is vitally important.In setting up the TBS 1202B, I went through the recommended verification steps, and I was able to test and connect the probe to generate the square wave. (See photo) Further in verification, I found that all of the calibration tests on the 2 channels had been passed. Also I noted that the oscilloscope was running the 3.25 version of the firmware. (FV:3.25). As the instructions indicated I checked the latest version of firmware and found that it was FV:4.0; so I downloaded the file for updating the firmware, placed it on a flash drive and plugged it into the front of the oscilloscope. Using the Multipurpose button, I selected the correct software (TBS1KB.TEK) and pushed the update button. (See photo.) The docs indicated this would take several minutes and I'd get a response on the screen when the update was complete. Using two different flash drives and waiting over an hour, nothing happened, and I still have FV 3.25. In the FAQs, I when a user indicated a similar problem updating to 3.25, the suggestion was to change the file name to TBS1KB.TEK. Obviously that didn't work either. Furthermore, 75% of the readers indicated that the response was NOT helpful. So here's a problem that Tektronix had prior to FV 3.25 that still persists as users attempt to update to FV 4.0. Not a good sign. My computers and mobile devices have updates all the time. My PC seems to have a Windows update almost every time I turn it one; so updating software should not be a mystery and as impossible as I experienced.The documentation is quite good, and it runs fine on FV 3.25. Further, the software running in the Tektronix TBS1202B works great and has good HCI and UX. I like the way the menus work and how the Multipurpose knob is used to select items on the excellent screen. I haven idea why Tektronix lets the firmware update persist, but until they get it fixed, I'm stuck with the old version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JV3VVBQAR9IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JPY2NMU#wasThisHelpful","R1JV3VVBQAR9IW","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't suppose that paper towels that look tough are a lot different than those that don't, but I felt pretty good about tackling tough jobs with this towel that I'd probably feel less secure using the white ones on the roller in the kitchen. For example, cleaning up grease spots on my workbench or cleaning up a bathroom sink and shower after using heavy powder cleaners like Ajax has turned regular paper towels into shredded rags. Would the same be true with WypAll L10 Disposable Wipers? After testing the towels on both projects--sink and workbench--I found that they held up just fine and did not dissolve or tear when using powerful cleaners that strongly suggest wearing rubber gloves when applying.Seizing the opportunity, my wife suggested a number of projects to try out the towels on for a thorough review. In the back of our house we have a large picture window that looks over a small meadow, a woods and a pond. From this view we watch the seasons and various and sundry critters from the woods and sky. We like to keep it clean so that we miss nothing. The outside takes a scrubbing wand and squeegee with liberal amounts of water, and the inside requires window cleaner and a paper towel. One of the problems that other paper towels have had with window cleaning is that something that goes into the makeup of the towel mixes with the window cleaner and tends to leave a filmy residue. The window is clean, but the residue is visible, and so my hope was that this towel would not leave the residue. Unfortunately, it did. So while it was gang-busters on the tough jobs, it did not prove to be the cleaning towel I'd hoped for when it comes to window-cleaning.I like the handy Kleenex type pull-out for the towels. Roll towels can easily get knocked over and roll around the garage or other work places, but the boxed ones are easy to keep in place and retrieve single sheets.

"In the past I've not had much luck getting into Jonathan Kellerman's character, Alex Delaware and the stories related to the shrink-detective. However, the opposite was true, initially, with Grace Blades, the heroine of his latest novel. Her father killed her mother and so she ended up as the book's title, ""The Murderer's Daughter."" In a series of foster homes, she finally hits pay dirt in a home run by an eccentric (in a Ma Kettle way) woman, Ramona, who lives on a ranch, and here she seems to be set until she's old enough to be on her own. It turns out that Grace is a pretty smart cookie as tested by a psychologist named Malcolm Bluestore (Dr. Bluestone.) Between the home schooling materials that Bluestone brings and her eagerness to 1) learn and 2) be left alone, Grace flourishes academically while not having to attend school.The story is told on a back-and-forth timeline; so we know early on that Grace (Dr. Blades) is now a clinical psychologist living in a small house in Malibu and practicing in West Hollywood; both in the LA area. She's like this magic psychologist since everyone she sees recommends her to their friends and seem to recover from whatever problem they had when they first went to see her. While she may have minimal relationship skills in her own life, her skills as a shrink are phenomenal. Her idea of a relationship with a man is a quickie in the dark corder of a hotel parking structure.  In fact, there's a point where most men with her predilections would be described as ""creepy,"" but some may consider that ""liberated"" for a woman. Or maybe the reader is supposed to understand that given Grace's terrible relationship issues in her past, her current behavior reflects a biological need met by someone who cannot handle relationships with men (or anyone else.)Grace gets her undergraduate degree from Harvard (naturally) and her Ph.D. in clinical psychology, from USC, which may sound like a step down—way down from Harvard. (Since USC is ranked #18 nationally in clinical psychology and nearby UCLA is ranked #1, why did Grace go to USC? Well, that's where Dr. Bluestone and his wife work; that's why!) Along the way, Grace picks up skills in Krav Maga—Israeli combat fighting technique used by the IDF— and how to shoot a gun. So by the time we meet her as a successful clinical psychologist, she can handle herself as a combo Kung Fu Mama, Annie Oakley and highly effective head-fixer.The drama as a thriller begins when Grace humps a guy in a parking garage who shows up the next day as a patient.  Ach du lieber Gott! What would Freud say? Anyway, to make things more interesting, this same guy is one she knew as a kid when he and his brother and sister were brought to Ramona's foster home-ranch. The next thing you know, the guy gets killed and Grace has to jump into the role of Sherlock Freud. Her suspect is quickly identified, and so she's off to Berkeley to find and stop him from further evil.At this point, a little after halfway through the book, things bog down. It gets about as interesting as an insurance seminar as Grace enters a holding pattern waiting for the book to reach 364 pages. It finishes with a flourish, but the very end seems to add a bit more creepiness to Grace's already creepy personality—outside of the clinical setting. Up to a point I very much enjoyed the book, and I was hovering between 3 and 4 stars and decided that I'd like to see more of Grace with a little less perfection (perfect scholar; perfect therapist) and a little more humanity with human relationship (some kind of relationship that spans more than two drinks and a whoopee.) The sweet relationship between Malcolm Bluestone and his wife was quite well done and bringing out the character of Ramona was equally adroit. Grace needs a bit of a makeover, but only the perfection and creep.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX93L3QI65AVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545311#wasThisHelpful","RX93L3QI65AVD","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first set of earrings with manufactured or ""lab"" rubies I've got for my wife. In the past, she's had emerald earrings that were a gift from our son that he got in Columbia and I've purchased a ring with real rubies from Israel. The real rubies and emeralds are nice, but the manufactured ones are essentially the same aluminium oxide-based stones. The perfection of the manufactured rubies is a giveaway that they're not natural—a natural ruby with the clarity and perfection of these would be worth a fortune.In most of the jewelers where you would find comparable earrings (e.g., Zales, Jareds), the prices ranged from lower to higher, and without having the actual earrings in hand it's difficult to compare. Also, if you purchase rubies for earrings, the settings are typically yellow or white gold instead of sterling silver. However, sterling silver is fine compared to other metals. You have to keep it polished, but I'm perfectly happy with sterling silver over gold.In order to compare these earrings with earrings made with real rubies, I took a picture of the earrings on and made a copy and superimposed the image of a real ruby. The difference in the price is significant ($126 vs. $8,500), but the appearance was not that much. However, suffice it to say, that while these earrings are not going to be confused with the ones sold at Harry Winston's, for the price, you get your money's worth. You can judge for yourself from the attached picture. (I superimposed a $4,266 ruby in an earring on the image on the right.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YD30V8CP9Q1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIW1DME#wasThisHelpful","R1YD30V8CP9Q1A","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some things are just easier to write in a notebook than a computer or computer tablet. Tablets are too much of a hassle to type on, and often what I need to take notes on are emanating from my computer in the form of online classes. (I'm a big edX and coursea MOOC fan.) The big notebooks (8.5 x 11) are fine if you have the entire desktop to yourself, but I share mine with a computer with a 27"" monitor, a smartphone on a tripod, a scanner and an embarrassing amount of other gizmos.

"At some point in time, Swiffer products began to accumulate in our cleaner cabinet. We have wet, dry and dusters plus I don't know how many more. So, what do we need another one for? It turns out that this new one called ""Sweep and Trap"" solved a problem we've had for years and never thought about. The dry Swiffer cleaning cloth is not any different (that I could discern) from our old Swiffer used for dry floor cleaning. (We have two stories of hardwood floors, and so there are plenty of surfaces for a dry Swiffer.) This new one has a rotating ""sweeper"" that picks up bulkier items and throws them into a holder that can easily be opened over the trash for discard. It's like a carpet sweeper for hardwood floors and dry Swiffer combination.Of course we do have vacuum cleaners (...we're not savages...) and they're used on a regular basis to pull up the debris that accumulates from living as well as visits from our grandchildren. Sometimes, however, we get little dry spills -- chopped nuts, leaves from an indoor tree, and dust bunnies -- (wet cleaners against dust bunnies result in what appear to be hairy drain clogs.) Neither the dry nor the wet Swiffers get  leaves, so, I was very happy to see that the Sweep & Trap pulled in  leaves and clung to everything from a pesky wrapping wire to dust bunnies (see photo).One of the most difficult areas to clean is under the TV and desktops with computers. Even in this day and age of WiFi, we still have wires everywhere. When using a vacuum cleaner (or a wet Swiffer), I'm afraid of getting electrocuted or breaking connections, but the wires are a favorite hiding place of dust bunnies and need to be attacked vigorously. Finding a dry solution in the Sweep and Trap was most welcomed, and while still a pain in the neck to clean around wires, this new Swiffer really helped.In looking at the negative reviews, it appears as though Swiffer listened to them and made adjustments. As to the gap between the rotating blades that toss the larger chunks into the holder, they added a ""cow-catcher"" in the blade gap. My experience indicates the Sweep & Trap does a good job, and in tight corners and around wires, this is a big plus. (See photos) Any manufacturer who listens to reviewers has my vote, and so kudos to Swiffer.Finally, in looking at the instructions, I found them in both English and French. Being a Francophile I was happy to see a French translation, but my initial reaction was, ""Que pensaient-ils?"" If only marketed in the US and the Canadian province of Quebec, that makes sense, but in the U.S. market, I'd think that Spanish would be a better second choice for instructions. (Of course they may have been thinking that having a French translation makes house cleaning look more chic--with the little green sneakers the pictured model has on--""Cela semble raisonnable."")","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIKP7JGXZ4WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBP7GPM#wasThisHelpful","R1WIKP7JGXZ4WI","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not too long ago, I had a loose nut on my lawn tractor, and I did not have a wrench that fit the nut. So I looked up the size in the tractor's manual and headed down to the hardware store and bought the wrench socket-holder and then (separately) the socket. It tightened up the nut, and I haven't had a problem with it since. That's why I like this 8-in-one set. While I don't need and/or use a socket wrench much, when I need one, I really need one. For one who seldom needs any wrench,  I can recommend this set of two ratchet wrenches. That's because every nut has a fitting size wrench, and this set of 8 standard non-metric sizes covers most of what I'll ever need. What's more, instead of taking up the space of 8 wrenches, this set fits well with just 2.The wrenches are made for what feels like a good grade steel, and the reversal switch on the ratchet makes it easy to tighten and un-tighten nuts and bolts using the ratchet. The two different sized wrenches is more useful than I realized as I was unable to get the larger of the two (4 sizes) wrenches in a confined space where a smaller nuts was set. The wrenches work on hex, square, 12-point, E-torx, partially rounded and spline heads. The eight sizes (inches) are: 5/16, 3/8, 7/16,1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, 3/4. Usually, more than enough of what I would need both in terms of sizes and head shapes.The only downside is that I like the open crescent wrench too. The obvious answer is to get an adjustable crescent wrench (what I have) but it is big and bulky. Besides, I was drilled to only use the proper wrench size and not depend on adjustables. That may have been a bit too extreme for the casual user like myself, but given that this set is not adjustable, I'm not too concerned one way or another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24RU6PD655NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRKN63U#wasThisHelpful","R24RU6PD655NV","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes what appear to be cliches either are not what they appear to be or they just work. In the Killing Kind by Chris Holm, I was happy with the strange brew of characters, some of whom appeared to be ""types"" expected in this kind of book. The basic premise of the book is that the hero, Michael Hendricks, an ex-Afghanistan vet, makes a living by killing killers. He has a wheelchair-bound buddy, Lester, who was in the same black flag unit with him in Afghanistan when his unit was wiped out by an IDE. Michael and his friend learn of people for whom a killing contract has been put out and they find the target and negotiate a big fat fee to knock-off the killer before the target is killed.The happy jumble of characters (and the book's premise) are thrown into a gunny sack with a plot, a wonderfully memorable villain -- hired to kill Michael -- and a couple of FBI agents, and shaken.  Special Agents Charlie Thompson (female) and Henry Garfield (a guy -- not the cat) are the FBI agents that become involved. Charlie suspects that someone (whom she identifies as the 'ghost') is shooting the shooters, but others in the Bureau (including the mildly misogynistic Garfield) aren't buying it, and they want to focus on the more routine kinds of investigations conducted by the FBI.The usual kind of bunk served up with this cast of characters is a clash between the hero and ""the girl"" who become lovers in the end after they have dispatched any number of villains. The girl's partner becomes bros with the hero, and Lester and Michael now have a solid contact in Federal law enforcement and their business thrives. Ta-da! (Not even close.) The book takes off with encounters between two killers the bad-guy killer and the good guy killer. The FBI gets into the act and the bad guys cannot allow their button men to be dispatched so well and frequently, and pretty soon our hero is up to his neck in adversaries.In any event, I think that you'll enjoy this book, and I hope that the author will send this unlikely hero out on other missions in future publications.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U55SUOJ59UAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316259535#wasThisHelpful","R2U55SUOJ59UAQ","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this shaver for one reason: trimming my beard. I have one of those beards that takes off like a free-range chicken, growing everywhere very fast. On top of that, grays have entered the mix of facial locks, and so if I don't do something about it, it looks too much like the two-tone British Jacob Sheep whose brown and white fleece are used in making yarn with different natural hues. My scissors just weren't hacking it for controlling my beard, and my ears were in danger of becoming casualties of my shearing efforts.Noting that the Philips Norelco S7720/90 7700 Shaver comes with a trimmer, I got it. The three-rotary head pulls off easily, and you pop on the trimmer in its place. Then you adjust the trimmer to one of five positions, ranging from short to long. It suggest that you start with the long, and pulling downward, trim you beard. So with it in the long position (5) I started a combing downward motion as the instructions said. Before I noticed, I had created a mess of trimmed hair on my chest and in the sink--not much, but enough to let me know it was working. I decided to go a little shorter (4) and after more trimming (more like combing) I got it just the way I wanted.You can use the trimmer without the comb attachment if you want, but the comb acts as a trim-guard that ensures that my beard is at a constant length. Once you have the comb attachment set to the right length you want, you can forget about it. Just pop it on the shaver, and comb downward for a nice near shave.I had not planned on using the three-head rotary that distinguish Norelco shavers, but I needed to shave the high-cheek and neck beard; so I tried it out. It was like there wasn't any blade in it it was so quiet and smooth. So kudos for the shaver too. It comes with a tub to keep the rotary heads nice and clean; so I can use it for cleaning, but the trimmer I'll have to clean with hot water and brush. That's ok since I plan on beard shaving once per week (or when needed) and I can clear it easily enough by hand.So, overall, I like this system, and even though I got it for one thing, beard trimming, I'd recommend it for regular shaving as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP0E0TOYG9N6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDAA#wasThisHelpful","RP0E0TOYG9N6E","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On a recent trip my wife purchased a number of antique silver earrings for gifts for the many women in our family. A lot of the jewelry today is made from silver-plated metal of unknown origins, and the antique jewelry apparently had the best chance of being genuine silver rather than a mystery metal. So, when I saw the Sterling Silver Twisted Hoop Earrings on Amazon, I thought she might like them.They certainly were as advertised, and not only did they look good on their own, they looked right with her other silver jewelry as well. (When you put inferior silver next to good quality silver, the difference is magnified.) So, everything worked as hoped.The only thing that my wife believed would help would be longer piercing stems. The current stems are relatively short and make the hoops stand out perpendicular to the ears—that may be a style choice by the designer—but my wife preferred ones that would lay flat and horizontal to the ears.

"By and large I enjoyed this book, and as long as you can put up with some of the more banal stereotypes and borrowed imagery I think you will too. The bad guy is a character named ""Mongo"" and for the life of me, I could not disassociate him from the bad cowboy of the same name who slugged his horse in Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles."" That aside, Mongo is a shrewd and efficient killer, and the story starts with his murdering a movie star, one Catherine Delure, and her manager. Very creative in that the reader knows the how the murder occurs, and we follow the NYPD detective as he tries to unravel the mystery first in New York City (where the murder takes place) and then in Los Angeles -- in Hollywood and Malibu. The investigation pits NYPD detective Jeb Barker against both the killer and the NYPD bureaucracy. Naturally, Jeb is a mustang (who drives...yes...a Ford Mustang) and even though he is an effective detective, he's always running afoul of the bureaucracy and shooting people who are really, really bad — like a puppy-kicking, parks-in-the-handicap-zone, child molester.As Jeb moves through the investigation, he encounters  Ms. Delure's housekeeper who refers to her late employer as ""Miz Delure"" sounding not unlike Hattie McDaniel who played ""Mammy"" in ""Gone with the Wind""-- however, the housekeeper has an Eastern European name; imagine a crazed Cloris Leachman playing ""Mammy,"" and you'll see the clashing images that wracked my mind. Later,  the author introduces a butler whose name is ""Cedric"" — that's about as close to ""Jeeves"" as you can get! Finally, the hero, Jeb Barker, tells the reader that he doesn't like ""rap"" music and the clothes the rappers wear--pants falling off and jangling medallions. He likes ""country"" music. Ok, we get it. The author, James Neal Harvey, is an old white guy. All the hero had to say was that he liked country music, and it is assumed that he doesn't like rap, hip hop and the genre of music favored by the young. (Back in the day, we were assured that listening to Elvis and Little Richard would doom our wretched souls to the deepest corners of hell.) Likewise, had the hero liked rap, we would assume that he did not favor country. Way to go Harvey!  Add to the great American divide.These dumb and lazy stereotypes of the politically correct rednecks aside, The Big Hit is an exciting read, and Harvey is a skilled storyteller. However, it's like having a wonderfully clean and ironed shirt and then smearing mustard all over it for no good reason at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCC291L2X8F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480485802#wasThisHelpful","R1YCC291L2X8F9","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tribest Sedona Combo SD-P9150-B Food Dehydrator looks like a microwave oven, but it is anything but. If you've ever bought dried fruit or jerky, it may have been processed in some kind of food dehydrator like this one. Since I like dried fruit as a healthy snack, the Sedona dehydrator seemed like a good choice. After reading the instructions and making sure that all of the packing material was out of the dehydrator, I gave it a test.It comes with nine mesh trays that you put the food on to be dehydrated and a closed tray to catch any drip along with a debris mat on the bottom. It has an upper and lower dehydrating compartments, and I wanted to begin testing by taking out all of the mesh trays except one to use and place the closed tray in the middle for a drip catcher. Then I planned to use only the upper compartment for the test.I tested it with three fruits: an apple thinly sliced, a banana sliced into three length-wise parts and a mango sliced as thin as I could. (They can be slippery and difficult to slice thinly--even with a sharpened knife.) The instructions that came with the dehydrator suggested that I add a little cinnamon and sugar to the banana as it lost taste when dried. I did the same with the apple slices but left the mango as-is. I set the suggested temperature (in Fahrenheit) to 110 and set it on the RAW mode. The RAW mode keeps the temperature at or below the set temperature while the FAST mode oscillates above and below the set temperature. It suggested checking it at 2, 4 and 8 hours. After 2 hours it was still pretty un-dehydrated, a little more after 3, and at 4 hours I took it out. The banana slices had shrunk considerably and the apple slices were pretty close to dry, but the mango was still very juicy, but drier to the touch. The banana still had moisture and with the cinnamon and sugar tasted like a rich candy.  The apple slices were almost chips but not quite, and the mango slices were like eating mango that didn't drip. The bananas and apples were hard to put down and were gone in short order. The mango was ok, but nothing very special. (A longer drying period was needed.)You have to read the instructions carefully to get everything set the way you want, but on my first try, it went quite smoothly. So, it's about like setting a microwave in terms of complexity.  The operation manual has several good recipes, but online I found hundreds of recipes for drying different kinds of food. One of the surprising practices in food drying is preparatory marinades. They sound really good, but if my experience is any measure, I just took fresh fruit and sliced it up with a little cinnamon and sugar. So if you want simple, it can do that quite well.Perhaps the most important thing about food dehydration I had to learn is the time it takes. Since the Combo Sedona dehydrator looks like a microwave oven, one can easily think that it's working in the same timeframe. It is not. To give you an idea, I want to make dried onion rings. It takes between 18-30 hours of dehydration; so you have to get used to the idea that this device is not for whipping up a quick afternoon snack, unless you plan a day ahead. So Wednesday's snacks should be made on Monday or Tuesday.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FIBL4N41UXN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUR325W#wasThisHelpful","R3FIBL4N41UXN3","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this set for my two grandsons who love to swim. The problem with children's fins and facemarks is the fit: especially the face mask. The U.S. Divers Youth Flare Jr Silicone Snorkeling Set Fun Blue Large 3-6 was tested by a 6-year old and a 10-year old, and they fit them both just fine. The 6-year old did say that he had a problem getting his face mask to fit right, but after he did, it worked as advertised.The kit comes with the kind of face mask that Jaques Clouseau used in his ocean explorations, and includes both eye coverings and a nose fitting; much more appropriate for snorkeling than the old round ones we used to have. They were guaranteed to leak. What turns out to be one of the best features of this kit is the carrying bag that comes with it. It looks like an oblong backpack with a netting cover so that damp equipment is less likely to mildew or get stinky during storage.

"Alliterative titles tend to belong in the children's sections of libraries or in the old serial dramas they used to show in theaters in the 30s and 40s. So the title Sierra Skullduggery --or Sierra Sidewinders, or Sierra Swindlers--it doesn't matter; the author was going for alteration--is only generally related to the story. So why even bother with a western title of this assumptive ilk? First of all, you can find gems in unexpected places. Some of the early noir novels by Charles Willeford were westerns (Deliver me from Dallas!) and so were some of Jim Thompson's novels--(Pop 1280 ).  I'm not a big  Louis L'Amour or Zane Grey fan, but every now and again, I'll read a western for a change of pace.This one involves an ex-gunfighter, ex-confederate soldier turned freight hauler in the area around Placerville, Auburn and Sacramento. (The three towns form a triangle with Sacramento in the west and both Placerville and Auburn in the Sierra foothills.) The ex-rebel is now married and his freight hauling business is running smoothly, and he has put his gunslinger past behind him. However, an evil Yankee captain during the Battle of the Wilderness had gunned down men in his unit after they surrendered and was now available to get shot by some mysterious men who want to hire the hero, Tom Patterson. The bad Yankee captain was a tempting target, but the Union Army had  cashiered the man and thoroughly dishonored him and both sides in the Civil War had committed atrocities (cough-cough-Andersonville) and so Tom figured to leave all the past behind. Then to make matters worse, the mysterious men decided to kidnap his wife to encourage Tom to take the job, and the story is off and running.The story is fun, the wife turns out to be quite self-sufficient and it's characters are well drawn. However, in the middle of the book, while Tom is on the run, he encounters a former slave who is eking out a life as a prospector. The former slave claims, ""Had a good life, but damned Yankees had to make me free and ruin it all."" The hero is a former rebel and the first black man he meets is wishin' fer dem good ole days when he was a slave. Seriously!!?? This isn't western noir; it's redneck re-write.The rest of the book and story reads like an episode of the old TV Show ""Gunsmoke."" In fact, the story is pretty good, but it's like introducing a main character as one who is a fervent Nazi and then saying, ""otherwise he's a pretty good guy"" and ignoring the fact for the rest of the novel. Either Jerry Drake, the author, is wholly clueless and historically blind, and Amazon Encore, who published it never proofread it for idiotic content, but slavery (on the whole) was not viewed  by slaves and former slaves as a decent way to survive.There's an old saw about how to make lead into gold; you heat up the lead and stir it without thinking of the word, ""rhinoceros"" and soon the lead will turn into gold. That same is true with books: it was hard to finish it without thinking of the word ""redneck"" or ""racist"" but that was what happened. The book just wasn't the same after that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7NTLKANYQDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612186475#wasThisHelpful","R1R7NTLKANYQDX","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first tried a Nutri-Grain Cereal Bar, I cut it in half and gave the other half to my better half. It struck me that the divided bar looked exactly like a Fig Newton. First I tried Apple, and liked it a lot. Next, I tried the Blueberry, and it too was good and tasted blueberry enough to know what it was. Finally, I sampled the Strawberry. It was ok, but it had more a generic sugar-based goo taste than the taste of real strawberries--more like strawberry preserves that (despite best efforts) don't exactly taste much like fresh strawberries either.The bars are wrapped in a generous crust of whole wheat that has a cookie-like flavor--reminded me of oatmeal a bit--not overly sweet.  Again, think ""Fig Newton"" but in a whole wheat wrapper rather than a Fig Newton one.Next, I pulled out my mobile iPhone app and scanned one of the cereal bars for WeightWatchers information. It came up with 3 points for the whole thing and the following breakdown:Fat: 3g (no trans fat!)Fiber 3gCarbohydrates: 24gProtein 2gFurther information for diabetics indicated 1.5 carb exchanges and .5 fat exchanges. It also shows a stamp from the Whole Grains Council indicating 8 grams of whole wheat per serving. Each bar has 120 calories.Overall, they taste good, and they have a very good after-taste. I like the fact that they're whole grain, and so while clearly not an organic food, they seem very healthy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TIYH6NC8IBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9ZV1AY#wasThisHelpful","R31TIYH6NC8IBX","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, let me say that I am not a professional wood-worker or carpenter. However, I have all kinds of things in and around the house that need attention or adjusting where I use power saws--rotary, jigsaw, and chain. Recently, I've been working on fence gates and my deck. In both cases I had to use my jigsaw for cutting off over-long wood screws and replacing bowed or broken planks and dividers in my wood deck.I had recently purchased some Bosch blades for my jigsaw--one set for wood and another for metal. The later I needed for shortening wood screws that protruded in the gate, and cutting through metal with a jigsaw  -- even using a great blade -- is a chore. The saw bucked like a wild bronco and while it finally did the job, it was not fun.As part of the deck maintenance, I bought some extruded aluminum stair edging. I got the six-foot strips that had to be cut in two for my 36-inch steps. This was a perfect test for the Blade Runner because cutting through L-shaped extruded aluminum can be a jolting experience. There was no drama as the provided aluminum cutting blade zipped right through it. (The Blade Runner comes with blades for cutting wood, aluminum, steel, ceramic tile and scrolling.)The BladeRunner is easy to set up, including the guide bars and the miter gauge. Since I had recently bought new Bosch T-shank blades for my jigsaw, I found that I could use the same set for the Blade Runner.  It also comes with a connector for an exhaust hose for blowing out sawdust, but I did not use it since the hose was not included with the saw.It's easy to carry and move, and it's small enough for the relatively narrow workbench I have in the garage. The on-off switch is located in the front right leg housing and is easy to quickly switch on or off. It even has a little saw blade drawer in the front. I don't know how practical it would be for a lot of heavy-duty cutting, but for the kind and amount of cutting I do, it's the perfect table saw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB2DHSH983S3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L47FZ8A#wasThisHelpful","RB2DHSH983S3J","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a TV where we also have our exercise equipment. When we walk on the treadmill, we like to watch TV while enduring the costs of healthy exercise. The treadmill is not hugely loud, but it is loud enough that we miss a lot of the audio from a TV program. This Bose CineMate 15 Home Theater Speaker System seemed like a solution to grinding out the walking and being able to hear.We have a big flat-screen Panasonic TV in the exercise room, and the Bose system is designed to re-route the sound from the TV's speakers to the hefty pair Bose provides. The small long speaker goes in front of the TV, and the big woofer (think tower PC, 1995) is placed off to the side. For some reason our Panasonic had none of the audio-out ports for using the connectors provided; basically an RCA pair and a fibre optic connector. (Earlier we had tried to add a wireless headset, but we ran into the same audio-out problem.) So, I had to plug in the speakers to the cable box using the optical connector, and it worked fine.What I was unable to accomplish was to sync the universal remote to the TV via the cable box. Since the speakers go through the cable box, I tried to sync the cable box. In the list of devices provided, Bose includes a list that seems to do a pretty good job of exhausting all of the different devices--including two types of AT&T cable boxes. (And Frontier cable, which took over some of our programming in cahoots with AT&T.) Using the Bose remote, I can turn the speakers on and off, but the TV is completely controlled controlled by the TV remote. Why? We had a nightmarish problem getting the TV and the cable box synched up on our old remote, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm good with a remote for the Bose speakers and one for the TV. For me, it actually simplified things. All I have to do is to use the TV remote to turn on the TV & cable box and then use the Bose remote for turning on the speakers.Ok, so how does it sound? For me, it did not seem to do much for the sound except that I thought that I heard things coming our of the woofer that I didn't realize were being sent from the TV station. Then I realized that I had on both the TV sound and the Bose sound; so I muted the TV and heard the Bose system really for the first time. By switching back and forth, I was able to see that the Bose CineMate 15 Home Theater Speaker System really did make a clear difference.  Getting better sound than what you get from the speakers built into and shipped with a standard TV may not seem like a huge leap since the TV speakers are generally so-so (especially for audiophiles.) However, once you get used to the added sound quality supplied by the Bose system, not a lot of people will ever again be satisfied with their standard TV speakers.One problem I wish they'd fix is that somewhat convoluted way that you have to use to set it up. I wish you could just plug it in without having to mess with the remote or anything else. In fact I wish they'd dump the remote and have the whole thing just play after plugging in the speakers to the TV. The power supply in the speakers could be handled with a simple analog switch--an on/off button with no remote.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15HYWS5SRMG19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1SSWXU#wasThisHelpful","R15HYWS5SRMG19","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had begun reading this book slowly because of time constraints and other projects, but at some point I could not put it down. It's the kind of book that will make a cross-country flight go by in the flash of a gunshot and keep you up at night. Recently, I had finished an equally fascinating non-fiction book, and often after reading a well-written book, whatever comes next pales by comparison. Not this one.Sometimes best-selling authors get into a hackneyed, predictable style, but ""Woman With a Gun"" by Phillip Margolin reflects a master storyteller at the top of his game. If you like the classic whodunit mysteries, this one will knock your socks off, but I tend to favor more the novel noir of the Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford genre. This novel has a touch of both--keeps you guessing and is populated by flawed and interesting characters.A literary and cinematic effect of late are ones that jump around timeframes. Such an effect can be disconcerting or add interest. This book jumps between current day (2015) and 10 years ago (2005). It starts with an eager beaver wannabe novelist in NYC who sees a photo of a woman with her back to the camera holding a gun in a wedding dress at a MMoMA exhibit. She is so taken with the photo, she plans to write a novel based on the photo. It turns out that the photo was taken of a woman shortly after her husband was murdered on their wedding night in 2005. Then the story shifts to 2005 and the investigation of the homicide in a little Oregon town south of Portland. So, while starting with 2015, the first half of the book involves the people and characters during the original homicide and its investigation in 2005. Then the second after picks where it started with the budding novelists leaving NYC and traveling the Oregon to research the original homicide to get background and ideas for her novel based on the woman with the gun.The characters are well-drawn, the plot is a hoot and even the romances are believable and add spice to the story. However, it is not Portlandia, but more of a love affair with small seaside towns on the Oregon coast and the city of Portland. So while many of the characters are dark, conflicted and interesting, the setting are not.A major clue is in the photograph on the cover, but don't try to figure it out. It's subtle but there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185SP6VFRCV8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062266527#wasThisHelpful","R185SP6VFRCV8J","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fire and Movement: The British Expeditionary Force and the Campaign of 1914 by Peter Hart chronicles the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for the last four and a half months of 1914. Made up of only four infantry divisions (organized into two corps) and a calvary division, the BEF was minuscule (around 80,000) compared to the giant armies of both the French and Germans numbering in the millions. Much of the British thinking about war was based on the Boer Wars ending in 1902 with a British victory. In fact, the Second Boer War is considered by some as the first total war where the British crushed the Boers (Dutch Afrikaners). Field Marshall John French, who had distinguished himself as the commander of a calvary division in the Boer War was appointed to lead the BEF in France and Lord Kitchener as Secretary of State for War, given overall responsibility for the army.The first major  BEF action in 1914 was the Battle of Mons, where the British have been characterized as mowing down legions of German troops, despite being hopelessly outnumbered. After their heroic stand, they are finally forced to retreat because of terrible losses due to overwhelming odds. In addition, the French have skedaddled and left their right flank hanging in the air. We learn from Hart that the French had informed the British of their withdrawal; the problem lay in the BEF's hopelessly incompetent staff organization and their inability to communicate information. While it is true that the Germans lost about 2,000 troops to the British, 1,600, the Germans were attacking machine guns, relatively accurate rifle fire and artillery. (Some reports claim a 10-1 British-German loss ratio, which do not jive with the best available facts.)  After the initial German victories, the Allies retreat, and the BEF ends up all the way south and east of Paris. One problem that Hart points out is that the British are not very good at retreating because their entire military philosophy is based on ""offensive thinking."" They muddle through the retreat suffering heavy losses in killed, wounded and captured, but the BEF no longer is the same BEF that came to the continent. The BEF commander, John French realizes that he cannot use the dashing calvary advances (least of all a charge) so loved by dim-witted calvary officers, and he proves to be equally inept at either organizing a competent staff or using a good staff organization to run a modern army. Hart points out that the long British habit of blaming the French for their own failures does not hold true, and even worse, the British often celebrate failure (such as the retreat to Paris) as a virtue.Throughout the book, Hart again and again debunks history of the BEF based on a one-sided view, and gives the French full credit for beating off the German advances. At the same time, he gives the BEF full credit where due as well, such as holding off the Germans in the First Battle of Ypres, and the very real adaptations the British made in light of their experiences in 1914.Hart is not a Monday-morning quarterback by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, he takes a detached view of the events, gathers volumes of evidence and goes about showing the reader how decisions were made. No one going into WWI knew how it would play out. The Germans seemed to have had the best idea and be the best prepared. For example, their trench mortars and hand grenades were very effective for the trench warfare that quickly developed. The British improvised, but in 1914, at least, they had no such weapons except those the soldiers improvised themselves.The book is a carefully woven quilt told through the eyes of the soldiers, their leaders and the staff on both sides. Using letters, journals, written commands and diaries, Hart both illustrates and explains what it was like to be a British soldier in the conditions of attack, retreat, and stuck in the trenches in Flanders in and around Ypres. You also get to see the German soldier's view who fought against the British. They believed that the BEF had been well-trained in aimed shots in quick succession using their Lee Enfield rifles. That was true, but I did not get the impression that Hart believed the training in actually hitting a target was important as was rapid fire the BEF soldiers had mastered. One of the stranger episodes related by the author is the use of the Royal Naval Division concocted by Winston Churchill. Navy reservists were gathered together to act as temporary infantry and sent to Antwerp to keep it out of German hands. They were given guns and brief instruction on how to load and fire them. One night an old white cow was lazily grazing in no man's land and the RND, thinking it was the Germans, blasted away at the cow, and after thousands of shots, the cow wandered off without a scratch. Perhaps the practice devoted to aimed fire actually had more impact than realized. (Most of the RND either ended up in POW camps or interred in Holland. Relatively few were wounded, but the author notes that Churchill's overweening confidence in his grasp of military strategy would lead to other doomed missions later in the war--Gallipoli in particular.)Overall, Hart's work is the best I've seen depicting and explaining not only the role of the BEF in 1914 but doing so in a book that was hard to put down. He corrects many of the popular misconceptions, the ""Miracle on the Marne"" being one. He gives French General Joffre full credit for realizing the mistake the Germans make in opening a flank and skillfully exports that opening by shifting French troops from the east to west. The Germans are forced all the way back to the Ainse. So, far from being a ""miracle,"" it is simply excellent application of sound military principles employed by Joffre. The BEF happened to be available to help exploit a gap between German armies, and this they do with what had been considered a beaten army. Quickly, the stalemate on the Ainse line gives rise to the opportunity to attack the other's western flank, which each side attempts to do, leading to the misnamed ""race to the sea.""By the end of the year, opposing forces are facing one another in positions that will be little changed by 1918 when the war ends. The BEF is in Flanders supporting the Belgian army on their left and the French army on their right. A new model army being forged by Kitchener is still in the making and won't be available until the next year.A set of 12 maps is spread throughout the book and are essential for following the ebb and flow of the ever-changing battlefield during 1914. The BEF begins near the Maubeuge fortress behind the Meuse, based on  a 1920 Ordnance Survey map and ends up near Ypres in December 1914 shown on a 1924 Ordinance Survey map. Other Ordinance Survey maps used are from 1932  and 1923. As an aside, I also used other maps of the 1914 battles and kept seeing ""BEF: French."" That makes it look like the BEF is part of a French army, but ""French"" is simply the name of the BEF commander.Also, a 16-page set of B & W photographs accompany the book. Hart's description of the clay mud in Flanders is so accurate that when you look at the photographs of the 1st Cameronians in the trenches at Houplines and the 11th Hussars in the trenches at Zillebeke (in Ypres area) they show exactly what Hart describes in their damp misery. The flatness of the terrain in Flanders shows why the troops (and officers) were forced to dig holes in the mud and muck to protect themselves from artillery and machine gun fire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUGZH6LIZYS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199989273#wasThisHelpful","R2WUGZH6LIZYS7","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my new HP Envy with Windows 8.1 and a touch-screen. Without much trouble I was able to quickly move my finger along the screen to create a drawing. However, after a short while, I found I could no more make a decent shape with my finger than I could in the first grade where we had actual finger paint. I could not use the French curve or other tools for drawing aids with my finger. I imagine that most artists have some kind of drawing pad and stylus, and so I loaded up SketchBook Pro 7 on my iMac and used the wireless mouse as a drawing tool. Immediate improvement. All of the tools worked fine--different brushes, pens, pencil as well as the ellipse and straight ruler, French curve and all other tools.The tools are arrayed in an odd sort of collection. There's the ""lagoon"" in the lower left corder where a quarter circle has the icons for interface controls, tools | views,  brushes, colors, edit and files. When you click the icon, a circle of icon selections appear and you drag the mouse from the center to the icon you want. This was very difficult to do with a touch screen, but simple for a mouse and I imagine a stylus. You can place another menu bar across the top that has similar controls as the lagoon. It's a lot easier for me to use, and if it gets in the way of the drawing, it can be removed and you still have the lagoon.Since almost all of my artwork is for the web, I was interested in getting the hexadecimal values for the colors. That was the only thing they did not have (or have it so well hidden I could not find it.) The color menu (on the Mac) has 5 different color mixing/choosing options from a color sphere with an adjacent slide bar to a box of crayons. The color slider shows the RGB colors in decimal values, and they can work for specifying text and object colors using the format rgb(220,20,60) or if HSL (HSB) hsl(348, 83%, 58%) coding. (Would it kill them to have the hex value too?) Anyway, just about everything I want to do with color is available. This include a Copic color menu with icons that when selected show the complimentary color (great idea!) and two ""color pucks,"" of fill and stroke colors. The fill  (color) puck will display a wheel and square color selector if you hold down the mouse on it.As a non-artist, I really felt that I could do more with this tool for free-hand drawing than with any other drawing tool I've used. I've seen what artists can do with this tool, and it's amazing. It seems to have been designed with artists in mind and not dabblers like myself. If they'd only package an artist with SketchBook, I'd be over the moon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R348BK3E1NNMGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI95DNG#wasThisHelpful","R348BK3E1NNMGK","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A while back I saw a story on TV about a guy who went into the baggage claim areas in airports, selected a bag and walked off with it. The security camera showed the thief selecting black canvas covered bags that looked like most of the other bags that came down the bag carrel. The theft-prevention expert explained that luggage selected by thieves was generally those kinds of bags that would not cause second-notice by anyone else who had a similar bag. So if someone walked right by you with your stolen luggage, you wouldn't notice until it showed up missing. Even then, you'd probably think that the airlines lost it, and if you did report it lost or ""missing,"" it's unlikely you'd think it stolen.So, when I saw the Double Dutch Club Safari Ride 20 Inch Hardside, Elephants, I knew that it was not a bag any thief would dream of stealing. First of all, it is unique, and if I saw another in an airport, I'd know it was mine. Second, it looks like something a 9-year old girl would load up with clothes and kid-stuff that isn't worth stealing. Finally, it has a hard side that I can use either for carry-on or checked. I like the hard shell bags since they give better protection so that a bottle of after-shave gets broken it won't give the rest of your clothes an over-colonged aroma. The wheel arrangement is the kind I like too. The bag can be turned sideways to easily move down the aisle. It has sufficient room inside and a little bag for cosmetics (candy-flavored lipstick?) and what-not.Finally, the pièce de résistance is the pink cover that comes with the bag that acts as a bag cover--the design looks like the logo on a college sweatshirt. So the combination appears to be an irresistible combination of girly-girl design armed with it's own wardrobe, exposing the little elephant design underneath.So, instead of smirking at this bag--embrace it. It's very practical, well-designed, and has little elephants that even Democrats cannot resist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRGOIYW9B92TC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPC4490#wasThisHelpful","RRGOIYW9B92TC","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All of my photo devices are now digital, and I needed something to print out photos.  The Epson Expression Premium XP-620 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner works very well to print out these photos, and while it has several other uses (printer, scanner, etc.), I got it for and use it for printing our photos. (I have a laser printer for written documents that require printing.)At the outset let me say that once it's set up, it works fine with a wireless connection. However, it took me almost half a day to set it up. The instructions look very simple with big numbers showing the steps. I made it to Step 2 before I got stuck. The control panel on the front is used to configure the printer, and following the steps I selected what I thought were the correct configuration steps. When I got to the end, it would not let me configure it. So I turned it off, and when I turned it back on, it let me finish the configuration. Following the installation of the 5 ink cartridges that come with the printer, which you need to be careful to collect all 5 when unpacking. (Treat these carefully; a replacement set runs $40 on Amazon).  I loaded standard 8.5 x 11 paper I use with my laster printer. It was a bit awkward because Inside the printer tray is a ""cassette tray"" for smaller size paper  used with different photo sizes for frames.I skipped Step 5 to connect to a Fax line, and went to Step 6 to install the software on my Mac with the latest OS X. It turns out that the CD that comes with the printer doesn't work with OS X. (C'mon!--the instructions are printed in French on the other side! The French love Macs!) You're instructed to go to a URL to download the drivers for the Mac. Ok, I can deal with that, but once I arrived at the site, I got a list with every printer driver Epson makes; which is close to 2 billion. (Maybe a little less.) Why not have a picture of the printer with the linked type, a single button that says, OS X drivers? Anyway, after fishing for the correct drivers, I downloaded and installed them all.Then, I went to the control panel, made the WiFi link to my ISP and tinkered some more with the control panel. I still don't know if everything was done correctly in the control panel because they seemed to be out of sync with the instructions (such as they were) and configured it for my WiFi and planned use of the printer. I also configured the driver on my iMac, which was pretty simple.I opened up a photo file (.jpg) and re-sized it in Adobe Fireworks, and printed it over the wireless connection. It worked perfectly. You have to pull out the feeder tray when printing, but that's ok with me. It was simple and it worked.Not leaving well enough alone, I noticed a section called ""Mobile printing"" on the instructions for iOS/Android. So I scanned the coded image, and my phone loaded up the Epson app for printing. It was easy to get to the printing part and selecting the print and the printer, but I could not get it to print. Easy to set up but not too easy to use. Eventually, I got it to do what I wanted but I should not have to arm wrestle the software.There's always been a software lag behind hardware, and some manufacturers just don't pay that much attention to the software. On a scale of 1 to 5, the printer is an engineering marvel is definitely a ""5"", but the software is only a ""1."" In a day and age where printers are making less and less sense with image display and distribution handled (in full color) using PDF files, you need a good reason to even consider a printer. The scanners are handy for taking old printed materials and digitizing them for Internet distribution and overhead display, but fewer uses are justified for a printer; especially one with awkward UI/UX. What you get for $100 is an amazing piece of multi-function hardware, but three refills of the printer ink exceeds the original hardware price.We are approaching a time when managers who insist on paper copies of anything other than meeting agendas, are considered not only wasteful but Luddites or Neanderthals to boot. I like the ability to use this printer for printing pictures for personal use and sharing with the shrinking number of friends and relatives who are not part of the Internet. The scanner helps to make documents available for  Internet sharing, but the software makes it such a chore to operate the brilliant hardware design that it is less and less worth the bother. I implore Epson to incorporate user-testing and work with HCI/UX developers. Otherwise, there may be even fewer people who are willing to plunk down $100 for the machine and $40 for the ink refills.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3STE18L8TQEG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHW1AOQ#wasThisHelpful","R3STE18L8TQEG1","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years now I've used Sennheiser headsets, and I much prefer their over-the-ear headphones to anything in-the-ear. They're a bit hefty, but they work fine. Their cords are rather long, but that's not a big problem and they have the advantage of being able to plug in just about anywhere and reach me. However, when I use them to go on a walk the cord has to be wrapped up and tied.In trying out the AmazonBasics On-Ear Headphones, I was mainly concerned with their sound quality compared to my Sennheisers. They are (much) lighter, the headphones are smaller,  they can be twisted flat for easier storage or toting in the black bag that comes with the headphones, and they cost about $7 less than my Sennheisers. Two things that struck me about these AmazonBasics is their sound quality and comfort. On taking them for a walk plugged into my iPhone, it was like not having any headset on at all. That's how light and comfortable they are.These do not have the sound quality of the Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, but they cost about $285 less than the Bose. I did not believe that you could get a decent set of headphones for $15, but you can. At that price I can get one for home and one for the office.

"This book is an easy one to read and come away wringing your hands about the Bush-Obama policies in ""America's longest war."" The quote, ""As the result of two successful campaigns, of the employment of an enormous force, and of the expenditures of large sums of money,"" the secretary of state observed, ""all that has yet been accomplished has been the disintegration of the State . . . and a condition of anarchy throughout the remainder of the country"" , nicely sums up the current situation. That statement was not uttered by Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton or John Kerry, but instead by Spencer Cavendish, Marquis of Hartington, the British secretary of state for India in 1880. I have no doubt that in 1989, the Soviet foreign secretary harbored similar sentiments, and the American public today certainly would not disagree.""One Million Steps,"" however, is from the worm's eye view of war boiled down to the platoon and squad level. Bing West, a former Marine grunt from the Vietnam War era examines both the context of the war and the consequences of the different policies and leaders. He takes a tiny section of Helmand Providence not far from the Pakistan border in southern Afghanistan. West chose the unit he did because the Marine of the 3/5 had the highest casualty rate of any fighting unit in Afghanistan.  Ideally, the Marines would like to have a war with clear objectives, no civilians to get in the way and the right support in terms of weapons and supplies. (Iwo Jima springs to mind.) Of these, the Marines only had the last one--weapons and supplies.Objectives were divided between battle and ""nation building,"" but the 3/5 focused on battle. Their job was to fight the Taliban and win the hearts and minds of the Afghans living in the area. Most were farmers growing poppies for opium, alternating with corn for food. (The opium tar brought in four-fold the income that corn does.) The Bush administration decided that we didn't need another War on Drugs to lose; so the policy was to leave the poppy and marijuana fields alone. However, in Taliban areas, the opium trade was their main source of income, and while the Marines could not destroy the poppy crops (policy-wise), they could make the Taliban pay dearly for it. And that's exactly what they did.The entire action centers around farmland next to the Helmand River where the Marines are on daily patrols to confront and kill Taliban. The main destructive weapon used by the Taliban is the IED, clay jugs of explosives set off by trip wires and wooden pressure plates connected to small batteries. The clay jugs and wooden pressure plates are invisible to mine detectors. Often, when one would go off injuring or killing a Marine, the taliban (part-time taliban) and Taliban (the pros) would attempt to surround and kill the Marine patrol. Generally, the tactic did not work because of superior tactics, training, firepower and organization of the Marines, and several Taliban would be wounded or killed.After patrol experience showed that Marine snipers attached to the patrol were more successful at killing Taliban, they became a regular part of the patrols. To counter this tactic, the Taliban would set up further away from the Marines so that they would not be picked off by snipers and kept their heads down until the Marines were close enough to be hit by machine gun, mortar or PRG fire. This is the exact opposite of Giap's tactic of ""fighting close to the belt"" so that the Americans could not use their superior fire power to bomb or shell the NVA. That's exactly what the Marines did; they'd call in a 60mm mortar attack, helicopters and the converted cargo planes bristling with guns -- canons, mini-guns and rockets. In addition an F-16 could be called upon to drop 500 lb bombs on Taliban positions. The air support also acted as aerial intelligence--they were able to radio the Taliban positions along with a high tech blimp that was downlinked to portable computers. The daily aggressive patrolling effectively kept the Taliban at bay, but as everyone on both sides knew, the Marines would be going home, and the Taliban would still be there.As a book on small unit tactics and experiences in Afghanistan, I've not seen the equal to this. Bing West does all he can to divorce what the average grunt must do to achieve his military and warrior goals from the larger political and humanitarian goals--and that of ""nation-building."" At one time the Marines had to pass a request for artillery support through an attorney--this included the company's mortars--before a fire mission. So on many levels, this book could have been insanely frustrating, but instead West brings it together around the role of the ""warrior"" in the Marine Corps--their culture and history. So no matter what you may think of the policies of ""America's longest"" (and expensive!) war, the Marines are doing what they've alway been doing in their long and storied history: aggressively fighting enemies, and despite losses and setback, they do it well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CRFDAOQERENI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400068746#wasThisHelpful","R3CRFDAOQERENI","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested the Linksys USB 3.0 Ethernet Adapter on a brand-new HP Envy running Windows 8.1. The installation using the enclosed CD worked easily. I plugged in the Adapter to a USB 3 port and ran a speed test provided by my ISP, AT&T. The speed showed:Down: 18.11 MbpsUp: 1.93 MbpsThen I shut down the computer, unplugged the adapter and restarted it. This time I connected into it to my wireless provided by the same ISP. This time I got:Down: 11.34 MbpsUp: 1.95 MbpsA governor of some sort keeps the upload speed to around 2 Mbps; so that was not expected to change. However, the speed with the adapter was an improvement of about 38% over the wireless. Obviously, if your computer has an ethernet connection built in, the adapter isn't going to be a big help. Further my old MacBook Pro yanked a speed of 23 Mbps from the same wireless, which was faster than the wired or wireless on the Envy. So, the speed is not only determined by the speed of the connected service, it's also determined by the computer you're using. Be that as it may, newer, lighter laptops may only provide narrow USB3 connections, and if you want a wired high speed port you're out of luck unless you have an adaptor than can slip into a USB3 port and make the wired connection. This product was shown to do the trick.As a side note, Linksys needs to do a much better job with the software needed to download in cases where the computer has no built-in or external CD drive. I went to their Web site to download the driver needed, but I was unable to do so because their site was so convoluted. It was easy enough to find the Linksys USB 3.0 Ethernet Adapter on the site, but when I attempted to download the driver for the adapter, I could not do so. HCI and UX are not options!

"I really wished I had liked these better, but while nice and coconutty, they were a bit oily for my taste. I have a great deal of respect for products with the Fair Trade mark, which means that children aren't exploited in the agriculture work with the coconuts.

A regular piece of coconut right out of the shell is more tasteful.Overall, while I applaud Nutiva's dedication to providing food that won't kills us or pay starvation wages to agriculture workers, I just wished it tasted better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356T63OE3Y742/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRFLDR2#wasThisHelpful","R356T63OE3Y742","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love color, but I usually use hexadecimal values in putting together color schemes for display on a Web site. The computing part I understand. The Datacolor SCK200 SpyderCHECKR 24 is a big step in the direction toward professional color use, and it is designed for photographers, of which I count myself among the enthusiastic amateurs. So getting this is a step in getting better pictures beyond what I can do with Photoshop Elements on ""automatic fix.""The quality of the colors on the board are brilliantly displayed, and I was careful not to smudge any. First, I created a DIY light box for placing the CHECKR 24 in for taking a test photo. Next, using a GoPro still and an iPhone 4S still, I took a picture of the 24-square color board. I used diffused light from the top and both sides with ambient light in the front where I had placed the camera. Then, I downloaded the Datacolor software, and using a magnifying glass to make sure that I copied them correctly, I entered the serial numbers. (It turns out that if you leave in the dashes, the software does recognize the black-on-silver numbers-- that are easy for superman and others with X-ray vision to make out. Note to Datacolor: Make the serial numbers bigger and more readable like the 8 digits below the serial number.)Once the software was downloaded and installed, all I had to do was to drag in the photos (that I had imported to my computer), and it automatically created a preset for me. When you drag in the photo of the color card, you might find that you have to do some horizontal and/or vertical flips in your prep software. (I used Adobe Fireworks.) Then you drag the sides so that the color in the little squares correspond to the color in the squares in the photo--pretty easy once your realize that you don't drag the tabs but the sides. Since the software knows that the colors should match, it can set up the presets that you can load into Adobe Lightroom (which I used) or Photoshop or even Photoshop Elements or some other software photographers use for getting color and lighting right.I used a Mac with OS X Mavericks, and I was unable to locate where the presets were stored. The path supplied by the software went into oblivion. However, since I saved the presets as Lightroom settings, when I opened Lightroom, I was able to find them under User Presets. In this way I could load the presets up with the photo of the color squares synched to the presets the SpyderCheckr software used when I dragged the digital file into SpyderCheckr. Of course the real test comes you use the same camera with the same lighting conditions and take a picture of something else in the same light box (or tent). The presets should make adjustments to your photo so that the colors are just right.Any good photographer (including a striving amateur) knows that the right lighting makes the right photograph. However, you can't always get good lighting or the right lighting. However, using Datacolor and SpyderCheckr and programs like Photoshop and Lightroom, you can make huge improvements. As more and more amateurs click away with their digital mobile devices, more and more images are going to be from these sources. Professional photographers are clearly a different breed and know the importance of using the kind of adjustments that are afforded by Datacolor SCK200 SpyderCHECKR 24. However, the same products are also a big help to us lesser lights who keep trying to improve our digital photos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PM27ZZ6UD5WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPS46TW#wasThisHelpful","R2PM27ZZ6UD5WF","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book gets off the ground quickly, but at times it got into a briar patch of characters with names American readers may find complexing. However, for a serial killer novel, this one takes a unique turn. It asks, in effect, is torture in battle is justified? For example, if torture will save the life of a kidnapped child or defuse a dirty bomb set for a nuclear detonation -- is it justified?Some American readers may be put off by what appears to be anti-Americanism; but it really is not. There are stereotypes and date mistakes (for example working for Macintosh (Apple) in 1978 when the Mac didn't debut until 1984. In '78, the Apple II was just getting off the ground.) The musing of ""How  does America generate so many serial killers?"" is just plain dumb. As a country of 300 million, the US has its proportion of nut jobs just as does Sweden and the rest of the world. (Sweden's population of 8 million requires very few such killers to equal that of the US.)There's good humor as Americans mis-pronounce Swedish names, but Swedes probably do the same with American names; so enjoy a view of Americans from the perspective of another country.The killer (Kentucky Killer) is narrowed down early as having something to do with a special ""torture group"" that Nixon set up during Vietnam, but we know from POW reports that the North Vietnamese were not exactly operating under the rules of the Geneva Convention. However, we're supposed to be the good guys, and when we're not, we hear it loudly from those who expect more of us. The killer goes to Sweden, and so we're invited along on the investigation. In some places, I wondered whether the author was padding the story, but overall, it trudged along to a very vivid and surprising ending.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GEJPAZXR9V0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375425365#wasThisHelpful","R1GEJPAZXR9V0","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My workbench is organized with power tools, wrenches, screwdriver sets, plus various and sundry saws, hammers, sanders and pliers. However, there are more times than I can count that I've needed a good pair of scissors. Try cutting sandpaper with pliers or a box cutter. They need to be heavy duty, durable and (in my case) fit into my multi-holed tool-holder.

It goes through them like a knife through warm butter.Several other happy consequences have come from having my own shop scissors. I don't have to use the ones in the kitchen junk drawer, I don't have to run all over the house looking for scissors or getting into my wife's sewing tools.

"I am a flosser, and I don't like it. Every evening I pull out my waxed floss and go to town on my pearly whites. This is not something I relish, but I need to save all my teeth. So, when I saw the Waterpik Cordless Professional Water Flosser, I jumped at it. (Honestly, I could care less about the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with it, but more on that later.) Following the instructions I charged it, filled up the water reservoir with luke warm water and started Niagara Falls in my mouth to the sink. You're supposed to hold the Flosser at a 90 degree angle so that the water flosser head is at the correct angle with your gums, but if you do that, there's no way that the torrent of water coming out of your mouth is not going to dribble all over the Water Flosser and your arm (I don't care what the picture shows of the correct use of the Flosser; in the real world, your arm and the Water Flosser are going to be drenched.) Then, just when you're getting used to the idea, it runs out of water and ends water flossing. Its water capacity is described as ""45 seconds."" That's right on the button. You get drenched for 45 seconds at a throw.Initially, I was thinking 1 Star with the tag line borrowed from Hobbes ""... solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."" However, I so detest the necessity of string flossing, that I kept testing up. Knowing well in advance that I was in for 45 second of arm-drenching, I concentrated on the most sensitive areas in the back of my mouth. First of all, it blasted out food particles; which is its primary job. Second, it felt sooooo good on my gums that I didn't want it to quit. A gum massage compared to the assault by my string floss.As for the charging, I had no problems. After an hour's charge, I flipped the ""intensity"" switch to II (2) and blasted away for 45 seconds. I don't know how many times I could have done that before the charge failed, but since I have to stop every 45 seconds to refill it with water, I have the patience for only a few refills. They suggest starting with the lower intensity I (1), but that didn't seem to do very much at all. Don't waste your time on I; go to II and while you don't get the fire hose blast that some prefer, you get enough water jet speed to knock out hidden food particles between your teeth.Now about the Nano Sonic Toothbrush that comes with the flosser: It's small and handy; perfect for travel. Up until now, I've never taken my electric toothbrush with me on trips. I just leave it in the charger at home. The Nano Sonic Toothbrush runs on a single AAA battery and fits nicely in my shaving kit. My other electric toothbrush comes with a big travel carrier, but it's too big and bulky. So up until now, I just use a standard hand powered toothbrush on trips. Now, however, I take along the Nano Sonic Toothbrush.The system comes with four flossing heads; two standard, one with bristles, and one with a fine stream attachment. There is a single detachable brush for the Nano Sonic Toothbrush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXG3KJQJV6EK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFQQ0ZQ#wasThisHelpful","RXG3KJQJV6EK4","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were having company when these arrived, and so we had ditched all of the well-used dish towels that decorate our kitchen and substituted these. Talk about putting on the dog! The color orange is a lighter-tinted burnt orange--rich and sturdy. (Not orange-is-the-new-black orange used for time in stir or trash pick-up for community service.) The brown-gray accent stripe is just the right complementary color with these towels. Growing up we used to call these tea towels, ""guest towels""  and my mother stored these in some unknown corner of the linen closet where she brought them out only when we had guests.Using these towels as kitchen towels may sound barbaric, but I realized that most of the dish towel use in our kitchen was drying our hands--not dishes. With really nice towels like these, we add a joie de vivre to a corner of our everyday lives. Somehow they didn't seem right for everyday bathroom hand towels (Canon towels have that job already taken), but their rich bright presence in the kitchen where we spend a lot of time lit up the place. So instead of occupying a dark corner of our linen closet, these towels add a welcoming warmth of our kitchen. (Rougher dish drying  duties are relegated to our more proletarian dish towels that lurk in a less prominent corner.)Now here's the best part: they can be laundered in your washing machine. You don't have to pay a bundle to have them dry cleaned (which strikes me a pretty creepy for towels that may come into contact with our China), but you can wash them with using delicate setting on the family washer. So, for a little over 40 bucks, you get two towels that make you feel special every day, impress your guests who wanter into the kitchen and provide a needed function in your kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5UAYC4PV2EO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3C9NS2#wasThisHelpful","R3U5UAYC4PV2EO","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got the Belkin Car Charge and Navigation Mount it was for a hands-free talk for an iPhone 5S. However, it turned out to be more. First of all I tried it in three different models of cars in three different years; a 2000 Infiniti G model, a 2006 E350 Mercedes-Benz, and a 2011 GLK 350  Mercedes-Benz, and it was functional in all. It was a little wobbly in the Infiniti, but it worked fine both as holder and charger. The two Mercedes had build-in GPS systems but the Infiniti did not, and the driver of the Infiniti used her iPhone 5S for GPS. So we took it out for a test, and the GPS voice was loud and clear and so too was the GPS map (more features of the phone's GPS apps than the mount). However, the last thing a driver should do is to look down at a moving GPS image held firmly below the driver's line of view unless fully stopped. As it turned out, the driver never looked down, but listened to the GPS instructions to get to her destination. A phone call test was also made and it held the phone while the driver talked without taking her eyes off the road.Getting the mount into the car's cigarette lighter was simple enough for the E350 and Infiniti, but the GLK's lighter is in a little box with a sliding wooden top. It is very low on the panel, and I wasn't sure whether it would fit or not. It did. Getting the iPhone onto the mount was very easy only IF you remove the case. (In the test, the case was an Otterbox Defender, which is medium bulky--more than the Commuter and less than the Armor models.) As a general admonition, if you have a case around your iPhone, plan on removing it for use in this mount.While the mount fits pretty snugly in the two test Mercedes, the wobbliness of its hold in the 2000 Infiniti is not a necessarily bad thing. Easy enough to tap a single phone call, but not a very good platform for text messaging while driving. So, I would judge any text messaging difficulty in an automobile mount a positive feature. Of course, while being guided by GPS or chatting away with a friend while paying attention to driving with both hands on the wheel, your unit is charging. A fully charged phone, especially in case of an emergency, is a very good thing.The grip for the phone can rotate from horizontal to vertical, and that's most important to keep the phone from blocking access to any of the other switches on the car you need--like seat warmers switches. You can also adjust it for making one-touch phone calls, and selecting music. However, most of the selections you should make should only be single-taps, and not browsing through what tune to play next. (For those of you who are unaware, distracted driving accounts for more fatal accidents than drunks now; largely due to smartphone use.) So set it on playlist or your favorite Pandora mix before you start and don't change it until you've stopped. The clamp mount makes that pretty easy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33OIFPA8T7R5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNMMY04#wasThisHelpful","R33OIFPA8T7R5R","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years my wife has had a combination of body and hand lotions, and I've always associated the various feminine preparations with the general realm of beauty products. Nivea Cocoa Butter Body Lotion is subtitled--""Intensively Hydrates Skin"" and that's what I needed. With age (and yard work) I found that my skin (especially hands) were getting dried out and beginning to crack. So getting a skin hydrator seemed like a good idea.So I plunked it down on my desk and started using it. Every now and then my wife would pop in and pump some on her hands too; so it became a family hydrator. After having used it for several weeks, it seems to work. At my age I don't think I'll suddenly have pretty skin, but at least I want it to reduce the drying out, and it seems to do that ok.In looking at the ingredients, Cocoa Butter, is listed as Ingredient #12. Actually, #12 is listed as Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter. Since ingredients are listed in order of proportion of the product, the other ingredients are some kind of ""helpers"" to create the lotion. The first three ingredients are Water, Glycerin and Isohexadecane. That third one was new to me so I looked it up and found:  Isohexadecane is a high purity, iso-paraffin emollient and solvent used in cosmetics and beauty products.More importantly, it was found to be safe for your skin.  Likewise, the other ""helpers"" that make up the Nivea Cocoa Butter are included as part of the lotion delivery system, added moisturizers or perfumes.It's recommended for Dry to Very Dry Skin, and it contains Vitamin E. In a light to rich scale, it is right in the middle, which probably is a tad lighter than I need, but it still works ok.

"For years I used Pelikan ink, and while it has a rich mark on paper, it was a tad thick. As a result, I'd have to clean my pens frequently to open up the ink flow. After I got a new Waterman pen, I decided to try Waterman ink, and while not as thick as Pelikan, it does not have a weaker mark on paper. It definitely does not jam up as easily. Any ink is going to stop up a fountain pen when it dries up, but with thicker inking components, it happens more often and leaves a bigger chore.I also tried the Waterman with a Japanese Pilot Fountain Pen. The Pilot is a wonderfully operating pen with a thick nib and the Waterman ink flowed quite well without overflowing and leaving a Rorschach test  on the paper. (The flaw with the Pilot is that the cap and body have a sharp divide.)Without sounding too much like a commercial for Amazon, finding Blue/Black in can be a challenge. If you can find ink in a store at all, it is likely to be blue or black, and if you want Blue-Black, you'll have to buy a bottle of blue and black and mix them. However, Amazon does have Waterman Blue/Black. (I did manage to find Mysterious Blue Ink [Encre Bleu Mystére] by Waterman when looking for Blue/Black, and it's pretty close.)

"Graphic artists who insist on using absolute values for their Web page designs drive me nuts. Static size elements in a design inevitably come to a bad end--on smaller screens, half the page is missing and on larger screens, the design sits in the middle of the display like a postage stamp in the middle of a white wall. (On certain size screens, their designs are beautiful, though--and I'm sure that more than a few artists are miffed by the fact that the world does not agree on one screen size so that their designs can be appreciated.) This was before mobile computing with smartphones and tablets. With the exponential growth of mobile computing devices, all graphic design for the Web is now ""responsive web design""--or at least it should be. Clarissa Peterson sets out to introduce beginner's on how to get started in responsive design.In reading Peterson's book, I'm reminded of Jennifer Tidwell's admonition to Web page builders—  It's not about you!Many designers and developers somehow think that their creations should be appreciated as graphic or software design exemplars and not a useful tool for the user. Responsive web design responds to the users device; so, designers should get the idea right away that their designs must conform to a diverse technological environments and not some ideal canvas dimensioned for their creations.Given my own background as a programmer I've migrated to PHP sniffer programs for determining user agents (devices) and grouping content into phone, tablet and desktop sizes. I've  come to depend on jQuery Mobile for creating sites for non-desktop displays. So while I'm not a designer, I've a good deal of experience dealing with the issues that Peterson tackles. I've just considered the issues from a different angle.For a beginning Web designer, I think that Clarissa Peterson has hit the designer sweet spot. She has set her focus on using CSS3 and HTML5 (...and a smidge of  JavaScript) to introduce graphic designers who want to design Web sites. Divided into four parts, the book covers:I. Foundations of Responsive Design (What is it and responsive content)II. Creating Responsive Websites (Basic HTML and CSS, including media queries, and using images.)III. Working Responsive (Workflows)IV. Designing Responsive Websites (Typography, navigation, headers, performance)At almost 400 pages, the coverage of the different topics and details is not unsubstantial, and beginners will get enough to have a solid grounding. The topics are well chosen, and since no two Web designers on earth can agree on much, some may want more of some and less of others. Peterson assumes right off the bat that the reader has some inkling about HTML, and that may prove to be more dangerous than assumed. It's not until halfway through the book that she talks about some different Web development tools like Dreamweaver, but I think that she'd be well-served to show readers right off the bat how to create, save and store HTML files and related content using a text or browser editor.The writing level is clear, and Peterson provides lots of links to appropriate articles on a topic that is not fully covered. I think that spending a page or two on how hexadecimal values are translated into RGB colors would be useful. There are examples where a hex value is used in illustrations, but for most designers, it's Greek; so a quick introduction would be useful. Some examples have mixed problems. In one example (p. 292), the author shows how a decorative typeface may look good on a desktop but not on a mobile device. The point being made is an important one, but the example uses ALL CAPS that looks pretty bad on both desktop and mobile!The author's UX background is apparent, and I think it's the kind of background that is valuable to Web page designers. It helps designers to focus on the user rather than just  artistic creativity and design concepts. Often the lesson is that a good responsive design will go unnoticed by the user who plows through the site trying to find a good deal of a pair of shoes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ8FB259PZF3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144936294X#wasThisHelpful","RZ8FB259PZF3B","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mattel's Wrecky is one of those toys that does a lot for a kid, but it leaves a lot for a kid to do--up to a point. It's for 3 years and up, but I have no idea at which age kids turn to more sophisticated toys, and our grandson is 7; so while he gets a kick out of this toy, I think that he represents the higher limit.This toy has anthropomorphic characteristics. It talks, laughs and even farts and shows other human-like attributes such as wondering if it's ""break time"" yet. It has siren sounds and flashing green and red lights in its eyes/windshield. The voice reminded me of one of those from the Disney movie, ""Cars,"" and whether or not that was intentional or coincidental is anyone's guess.The toy has three modes; Hauling, Bulldozing and Wrecking. In the Hauling mode, it drives forward, and I tested it on both hardwood floors and thick carpets. It works fine on both surfaces. In Bulldozing mode, it charges up against whatever is in front of it after a preliminary shuffling. The box shows what looks like a brick wall made of plastic bricks (not included), but I'm sure a sibling's Leggo creation, doll house or Lincoln Log cabin would suffice. When it smacks into a structure it makes a comment initiated by sensors in its bumper. Finally, it has a Wrecking mode. In this mode, after releasing the dump bed, it spins around and as it does so, the plastic wrecking ball on the plastic chain extends outward like a knight's mace. (Watch out flower vases!) What has resisted the bulldozing will surely be knocked flat by the wrecking mode. If that's not enough, it dances (on grave of the wrecked Leggo castle or the cat who cashed in life #9 after being accosted by Wrecky) while accompanied by its own music. For some, this may appear to be a tad creepy.This is a great gift for grandparents to give their grandchildren. Not only will the kids have fun with after playing with all of those educational toys piled on by doting parent, it's payback to their own kids who gave them prematurely gray hair. The ""Buddy Manual"" is quite good, and I would suggest parents put it in a place where it can be retrieved. It runs on 4 'C' batteries (included), and they can be preserved by turning the switch to the ""Off"" mode. It has 3 battery modes--on--off--demo. The last is for people to test it in stores.The controls are two shell plastic smoke exhaust pipes on either side of the truck. Depending on the mode, pushing the stacks forward or back will put it through one of its routines. I'm sure the kids can figure it out without the manual, and they'll have fun until mom and/or dad keep forgetting to get it new batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S70HV9B0FATJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVLIC46#wasThisHelpful","R2S70HV9B0FATJ","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as Dennis Lehane novels go, this is  story-telling at his best. In fact, The Drop has all of the ingredients I like in a novel; clear fully developed characters and a good story that moves along. Irish Catholics in Boston can get depressing very quickly. Most depressing is the fact that the churches are being consolidated and thanks to pedophile priests and a blind eye hierarchy from bishops to cardinals, the Boston Catholic churches are going broke paying off law suits and losing the faithful. Add that to the drunken and pugnacious stereotype of the Irish what little charm that is found in that same stereotype, thins quickly.However, Lehane does not play on any of the Irish stereotypes, but instead tells a tale of fear, control and redemption -- perhaps a peculiar type of atonement that comes from saving a puppy. The good old days of mob bosses like Irish American Whitey Bulger  who vied with the Italian mob for territory and riches in Boston are still around, but now the Chechens, Latinos and other  ethic groups control a hunk of the loan sharking, betting and all other illegal businesses associated with the Italian mob popularized in the The Godfather. The story centers around a bar run by two ex-connected guys from the old days who blinked when the Chechens brought in their brand of violence. Marv's bar is now owned by Chechens who use it as a drop.The focal point of the book is a bartender named Bob Saginowski who attends the neighborhood Catholic Church. He works in Marv's bar, and at one time (pre-Chechen) he was part of Marv's crew.  But now Bob is just a bartender and is perfectly content being one. Each week, the money from the bets and any other funds the Chechens need to be temporarily deposited are dropped at Marv's bar, and the bartender drops the envelops into a chute where they land in a box at the bottom of the chute. Chechen runners come by and pick up the week's bets, payoffs and other funds at the drop.One day Bob and Marv are  robbed by two two masked men--one skinny and one fat. They were described as the number ""10"". They take $5,000. Now the problem is not that the amount of money but rather the fact that it  belongs to the Chechen who own the bar. The boss, a man named Chovka is going to want that $5,000 back. Bob and Marv lost the money; so they are held responsible. This worries Bob. The investigating detective is Evandro Torres, a former homicide detective, now demoted to robbery. Torres hints that maybe the bar is a drop, but Marv acts as though he doesn't understand and Bob tries to be helpful by pointing out that one of the masked men wore a non-working watch on the inside of his wrist.Besides Bob, Marv and Chovka, Lehane introduces Nadia whom Bob meets as he saves a severely mistreated puppy from her trash can. She is not well developed as a character, and I wish she had been. In lieu of finding out more about Nadia,  we meet a truly evil character, Eric Deeds, whom Nadia had dated at one time. Lehan describes Deeds in terms of action and mindset that reminds me of some of Jim Thompson's undramatically evil characters. Eric Deeds is as snake-like as any dangerous man in literature. Lehane takes the reader into his life and fully describes him, but leaves out enough so that we don't truly know him or trust him. He was the man who beat the puppy and threw it into the trash.Lehane is masterful in weaving together the different events and characters that make up the story. In the movie version that will be released by Fox Searchlight films, the main characters are played by Tom Hardy, Noomie Rapace (The original girl with the dragon tattoo) and the late James Gandolfini (Sopranos). Just for the fun of it, see if you can figure out which actor plays which character before you look at the trailer. Then see if you were surprised as I was.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JKGW3C19DHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062365444#wasThisHelpful","R25JKGW3C19DHT","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good grief! Little certainly can write. Reading Little is like eating bon-bons. They're really good, and even after eating too many, you don't care, you just want more, even if you're staying up much later than you promised yourself you would. Elizabeth Little's ""Dear Daughter"" is a mystery with multiple layers of intrigue, the most interesting being the dual query, ""Who's my mother/Who am I?"" The story centers around Jane Jenkins, a Paris Hilton /  Kim Kardashian  type celebrity, who is one of those singularly unaccomplished people chased by the paparazzi to get photos of them doing nothing of merit--for which tabloids pay big bucks.Jane is convicted of murdering her mother, an idea that has passed through the mind of a daughter or two. However, after 10 years in the joint, her lawyer is able to get her sprung because of the mishandling of evidence by the LA's forensic lab.  Jane decides that she'd be well-served if she discovered the real killer of her mother. Shortly before the murder, she had been in the next room and overheard her mother arguing with an unknown man and a couple of key words are uttered that are Jane's only clues who killed her mother--if it wasn't Jane herself. (Sometimes booze and dope can cloud one's memory, and Jane isn't absolutely, positively....well maybe she did take the shotgun...but she doesn't think so.)So the saga begins. Jane wants to avoid the celebrity chasers, and so while trying to find out about her mother, she also has to avoid the reporters, bloggers and a host of other creeps who make their living (and probably their own selfhood) by writing, tweeting and gossiping about those who live to get tweeted, written and gossiped about. All of this happens in a wonderfully written surround of words and phrases that Little wields with aplomb. For example, when stopped by a cop, she writes about her heroine ""putting on her best these aren't the droids you're looking for"" face. Not only is that a perfect example of modern culture and what we're expected to understand as a reference, but it describes the culture itself. (This, as opposed to ""Cry 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war."")Somewhere around the middle of the book, I began having trouble of keeping track of who's who and what's what, and the story seemed to droop. However, after the middle, it picked up a head of steam and finished on a very strong, have-to-stay-up-late to finish note. Little weaves a complex story filled with great writing not uninteresting side characters, and a story that meets the expectations of a good mystery, albeit a bit convoluted in places. Her Jane Jenkins character is fully drawn and believable in her own shallow sharpness.All in all, Elizabeth Little writes the way I wish more writers would. Her imagery brings alive a culture that is one that we embrace and are embarrassed by all at the same time. We subscribe to the New Yorker and Economist, but volunteer to go the super market where we get in a long line just so that we can browse through US, People and the National Enquirer. Our celebrities are participants in the most banal ""reality"" shows that have nothing to do with reality, and their stock in trade soars with a publicly released sex video. However, even (or especially) the most hot shock chick on TMZ.com has a mom and mom-daughter issues.I look forward to more mysteries by Elizabeth Little, and I wholeheartedly recommend ""Dear Daughter."" The little dip in the middle and similar plot over-complexities are sporadic and minor, but in the future, I hope to see less of those and more of what Elizabeth Little does so well--describe and add whatever amounts to literary eye candy that she spreads like diamonds throughout the book.(An interesting note in the acknowledgements and end notes are ""Mom, it's fiction"" and ""Mom, it's not about you."")

"The gizmos that come with the GoPro Hero3 Black are nice and solid products. This one, while I was able to get it to do the job of holding the camera to the tripod, (not by GoPro) was just a cheaper quality. When I tightened the hold, the camera was still a bit loose and I never was able to get it to the point where it ""locked"" the camera in one position. As soon as I tightened the screw, I felt it begin to strip the threads; so I didn't tighten it further. When that happens, it's usually cheap metal components that have not been (and never will be) sufficiently hardened to snug up an angle.  If you need a low-cost adapter for a GoPro Hero3 Black, this product will work, but if you plan on doing a lot of tripod work with your GoPro Hero3 Black, you might want to pay a little more and get one made of more substantial materials.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39IPWGMV485YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ7PSYC#wasThisHelpful","R39IPWGMV485YI","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's pretty difficult to get excited about a kit of markers, some cleaners and an eraser, but they all did their job well, and so I'm happy to recommend them. A while back I got a white board that I put up next to the exit door to the garage. On it, I put reminders of what I needed to take with me--mobile phone, keys, lunch, etc. The board also has little magnets where my wife and I can affix coupons. I got some color markers at a dollar store, and they didn't exactly work well. They looked faded and I had to scrub messages on the white board with them. In no time, the board was pretty messy, and the eraser that came with the board was a little bitty one affixed to the head of the marker that came with the board.Rather than buying what I needed piecemeal, I got this kit, and everything in it worked fine. First, I used the eraser to get as much of the old stuff off that I could but some of the older (more stubborn) markings were still there. Since my white board had never been properly cleaned, the spray cleaner had to be applied more than once with a paper towel to wipe away the old markings, but it did a great job. The new markers were clear and the red, green, blue and black colors distinct.This is one of those handy things that takes care of business with no muss or fuss.

"I'm not sure whether this is exactly what most need for either modern business or education. It is decidedly for paper and only paper--along with paper-marking instruments. You could get more than one spiral bound notebook clamped in and lots of loose sheets of paper that are easily and well-organized. In that respect it looks like the ideal organizer of school or business meetings.  If that is how your business works, you're in luck--especially if it operates on technology that existed before smartphones, tablets and USB drives.For me, the lack of a pocket for a USB drive, some cables and a plug-in recharger for a smartphone or tablet--or even a small laptop--dates this binder. The way the handle is positioned, the materials in the binder hang downwards. If you hazarded putting a tablet in the binder, its weight would be pushing against the material that houses the zipper. From the weight and apparent quality of the cloth, it wouldn't be long before your iPad or Surface came bursting out and crashing on whatever surface you happen to be over. There is a netted catch-all pocket for pencils, pens (quills?), erasers, yellow markers and paper clips. I suppose you could stash a USB drive there and secure a small tablet in there along with your smartphone, but it's little more than a netted sack that is hardly purpose container forbuilt-for the kinds of technology found in modeled education and business.Of course for those of you who live in a paper and pen world, it's no so bad.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2TLZAIFTSAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIXXHEG#wasThisHelpful","R1H2TLZAIFTSAL","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bagmen is a lot of fun, and while I found a few missteps, there weren't many. The story centers around Victor Carl who happened into the job of a ""bagman"" -- the guy (or gal) who is so named for delivering bags of cash to different individuals in a position to influence the outcome of an election, drop a criminal charge or get the water treatment plant built in a certain district. This can be anyone from a union boss to a priest. Victor has come up in the world from a mere lawyer (forever with an ear open to the sound an ambulance carting off a potential client) to the loftier and more rarified air of a guy who collects from the rich and gives to the corrupt. The rich have their will implemented and the corrupt get paid.One of the enigmas of the story lies in the love/hate relationship that Victor has with his position. He can clearly see it is no less sordid than what he had been doing as an attorney, but he runs into the rich crowd whom he simultaneously detests and wants to be a part of. He beds (or gets bedded by) women for whom power is a drug, and sex is a strange concoction of control and pleasure to a point some would consider perversion. (Not Victor, though.)The most interesting characters are not the corruptors or the corrupted but the bagmen who have their own set of rules and ways of being. One, named 'Stony' is a second generation bagman and more or less takes Victor under his wing. Early on, Victor gets into big trouble as a suspect in a homicide, and the bagmen's camaraderie quickly turns sour and Victor is on the outside looking in. However, he is quickly accepted back into the bagmen fraternity—one of those missteps I mentioned--and the story continues.  Stony comes across as sort of a Yogi Berra kind of philosopher and avuncular figure to Victor, but as the reader finds out, Stony has his rules as a bagman, and the first one is to look out for Number One (himself.) So it's important to understand Stony's rules and to realize that he's not kidding.The dilemma for Victor is where to draw the line—believe it or not a moral line (and we're talking about a lawyer?). Some nice people have been murdered, and Victor has a strong moral sense about their being killed (and possibly ending up the same way himself. ) As the story unwinds morals keep getting in Victor's way and he even wonders if he's on the right side, even though all sides in the political battle do little more than voice hollow platitudes. (How can you be on the wrong side of a platitude?)William Lashner's humor is wry and unrepeated--it sparks like a firefly and you either get it in a blink or miss it. Victor Carl is stuck with being a hypocrite or lashing out against the hypocrisy that has become his bread and butter. His cynicism is not too deep because his expectations of the human race were never too high to begin with. Nevertheless,  he is nagged by the possibility that some decency wouldn't hurt all that much and too much evil spoils life for everyone. So, in a glib sense of right and wrong, he still lances windmills and Lashner's tale of Victor Carl is one of great fun and mystery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBH9THQUKR69D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477822836#wasThisHelpful","RBH9THQUKR69D","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a book like this, it's easy to do one of two things; 1) Detest it and get snarky, 2) Declare a 'new voice' and over-praise it. I hate to get snarky, and this is an easy book to dismiss as drivel, and I can provide several reasons why. Likewise, I dislike declaring a 'new voice' or revolutionary thinking for a collection that shows little evidence of much new or revolutionary. However, I do think that the author, Lindsay Hunter, has something truly new: the voice of the Wal-Mart worker; at least female worker. I'm not referring (necessarily) to the women who work at Wal-Mart, but the underpaid, undereducated and just plain invisible women and their men who work at such jobs. According to economic demographic trends ""these"" people may be what becomes of the working and middle classes.Other writers have used the kind of out-of-their-mind-and-on-to-the-page writing without a lot of in-between grammar gumming up a pure thought. For example, Jack Kerouac:"" And think, Sal, when we get to Pennsy we'll start hearing that gone Eastern bop on the disk jockeys. Geeyah, roll, old boat, roll!» The magnificent car made the wind roar; it made the plains unfold like a roll of paper; it cast hot tar from itself with deference - an imperial boat. I opened my eyes to a fanning dawn; we were hurling up to it. Dean's rocky dogged face as ever bent over the dashlight with a bony purpose of its own.""( from On the Road (1955);)So the free flow of thought is not new and certainly not literary heresy, and in some places Lindsay Hunter sounds right:""Her momma was the town skank. Everybody knew. So you couldn't take her all that seriously when her girl went missing. Stay home all night for once, ourown mommas would whisper to each other, swat each other on the arm.You so bad. I know it."" (from A Girl)Women writers who knew both sides of the track have created major works, but they seem to have voices that transcend themselves. For example, Sylvia Plath wrote:""Look what can happen in this country, they'd say. A girl lives in some out-of-the waytown for nineteen years, so poor she can't afford a magazine, and then she gets ascholarship to college and wins a prize here and a prize there and ends up steering NewYork like her own private car. Only I wasn't steering anything."" (The Bell Jar--1971)However, while the stories seem to emanate from women who might seem to have Wal-Mart lives, it's hard to tell whether or not Hunter has. In a few of the stories the dialect stumbles on good grammar and generates a sense of fraud. Further, Hunter does a lot better job in describing than she does ""inside the head and voice telling"" Her Nixon story didn't work for me and some of the other where she talked from the inside didn't either.In some places where the author seemed to think it was a good idea to use clever formatting (Our Man) or ALL CAPS (my eye-brain is still screaming from THAT). (Cigarette companies used to print health warnings in ALL CAPS to make them difficult to read.) If you have something to say, gimmicks will not help.All in all this book is a mixed bag. O. Henry wrote ""flash stories"" and a recent issue of the New Yorker was full of them. They're just short, short stories, and I think they have their place in American literature--past and present. Lindsay Hunter has picked an important voice and does a good job in communicating that voice and even the culture. She needs a lot a work on her storying telling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVVIO3KO15NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374533857#wasThisHelpful","R2FVVIO3KO15NZ","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the  Wireless AC750 Portable Router and Charger by D-Link, known as the DIR-510L. It has a few issues, but I'll get to those later. I tested the personal router on an iPad Mini, regular iPad and an iPhone. ( I have no idea how it works with an Android or Surface device.) Trying to follow the paper Guide that comes with the device proved very difficult in the 5-point font they used to print it in. So, the very first thing I recommend doing is to read the Quick Install Guide online at:(Google up  Quick Install Guide DIR-510L for the URL--I cannot put it here.) It has three basic types of connections:1. Broadband Router with Ethernet cable2. Mobile Router Setup (Requires 3G/4G USB adapter) //Not evaluated3. Wi-Fi HotspotI first plugged in an ethernet cable, fired it up and connected two iPads and an iPhone to the DIR-510L.  The default password is a blank; so you're advised to create your own password.  Anyway, it worked fine and all of my ""i"" devices wirelessly connected simultaneously. (The manual suggests that you connect no more than 5 devices at the same time.) If you do not have a wireless router, this will allow you to connect all of your ""i"" devices.  However, most ISPs like Comcast and AT&T include a wireless router. However, what I did find invaluable is the new found ability to plug in a USB drive into the DIR-510L and open it on my iPad. For me that's huge!Next, using my own wireless router as a ""hotspot"" I unplugged the ethernet cable and re-connected my mobile devices to the wireless DIR510L wireless connection that appears in my Wi-Fi Settings on my ""i"" devices.  That worked too, and it's the important one. Every Thursday I meet a friend at Starbucks and use the mobile hotspot they have there. (Some people use our Starbucks as an office with their laptops, tablets and mobile phones all arrayed on the postage-stamp size tables there.) One feature of the DIR510L is that it can add a layer of protection against unwanted intrusions. In Starbucks, everyone there has the Starbucks wireless connection code; including some jerk trying to get information form your mobile device. By connecting my DIR510L to the Starbucks wireless and then my iPhone to the DIR510L, I'm using the password that I set up on the DIR510L as a firewall against intrusion.Most of the configuration is done online at a D-Link URL. There you enter your Admin Password and some other configuration chores. Fear not; once it's done; it's done. However, you do need one more thing, and that's the app, ""mydlink SharePort.""  With the SharePort you can access Documents, Folders, Videos, Music, Photos and ""Favorites"" from storage devices attached to the DIR510L.The DIR-510L includes a WPS button for wireless devices with WPS. Since the ""i"" devices don't have WPS, I could not test it. However, they do have WPA/WPA2, and from what I could gather, WPS security is a lot less secure than WPA. In fact, I found several online articles suggesting that you avoid WPS. I'm no security expert, and so I wouldn't bet the farm of any of the available security measures. Nevertheless, I checked to make sure that my devices were secured by WPA2--it was done automatically in connecting to the DIR-510L and that's on top of the DIR-510L security. (A big red warning labels comes with the DIR-510L that lets you know that your device is subject to unauthorized access unless you have WEP, WPA or WPA2.)Finally, the DIR-510L charged my devices. I just moved the switch to ""Charger"" and plugged in the power cord to my iPad. I watched the battery go from 85% to 90% indicating a positive charge. (I didn't wait for it to hit 100%.)Overall, I really like the DIR-510L, and my reservations are small, but I do not believe to be petty. Like everyone else, I want good security, and from what I've seen about WPS security, they probably ought to drop it and provide more instructions on using WPA or include WPA2 as part of the DIR-510L. Another problem is with their Quick Install Guide. Why print it in 5-point fonts? That's absurd! Either put it in standard size print (about 12pt) or just provide an online address. Third, who's bright idea was it to print the labels in white on a white background? The labels for the button positions (e.g. 'CHARGER') and sockets and idiot lights are all white on white. Here's what I suggest: give all of your designers a piece of candy that gives them the runs, and then write the antidote in white ink on white paper. See how they like it. Otherwise, it's a nice design. Finally, not counting the value of an online PDF file with all of the documentation, I had a lot of trouble working out the configuration process using the necessary online link.

"We have mice, and my wife goes nuts whenever she spots the their droppings. We've used traps (both spring and electronic) and even poison. (I couldn't bring myself to put out the poison packets, but the mice gnawed their way into the package with the poison and did themselves in.) So when I saw the Tomcat Super Hold Mouse Glue Board, I had to try it.Right off the bat I caught a little mouse. The poor thing was struggling and looking at me like I was going to help him get unstuck. I picked up the trap and covered the mouse with a big maple leaf and carefully put it in the trash. I didn't want to have the thing stick to the side of the trash can. Tip: Put the trap into a bag before putting it in the trash.I put two in the garage where we've had mice move into my car's air filter for warmth. The first one caught something that kicked over the trap after apparently getting caught and kicking free. I assume it was a bigger mouse or even a chipmunk. Anyway, it seemed to mess up the stickum in the trap. I put another one next to it, figuring that it would have more difficulty getting away from two, but so far the only thing that it's caught is a big black spider.  I replaced the one where I had caught the first mouse but so far nothing.At this point in time, the traps are batting 250, which doesn't sound bad, but the real fact is that only 1 out of 4 has caught a mouse.  In all the years I've been battling mice, I've caught more with peanut butter and the old-fashioned Victor spring traps than any other. I don't like the spring traps because they get yukky with mouse blood and guts and will swat your fingers while setting if you're not careful. My electronic trap worked exactly once, and I like it a lot except for that fact that it quit working after the first mouse.Of all of the mouse trap systems I've used, this one is the easiest if you don't count the suffering of the mouse.  However, it only works some of the time, and while simple, I wish the mouse didn't have to suffer. Like all mouse catching systems, you want to dispose of the caught mouse as soon as possible so it won't get smelly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTW70R52KJC8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKEU74M#wasThisHelpful","RTW70R52KJC8R","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The older you get, the more your skin dries out. If you work outside doing yard work or garden work--or just about any physical work with your hands (other than writing reviews), your hands get banged up and dried up. In the past I've used L'Occitane after shave and shaving cream and like them both. However, for my hands I've used Burt's Bees Salve (A Farmer's Friend), and still like it. However, I like this Shea Butter Ultra Rich Body Lotion for dried up, banged up hands too.The lotion comes in a pump bottle with braille dots on the front label. (A nice touch for the blind.) It's easy to apply, and I've got to learn to pump a little less because it does not take much.  If you leave it on for a little while, it is absorbed into the skin and your hands don't feel greasy or sticky--just give it a good rub and wait a little while.The ingredients look like the contents of a Gilbert Chemistry Kit, but the top three are water, shea butter and glycerin--nothing lethal.I have no idea what the other ingredients are for but assume that they are a combination of scents, stabilizers, and moisturizing agents.Overall, the product works as advertised, and while my main purposes of use have to do with aging skin and rough hand work, it is recommended as a general hand moisturizer for purposes of appearance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZIOGAPH3HLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052H2JXW#wasThisHelpful","R2XZIOGAPH3HLO","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I poured White Cheddar Seasoning on my popcorn, and loved it. Poured a little more because it took more than just a little. Great stuff. Everything would have been hunky dory had I not looked at the label. Each serving is 1/4 teaspoon, and each serving has 75mg of sodium. So 1 teaspoon has 300mg of sodium, and even if you're not on a low-sodium diet, that's a lot of sodium.The other ingredients besides cheddar cheese and salt for taste are onion and garlic powders, and it does contain milk and soy in case you have a problem with either one of those. A teaspoon only has 8 calories zero fat, carbs, sugars or protein; so you can gobble this stuff up without getting fat. Also, the vitamin count is 0%--not healthy or unhealthy.One thing that has bothered me about food labeling is what counts as a ""serving."" A teaspoon, tablespoon, cup or some other whole measure makes sense, but 1/4 teaspoon (or 0.8g)? Where does that come from? If you go to buy breakfast cereal, the serving sizes are all over the map--for Cereal A, the serving size is 1 cup and for Cereal B, it's 3/4 cup. There are no standards that I can fathom, and so when you buy anything, you better check what the marketing folks have decided is a ""serving."" Why is that important? Consider this: A low-sodium diet is 2000mg of sodium per day. A little over 6 and a half teaspoons of of Kernel Season's White Cheddar Seasoning will put you at your max. On the other hand, 24 plus ""servings"" sounds like a whole lot more, but it is only 6.6 teaspoons that generates 2000mg of sodium. Partial units make me believe that they're up to something sneaky.So be careful with this stuff. It really tastes good and is easy to over-indulge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB15668YJEUPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H727M96#wasThisHelpful","RB15668YJEUPV","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The BonJour 16-piece Dinnerware Meadow Rooster Stoneware Set is a delight to the eye. The colors are very bright and vibrant and the French countryside design appeals to my tastes. So I was more than happy when I first opened the box. I knew of ""stoneware"" and somehow associated it with some kind of rough and tumble version of 'china' invented in the 1950's in the U.S., but I was dead wrong. It turns out that stoneware was first used during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 bc), and invented by the Chinese. These dishes are made in China, and so you might say that the manufacturer has a long history of making stoneware, especially the fine stoneware used in making dishes. (Ironically, what we call 'china,' is 'Bone china' made, in part, from bone ash and was invented in England in 1748.)The 16-piece setting is made up of 4 dinner plates, 4 small plates (salad, desert), four bowls (cereal, soup, salad) and four mugs. Besides the big colorful country rooster, the dinnerware is decorated with a scattering of wild flowers and greenery and another chicken and chick.As much as I liked the dinnerware, it still had two final tests; microwave and dishwasher. Our dishwasher is super modern, but it will destroy dinnerware that is not ""dishwasher safe."" After washing, the dishes were as good as new.(No cracking or color fading.) Then, I tested heating water in the microwave. No cracks or hairlines developed at all nor was the color faded.Overall, I really liked this set. It might be tabbed 'fine informal.' It's not the plain Jane stuff that some people use everyday nor is it the dinnerware to haul out for company. It's the kind of everyday dishes that is nice to have meals on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22QS35XXKGKEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2VP2YW#wasThisHelpful","R22QS35XXKGKEC","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I received this for a Vine review, I wanted to give it a tough test. The kids are grown and gone, and so we don't have the grass-stained, roll-in-the-mud, wear-way-too-long-favorite outfit that kids seem to have. However, I had several very good pairs of colorful (argyle) socks shrunk to baby size, and I've been leery of washing the new ones except by hand in Woolite. For this test, I threw in a pair. Then I gathered up the mealtime linen (colorful and made of cotton) and dishtowels and my yard clothes and decided that those were the worst of the worst colorful things.My wife informed me that we have a high efficiency washer and I'd better check to see if this Tide is appropriate for our washer. It is. Then my wife went through the standard motions to wash the test clothes and linen (that's really cotton). (I'm not some misogynistic cretin who insists that doing washing is women's work. Rather my wife believes that I will break our washer if I touch it--it's sort of hi-tech, and even though I fix her computer I am not allowed to use the washing machine by myself--or even at all.)Once the wash was done and dried, I went through every piece. Everything was clean and it smelled nice--perhaps a little too nice in a ""fresh chemically"" way. Suggestion to Tide: lighten up on the 'Clean Fresh Scent' -- there's a difference between unscented 'Fresh and Clean' and chemically induced 'Camouflaged and Clean'. If Tide really does work, and you dry your clothes on a clothesline outside, then you get the real 'Fresh and Clean' scent, and it's way better than the chemically induced version. (Clean clothes coming out of a dryer usually smell warm and clean, but if they're stinky, you know that they're not quite clean.)Other than a few stains that still clung to a dish towel, everything else looked very good. Best of all, my socks didn't shrink. Tide does make an unscented version (Free and Gentle), but I'm not sure if it's for cold water or not. I'll have to look into it, and in the meantime, I'll just use the now-perfumy napkins, dish towels and yard clothes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YAY9HSD3AGYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ6XEQO#wasThisHelpful","R2YAY9HSD3AGYY","A2AYDT1O1K8MG2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AYDT1O1K8MG2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far this razor has been solid. I haven't used it for the full 30 days that Philips says in the manual is the suggested trial period for testing the razor. What I can tell you is this:-It charges fast-It gives a close shave-It can work even with cream or gel-It's got a neat digital display with all sorts of helpful data/alerts-It's design is fancy and innovativeThose are the good things. The less good:That fancy design is better in theory than in practice. For instance, you can charge it in the cleaning base...but the base is HUGE. It's not as easy to plug in as you would like either. You have to press down on the top (which then pops it up) and then push it back down in the razor to charge. Except you have to do it several times because it doesn't always go in. The cleaning solution that goes in the base--you have to peel off the wrapper before putting it in. Why not just have the base puncture the wrapper like a Glade Plugin? (That's in fact how I though it worked and try to force it through several times).The final note? This razor is nearly $200 on Amazon! The list price has it as $309.99!! Who on earth would pay that much? Look if Apple had a razor that's probably how much it would cost.

It does its job: makes your mediocre mattress much more comfortable (though I would argue that the foam toppers are better than the fully memory foam mattress). But since this one does not offer any particularly special features, I might suggest shopping around for price on similar specs.That brings me to my next point: Why isn't there any feature differentiation? Why not make it with a cover? Why not put a brand or a logo on it? Why not make it some other color than yellow sponge? Of course, a big piece of foam you put on top of your mattress is not exactly the most inspiring designer canvas but it does seem weird how little changes there have been to this type of product over the last ten years.

The problem is that it just doesn't work well.I vacuumed my carpet twice before I started to use the carpet cleaner and at first things were great. Squirt the cleaning solution, vacuum it up. Easy peezy. I thought things were going along great until I stopped the machine and noticed I'd gone through nearly the entire tank of cleaning solution and the dirty water tank was nearly empty! What happened to all the dirty water? I removed both tanks to investigate and the machine dumped water all over my carpet. Then I moved the carpet cleaner off my carpet and discovered it literally vomited clumps of dirt onto the carpet. (I'm not gross I swear I had my carpet professionally cleaned a couple months ago.) Look, I understand you need to vacuum your carpet before you use a carpet cleaner, but this is meant for pets and it can't handle a little pet hair from my short haired dachshund? Now my carpet is dirtier than it was previously and I had to lug my heavy Hoover Power Scrub Deluxe Carpet Washer, FH50150, out of the garage and start all over again. If you're in the market for a carpet cleaner, check out that Hoover. It's heavy but it's a beast and works way better.

"I never expected to be a slackline guy, but along the lake in Austin there is a long boardwalk that curves along the shore. When I go running I've passed a group of people who set up a slackline across one of the the turns. It was so cool to watch them walk and fall into the water when they messed up.

"Shadow Divers is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. Kurson manages to so effortlessly explain a man who is probably a mystery even to himself, he's able to make relatable a drive to discover and understand a drive that goes beyond what many of us will ever experience. In Pirate Hunters, all the same mastery is at play again. Only this time, instead of exploring the depths of a sunken u-boat, John Chatterton is searching the entire Caribbean for one of the greatest pirate ships of all time. What makes Kurson's story so compelling is that this isn't some simple treasure hunt. It's not a fictional story where all the ends are tied up loosely. It's complicated. It's confusing. It's not Johnny Depp's brand of pirates. It's something different. Yet Kurson tells it all so compellingly and so clearly that you turn every page and want to know what happened next.

"Mr. Holzer has crafted a book that sheds light on how, in addition to waging war on the battlefield, in the courts, and in Congress, Lincoln was also required to fight and win on the hotly contested front pages of the nation’s newspapers. Never before until now, has America seen the tail wag the dog in the way that newspapers—empowered by technological advancements in the printing press and the telegraph—did in Lincoln’s time.If you were to ask the average person what they know about Lincoln and the media, they’d probably say something about him throwing journalists in jail or suspending certain Constitutional rights. That is true and it is interesting.But what the record actually shows is that Lincoln was an astute and deft manipulator of the media—a manipulator-in-chief has he had been called. He needed to be. And frankly, the media in that day deserved it.It is not for nothing that one could swap out “newspaper” for “blog” in many instances in this book and be just as accurate now as it was 150 years ago. The “racket” we see today—was in fact invented and perfected back then. It made a handful of moguls quite rich, and quite influential, as the expense of pretty much everyone else. Like today, it was disruptive technology when combined with a self-interested internal culture that made the media such a difficult beast to be reckoned with.What Lincoln ultimately got very good at was using the press against itself—the art of a well-timed letter, a key leak to the right reporter, even knowing when to let outrage outdo and undermine itself. To see and understand this is to observe a master politician and communicator at work.But…In my eyes, one can look at the 19th century media and Lincoln and only be appalled at the needless cost and real damage that was inflicted on the country by bands of partisan, attention and patronage hungry editors and reporters.What Lincoln showed then and now is a path forward—how politicians can lead and overcome a toxic media environment. As Mr. Holzer relates, as the war progressed Lincoln broke his lifelong addiction to newspapers. He realized that his duty required him to see a larger picture than biased, misguided and small-minded reporters could ever capture.As Mr. Holzer tells it, only after the Emancipation Proclamation did Lincoln begin to “look beyond ephemeral journalism to validate his place in history.” He began to delegate his media diet to subordinates and opted for real interactions with real people (soldiers, letters, office hours and ironically interviews with reporters directly back from the front) in what he terms “public opinion baths.” Lincoln’s homespun language and stories—these were not for reporters and editors, who in fact, looked upon them condescendingly but for the people who loved it—who got it.In a way, Lincoln was temporarily able to transcend the everyday squabbles of the media in light of a larger goal. He was the right man, at the right time who did the right things, the right way. How long this would have lasted, though, we have no idea. Had he not been assassinated Lincoln may have been almost immediately pulled back into the swamp (recommended read: The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln by Stephen L. Carter is a great fictional look at this idea). How he would have responded, we cannot say, but Mr. Holzer’s book makes it safe to assume that it would have been impressive and masterful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U95XVPRBIKNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439192715#wasThisHelpful","R2U95XVPRBIKNE","A281YN2K4M72JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A281YN2K4M72JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Networking: any activity that increases the value of your network and/or the value you contribute to it.That is Derek Coburn’s definition of networking. Notice he doesn’t include “attending large events” or “handing out business cards”. Derek found through his years of doing similar low-yield activities that most things people consider “networking” are really just a waste of time. Instead, Coburn decided to try new approaches, and only spend his time on what actually worked.The result of these years of testing is “Networking Is Not Working.” The book is split into two sections: the first looks at the inefficiencies in common networking strategies. The second part explores Derek’s response to those inefficiencies and how anyone can replicate his unconventional methods.The process Coburn developed and lays out is called “CONECTOR”:C: ClientsO: Open DoorsN: NucleateE: EventsC: CommunityTOR: Trigger Ongoing ReciprocityThe book emphasizes that networking is not a volume business and instead professionals should focus on creating small, motivated groups of like-minded people who appreciate staying connected and helping each other out. I recognize in my own life, similar small groups of friends and colleagues have lead to my most rewarding (and lucrative) ongoing business. Having known and worked with Derek, I've seen him live and prove the theories he talks about here.Luckily, this book can save you hours of learning by trial and error and accelerate your path to becoming, as Coburn says in the book, the “Ultimate Connector.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ICBPKC8WKFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K436RH8#wasThisHelpful","R13ICBPKC8WKFK","A281YN2K4M72JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A281YN2K4M72JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Feeling stuck is a very common feeling. Stuck at a job. Stuck in a relationship. Stuck because of groupthink and nearsightedness. Headed down a path, not exactly sure how they got there, or how to change that course. As Hankel puts it in the book “Too miserable to move forward, too invested to turn around.” As someone who has been in that situation before, I know that feeling trapped in a situation or bound by circumstances is one of the worst feelings ever.Black Hole Focus argues that the solution to this problem is not just figuring out WHAT we want to be, but WHO. Defining a purpose in life and working backwards to fulfill that purpose.The book lays out a strategy to finding this purpose in 3 sections:- The first section discussed why you need to actively find a purpose for your life- The second section lays out the process of transforming your current life so it is aligned with that purpose- The final section covers Hankel’s strategies for keeping with your purpose in the face of adversity.Hankel draws heavily from his extended time in academia (which ultimately lead him to being hospitalized before the age of 30 due to kidney disease brought on by stressed-induced inflammation) as well as recent studies in psychology, physiology, and motivational theory to build upon his compelling thesis.This book is inspiring, it's honest, it's practical, it's based on real experiences and insights born from Hankel’s NEED (medical and otherwise) for purpose. I ended up with a page of notes that called into question my purpose I felt was already well established.I recommend it to everyone, stuck or not. It will undoubtedly call your attention to larger questions which need your “black hole focus.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NYTTQC7SCE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYC1EQ4#wasThisHelpful","R17NYTTQC7SCE0","A281YN2K4M72JQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A281YN2K4M72JQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used 900MHz for the last few years and just decided to try out 5.8GHz. Installation is pretty standard, try to use a little double sided foam tape on the back to prevent vibration from destroying the circuitry then use zip ties to keep it from falling off. The wiring is a little annoying, it has 5V out with no option of 12V, which nearly all cameras use so you need to make a bridge from the 12V input then build an LC filter. I also think these transmitters are weaker physically at the SMA socket. The 900MHz TX's have the SMA socket soldered to the metal case for example. I would recommend using a short 2-3"" extension with the other end screwed on to your aircraft, this will prevent your antenna from ripping the connector off in a crash (loss will be minimum too).Performance is not bad at all, I get nice clean video pretty far out but get bad interference the second I dip behind a bush/tree. 900MHz does not have this problem and video clarity is about the same. This transmitter does get pretty warm, be sure to keep the red sticker side exposed to air to cool it. Also be sure to use the stock antenna to stir paint and buy your self some circularly polarized antennae, this will cut down on the multipath problem of this frequency. I personally use IBcrazy's bluebeam ultra with plastic dome cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBGEZFYSXITB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BW7HS00#wasThisHelpful","R3OBGEZFYSXITB","A1CSRR7FCKBL9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CSRR7FCKBL9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am an engineering student and wanted something to replace my heavy/aging 2009 macbook pro. I needed something light to take to school and did not need a heavy duty computer. I picked the Surface Pro 3 128gb/i5 model and used it for a few days. Here is my opinion..Hardware:Pros - The hardware is great. Screen is bright and crisp, touch screen is pretty precise, kick stand is surprisingly sturdy, and the build feels solid.Cons - The haptic feedback motor is loud. Very loud. When it is on a desk, bumping that windows button will cause it to vibrate which will resonate with what ever it is touching. There is no way to disable this ""feature"" unless if you disable the windows button. But it seems the volume/power/windows button is all on the same I2C bus, disabling one with device manager will disable them all. You will bump this key at some point, especially if you use the pen to write with.The keyboard:I will talk about the type cover here too, since the thing is almost useless without it.Pros - The keyboard is very light and adds only a tiny bit of thickness to the SP3. I did not have much trouble adapting to it and I can type on it at a normal rate.Cons - When on a desk and the keyboard is angled, it is INCREDIBLY loud, it sounds like a 1940's type writer. If you are in a quite area, you WILL disturb people around you. Microsoft also chose to use some type of weird felt like cloth covering. It will get dirty eventually and be difficult to clean. The mouse pad is located slightly to the left, and as I result I am always hitting it with my palm. I have also noticed that laying sideways in bed will make the SP3 think it is being used like a tablet and automatically disable the keyboard.The pen:Pros - The pen and palm rejection surpassed my (high) expectations. The pen feels pretty close to using a ball point on glass except the ink is electronic. There is also a feature to convert handwriting to text that is pretty useful and accurate.Cons - The buttons are a little awkward to use, the magnetic holder at the bottom is not strong enough to hold it, and there is no symbol support for the handwriting input.The charger:Pros - Has a USB port!The software:Now, I use both windows and mac and I might be used to the extra polish of OS X. I thought I could try to adapt to windows 8 but I can't. It is just too awkward of an operating system, having to manage programs and apps, having tablet settings and then desktop settings. There are too many little things that could just be better. For example, in desktop mode I have to bring up the digital keyboard every time I want to type and X it out once I am done. Windows get resized but do not go back to normal once the digital keyboard is gone. Desktop items often end up shuffled too.The absolute worst part is that I cannot get over is the fact that the stock microsoft apps have 3rd party ads built into them! I paid $900 for this machine, I do not want to have advertisements!Overall, it is a great idea and could have completely changed the way I work. Unfortunately typical microsoft blundered it by missing out the tiny but ever so annoying details. Usable? Totally. Perfect? Not at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOACXG8K89GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KHR4T8U#wasThisHelpful","R1YOACXG8K89GS","A1CSRR7FCKBL9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CSRR7FCKBL9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Teensy controllers are great! They surpass Arduino literally in every single aspect - number of I/O, speed, comm ports, memory, and so on. What makes them better is that pretty much every Arduino library is compatible with Teensy controllers. You might have to change a few pins around but I have not had any serious issues yet. Plus, you can program the Teensy in several other languages with a more formal IDE instead of Arduino. I think of these as the stepping stone to more serious work with the Easy Option still available. For example, this thing can do all sorts of sweet tricks, like pretending to be a keyboard, mouse, MIDI, flight control for simulator, FULL speed serial communications over USB(!), DSP, and it even has pins for touch input! (There are a few Arduinos that can do the mouse/keyboard stuff but are not as integrated to the OS)There really is no downside but there are a few things that should be mentioned.  These are not directly compatible with Arduino shields because of the physical shape; you will have to make an adapter.  You will also have to be competent with a soldering iron, I recommend vertical male headers on the long sides and horizontal pins on the short edge to make it breadboard friendly.The last thing I think should be noted is the Teensyduino installer. It is pretty dead simple to use, but there is an option for you to install additional libraries. This is both good and bad. I selected ""install all libraries"", and it did - straight into the actual Arduino IDE and NOT in the user installed libraries. This is important to know about because I nearly went insane trying to figure out why one of my libraries was capable of compiling without the .h file, turns out a copy was installed with Teensyduino.

"I was a little hesitant to buy bulk lasers from China but I was willing to take a $5 risk. Mine arrived in just 2 weeks and each one works just fine at 5v but might last longer on 3.7v. They are about as bright as a standard keychain laser but they are much smaller and they did not seem to heat up at all which is good. There isn't a lot of circuitry so I would suspect that it might be beneficial to power these with a buck-booster/constant current driver but I am not a laser expert.

"This little display is great - it is half the price of the Adafruit version and does not have a multitude of wires. The display works with the Adafruit_SSD1306 Arduino library. For those unfamiliar with that library, be sure to open the .h file, look for line 54-56 which will have a few lines of #define's. Simply leave the one that has 128x64 uncommented and comment out the other display sizes. There is a jumper on the back of this display to let you select the I2C address. Mine said it was 0x78 but was actually 0x3C (the Adafruit library is set to 0x3D by default). Also, the listing says this board is 3 to 5 volts, but I know the Adafruit ones are either 3 or 5 volt. Since this board probably isn't as well built, I decided to run it only on 3.3 volts straight off my Arduino. And I also should mention the upper ~20-25% of this display is yellow and the lower section is a teal blue - it isn't a dual color display where every pixel's color is selectable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HN7CK2RM6QQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2LLT30#wasThisHelpful","R2HN7CK2RM6QQF","A1CSRR7FCKBL9M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CSRR7FCKBL9M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Skip Hop 3 Piece Explore and More Egg Shaker Toys are adorable. This set is perfect for boys and girls! I'm personally loving the adorable forest animal theme! This set features a hedgehog, owl, and fox. The shakers are the perfect size for babies 3 months old and up and can easily be held in the palm of little hands. The toys are PVC-free and Phthalate-free ensuring the safety of baby when playing with or putting them in their mouth.Each of the animals make a different rattling noise and feature a different raised textured on the bellies. The hedgehog has little bumpy textures for it's quills on its back! The colors are attractive not being too soft or overly bright. These little egg shaker toys will make playtime more fun whether learning about new textures, sounds, or in making noise to match the rhythm of a song. I see these toys being played with as baby grows into a toddler and beyond. My 7 year old and 4 year old are even fans of this adorable little shaker set! I feel it's a wonderful set for any baby and would make a fabulous gift to receive for expecting parents (especially if you don't know the sex of the baby yet)!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NCU8FMPCC5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GEXBXE#wasThisHelpful","R8NCU8FMPCC5D","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These refrigerator liners come in a set of 6. Measurements of each liner is 12X24 and can be easily cut to the specific size needed for each desired resting place. I like these are reversible so if I want to change things up or prefer one pattern style over the other I can use it. The material wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting something more slick or vinyl like but instead each liner is soft and absorbent. The liners aren't very thick but are great at absorbing  spills.I adore the fact that when these need cleaned I can simply just throw them in the wash without worry to use again and again. These air dry and since they are thin it doesn't take too long. You'll just want to flip it over to let both sides dry before placing back in the fridge. The liner comes out look just as good as when I first used them! There's no wrinkle, bumps, or off putting wear. The liners retain shape very well.Aside from keep the shelves clean, these are a better choice than disposable liners. These also since there's a bit of softness prevent produce from shifting around in drawers and bruising.These liners are saving me precious time when it comes to deep cleaning the fridge! My only regret is not discovering these sooner. I highly recommend them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UE5APHO278S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHB176#wasThisHelpful","R19UE5APHO278S","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The  Lenox 2015 Disny's Fa La La Fairy (Tinker Bell) Ornament is exceptionally beautiful. There are zero flaws as far as I can see. This ornament is of very high quality. It's light in weight so as to not hang low on my tree. It can be hung using my own hooks or solely from the golden cord attached on top of the ornament.  Even though the ornament is light it doesn't feel cheap. I like that the ornament comes in a velvet lined box in which the ornament can be stored when not in use. It's the perfect ornament for collectors and the box is dated so you'll know what year it's from. My daughter is a huge Tinkerbell fan and adores this ornament so I've gifted it to her and will pass it along when she's grown for her own tree. I feel like we'll be collecting more from Lenox in the future.

"The Safety 1st Grow and Go 3-in-1 Car Seat is awesome! This seat will take us all the way from newborn (5lbs) to booster (40-100lbs) without the need to purchase any other seat making it a huge bargain! The seat is back facing and forward facing when the child reaches the intended weight, age, and height requirements. I'm loving how easy this seat is to clean! The seat cover can be thrown in the washer and dryer! I used to have to wash car-seat covers by hand but now no more!Installing the car seat was as simple as most other car seats I've installed.  Adjusting the car seat to fit was a lot easier than other car seats. There's an adjustment mechanism in the back that is far easier than unthreading and rethreading the belts through slots. The seat takes up less space than other bulkier seats we've used in the past. This is very important because we have to seat three kids in the backseat of our car. This seat has given plenty of wiggle room to keep all three of our kids comfortable.The straps that hold children in place are strong and the buckle not easy for them to detach on their own but not a strain on parents either.There's two cup holders for long trips, or one for a cup and the other for other items, snacks for example. The seat can be adjusted to a number of reclining positions. The seat feels sturdy and safe, with plenty of padding and comfort for our kids. There's been no complaints. We totally recommend this carseat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SWWKCNA6OOO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015KFDKB0#wasThisHelpful","R2SWWKCNA6OOO0","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That said, it wasn't that hard, just confusing, but it was my own fault.There are stickers to affix to the pieces and they fit as expected.The toy's main features work well for the most part. A few bits are fiddly, but they seen sturdy enough. You can move a few pieces around to customize it as well. The features that flips one of the bots out and transforms it into a boat at the same time is rather neat!My four year old son is a big Rescue Bots fan and really likes this toy!

"My husband does the grilling around here so below are his thoughts on this product....Ever since I took a BBQ class, my grilling skills have increased, and the food tastes much better. This thermometer kicked it up even a few more notches.After installing the included batteries, it's easy to pair the remote wireless sensor to the thermometer. It just takes a couple button pressed. Best to read how before turning them on, or you might have to turn them off and back on again.Setting the sensor alarms, one for the grill temp and another for the piece of food you put the second probe into, isn't complicated, but if you want to set lower than the default, you have to hold the buttons until they go all around. The default temp is higher than any of the recommended minimum temperatures listed in the instructions!That aside, the instructions are clear and explain the various modes, and how to set them up. Using this allowed me to get the meat off the grill at just the right time, instead of having to put it back to cook longer, or have it overcooked. Opening the grill to check temps increases cook time, so using this device help the food finish sooner as well, since I didn't have to open the grill at all.Naturally, of your coals are not evenly hot, various pieces of meat will good at different times, so you have that to watch out for. The probes, that you put inside the flaming hot grill are also hot, and should not be touched with bare hands until cool. Use a hot pad or glove. I totally didn't touch them on accident. Nope, not me! (anyone got an ice pack?)If you grill, and you want your food to be cook right, and you want to be able to be in the kitchen or elsewhere but still be able to know what the temp is, and have a warning if the grill is cooling or your food is just about done, this is a great choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIY6RHCXBNVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TR2E7M#wasThisHelpful","R2PIY6RHCXBNVU","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Blends Clean Translucent Oil-Control Powder has been wonders for my skin. I typically have oily skin and because of my recent pregnancy, my skin has become even oiler.  I feel each of the blends have given my skin a natural vibrant look with appearing shiny. The application is easy and I can blend how I please using my preferred powder brush.  Brushes aren't included with these powders. The containers are transparent and keep closed well. A little bit of the powders seem to go a long way.Out of the three blends I've been using the Clean for my my entire face and the Pure for my blush areas. The Sunkissed shade is just a little bit too dark for my skin right now. The Sunkissed is a dark shade and would be best suited for darker skin tones or to be worn during the Summer time when my skin is a bit darker for a bronzing affect.  I like I can play with the palette to find my perfect shade.  The makeup goes on well and cleans off pretty easily.

"The Platinum Plated Sterling Silver Garnet and White Topaz Halo Heart Pendant Necklace is darling. It's 18"" inch length rest not too short or too long when worn.  The chain is small and quite delicate. It can become easily tangled if not being careful. However, I like the chain. I feel the sizing width wise of the chain is perfect and spotlights the pendant nicely. The clasp is small but I had no trouble putting the necklace on or taking it off on my own.The pendant is garnet. At first my husband thought the heart color was black! It's pretty dark to the eye if being worn in a not brightly lit area. The color is certainly something to keep in mind if you are hoping for a brighter red.  The necklace comes in a box that's nice for gifting and perfect for storage. The necklace doesn't feel or look cheap. It's got just the right amount of sparkle!

"The Fisher-Price Roller Blocks Rockin' Wagon is a great toy that grows with a child. It features two different ways to play which are in a standing pulling position or for a crawler that is more accustomed to a sitting position. Other than installing batteries into the toy and popping 3 pieces into place the toy is ready to go! Very minimal putting together is always a plus when a little one receives a toy and wants to play with it right away.  The toy is well made, there are no sharp edges, potential places were little fingers could get pinched, etc.The back of the wagon (holding area) features a tailgate that can be closed or opened. The blocks tumble out and rock back in forth stopping baby to pick them back up and place them inside if they wish. Each of the blocks feature cute designs and faces that are all different and interesting to look at it. I like that if my baby isn't ready for the walking/pulling stage of this toy that the handle can be folded underneath with very little effort. The music and silly sounds can be turned off or on and there are two volume control modes. Lots of fine motor skills on cognitive skills will be challenged and mastered by playing with this toy. Pushing, pulling, twisting, stacking, there's a lot for a baby to do. It's a gender neutral toy perfect for a boy or a girl.

"Dragon's Gold is an artfully crafted negotiation game from renowned game designer Bruno Faidutti. Each round you place one of your party members on a dragon to fight it. Once the attack values of the attackers matches or exceeds the health of the dragon, the treasure is split up in a negotiation process including everyone who participated.Everyone involved has 1 minute to make a deal everyone can agree on to split the loot. Factors to consider are your own goals, what you think other people might have, and if there are wizards and thieves. Someone with a thief gets to steal from someone after the fact, so maybe they deserve less, and anyone who played a wizard who gets a red treasure also gets magic items.The magic items can shift the game by moving treasures around, gaining extra items, or cancelling a successful dragon slaying, and other actions. These add that extra bit of strategy to really fiddle with the game to your benefit, or at least to mess with what other people are doing.This game is loads of fun. You have to balance getting what you want with giving up enough to at least get something. Someone who is greedy might end up with little or nothing, while the players who cooperate with each other continue to gain. The turns go quickly, and players can stay engaged by counting up the attack totals and deciding which dragon to attack next, such as deciding if they can get in on the action with others, or try and take one out themselves with the available plays before their next turn comes around.The only issue I have with the game is the gold and silver treasures. In certain lights they are so similar it is really hard to tell them apart. I'm considering getting some sort of paint to spray the gold pieces to make them more distinct. I think in a white light they would be clearer, but in softer lights they don't stand out.I've played this game with out 7 year old daughter who I clearly have taught to well how to be devious, as she has made some real stinker moves for her gain with the magic cards. We've only played with the advanced rules, but there is a version without the magic items. I don't imagine this being as much fun, but it might allow our 4yo son who is just starting to read to be able to play, as there is no reading required other than the magic items.I recommend this game as a must buy if you like a lot of interpersonal interaction and negotiation in your games. Even if not, it's a good game with nice art, quality pieces, and engaging game play.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KN08V0VB52JU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R2KN08V0VB52JU","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Most of the prints I wouldn't even mind framing and putting on the wall of my kids room. The colors used are bright, bold, or over the top but fit the theme of the book very well.The words in the book can challenge young children and grow their vocabulary.

"The DII 16-Piece Bathroom Starter Set is a bargain! I feel this is a great set for those that don't want to break the bank to give the bathroom a design face-lift. This set includes a shower curtains, curtain rings, lotion or soap dispenser, and a cup. You pretty much have everything but a couple of rugs and towels to finish off your entire bathroom!

"Fluxx Dice is an add-on to any Fluxx deck. It adds two dice and a five cards to the game. When the game starts, you roll dice to see how many cards to draw and play. These new rules can be removed or changed like any other rules in the game as normal.Since the dice start in play, the game starts with with more randomness. Maybe not best for a new player to start with these in play, but for veteran players, it'll give some freshness.If you frequently play Fluxx then this would be a good edition.

I really liked that the material doesn't have any off putting smells and that's it's organic. The seams are strong and the elastic isn't overly tight. These are a must have for babies. My first born went without  mittens when she was very little and did end up scratching her eye and having to go to the doctor for treatment for it. No major damage and nothing a few days with medication couldn't  remedy but it could have been prevented. I recommend these to all parents of babies.

The mason jars, labels, and plant marking flags are simplistic and altogether look great sitting in my kitchen. I wouldn't hesitate in the least bit to purchase this kit for someone I know. Visual learners I feel will really appreciate the video instructions and the helpful hints, tips, and a bit of history shared by the folks over at Makerskit. Totally recommend this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OTY7NE7DLH3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5EPVBK#wasThisHelpful","R3OTY7NE7DLH3V","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five Minutes with Jesus By Shelia Walsh is a lovely hardcover devotional book. The author shares short stories that will impact, convict, inspire, and move one to grow closer with God.  I like how even though the devotionals are shorter that there is still a lot to each of them to ponder and apply to my daily life.In this book, there are 50 devotionals for daily reading. If read daily, this book will last one about a month in a half.  The book is in hardcover format and features an attractive blue and white floral design on the outer cover as well as on the inner-pages. I typically like to read my devotions in the early morning hours but that doesn't always happen. So I appreciate even more the small size of this book. It's size makes it easy to slip into a purse or tote to bring along with me wherever I may go and makes it always ready for whenever I have the time read it.Every devotion begins with a title, short devotion with a point to ponder, and a five minutes in the Word section. The five minutes in the Word section list many Bible verses that correspond with the devotional. I like so much scripture is included! I can go over the scripture again and again and ponder it's truths for my life and that's something I very much appreciate.The devotionals aren't numbered or dated so there's no pressure if you miss a day. I would have loved if there was a ribbon bookmark included in the book to keep my spot but it's still fine without it. This book is a wonderful choice to bless someone else with or to keep for yourself. We all have busy times and seasons in our life, so it's nice to have a Word of Encouragement to grow in God such as this to turn too. I certainly recommend this book.Required Federal Trade Commission disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary copy of this book by the BookLook blogger review program in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TI5TYXDFA4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0718032535#wasThisHelpful","R18TI5TYXDFA4W","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew my husband would appreciate this shirt. A cold winter is expected and I want him to have quality tops from trusted brands that will last and  keep him warm. This shirt fits that bill! It looks great on my husband and it's easy to care for. I asked him to share his thought on it below.Husband's thoughts: If it's cold out, a warm, comfortable shirt is key. This shirt is both of those things! It's not itchy, it's warm, and stylish too!I've worn it with a t-shirt and without and both were comfortable.The shirt feels durable and well made, with a lined collar.It has two breast pockets with buttons.

"The DII Oceanique Machine Washable 100% Cotton Ribbed Woven Luxury Spa Bath Rug in cool brown is nice. The brown is almost a gray, in my opinion. It pairs will with many colors like yellow and blue. If a bathroom is beach themed, I feel this rug would fit perfectly.The rug is just the right size to sit in front of our shower or take residence at the foot of our sink. The material is comfortable to step on and it's very absorbent. The rug does  slide on the floor a bit because it doesn't have a rubber backing and I feel this is something to be aware of. The rug is easy to clean in the wash and it lays flat after drying. Drying time only took a couple of hours after being run through the wash. Since use and washing, there's been no signs of the edges unraveling meaning the rug is made well! I like also that it doesn't seem to pick every fuzz ball or piece of lint.If looking for an affordable option, this rug is a decent choice that won't break the bank!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U2MAGG5K29B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3FFAIE#wasThisHelpful","R3U2MAGG5K29B9","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm quite impressed by the 100% PEVA (Non-Toxic) Shower Curtain Liner from Smarty Pants Supplies. This liner is extremely durable and of high quality.  I noticed right away that this liner doesn't smell! I'm sensitive to smells so not having  weird chemical smells linger in my home is a huge plus.This curtain has 12 rust-proof metal grommets. The grommets are tightly in place and I feel they can withstand normal tugging and pulling very well. The bottom edge of the liner features three encased magnets that have a moderately strong hold to keep the liner in place while showering. The weight of the curtain provides one with the peace of mind that it won't easily tear or move around with the steam of the shower and cling to us!This liner I report is holding up very well! I just love the fact it's able to withstand mold, mildew, and bacterium so well. My bathroom is not well ventilated so we've been battling these inconveniences a lot. It's great to have a liner that's resistant!  A good spray down of hydrogen peroxide and wipe down every other month and this liner is sure to hold up for a long time. I highly recommend it and feel strongly that it's worth the price. *I received this in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377AR2JWSPHH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4VPZNS#wasThisHelpful","R377AR2JWSPHH4","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This headset graces the top of your head with delicate comfort, and fills your ears with the might and magic of gaming.This headset is designed for the PlayStation, but an adapter will allow you to use it on PC as well, and that is how we tested it.It plugs into the standard audio ports (or PS controller). There is a switch to mute/unmute the mic. There is no volume controller on the cord of the kind you might find on a USB headset. On the plus, there's no blaring light on said volume controller that seems to be all the rage these days.The rig on which the speakers are on is a delight to wear. As you place it on your head, you naturally adjust the fitting to the contours of your pate, and it sits there quite placidly, not being intrusively heavy or oppressive to your ears. No bending the cartilage leading discomfort.The sound is of good quality. It sounds better for gaming than music when I tested it. But there is a wide range of sound. Even plugging it into my tablet provided some rather stunning sounds from the game.This Steel Series headset is quite comfortable, sounds great, and is portable from console, to PC, to mobile device.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JYXRIPN2PU90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3P4RI#wasThisHelpful","R2JYXRIPN2PU90","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love having lights up year around but most aren't energy efficient, long lasting, or the best thing for our monthly electric bill. I don't typically do outdoor lights because that would mean having extension cords throughout the yard, timers set up, etc. It's just more of a hassle than it's worth. Though in the back of my mind, I just kept wondering if there was a better way!I was excited to learn about the ZITRADES Solar Fairy String Lights. The multi-colored light string is great for brightening up any indoor or outdoor space for short or long term use! For my family, these have eliminated numerous decorative lighting issues we've come across.The strand is 57 feet long and features 200 lights that flash, twinkle, and stand still depending on what mode set on! There are eight total light modes to chose from. Modes can be changed by pushing a button on the back of the solar panel. My personal favorite is the twinkles! It just makes the atmosphere feel magical!I appreciate that these are waterproof! It's been pretty hot out but we've had a few days of rain and these have gotten soaked daily due to being placed on a fence that surrounds my herb garden and these have held up as a good as new.A six hour charge is all it takes to keep these lights going strong for up to eight hours at night! As soon as it's dim enough out, these prominently come on. The solar panel needs to be facing the sun.  I was placing these indoors, I would keep the panel near a window to take all the sunbeams in to be fully charged. The solar panel can lay flat or be attached to a spike that easily can be pushed into the ground. These are very simple to set up and start using!I adore these lights and am looking into getting more to use for decorating our yard and inside our home. I highly recommend them! These are great for everyday, special occasion, and holiday use!  *I received these light in exchange for an honest review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22WUMUTHT0P2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQUKLEE#wasThisHelpful","R22WUMUTHT0P2A","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Eltronica Lantern not only light the way but also directs your path! The compass that's built into the top is accurate and a neat feature to have included. The light stays hidden and off until you take hold of the handles and pull up. In pulling up you release the light to whatever desired amount you please. It is very bright so I like I can release as little or as much as I'd like!Batteries are not included. It takes three double A's to run. The battery holding area is located on the bottom of the lantern. No screw drivers are needed as the compartment can be open or closed simply by twisting. I like the size of the lantern as it's roughly the size of a can of soup! It takes up little space and that's very appreciated when having to pack for a camping trip or needing to store it some place at home.I consider this lantern a great asset to have on hand when camping or for home emergencies to provide adequate lighting!*I have received this product at discount to provide an honest review.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIVECT1VU1Z0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V97YCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YIVECT1VU1Z0","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The K'NEX Mighty Makers Up, Up and Away Building Set is pretty cool! I gave this set to my seven year old daughter and she got to work on it right away.  She spent a good portion of her Saturday making all three different aviation builds this set allows by herself. The builds include instructions and parts to make an airplane, glider, and a butterfly. My daughter even went so far as to create her own personalized flying contraption.She's not really into dolls but loves blocks and building so she was really thrilled to see a girl-themed set perfect for her age group! Compared to other sets out there she was able to lock the pieces together and take them apart without needing much additional help from my husband or I. She told me that the full color illustrated instructions were easy to follow.The pieces that challenged her the most were the arms and legs of the character. Once attached with moderate play, these tend to need re-attached which can cause a bit of frustration.Once put together the set can be played with without worry of anything coming apart or used as fun room decor.  I like that this set can be used as spring board to learn about mechanics and talk about engineering. It's not just fun to build but provides for a world of learning.Total props for this set being educational as well! My daughter was very proud of her accomplishments (I totally was too!) and is looking forward to collecting more in the Mighty Makers sets!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIQSX4BXRTBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5Y9Y3E#wasThisHelpful","R1TIQSX4BXRTBD","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Five Star Advance Spiral Notebook, 5 Subject, College Ruled in Green is a good choice to keeping organized whether using it for school, office, or another task where having dividers would be beneficial.I'm quite impressed with the durability and quality this notebook provides. The cover is a thick plastic which can easily be wiped off if needed. The binding is some sorta cloth that covers the binders rings. The binding gives this notebook a really polished look and feel.The spiral rings are covered which prevents unwanted snags to bags or injuries to oneself. There is a elastic tab on the front which one can store a pen or pencil so you'll never be without if ready to jot something down. The side of the binding has an area which one can label what the contents are within.Inside are 5 movable pocket dividers and 200 college ruled sheets that are perforated and feature three holes perfect for placing in a binder if needed! Each divider comes in a different color. The colors are gray,red, blue, green, and orange. The dividers feature pockets on both sides and a tab for quick reference and labeling. I like using a pencil when writing on the pockets so if I want to use them again I simply erase my writing and I'm good to go.The durability is top notch. I really feel that this notebook will last a lot longer than something like a binder would over the same amount of time. I'm finding it very useful aid in homing my teaching notes for a variety of subjects being taught in our homeschooling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W0UBKGR0EMYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7X2QQI#wasThisHelpful","R2W0UBKGR0EMYQ","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends Transforming Batcave is awesome! My four year old son adores this set. The look on his face when I presented it to him was priceless. He's into the superheroes quite a bit and his ultimate favorite has always been Batman! This is his first Imaginext set and it certainly wont be his last.The features this set has are many. The transforming action goes from closing and opening batwings, ,transporting action figures up and down an elevator, light up bat eyes,  and jail that can be opened and closed easily! There are gadgets and armor which include an additional suit for Batman, projectile missiles that can be launched, a high-tech command center, and so on. When not being used, the armor is stored in a trunk that is sealed by a power pad which any figure can be placed on and then rotated for the trunk to pop open. All the gadgets (missiles, etc) have a place to be stored which prevents losing crucial pieces!There are two action figures included in this set which are Batman and the Joker. The set was pretty much ready to go upon arrival. All us parents had to do was free the toy from the packaging (which was quite easy to do). The set does have some light up action so I was pretty pleased also that we didn't have to purchase batteries separately.This set has provided for hours of imaginative play!

"The CARAT Fruit Basket with Banana Hanger is a great dual purpose kitchen item. What drew me right away was the fact that I could hang bananas and place other fruits and vegetables in the generous sized bottom bowl. The open areas helped seal the deal for me. The open design ensures the inner contents will last longer preventing bruises and allowing breathing for fresh produce.The attractive design and shiny chrome finish likely will fit into any kitchen color scheme. It looks great on my counter top and in the middle of kitchen table! It's easy to clean and hasn't scraped up any surface it's been upon.The durability is high. The hanger can hold a large number of bananas on the hook and still allow for many fruits to rest below. I would recommend having weight in the bottom of the bowl (i.e fruit or vegetables) when hanging bananas from the hook. The bowl can be somewhat unstable with bananas hanging from the top and and empty bowl below.Because my kids can see the fruit bowl sitting up on the counter or table, they've asked for fresh fruit more often than any other snack! It's been a great replacement for a large wooden bowl that fruit used to reside in. I guess for them it was out of sight, out of mind. This bowl has a been a huge space safer, has caused my kids to chose healthier choices for snacks, and has kept produce fresher longer. I highly recommend it!  *I received a sample of the product for review purposes.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32N3AK0G1NXJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6LEUXO#wasThisHelpful","R32N3AK0G1NXJJ","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd been looking for a functional as well as an attractive kettle for some time and this one certainly fits the bill. The porcelain enamel is very attractive and the stainless steel trim adds that special something. I've found that the kettle has retained its vibrancy and shine after many uses.The base of the kettle fits perfectly on my small 6 inch plug-in burners.  My previous kettle held 2 quarts as well but it's base was suited for a larger burner. My oven only has one large burner but three 6 inch so having a smaller kettle base is quite preferred.The kettle features an easily removable lid for filling. I've found the lid to stay in place not shifting around even though it can be removed with very little effort. The kettle does whistle when water is boiling, it's not an overly ear piercing but much more subtle.  There's a heat-free silicone grip on the handle of the kettle that keeps it from slipping out of my hand while I am pouring. I also like the that the thumb lever on the kettle features the same heat reducing grip which helps to prevent accidental burns.This kettle is easy to pour and not make a mess. It has a bit of weight to it but of this I am glad. I don't have to fear the kettle getting knocked off the counter or stove easily.  Water stays warm for at least a half hour after boiled. I feel this kettle would be the perfect gift. It comes in a array of colors to suit any kitchen theme or personal style preference.

"Zwilling J.A. Henckels Ultra-Slim Nail Clipper do an excellent job. The construction and design of these clippers make it that they take up a  very minimal amount of space. Per following the illustrated instructions on the packaging my husband and I were able to figure out how to properly wield these for trimming finger and toenails. You simply slide the top part toward you to unlock it, then push that part all the way away from you, and then back toward you again to put the clippers into a cutting position. Closing the clippers is just as easy as opening them, once you get the hang of it.The cuts are clean and never rip, tear, or leave one with the need to file ones nails after. The storage pouch is black leather and the clippers stay snugly inside once placed. Since these are so slender, I've swapped out another pair of clippers in my purse and these took their place. These do what advertised, take up very little storage space, and appear to be quite durable. I certainly recommend for all nail trimming needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R88ZKXG53CGEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A9JPKK#wasThisHelpful","R88ZKXG53CGEJ","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Zillionz Talking Cash Register is a great choice for a teaching aid or prop for pretend play in helping children understand the importance of money and how it works. The unique features of this register such as the microphone, credit card sliding slot, and hand held scanner with sticker bar-codes to scan were huge hits with my 4 and 7 year old. The register includes play money and coins that mimic the size and value of real money. The drawer on the register opens and there are separate spots to  place the play money. The drawer makes a ding noise when opened. I did notice that the button will need to be pressed down with a bit more pressure to open as intended. I let my kids know that it tends to stick a bit and since realizing that there's been no issues with it.There are three languages English, French, and Spanish that the register can function in. This is great if teaching children a separate language! There is no volume control option but I found the sound to be at a comfortable level. The microphone works well and sounds just like one you would hear at the supermarket! When the register is not in use, there's an auto-off feature which saves batteries. This register requires 3 AA batteries which are included!There is a number pad on the register that functions just a like calculator. Children can scan bar codes and, add in their own prices to their total easily. I can see my family using this register for many years to come. It's a great way to teach about adding up purchases, making change, and so much more. This toy register is the closest to the real thing that I've seen on the market.I recommend it to children ages 4 and up mainly due to the lightweight plastic and feel of the product.

Each of the flowers  have a separate colored light of red, green, and blue. When it's dark out, the lights shine vibrantly likely not to be missed. The solar power panel is on the back and can be removed to change the one double A battery if needed with a small screw driver. If I need to turn the fairy off, there's a switch on the bottom of the statue. I like how the solar panel and switches are out of sight.In being a fairy fan myself, I feel most would favor this one. She's beautiful and adds charm to wherever she is placed. I feel she will be the first of many more additions!* I received this product free.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M0AXGZ6JFG5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6NDK3U#wasThisHelpful","R2M0AXGZ6JFG5R","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The  25 oz FlavFusion (TM) Infuser Bottle by Big Easy Brands is one of the best infuser water bottles I've used!  It's durability is something to brag about being made out of Tritan Plastic. It can withstand being washed in the top wrack of the dishwasher use after use.  The bottle only has a few parts that are easy to keep together and keep clean, the base, a lid, infuser, and infuser cap.The bottle is completely BPA and Lead free. It's very light weight and easy to carry along with either with my hand gripped firmly around it or when using the hook on the lid to hold or hook onto a bag. It's slender design also fit great into the cup holder of our car.One of my favorite features is the locking lid. I simply turn the top lid to the right or left to keep it locked or unlocked.  The lid is a flip-top. I press a button on the front and it flips open. This prevents me from having to stop when walking, exercising, or whatever else just to un-twist a top to rehydrate. I've had zero issues with this bottle leaking or showing any other sort of wear.The infuser works great and I like the fact that you can use this bottle with or without by simply untwisting it from the inside. I've added cucumbers, blueberries, lemons, limes, mint, and more to create a number of delicious fruit infused water blends. For the best results I found letting the fruit, herbs, and vegetables sit in the water bottle in the fridge overnight delivered a far more intense flavor. Overnight setting isn't necessary, but important enough to mention.The flow of the water from the bottle with the infuser  is very natural, much like drinking from a cup. Since the fruit is confined to the basket, it allows for the water to flow around it preventing one from drinking pulp, seeds, fruit, or whatever else when taking a sip.I've been using this bottle for a couple of months and after seeing how well it's held up, highly recommend it! *I received this bottle for free to share my thoughts upon it*","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRDX0WUE9VQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NY7R65S#wasThisHelpful","R1HRDX0WUE9VQ2","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Installing the Home-It Mop is simple. It comes with everything you'll need for general mounting, such as screws and drywall mounts.My husband put the rack on the desired area, made pencil marks where the holes were, then drilled holes for the mounts and hammered those in. He then put the rack back up and lined up the holes with the mounts and inserted the screws.There are no instructions, but there's nothing abnormal about the setup. If you've ever mounted something before, you'll likely have no problem. If you've never mounted on drywall before, and that's what you need to do, surely youTube will have a helpful tutorial.This is quite simple on the scale of install difficulty.The durability is noticeable and construction of this product was obviously well thought out. I've filled a few of the holding areas with household cleaning items of different sizes such as mop and brooms. The hanging hooks I've placed hand dusters and needed reusable bags upon and everything has stayed in placed.  My family likes this product and it's kept our home better organized.

"I received this to review and passed it along to my husband. Here's what he had to say about it: I've tried a few beards, and now also a various beard balms.Mr Rugged now ranks among the balms that have been upon my beard.This balm contains several oils, such as jojoba and ceder wood, as well seed butter and beeswax. It's easy to apply as it is soft but fairly firm.As one might gather from the ingredients, it is oily, so if you apply too much, your face will be oily. Following the directions should help. I just got carried away.When applied properly, it does soften the hair, as well as hydrate the skin. It's noticeable after using it only once.Got a beard? This is certainly an effective product to make it as good as it can be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBIKACG724N2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R46FGDO#wasThisHelpful","RBIKACG724N2G","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OZ Naturals Anti Aging - SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen is the best natural sunscreen I've used to date. It provides the protection needed from the rays of the sun without the use of any harmful chemicals.  It's made in the USA, never tested on animals, and 100% Vegan free. It contains  Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide known to give the ultimate protection against UVA and UVB rays preventing sunburn and damage.I like that I know what many of the ingredients and vitamins are that make up this sunscreen. The combination of of aloe, green tea, sweet almond, sunflower, cocoa butter, vitamin E, and so on smell wonderful! The scent is light and sweet. It's not what usually comes to mind when one thinks of sunscreen but I really like it!Application is directed to apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying after two hours or sooner if swimming, sweating, or towel drying. It went on fairly easily and didn't leave any undesirable white residue behind.  My skin wasn't left feeling greasy or looking shiny but feeling soft and moisturized instead. It doesn't feel heavy.  I was able to apply my mineral makeup right on top of this! My skin is fairly sensitive and I've had zero irritation.I work outside quite bit in my garden for a good bit of time each day and have found this SPF 30 sunscreen helps to prevent me from burning! Aside from protection it has anti-aging properties! I certainly recommend it. *I received a sample of the product for review purposes.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EVAU0DGUGYGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MF7321A#wasThisHelpful","R2EVAU0DGUGYGC","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Educational Insights Crazy Cereal is fast paced electronic game. Upon arrival, my son and daughter ages 7 and 4 were drawn to the cheerful illustrations covering the box. I have to applaud the box design. It mimics an actual cereal box quite well with nutritional information, a maze to do on the back, and so on. My children couldn't wait playing this game as it promised laughter and fun!Before play, a parent, teacher, or guardian will need to locate 2 AAA batteries and install one each into the game spoons per the instructions given. This step only takes a few minutes. A normal sized Phillips head screwdriver sufficed in the installation process. The batteries are solely needed for the LED color changing lights which match individual pieces of cereal. Each of the spoons has an auto-shut off mode which saves batteries and the sheer wonder if everything was turned off after game play.This two player game focuses on matching and color recognition skills. It's a fast paced and is usually is over in about five minutes. Whoever has the most pieces of cereal in their bowl at the end wins. There's a bit a variation to the game to keep things interesting. Skill is required in scooping up one piece of cereal and then two at a time into their own bowls with only using one hand. This game can help with sharpening motor skills and hand-eye coordination. It provides a challenge and also can be used as an aid to teach patience and good sportsmanship with others.Aside from playing the game as instructed, the game pieces can be used as an aid in teaching or pretend play. The cereal pieces designs are a circle loop, star, and a waffle type square. The colors of each are red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. The high quality pieces can be used to create patterns, practice motor skills without the speed of the game, and as math manipulatives.My son and daughter seemed to find this game fun. Their only disappointment was that it was over somewhat quickly. To expand game play we decided they would play three rounds. I had to remind them the first few times about the only picking up the cereal using the spoon and not their other hand. I really like that this game provides challenge. At the end of each round, I had the kids count the pieces they collected in their bowls. They were enjoying themselves so much that I bet they didn't realize they were learning and developing important skills too!  * In being an EI Insider I received a sample of the product for review purposes.*","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BDFSCNWBICOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAW2Z0O#wasThisHelpful","R2BDFSCNWBICOX","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DII kitchen millennium microfiber dishtowels are amazing. I'm used to towels becoming soaked with minimal dish drying and leaving wetness behind but not with these. The towels are super soft and retain softness even after coming out of the wash. I washed these cold per instructions given and the towels look just as good as new when through the wash completely. I've often had towels of the same material pick up all sorts of lint  in the dryer and bleed onto other things but I didn't run into that issue with this set.The towel designs vary from light gray to much darker. The striped pattern is on one side of the towel and on the back it's completely white. The edges are all finely done and there's no sign of these coming apart very easily. On one of the corners is a tag that provides care instructions. I like that these towels can be multi-purpose. Aside from drying dishes, one could use these to polish stainless steel, wash windows, wipe down the car inside or out, bathroom cleaning, and so on. The quality and price made me jump at purchasing another set.  I may just invest in more to have colors for every season! I can't recommend these enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHCP4822GK5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQYFQES#wasThisHelpful","R3KHCP4822GK5Y","A194K60CWZ371J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A194K60CWZ371J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This was very easy to install and took me less than 30 minutes from opening the box to having it connected to the water lines and secured to the sink.  i had an issue with the stopped function but that was more related to our shape of sink and not so much the faucet.

"Pretty neat concept but is a bit trickier in real life than on TV....Imagine that!  It needs 6 AA batteries to bring it to life to build the charge, so I suggest you use rechargeable batteries to get the job done.  You have to be careful at launching so as to not keep your face right over the unicorn as it takes flight.  It's magical in flight with a horn that lights up.  Easy to open packaging and easy to set up.  It does have a learning curve of around 20 minutes, but I do not recommend this outside in any type of wind.  It does need big open spaces when getting the hang of the unit.Overall, really nice toy with a small learning curve with the need for some AA batteries.  Depending upon the treatment of the toy will determine the outcome of how long it lasts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LONYHLG9GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U7EXCV8#wasThisHelpful","R10LONYHLG9GI","A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After watching the Blu-Ray DVD version of Ryan's trip to the Sacred Mountains i got the book.  I have to say the book is a must have to go along with the DVD.  Phenomenal detail of Human powered adventure mirrored with excellent writing and editing.  You take on Ryan's journey as he prepares mentally and physically to push himself through each trek, and you soak in the experiences with each step as if you were along side him on the same journey. The DVD consists of four episodes, each of a different mountain. They are 40-45 minute made-for-TV episodes, seamlessly put together giving us details of each trek before the adventure.I highly recommend the Blu-Ray DVD of his trek through China and state that you must accompany it with the book.  Not only did I enjoy both but my family as well.  The video was fantastic and goes hand in hand with the book.

"One of the best faucets I've see on the market and one that was installed effortlessly by a professional handyman.  It has an awesome shine that cleans up well and goes with my stainless 5 burner cook top very well.  It arrived in good order with no issues and was well packaged and ready to install.  It came with the AC power pack but I needed the 6 AA pack since I didn't have an outlet under my sink.  The installation was pretty easy and straight forward and was done in little over 1 hour. The Pfister company does sell the battery pack option, but I purchased off Amazon and had it there in two days and plugged it in myself.The React Touch Free Technology feature works flawlessly and super fast, just a little too sensitive at times when in dimmer light or when you accidentally wave your hand in front while cleaning.  I suggest using the cleaning mode to turn off the sensor before cleaning.  My kids love it as much as I do simply because you can now avoid getting the faucet and handle dirty by turning it on and off.  Easy off and on for kids and you get to set the temperature so it cannot scald.  They like being able to hold a glass in front of the faucet to get some water instead of having to turn it on and off all the time.  If it's left on, it shuts itself off after 2 minutes.  Perfect!Good clearance in getting the unit filling iced tea pitchers and my icoffee water tank. The pull down sprayer with a pause feature is the perfect finishing touch with the Pforever Warranty covering finish and function for as long as you own your home.  How can you go wrong with such a unique system?  The perfect way to update your kitchen.

I'm glad it was a demo model as it's highly uncomfortable to sit in and it has you leaning forward no matter how you adjust it.It did not arrive well packaged, in fact the box was pretty much destroyed and it fell apart getting it into the house. Part of the seat back was punctured during shipping but nothing worth fixing since the chair is not something I want to use.  Lucky everything was still inside the box.  Instructions were very easy to follow and the chair was put together in 20 minutes, but I tried adjusting it for an hour since it was so uncomfortable.The material feels good but over all the chair but it's stiff, clunky and seat back was not proportioned for my 6' 2"" frame.  With it dipping forward and not being able to get a comfortable position its sitting off to the side, perhaps a Good Will run is in it's future, but I'd feel bad giving it them as well as it seems below anyone normal standards of a chair.Do not buy unless you can first sit in one at a local store!","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVM18CCCBCKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4NAHWA#wasThisHelpful","RGVM18CCCBCKG","A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a professional chef I often am on the lookout for items that fit my extreme in cooking at home.  It was perfect when when I saw this pop up to demo and really glad I choose the item to utilize.  My wife and kids love the color combination and I love the versatility and durability including the stay cool handle.First and foremost I cooked off a pound of bacon at low heat, uncovered and had minimal splatter.  The pan was a snap to clean with a dry paper towel and then back on the gas burner to cook off some grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches.  A little butter on the bread and then two sandwiches at a time without turning up the flame.  There was even heating and browning and perfect melting of the cheese.The ceramic finish made for another quick cleanup with a sudsy sponge, and then hung on the pot rack for the next meal.  Perfect pan for the professional and home cook alike.  It's nice to have such quality in the kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5ZYJGK6UOE3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KXTDF3C#wasThisHelpful","R3L5ZYJGK6UOE3","A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IFGGXG3YV3Y6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's ready to go in a matter minutes right out of the box, and replacement filters are easily found on Amazon or other online locations as needed.

It gives a fresh clean smell to the main family living space with little noise.  I'd say from low to high it goes from the sound of our dishwasher to that off a small box fan, which is not that bad for the size and volume of air moved through the unit.Even as a demo, I'd purchase another if needed based upon the quality, design and economics of filter replacement.

"UGh.  I have skinny legs so I thought I'd be okay with the large - which fits EVERYWHERE else - but nope.  Could barely get the crotch snapped and even when I did, the snaps popped open almost immediately.  I've been trying to make some alterations on it and am regretting it because it's so much more complicated than it should be and now I can't return it... even if I do get it to the point where the crotch doesn't pop open when I move, I'm not sure that it will look good.  I might just have a hanging crotch.  Ick.It's really annoying that it fits me perfectly except the leg holes - seriously, I don't even want to think about how skinny someone's legs must have to be to fit into this thing.  Although, maybe it's not the legs, maybe if I had a little less booty that would help too, but either way, the fact that the elastic still can't stretch enough to wear this comfortably and without the crotch unsnapping is pretty disappointing.  It's elastic.

"Reading The Para-Portage of Emily made me feel like I was reading Jane Austen or one of the Bronte sisters, if they had written erotic romances.  Wilson's descriptive prose paints a scene like an artist paints a landscape.  The story itself is hauntingly beautiful, interspersed with passionate erotic scenes that are done in a very romantic style with lots of description and emotion imbuing each one.  I couldn't help but feel a little sad while reading the story, because there is quite a bit of sadness as Emily learns about the tragically romantic past of the house she's currently residing in, but at the same time there's a thread of hope as well.  There's also a mystery to be solved and little hints scatter the story, like breadcrumbs, until it all comes together in the end.While I found the story to be a bit sadder than I usually enjoy, I couldn't tear myself away from the beautiful writing, my curiosity over what kind of ending could be coming, and my desire to know exactly what was going on.  There's ghosts - or maybe just shadows of the past - and all sorts of possibilities.  Mostly, there's a sense of love that never dies, passion that never fades, and patience that never ends, until the reward finally comes.  I'm very happy this is a series, although I wouldn't say the book ends on a cliff-hanger, but I can't wait to see where it goes from here.If you want a completely different kind of ghostly romance, and especially if you love histories and love that crosses all barriers of time, space and death, this is definitely a book you won't want to miss.  It's unlike anything I've ever read, in a very good way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7PBDS0OQL2NM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMI9QTG#wasThisHelpful","R7PBDS0OQL2NM","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is just bad.  I bought it to be part of a costume, while also being functional as a purse, and it's completely unusable, as a costume prop or as a purse.It's poorly and cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture. Strangely, it does come with four machine gun purses instead of one. I assume that's why the price is so high. I thought the price was high because it would actually be something of quality.The gun part is completely flat, less than a centimeter thick, so that if you pointed it at someone, they would have no idea what you were pointing at them. It also comes wrinkled and bent, because the wire that's keeping it straight leaves a lot to be desired. The ""purse"" part is basically a coin purse; the only part of it that holds anything is the little round pouch which (as my best friend and husband both pointed out) looks like a man's sack. It's wrinkled, asymmetrical and bent out of shape when it arrives. After ten minutes of trying to get it to face the way it's supposed to, I finally gave up and realized that it was just going to keep turning to the side, no matter what I did.It looks like a machine gun that some kid cut out of cardboard and painted black, and the purse part doesn't actually function as a purse unless you're not carrying anything more than some cash and cards. Overall, incredibly poor quality and I will be returning it asap.****EDIT*****Even worse - their return policy stinks.  You have to pay for the postage, the original shipping is non-refundable and they charge a ""minimum"" 15% restocking fee.

"I really wish I had read the other one-star reviews before buying this book.Callie had HUGE potential and I was so looking forward to reading her story about how she comes into her own and learns to stand up for herself and stand on her own two feet... yeah, that's not at all what the story was.  It was still a good read though, even if I wanted to kick her over and over again for the way she was treated Cadence.  She was a really $hitastic friend to Cadence after leaving, not returning Cadence's calls, not talking to her, and really hurting Cadence over and over again.  I was also looking forward to seeing their reconciliation.Instead, Butler has Callie turn from a sweet and compassionate person to everyone, to only being sweet and compassionate to her twins and their family members.  By the end of it, she's even forgotten to invite Cadence and her old friends / family to her wedding.  She's completely shut them out of her life, and she wouldn't have remembered at all if Cadence hadn't called to bug her about it.  She doesn't even CARE how much she's hurt Cadence.  She never apologizes, and then she's all pissed when she finds out that Cadence wanted her to be miserable so that she could come back to the pack?  Of COURSE CADENCE DID!  SHE WANTS HER BEST FRIEND BACK!  If Callie hadn't been such a terrible friend, if she had actually kept in contact with Cadence and hadn't ABANDONED her completely, Cadence would probably have never wished that.  Because she would still HAVE HER BEST FRIEND.It also bothered me that the twins were so pushy about Callie forgetting her past friendships as well.  They were even jealous over her playing with her new nephews.  WTF.  They're verging on being abusive; cutting her off from her other ties, keeping her from interacting with anyone outside of their family, stifling some of her interactions within their family, and keeping her from working so that she literally CANT have interactions with other men outside of their family.Instead of finding her strength and being a good person, Callie caves on all these points.  It wasn't romantic, it was actually pretty terrifying.  And the way she treated Cadence was unforgiveable.  By the end of the book, I asked for a refund, which I NEVER do if I actually finish a book.  I hated the characters that much.  I could barely even skim over their HEA because I didn't feel like any of them deserved it.  Callie started off the book a wimp in search of herself, and ended the book under the thumbs of her new hubbies, and during her journey, she became a terrible friend and kind of a terrible person.If you're reading this series, skip this book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIXYAK42482OM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089YLQXY#wasThisHelpful","RIXYAK42482OM","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is what I like to refer to as a ""limbo"" book.  Because everything is stuck in limbo.  A whole bunch of stuff happens, but at the same time... nothing happens.  Because nothing gets resolved.  It kinda sucks to write a 3 star review after I wrote a 5 star one for the last book, but the last book had a lot more going for it.Starting with the most upsetting / disappointing aspect of this book - Reece and Lexi's relationship.  They actually get it together for a bit, but who cares, because by the end of the book they've fallen apart again.  The only thing that's holding this relationship together is the ""bond"" between them, which is basically a false foundation for a relationship because it's something they don't have a choice about.  I really wish they'd spent the entire book being good together and didn't fall apart until the next one because it would have done a couple of things - given them a chance to build their relationship on a solid foundation so that when they did fall apart it would be more devastating but it would also be more believable when they start to work things out again (because you know they're going to... Lexi has to, she's drilled it into the reader's heads that she had no choice about that because of the bond).  It also would have made me a lot more anxious, because I was honestly expecting their relationship to fall apart sometime during the book.  Diem has already set that up during the past several books and so I waited and then it got to the critical point and I thought ""I bet this is when it all falls apart"" and BOOM yup.  Except that Reece didn't have to let it fall apart, but he did anyway, and that just made me even more disappointed in him as a hero.  Especially since there was basically no time to build him up as a better boyfriend before that.  There was no time for Lexi to make a real romantic connection to him and so it's hard for the reader to feel it.Lexi comes off as more immature in this book, which is understandable when I remind myself that she's 18.  Diem also has liking for major foreshadowing, I've noticed, and does a lot of it with pushing home that Lexi can never get it on with another guy because Reece bound her so tightly, but apparently she didn't bind Reece as tightly so he can totally get it on with another girl.  Gee... I wonder what's going to happen in the next book.  On Facebook Diem has said that Reece will SEEM like a cheating bastard, so my hope is that he's not ACTUALLY a cheating bastard, and that Lexi will not put up with his b.s. forever.  Which is great and everything and I'm looking forward to watching Reece suffer and, hopefully, spend a lot of time proving to Lexi that he can be a good mate and actually building a relationship with her, but after this book and the abruptness with which they fell apart, without building a foundation, it's hard to believe that Lexi would ever want to.  She's got good reason to have rejection and trust issues at this point and with Reece doing it over and over again... honestly, unless he spends MULTIPLE books trying to win her back, I'm going to be pretty disappointed.  Diem has also stated that despair is the most powerful driving force and only those we love can get us there... I'd argue that LOVE is the most powerful driving force and that Lexi - who has already lost so much of what she loves with her mother and father - would fight hardest to KEEP her loves safe whereas despair tends to make people take suicidal risks when they feel they have nothing left to live for (and Diem def has her getting to that point since she's now lost her mother, her father and Reece, not to mention any hope for her future with Reece because of the restrictions of the bond - and seriously, how does she know the differences in how they're bound nad Reece doesn't? it's never explained)... but yeah.  At this point, the only way 'despair' as a driving force makes sense to me is if she's going to sacrifice herself for them, because right now it doesn't look like she has a whole lot worth living for.  And that's before Reece becomes even more of an @$$ (which, according to Diem's fb posts, is going to happen in the next book).As to the main action... Lexi's mother isn't even an issue in this book, the rogue shifter takes center stage (despite the fact that Lexi is slowly being pulled to the dark side and will continue to be so until they kill her mother).  Focusing on the wolves mostly seemed like a plot device to make sure that Reece and Lexi fell apart again more than anything else, and it was pretty disappointing that the mother story line got shunted off to the side, despite the danger that it puts Reece and Lexi into.  While the wolves were interesting and the succubuses were interesting... it really did seem like a plot device more than needed action.  It didn't totally make sense to me either.  Hunt down murderous paranormals vs. hunt down murderous paranormal that is going to tear the team apart because two of them will die if they don't... and somehow the former won?  Sure the rogue wolf could make them look bad, but it ended up that they didn't spend most of the book hunting the rogue wolf, they spent it hunting a succubus... so why aren't they looking for her mom again?  As strategy goes, it was incredibly questionable, which is why I say plot device.So... of unresolved issues at the end of the book we have:Lexi's fatherLexi's motherWhether or not Lexi and Reece are going to be consumed by the vampirism they're infected withLexi and Reece's relationshipSounds a lot like the end of the last book.  Except add to this that now we can expect Reece to have to choose between his team and his heritage in the next book, so we got new information, but instead of any answers we just got new questions.Here's hoping that in the next book there is at least SOME resolution to SOMETHING.  I'm also personally hoping that Lexi finds out she's not as bound to Reece as she thought and he ends up with some competition.  Esp if he ends up sniffing around some other women, because I really hate the sexist cliche of the heroine having to remain faithful while the ""hero"" gets to dip his wick.  Reece could use some shaking up and, honestly, so could Lexi.  The 18 year old mentality of ""i'll never love again"" might be kind of true thanks to the bond, but hey... we know from this book that alphas can steal bonds.  So at least there's an out for her if Reece becomes any more emotionally withdrawn (*cough*abusive*cough*) and hopefully she'll get a happily ever after that is believable.All of that being said; the actual writing is still very good (Diem is one of my faves for writing style), the bad guys are interesting and different, a lot of what happens in the book (other than the strange strategic choice of which baddie to deal with) is believable (even if it does make me strongly dislike Reece), and I still have hope that the books will eventually come together in a way that will be happy for Lexi AND believable/happy for the readers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O03L43TL4WAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6U1Q8Q#wasThisHelpful","R1O03L43TL4WAS","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I adored this book.  Almost.  Except that Ms. Blake is an evil writer who put something into the epilogue that makes me want the next book NOW NOW NOW NOW!  Although that's not exactly an unusual feeling for me whenever I read her writing.  But still.  I WANT IT NOOOOOW!Enough of that though - this book.  Adored.Mitch is one of those frustrating heroes that's all closed up inside emotionally and you just want to kick him, but he has such good reasons for being guarded that you also want to pet him and tell him that everything's going to be okay.  On top of that, he's a sexy and demanding Dom that makes you want to drop your panties.I loved Laurel.  She was an exceptionally strong heroine, one who had the guts to walk away when she needed to and - even more important - to stand her ground when the stakes were high.  So many books have the hero chasing after the heroine after he messes up, and it's good to see the groveling, but in a relationship not everything can be high drama and ""we're over"" as soon as there's a fight.  Both people have to be willing to fight FOR the relationship when the fight is over, despite their pride, despite their hurt... and Laurel is strong enough to do that and to show Mitch how a relationship SHOULD be.  All he has to do is be deserving of that.There's some danger, some twists and turns, plenty of humor, just a little bit of Ian's delightful relationship advice, and some new characters that have me super curious. Speaking of adoration, I really hope Kai gets his own book or novella eventually (although, like most of her novellas, Adored is more like a short book than a true novella) because listening to him talk about women and relationships... ha!  His theories are sound, but he's obviously lacking in some practical experience =DAnd, when you get to the epilogue, you'll probably curse Ms. Blake for not having the next book ready immediately. There's a reason she's an automatic-buy author for me, and I have not been disappointed yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZPUHIRGKGOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O99U468#wasThisHelpful","R6ZPUHIRGKGOG","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was actually pretty disappointed in this book.  Partly because I'm not sure I like the way the story line is heading... I'm down with shifters and 'changed' humans, but once you start throwing ""gods"" around into the mix... things always get too deus ex machina for me.In this particular Luna Lodge book I felt like there was a lot less romance, which really sucked because I was looking forward to two things 1. Remus being super alpha sexy (which he has been in past books) and 2. Finding out more about Remus because he's pretty swathed in mystery.The problem was, we didn't get to find out much about Remus' past still.  We still know very little about why any of the bad guys are doing what they do - which is part of my problem with gods being thrown into the mix, it adds a whole new aspect that now needs to be explained, even though not much else has yet - and we're introduced to more of the inner circle of bad guys... and still get no motivation other than they're working for these mysterious gods.  Except at least one of them thinks that the gods would disapprove of what's going on.  We didn't even get to find out why Romulus does what he does, except that he's power hunger and jealous of Remus?  maybe?  No explanation why though.  oh, and apparently he's NOT in charge of the bad guys.  At least, he's not the big in charge.  There's others that are in charge of him that he's scared of? or feels like he has to listen to?  Ugh.  Things were not entirely clear.  Even Remus was confused by what the heck was going on.Because of the bad bad things the bad guys are doing to Remus while he's with them, trying to arrange to get his people freed, he's getting weaker and weaker.  And while I love seeing Jenna step up to the plate as the bada$$ that she is... there was something very much missing in the romance of this one for me.  I read Luna Lodge because I love the hot alpha males... there wasn't a whole lot of that going on.  There were some tender alpha male times, which were pretty great, but Remus was always so much fun because he was so cocky, so mysterious... and there was none of that here.I adored Jenna, but that wasn't enough to make up for the things I felt were missing from the book.  Namely - any kind of real insight into the bad guys and Remus' alpha sexiness.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2DDX4JJ3DPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X114YR0#wasThisHelpful","R1U2DDX4JJ3DPK","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not Jillian Eaton's best work, which is truly disappointing as this may have been one of the books that I was looking forward to the most and which had the potential to be one of the best.I liked a lot of the book, I even liked Miles... up until the last quarter of the book.  Maybe Ms. Eaton got lazy.  Maybe she's just a more forgiving person than I am.  But she let him off way too easily.  ""Four times"" he puts his heart out on his sleeve for Diana... soooo one time for each year?  Whoop-de-doo.  Then he runs away like a pansy because she keeps saying no to him.  Of course she keeps saying no to him, she even tells him that she can't love him because she can't trust him not to leave.  Instead of PROVING that he can stick around, PROVING that she should be able to trust him.. what does he do?  He leaves!  WITHOUT TELLING HER AGAIN!!!!Which apparently somehow makes him worthy of being chased after?  I don't think so.  She should have realized she was well shot of him and gone on to marry someone else who was actually worthy of her.  Someone who was willing to fight for her.  For all Miles' talk of how much he loves her, he chooses his horse over her at one point (it had a fever... it's called grooms.), he doesn't do anything to court her (no flowers, no determined wooing, just some attempts at seduction which is NOT the same thing) and he never REALLY grovels to her for abandoning her to her family and the censure of Society.All in all, he is still taking her for granted by the end of the book.  But she's will to accept that, so I guess she's going to get what she deserves... a husband that's undeserving and doesn't appreciate her the way he should and was never willing to really fight for her, because she never made him.Honestly, I really hope that one day Ms. Eaton rewrites this book and makes Miles into an actual hero instead of a spineless, useless, unappreciative a$$ that is so far from being worthy of Diana that it's not even funny.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L79YC631MNNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8F5GTM#wasThisHelpful","R3L79YC631MNNM","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a great follow-up to the first book!I'm a big fan of Amanda Lee's Witches and Avery Shaw series (although, admittedly, I could NOT get into her young adult series... hated the main character in that) and it looks like she's got me hooked on a new one now.Definitely read the first book before trying this one, because there's a lot of background about reapers that you need to know, as well as about Aisling's rather unique family.  If you like snarky dialogue, nosy brothers, alpha male overload, and a seriously sassy heroine, then you need to check this series out.  I've tried other reaper series and been turned off by the magic or the exposition, but Ms. Lee weaves the mythology and facts that you need in order to swallow your suspension of disbelief through snappy quips and lots of action to keep the reader interested.As a follow-up book, we get to go deeper into Aisling's family situation, AND we get to learn a lot more about Det. Griffin - even meeting a family member!  Can I just say, I freaking love Griffin????  He's got a ton of patience, and at the same time manages to hold his own with Aisling's family, occasionally giving out the affectionate verbal abuse as fast as he gets pummeled with it.  I really love that this book shows a lot of Aisling just trying to do the mundane business of her job, while being sidetracked by more wraiths, more little mysteries and more murders.I also really appreciate that a new character brings in some great insight into Aisling and the way her family works.  It's easy, at times, to dismiss Aisling's behavior as childish, and there was one point when I was shaking my head and thinking WHY IS SHE SO STUPID?! I was almost disappointed at Ms. Lee, because it seemed like she was being stupid for the sake of being stupid, but then the side character brought up some really good points as she was basically psychoanalyzing Aisling and her family, and I immediately was like ""Oh... okay, good points.""  I'm totally okay with behavior that verges on idiocy as long as there's a reasonable explanation behind it that makes the character's motivations plausible and not just a convenient plot point.  Ms. Lee is RIGHT on top of it with providing that explanation.More girl fights with Angelina, more delightful nights with Jerry, more family confrontations, and a rousing game of Shark Attack (which... I am dying to get my friends drunk enough to convince them to play it with me...) and there's plenty to laugh about through the book as you wait for the mystery to be solved.The best part?  No cliffhanger ending.  There IS some information that comes up at the end which is like OMG and of course I can't wait to see where that information is going to lead in the next book, but it's not a frustrating / things are unexplained kind of cliff hanger ending.  Which is one of the nice things about reading this series - I'm not MAD at the end of the book.  I'm satisfied with the way things wrapped up but looking forward to the next book (a lot).  It's the best way to feel at the end of a book - and highly unusual for a serial.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20DGU0EXDO2CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW9SNEO#wasThisHelpful","R20DGU0EXDO2CP","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's the thing. I really wanted to like this book.  It sounded like it was going to be so good.  It started off so promising.  The writing style is well done.  The opening is well done.  The characters are well done... right up until Jada STOPS being a strong, sassy woman and throws herself into Brandon's arms only a page or two after she's all ""he's not the golden boy to me... I'll never trust another man because of him""  etc etc.  With good reason too.  So, without even an explanation as to why he left her high and dry, which led to quite a bit of bullying and making her absolutely miserable, or even a freaking APOLOGY, he's holding her hand and then they're getting it on.  WHERE DID STRONG JADA GO?!Okay, so that means that AFTER the sexy times, they're going to talk and she's going to get an apology and an explanation, right?WRONG.They're getting it on again only minutes after she thinks she caught him getting it on with another woman.  Although, I suppose one way to find out if a guy has had his face between another woman's legs is to kiss him and see if you taste her... like... come on.  We all know that's not why she did it.  She just ""couldn't resist him"".Well this book would have been a lot better if she had.  This book needed tension.  Sexual and emotional.  There was absolutely none, because the second Brandon shows up, Jada forgets all of her convictions, she forgets all of her trust issues, and it's like she's a totally normal woman who's smitten with him.  What's the point of building up her character in the beginning if that's not who she really is?!  It would have been an AWESOME book if Brandon had actually had to do all the things that he thinks he's going to have to do - like groveling, winning her trust, winning her love.  Instead, she basically just throws her trust, love and body at his head within a couple of hours of him showing up in town.  No apologies, explanations or groveling necessary.As second chance books go, this one was a flop... right from the moment the couple flopped into each other's arms rather than actually building anything between them.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQ4NN0IY4H6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TM8RRSO#wasThisHelpful","R2GQ4NN0IY4H6J","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a fairly decent novella, except for the fact that with the amount of story going on, it really should have been a full length novel.  I enjoyed most of the read, but almost every aspect (except the erotic) left me wanting MORE.There's a dating service... but we barely get a glimpse of how it works, other than Mrs. Wilder making decisions based on whether or not Talia might be attracted to Connor and Theron and whether she'd be open-minded to a threesome.  I wanted to know more about this dating agency that's run out of the feisty old woman's home.There's an evil ex... but why exactly is he evil?  I'm not entirely sure.  We get a VERY short glimpse of him being a jerk to Talia, but there's never any real explanation about why they broke up, what took the ""blinders off of her eyes"" as to what he was really like, or how her family has shut her out since then.  She talks about it a lot, but we never really get to SEE it because even when she goes to her cousin's bridal shower and wedding, she has NO interaction with any of them whatsoever.  Not even them giving her dirty looks or speculative looks or even just straight out ignoring her...  We don't even really get to hear about Paul (the evil ex) interacting with her family.  Which is a big part of my basic problem with this novella, it was a lot of ""tell"" and not ""show,"" which made it feel very rushed because there's so much telling going on.Even the closure on the ex is kind of lackluster, because Granny just gets feisty with him and kicks him out... why hasn't she done this before if she loves Talia so much?  Why is this the first time that she's stood up for her granddaughter to her family?  And we also STILL don't get to see any of the family reaction.  No one says sorry or looks upset or defends Paul or looks guilty... it's just this blank silence on the family front.Despite this being a shifter novella, that doesn't really come up until the end of the book.  We HEAR about how the women of the Pack are going to be upset, and how they're petty and mean and the guys aren't interested in any of them.... but we don't see any of them until literally the last chapter.  There's not a lot of explanation beforehand about how Talia's supposed to prove herself, or even the fact that she IS going to turn into a werewolf (which I was a bit confused about, because Connor and Theron had been so concerned that she was human).  It seems like the challenge laws are set up so that any human turned werewolf is going to fail, but Talia turns so quickly that the Pack is impressed... at least I think that's why they all ended up caving in without any real expected trouble?  It was all a bit confusing to be honest, by the time it got to that point, because there'd been no chance to see the Pack dynamics at work before this very last, very rushed chapter.Overall... I enjoyed a lot about this novella.  Except for the fact that it was a novella, had enough story and characters to be a book, and so ended up feeling both rushed and unsatisfying.  It won't stop me from reading Milly Taiden, because I love her books, but I do wish that she'd either put more time or less story into this novella, and done a lot more showing instead of telling.  This was not one of my favorites of hers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL5M17XPLVJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU9YUTG#wasThisHelpful","R2BL5M17XPLVJ6","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book COULD have been5 Stars if the author hadn't gotten lazy at the very end and decided to go with a stupid romance trope instead of actually finishing out the emotional journey that the characters were on.It takes a lot of skill to write a sympathetic cheating character, but Immad was on his way to being one.  He was typically arrogant, just like an alpha ruler would be expected to be, and it was obvious from the conversations with his family and the people around him that none of them expected him to be faithful to Mersiha, even after their marriage.  But he still wanted to be, once they were married.  In such a culture, it's fairly understandable that he kept his mistress until he was formally engaged.  Mersiha's response is just as understandable and I was cheering for her all the way... I was even starting to cheer for him a little bit too until the author decided she was done having Immad actually trying to make up for his previous transgressions.Not only does he start treating Mersiha coldly again, because for some reason in his brain that's a better plan than continuing to shower her with his love and affection and proving to her that he's not going to change his mind about wanting to be with her and only her, but then instead of even continuing the play out that tangent and seeing where it takes the characters.... oh no! there's been an accident!  His life is in danger!  And of course the requisite vows of love come out.*gag*This book was headed towards something truly unique and fantastic and then the author just RUINED all of it.  It reeks of laziness, which was especially upsetting because the emotions and characters had been so well thought out and wonderfully rounded until then.  I was really enjoying watching a male alpha actually paying for his mistakes and doing his best to make up for them.  Then I realized how little book I had to go... and I was like oh no... please don't tell me she's going to... *(&*(^3@#$%@... she did it.Laziest and most overdone romance trope of all time to the rescue.  Except that this book didn't need that rescue, Immad was doing a fine job on his own if he'd just kept it up in the face of M's punishments.  Which made it all the more disappointing and unsatisfying to reach the end and the supposed HEA.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMUAYGX86SE78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GCPO7O2#wasThisHelpful","RMUAYGX86SE78","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always had an interest in WWII and especially the sociological and psychological implications of the horrors that were perpetrated and how it was made possible by the culture.  This book delves into the psychology of Goering, the highest ranking member of the Nazi party who was put on trial at Nuremburg, and focuses on the cross-examination.Ms. George does an excellent job of setting up a thorough background of Goering's life, the war, the prosecutors, and the events leading up to Nuremburg, without the book becoming bogged down in exposition.  It's easy to read and easy to understand, and, once the trial starts, every chapter has some explanation before the transcript of the cross-examination, which made it much easier for me to understand the context in which this cross-examination was happening.  The content is rather chilling, but it's also an important glimpse into the mind of one of Hitler's highest ranking men.  In the forward, the author says that she usually writes fiction, but she's done a fantastic job of the non-fiction genre and making it both understandable and interesting.  Transcripts by themselves can often be dry and tedious; set in this book, they're so much easier to read and comprehend.***Free copy of the book received in exchange for an honest review***","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S2OOSE22IU1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRJH7Q8#wasThisHelpful","R1S2OOSE22IU1A","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"omg this book just about gave me a heart attack.First of all, if you've been reading this series, you're already invested in the two main characters.  Chelsea, who is both broken and a big b!tch, and sooooo needs the support and happiness that her sister Charlotte found with Ian.  On the other side is Simon, who has been pretty hunky and appealing since the very first time he was introduced, and has only gotten even more mouth-watering with his patient stalking of Chelsea.  Learning more about Simon was possibly my favorite part of this book, because he's always been such a closed character.  With Chelsea, there was always more information about her because Charlotte knew her so well, although I learned quite a bit about her during this book also.  Seeing her finally become the strong, giving person that was always hiding behind her walls was such a treat.Although it was also super frustrating.  Simon had his work cut out for him with those walls, and just when he thinks he's gained ground... she's running again.  She's got some good reasons, but she also deserves the reaming out that she finally gets from Charlotte and goodness was it good to watch that go down!  Even better was her reaction afterwards, and then Ian's reaction to her reaction.  Man I love that big guy.  Simon had his own issues of course, and a background story that I would have NEVER guessed at.  We get to meet some of his cousins, who are a riot, as well as (eventually) his parents and brother.But that's not all!  We've got lots of danger as Chelsea is hunted by the Collective, lots of Jesse being an adorable ball of Crazytown murder (and I don't know why I find that so cute), and we've got TWO NEW TAGGERTS that Tennessee Smith has been keeping from Ian & Sean.  That's right, Big Tag and Little Tag have two little brothers that they never knew about and they're part of Ten's Agency team... let's just say, Ian does not take the news that Ten has been hiding family members from him so well and I cannot WAIT to see him throw up his big middle finger to Ten as he pulls his brothers into his family.  Because that's what Ian does, and that's what this entire book was about - family (both biological and the family of the McKay-Taggert team, because we all know that's what they are), second and third chances, and finding out what's worth dying for - and maybe even living for.Although, I have to say...

"If you've read the other Delroi Prophecy books, you were probably like me and wondering what the heck happened with Anna Leigh and Zora's brother, and you wanted more of a conclusion than what Book 3 provided.  This is where we get that.It's not as detailed a book as the first three in the Prophecy series, maybe because Ms. Hunt figured we already knew most of the details, but I do think that the book suffered a little because of that.  That's why I'm only giving four stars instead of five.  The plot felt rather rushed, as did the character development.  I still don't entirely understand what was going on with Xan's cousin and her mate.  It was confusing and it made me wonder if I needed to go back and re-read book 3 to remember what had happened there, which I didn't like.  Considering how involved Xan was with his family and that he was eventually wounded because of the situation, I felt like it should have been more fully explained in THIS book.  I also felt like more time could have been taken between Xan and Anna Leigh on the spaceship, so she could learn more about him and his family and culture... and I didn't like that the meeting between her and one of his old girlfriends was kind of made into a big deal, and then we never really got to see what her feelings about Lady R. were after the meeting.  Which... is kind of important since the three of them were all going to be in-laws.Overall, however, it did do what I wanted.  I learned more about Anna Leigh's perspective, I got to see her and Xan's relationship blossom - which was great because I really liked him in Book 3 and wanted to see how that all came about.  We get the final rescue of Zora's brother and the beginning of the next part of his story, as well as a glimpse as to what Ms. Hunt has planned for the future.  But I felt like it could have been a more fully fleshed out book, one that could stand on its own.

"The plot was interesting enough, but I couldn't finish the book because it felt like my head was going numb from all the terrible dialogue.  Seriously, NO ONE talks like that.  And the amount of exposition that was shoved into the dialogue... ugh.  So much talking, not enough action, and the talking was soooooo stilted.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I could barely get one fourth of the way through the book and I kept trying to push through, but by the time she and Matthews are telling each other more of the visions (rather than let us seeing what's going on), I was ready to bang my head against the wall.

"While the author had a fairly decent writing style (although is also in need of an editor), I just couldn't get fully involved in this story.  Thankfully I got it for free from Kindle Unlimited, because I don't think I would have wanted to pay for it.There was really good potential for this book.  There were a couple of mysteries going on - why did the Cruentas clan want to kill Gabby?  Who was killing off cubs?  But there were also just too many things that didn't add up, and the two main characters... well their relationship just didn't make sense to me at ALL.  It was basically based on nothing more than animal attraction.  They didn't seem to particularly like each other, they didn't have anything in common, and throughout the entire book, Zane is still hung up over his ex.  I mean, yeah, she cheated on him and left him for another dude... I get that it might be hard to see her for a while, but the way he's hung up on it isn't anger or anything like that, it's like he's still in love with her.  Even after he meets Gabby.  Even after he and Gabby start making out.  Even after he realizes he doesn't want Gabby choosing anyone else for a mate.  Nope, he still can't quite get over Alicia.  It's... not attractive.  On top of that, he's the worst Casanova ever.  His idea of wooing Gabby seems to be jumping her bones.  There were a lot of times that I found her personality to be somewhat unpleasant, but honestly I can't blame her for being a big B to him.  I'm just surprised she let him succeed as much as she did.Then the main plot... even though the whole mystery around cubs being killed is talked about throughout the book, it's wrapped up in a neat little bow that's not all that neat because we don't get to see ANY of the finding out whodunnit or the resolution to that.  Then the whole thing about why Gabby is so powerful and wanted... it drove me up the WALL that she has this awesome moment when her inner alpha power pushes back some of Zane's clan, which is how they know what she is, but it NEVER happens when she's upset and yelling at her attackers to leave her alone?  Seriously?  It happens ONCE and it's not even when she's in danger.  HELLO illogical plot device.There's a lot of potential in this book, but it could have been much better done if the story had been more fleshed out and the clans more fleshed out and everything better thought out.  I would have liked to see more of the suitors actually trying to woo her.  More relationship building between her and Zane (or you know, any at all that doesn't involve sexy time), which would have also helped with her final decision on who she wants to be a mate with.  Would have been nice to see her use her awesome powers when she's being attacked, make her a harder prospect to kill.  As it is, everything just feels rushed and open ended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307DQMIJWN2TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LYM5BBQ#wasThisHelpful","R307DQMIJWN2TN","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you've read the Cynster series and the Bastion Club series, then you'll remember him... and honestly, I wasn't sure that it was going to be possible to make him a redeemable character, but by the end of it I was proud of him.This book harkens back to the Cynster series in a lot of ways - not because it includes a lot of Cynster characters (other than the Adair characters of course), but in how it's written.  Rather than jumping right into the case, we get to see Thomas Glendower making himself into a new man and then taking his first steps back out into the world where he meets Rose.  The little hints and revelations that not all is right with his new housekeeper come slowly, and (as much as I tried) I couldn't figure out what they added up to.Unlike the other Casebooks, this one focuses more on the relationship between the lovers than on the mystery.  And Thomas and Rose are wonderful.  There's a lot less focus on the Adairs and Stokes, and more on Malcolm and Rose - and with several of the sumptuous love scenes that Ms. Laurens is well known for.  While Malcolm might not be a sexy alpha tyrant on level with Devil Cynster, it's still a pleasure to read about his and Rose's burgeoning relationship.The mystery itself was incredibly well handled.  I was kept guessing all throughout the book.  It was nice to have the characters sharing my confusion.I thought this was the perfect blend of the old books that I loved from the Cynster series and the new, exciting mysteries from the Casebooks.  Definitely recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OS1PJ59JQN3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFZMGR4#wasThisHelpful","R2OS1PJ59JQN3G","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Honestly this wasn't what I expected and I came away with fairly mixed feelings about it.On one hand... I really liked that it the ending wasn't at ALL what I expected (and I'm not going to give anything away about it except that).On the other hand... I felt like there was something missing between all three of the characters.  I think part of me had expected more punishment scenes between husband and wife - there were really only a couple - and the scenes between the wife and her lover weren't all that hot after the first one.  I also wish there had been more scenes of passion between the husband and wife, or at least some more scenes between them at all to help with the character / relationship development.It's not my favorite by Ms. Belford, but I did enjoy quite a bit of it... I just think it could have been a lot better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NY01ZEVDCY36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECKR1HY#wasThisHelpful","R3NY01ZEVDCY36","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ugh... this book is filled with Dominants who are just terrible.  Like... seriously.Emerald's protector and mentor, Daddy Drake, who has no interest in her sexually apparently decided that she's ""too much"" for any of the Doms at the club to handle her, and so he won't let any of them approach her for scening.  Not that he tells her this; nope, she just thinks that no one's interested in her at all and hasn't been for FOUR YEARS.  And somehow it's a shock to him that she's suffering from low-confidence and insecurity?  Seriously?  Then, he also loses his temper with her and uses humiliation as a punishment - even knowing that it's a hard limit for her.  I don't care what she did, he even admits later that he knows it's something he should have never done to her - not that he'll apologize for that until she apologizes for running off when he does it.  She's so freaking desperate to please and he uses that and manipulates her with it.Then, when she finally meets Sir Drool (who has been featuring in her dreams for years now, along with his dead wife who encourages Emerald to find him), he inserts himself into a scene with her, is angry at himself and treats her like crap at the end of it.  Then she starts avoiding callings from Daddy Drake - who gets super pissed without even considering where she is emotionally after that.  He was there for the smackdown, he SHOULD have done his duty as a Dom and done something to reassure and take care of her THEN, instead of just calling and accepting her excuses.  Nope, he gets all pissy about her reactions, so she has to apologize for that too eventually.  Sir Drool sends one of her friends who basically drags her back to the club where she spends the night in a locked room.  She does this for two nights in a row, pissed and tired of being treated like sh!t (which is completely reasonable) and then Ghost-Wife comes to her in another dream and helps her to realize that she needs to accept what the Doms are doing and act like a submissive.This is when Mika finally apologizes to her for being a jerk.What the heck happened to the communication between ANY of these characters?  The Doms make decisions that they don't have the right to, manipulate Emerald all over the place, make her apologize for things that she really shouldn't have to, and overall just keep pushing her into the shape of a doormat.I was not a fan.  I suggest Cherise Sinclair if you want to read a good BDSM romance with Doms that actually treat their submissives with respect and love, instead of just mouthing the words constantly while not backing it up with their actions.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0HRJNSVAO5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YLRG62#wasThisHelpful","R2E0HRJNSVAO5H","AH3W1BMSY9G07","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AH3W1BMSY9G07?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I LOVE Prisma colored pencils! I love colored pencils anyway, and these- with Crayola many years ago- are the only ones I've encountered that have not had SAND in them.About 15 years ago, I got a set of 120 Prisma colored pencils, and love it. But! I am currently getting into adult coloring as an alternative to meditation, and so when I saw THIRTY MORE COLORS!!!!- I was intrigued.What I like: the extra colors; the fact that the pencils are more-or-less sorted chromatically as packaged; having them come partially sharpened.What I dislike: my set of 120 had a tiered box in which all colors were visible all the time. This one with 150 colors has instead flimsy plastic trays that have an unfortunate tendency to explode one's pencils all over oneself; also, these trays are stacked on top of each other so one cannot see the full range of available colors.Still- great quality, and great colors!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37LJHBP4QGR39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005O2ZU68#wasThisHelpful","R37LJHBP4QGR39","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a good sequel to ""Unseen"", and developed both the world and Mac's character more.Unfortunately, the Big Bad seems to be Big and Bad without any specific agenda; while they are terrorists, they do not seem to have a goal besides being terrorists. Since no one is a villain in his/her own mind... they clearly ought to have some kind of goal besides ""power!""- but that isn't clear, and so the terrorist acts they commit do not make any particular sense as means to a goal.I do like the way Erickson handles the mind-reading, and the world in which it exists.However, in this sequel the characters were less important and well-drawn, and combined with a fairly basic plot it was not as enticing as the first book in the series.

"Gorgeous, fragrant, wonderful coconut oil! And at an attractive price, because this is a HUGE jar!I've been using it for several weeks now, mainly for cooking and cosmetic purposes. It's great! As winter approaches (it's November here in MA), my skin dries out, and not only does this oil absorb quickly, it smells lovely (though it does remind me of the Pina Colada song!).It's equally good for cooking, especially curries. If the dish has coconut milk, it reinforces the flavor; if not, it';s very subtle but does enrich the taste.I have not yet used it for cosmetics or soaps, but I think it has great promise for these as well.Highly recommended, if you like coconut oil and especially when you use it for multiple purposes!I got this in exchange for writing an honest review, but once I use this jar up I'll buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3YSY2J0XI6T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8HZS1W#wasThisHelpful","R3D3YSY2J0XI6T","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mind reading is tricky to handle in fiction- either the the mind-reader Knows All, or is a basket case because of too much input.Erickson handled this really well. She dealt with what it would actually mean to read minds, and how difficult that would be until and unless one develops ways to control it.And if there were mind readers, there would definitely be various schools of them, mostly at odds.I think this was more novella length than novel length, but it was a fast, suspenseful and engaging read, as Mac finds others who share her gifts, and learns the advantages and perils of having such a power.I received this for free from the author's website, and do recommend it to those who find this intriguing- it's well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FAFZUJBZVO0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P0B0ZPO#wasThisHelpful","R2FAFZUJBZVO0E","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the 1930s, in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, this story in Ted Korsmo's Wayzata can accurately be described as both hard-boiled and noir. Korsmo made considerable efforts to keep the locales and the language historically correct, as far as I could tell; having grown up in the area 60 years later, I enjoyed getting an idea of what various areas like North Oaks, Uptown and the titular Wayzata were like back then.Unfortunately, these were this book's strongest points.I like noir (though I prefer it with some black humor thrown in), and I enjoy following the twists and turns when everyone is gaming everyone else. For this to work, though, the plotting and characterizations both need to be very strong indeed ... and here neither were. Therefore the plot seemed utterly arbitrary, and character actions and interactions that drove the plot were baffling. It is not good when a sudden relation of, perhaps, a hitherto-unknown connection between major characters is met with ""Huh???"" rather than ""Man! I should have guessed!"" In such complex scenarios, some foreshadowing can be a big help in making a plot plausible.As can coherent, consistent characters. I expect Korsmo himself can picture them all with all their individual nuances, but he did not succeed in communicating such, even when situations were ripe to do so. Thus, everything anyone did felt arbitrary, and rather than continuing to reveal aspects of character, every surprising turn made me feel slapped by a dead fish.The language was also an issue. While I give Korsmo great credit for incorporating so much period slang and wordings into the text, he rather overdoes it, sometimes to the point of incomprehension. Call cigarettes ""nails"" if you will -- but please make the context clear the first couple of times you call them such, and do not substitute pretty much every other possible slang name and never, ever call them ""cigarettes""! I've read books written when this was set, and they used slang more judiciously.Most of the novel is first-person by our hard-boiled detective. He is not one for introspection, though, so we see pretty much nothing of his inner life. Maybe that's the point? He does seem to have an excessively fine opinion of himself, particularly his physical handsomeness, which he himself tells us all about. Neither he nor the author seem to notice his obsessiveness, or play at all with how a job to shadow someone is similar to stalking.In short -- while I like the idea, I do not think this novel has sufficient charms to make it worth reading despite its numerous flaws.I received this book in exchange for writing an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D54E72QOSC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500769029#wasThisHelpful","R1D54E72QOSC9","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an amazing novel, that combines wonderfully written personal relationships with historical fiction, a police procedural, and a serial killer...not to mention the ghosts!The plotting and the pace are perfect, and the historical aspects so evocative that I almost felt I lived in San Francisco a few  years after the earthquake...But the strongest aspect is the characters. Not only are the POV characters complex, sympathetic, and interesting, but so are all the other ones; they all come to life, even ones that are only briefly mentioned.I like that it did not have pat answers for things like- what sparked the serial killer's murderous rampages? and how, exactly, do the ghosts fit in? For both, there are suggestions made, but no definitive answers, and I think that's appropriate.While there is definitely some violence, most of it is in the background, and the overall feel is more creepy than anything else.Very much recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Q7IE9NQ5YXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765331853#wasThisHelpful","R5Q7IE9NQ5YXM","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The plot has it all: social media, WoW-style game, hacking, IPOs, murder, human trafficking... and that's perhaps rather more than the plot can handle comfortably. Any one or 2- or even 3- of these could fit together to make a very tight, exciting plot... but here, they distract from each other.I could see a solid plot involving social media, human trafficking, and an IPO. I could see one involving the online game, murder, and human trafficking. Or pretty much any combo of the above. But- when they are all thrown into the same jar, one does not get a smoothie as much as a mish-mash; as soon as the plot seems to be going in any one direction toward resolution... it changes course!The description of the antics behind an IPO were entertaining, and well-enough explained that I pretty much understood them. Some of the other technical parts, though, made utterly no sense to me, and seemed to be vital to the plotline(s).The characters were reasonably well-drawn, though the book brings in aspects of their lives that have no relevance to the plot, like the banker's daughter who is going to shoot a porn film.

"If you don't like farces, read no further. This is definitely a farce.While Curtright takes a light approach to everything, some scenes stand out. I utterly adored the 5th grade class who were all Objectivists (until it came time for trick-or-treating), and their Rand-worshipping teacher's description of a RATIONAL Halloween party. Also, the ""play"" of Pioneer Days-done instead of the possibly Satanic Halloween- was a hoot.It IS a farce, and no one really comes off well... but they are all entertaining. And meanwhile it skewers standardized testing as the ONE way to determine whether kids are learning anything; fertility clinics; Ayn Rand style Objectivism (especially as implemented by fifth-graders); and meddlesomeness in general.All the characters are more caricatures than real people- but that's part of the point, and they are amusing.If you like humorous ""cozy"" mysteries, you'll probably enjoy this, despite the sad lack of murders.I got this for free via Kindle First, and definitely enjoyed it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R54QCNEUMX9D7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOLHKHA#wasThisHelpful","R54QCNEUMX9D7","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pacing, the characters, the plots, the world- all worked together to make a seamless, compelling whole.Corene- an annoying character from the previous books- sets off for parts unknown (with her family's disapproval), and in so doing, learns a lot about herself and the world, and how she can interact with the world as it is.But that sounds all too educational! There is flirting! There are mysteries, including murder mysteries! There are even action-adventure sequences! There are satisfactory marriages arranged, based on the idiosyncratic needs and desires of various characters, and their countries!Also- great political intrigue, sometimes with unexpected results.Corene really came alive here, and the other characters as well.

An exception is the brewing recipes, which require equipment and knowledge of basic brewing of beer and/or mead... but which look very intriguing! Brewing supply vendors ought to be able to supply some of the less-common ingredients for some other recipes, too, like the dried elderflowers.All told, there are maybe 50 recipes here, and I am including the separate recipes for, say, piecrust and pie filling, dumplings to accompany the stew, etc. That's not a lot for a book that costs what this one does, but they are all enticing- and the book itself is lovely!The notes say the recipes are based on historical ones from the 1890s in rural England.Recommended for cooks who are LotR fans, or interested in fairly accessible historic recipes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKZUIXZK2M8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692472258#wasThisHelpful","R1NKZUIXZK2M8Z","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh in the series, which I am not reading in order. This series, though- while I'm sure it's richer if read in order!- does not really require that...although for this volume, some familiarity with the basic set-up is helpful.While I loved the atmosphere, and learning more about the ongoing characters, this was not as satisfactory as a mystery as the others I have read in this series. The overall plot seemed arbitrary, and Simon was utterly revolting; I expect he will feature in subsequent novels. Most of the characters we are following just get a brief look-in; I think that's a major part of what made it less satisfying for me.Still, the medieval atmosphere is skillfully drawn, and the details of medieval church drama were fascinating.Mildly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LUCIBUEMMP3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590587634#wasThisHelpful","R2LUCIBUEMMP3K","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the final book in the ""Finishing School"" series, and I recommend it highly- but only after you've read the first 3. I like this series better than Carriger's ""Parasol Protectorate"" series, to which this one is something of a prequel.I'm a sucker for boarding-school novels- SO different from my life! Plus, I read etiquette books for fun (though this is not required to enjoy this series!). The steampunk elements give it extra energy and fun.Ria is a solid character, that is her own person even as readers can identify with her. The other characters are also both coherent and surprising. The plot is complex, of course, albeit a bit silly... but that's in keeping with the overall light tone of the novels; it is hard to take seriously Evil Villains called the Picklemen, whose head is called ""the Chutney"".

"I love this series so much, I have to be careful in doling it out to myself! I want it to last!(My edition, bought 10-2015, is complete. If you get one that is missing pages, I'd suggest either returning it to Amazon or contacting Poisoned Pen Press directly.)This is an excellent mystery, piquing my interest in both the origins of jazz, the legal riskiness of homosexuality (male), and some of the effects of the Great War on the men that fought in it.As with the previous books, while some of the content is heavy, the books themselves have a verve that honors the heaviness but still has fun- much like Phryne herself.Phryne is superb, of course! And I love seeing and learning more about her various associates, all of whom are well-drawn and interesting people in their own right.The plots are nicely elaborate and convoluted, and resolve satisfactorily in ways i could not call- much- beforehand. Kudos! (Because I have been reading mysteries for at least 45 years, since childhood, and I really love ones that still surprise me.)Very recommended for fans of the series, in either TV or book form... but I'd start at the beginning. This may be one of the better stand-alines of the ones I've read, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCZRKNRI1TJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590584074#wasThisHelpful","R3CCZRKNRI1TJT","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These designs are fun and very Halloween-y... but are not nearly as complex as are in many of the other adult coloring books around.This is either a plus or a minus, depending on what you like!I prefer the crazy elaborate, intricate designs, but I know that's not to everyone's taste- and this book does give one more flexibility in doing shading and ombre, if one likes that.It also has fewer designs- around 33- since it's a slender book and the pages are printed on only 1 side. The one-sided printing might be really helpful for people who want to use markers and are concerned about bleed-though- I would suggest putting a layer of paper toweling or plastic under the page one is working on if using markers.Since the designs are less crazy-elaborate than many other books, it might be a good choice for teenagers- along with some GOOD colored pencils and a good sharpener.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3X17MQN0CLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941325424#wasThisHelpful","R1X3X17MQN0CLL","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story has a lot of promise, and the plotting helps.Synopsis: a rogue vampire is causing a lot of problems in Philadelphia, with both the established vamp brood, the Mob, and the law. What to do?I like the shifting alliances, and that all 3 main groups have both (semi)admirable characters and loathsome ones. The Mob contingent was especially effective this way.Unfortunately, none of the characters really came to life themselves; they had their basic character descriptions, and then reacted more according to the needs of the plot than with internal motivations. I think Alves tried to bring more life to them- certainly his Mob boss is somewhat more complex than is usual for criminal kingpins- as is his second-in-command, Sophie....And that brings me to the main women, who are 100% physically gorgeous. Some are smarter than others- a decent differentiation- but they all start out as 10+++ on the looks scale. AND, what's more- even the most capable and intelligent ones are 100% willing to throw things over for Their Man (or Vamp, as the case may be). The secondary women can be shrewish, but are generally also well-nigh-perfect physically. What- no old women? None who have put on weight from all that Italian cooking they're doing?Back to the men: I don't really see Enzo, the Mob boss, having a lot of patience with the mess his subordinates seem to make fairly regularly. He went into the Mob vs legit biz because he couldn't stand the rules... and yet, as the Mob boss, he has no choice but to put up with pretty sketchy ""soldiers"", which he can't even effectively fire. We see less of management challenges with the law, but similar seems to happen there.And the vamps? It simply does not make sense that Magnus, the Head Vamp, would put up with so much crap from the rogue, especially when the rogue is directly challenging his leadership. Family? OK, maybe, at first. But if Magnus was half as good a leader as he is described as being, he would not let the rogue be the reason that half or more of his brood died. Especially considering the challenging.So there's a lot of it that is not great. I'll also add the copy-editing, or the lack thereof; lines are ""toed"" not ""towed"", unless you are shipboard, for example, and that's only one of many- the funniest was when Alves clearly meant ""wine and dine"", but instead it was printed as ""whine and dine""- rather different!The language is often raw, but I'd expect that of gangsters. There is also much gore.In short: the premise and the shifting and morphing alliances are solid and fascinating. The characterization- especially combined with meeting the needs of the plot- and the writing, could both use work. It would help if behavior did not often seem so arbitrary.I received this book in exchange for writing an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SBW5BCL1OX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=151507014X#wasThisHelpful","R1SBW5BCL1OX8","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"OK, one can fairly easily cut corn off the cob with a knife...But this is so much easier and more efficient! Even when one does not use a drill in the corncob to expedite the process!Tonight our corn soup required removing the kernels from 6 ears of fresh corn. It took almost no time, and with a knife, would have been 5-10 min.The slicing round is adjustable, which means that each ear benefited from 2 passes... but since they took almost no time, that was cool.Very recommended for anyone who regularly removes corn from the cob!Edited to add: I note that many people have had problems with its sturdiness.

"This is an enticing cookbook, suitable for everyone, with enticing, mostly fast and easy recipes that are nonetheless frugal- mostly because they de-emphasize meat.While there are a few time-consuming recipes, most are not- and there are tons of ideas for altering and re-combining elements to make new dishes. It's really more about an approach to cooking than about recipes per se... though the recipes look delicious!The directions are also very clearly written, so this is suitable for people of all levels of skill in the kitchen, including beginners.A particular benefit of buying this book is that Brown has committed to giving away one copy to someone in need for every one sold.I am lucky that I personally do not have to adhere to a strict food budget (but I still want to cook lots of these recipes!). It's even more important for people who do have a strict and limited budget, since it's way too easy to fall into the routine and boring; I remember those times.Unfortunately, it does not address people who are stuck in a food desert, which is a huge problem.Very recommended, both as an accessible basic cookbook that will improve skills for the novice, and for enticing recipes that are very cost-effective.Edited to add: The PDF of it is available for free on the author's website!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MP2JKPX3ESKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761184996#wasThisHelpful","R3MP2JKPX3ESKT","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very silly story, and I mean that in the best way possible.Our main protagonist, Toby, is in the 8th or 9th grade, and acts like it- including various stupid chpoices, like stealing stuff from his parents to sell to buy a fancy gaming computer. This brings a second plot into action... but the first is the way a foreign national is subverting the Science Fair in order to bring down the United States, with the aid and assistance of ambitious and unethical parents and kids.Naturally, everyone believes the rich kids, including the Feds. So it is up to our middle-schoolers to save the day!Unlike some of Barry's adult novels, this has no inappropriate content in terms of sex or language, so is suitable for most middle-schoolers and up- though as an adult, I found it a very entertaining read.Characterization was good; ridiculousness abounds; the plot(s) is/are complex and a bit farce-like, and there's a real snarky shout-out to Home Shopping Network.Recommended if you like silly farces!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLRIO796PR7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001U3YE4Y#wasThisHelpful","R1SLRIO796PR7Y","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am apparently the odd one out, since I have not yet read ""Just City"" (it lurks in the depths of Mount TBR at the moment).Despite clearly missing all that background, though, this is an engaging and effective tale. There are enough references to important incidents in the first book that a savvy reader can catch  up on the gist, if not on the details.I have not read much of Plato's Republic, and am not exactly enthused about many of the aspects I have read. I particularly dislike and am suspicious of the caste system, as I am of the current caste system in the USA; I think it behooves governance to include the voices of all its citizens, not just the ""golds"".So- there are meaty philosophical issues raised here, and not answered directly- which is as it should be! This may be one of the most thoughtful ""utopias"" I've read; it's certainly the least didactic.The characters are engaging and complex, and interactions can get complicated- more like real life than they are in most novels.Which is not to say it lacks in action! It's got some tense action, as well as the thinkiness!

"A woman is haunted in both dreaming and waking life by someone who lived around 100 years previously. Hallucinations? Ghosts? Memories of a prior life?This is coupled with various more mundane problems, such as her miscarriages, her disinterest in her job, an annoying set of tics in her right hand that prevent her from creating art (though not, apparently, from doing other things that require facility) and feeling a rift between herself and her husband.The pacing did not work for me.We start out with Jane, a modern American woman, who is having dreams and visions of Elizabeth, a Victorian British woman, as well as her spastic hand, her sleepwalking and sleep-drawing, etc.At first, this novel focused on Jane and her problems. But the middle third or so was all about Elizabeth, which is also a reasonably interesting story, but the author abandons Jane for that time.After Elizabeth dies (not a spoiler, because no Victorian woman would have survived to now), we revert to Jane, who just so happens to meet a spiritualist hypnotherapist with whom she has amazing results immediately, including a lot of the cliched ""white light"" and ""There are NO coincidences!"" -- which, frankly, strikes me as terrifying. In short order her various problems are resolved; she understands that everything has worked out for the best; and most of her social and family circle turn out to be compadres in a spiritual group dedicated to evolving toward the Light over the centuries. The first part -- Jane haunted by visions -- made sense. As it progressed, though, the novel became less and less plausible for one who does not share the spiritualism that the author depicts.Although the narrative is grounded by a lot of physical details, they are often not explained, and the consequences are often not addressed. Anyway, miracles for me need to be plausible miracles. This narrative is too disjointed to provide that. I wish it had been better; the premise is sound and it starts out promising, but derails.I received this novel via Rambles.net in exchange for a fair and honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXWEAOI2JG90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991159780#wasThisHelpful","RHXWEAOI2JG90","A1F1XYMX769KWE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F1XYMX769KWE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review starts out similar to the Seidio Dilex case review.  Nice quality case. Kickstand stays closed when you're not using it. Soft touch material feels nicer than the smooth plastic of the Nexus 6. The kickstand could be a little more centered. What I mean is the kickstand is so far down on the phone that if you try to use the phone while it is in kickstand mode you can tip it over really easily especially when touching the phone on the end furthest from the kickstand. I don't care for my use but for someone who maybe touches their phone a lot while in kickstand mode this case might annoy you due to that. Had they put the kickstand slightly more toward the center of the phone it may have improved the stability. Having said that, my absolute favorite part of this case is that where the kickstand is located there is a hump that sticks out. It is virtually impossible to see in the terrible stock photos on Amazon. This hump allows the phone to rest flat on a desk or table as if the back of the phone is flat. Now I can text or use the phone one handed with it resting flat on a table and it doesn't spin and wobble all over the place. I have a feeling that is why the kickstand is located where it is. The case cutouts are where they need to be. The headphone cutout is kind of small so that might be an issue depending on the plug of your headphones. Two different USB cables worked fine without being blocked. There is a cutout for the buttons.  They are not covered like on the Dilex case.  Protection appears to be on par with other similar slim cases. There is a lip around the front of the phone so if you lay it on its face it will rest on the case. The case is ever so slightly thicker than something like a Ringke but virtually the same.  One nice thing if the two part design makes this case very easy to remove.  Slim cases can sometimes be a nightmare to remove if they are one piece but the two part case solves that.  It stays together great and you can hardly tell it is actually two pieces when it's on the phone.  It is a two piece case with a soft touch hard shell outside and a felt like inside. Overall a very nice case. I uploaded a few better pictures so you can more clearly see the case and in particular the kickstand hump and how it affects the phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDC4J1OR37PQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6TA9TY#wasThisHelpful","RDC4J1OR37PQU","A9B0AGEKRKTQB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9B0AGEKRKTQB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As far as printing it seems to be fine.  Not as crisp or clear typed print as my laser printer but I guess that is to be expected.  It also takes a very long time (a couple minutes) to warm up if it hasn't been used in awhile.The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because I bought it specifically because it is Google Cloud enabled.  The only reason I bought this printer is to print from my phone.  However, if a few days have passed since I printed last it always is listed offline when I want to print something which means I have to go physically it up before the Google Cloud servers will communicate. This is extremely annoying if I want to print something while I am laying on my couch several rooms away or if I want to print something from my phone while I am out of the house.  There are no Firmware updates on Canon's site either and I bought the printer 5 months ago which means I doubt it will ever be fixed.Overall I am disappointed and wouldn't buy another Canon printer.

I went to several different stores and had to look at about 5 of this model watch to find one that had the second hand mostly lined up with the marks,  The worst watch had a second hand that was basically in between each second mark.  The manufacturing tolerances must be pretty loose so it might take a few tries to get one with a second hand that lines up properly.  It is to be excepted with a watch in this price range.

The 17mm end is the size needed for the front strut mount nut on a Mazda 3. The offset head allows the use of the Allen wrench to keep the strut from spinning while removing the nut. For $5 you can't go wrong and it makes removal so much easier than hacking together a solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZPJE23A3CSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00857SKZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3GZPJE23A3CSG","A9B0AGEKRKTQB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9B0AGEKRKTQB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Spigen Slim Armor case (Since Amazon decided to combine all the Spigen cases for the Nexus 6 for some reason)The case arrived undamaged.  It fits my Nexus 6 perfectly.  There is no wiggle room or squish at all with the case.  It is easy to put on and take off if you tend to go without a case often or want to remove it to clean any dust off. The cutouts are all in the proper location and appear to be precisely cut.  The lip comes up around the edge of the phone enough that you could lay the phone down flat on its face and only the case will touch the surface you place it on.The hard plastic material is about as smooth/slippery as the back cover of the phone.  The thickness makes the phone much easier to hold so I don't feel like I am about to drop it like when the phone is not in a case.  I would say the case is slightly thinner than my wife's Otterbox Commuter she uses with her Galaxy Note 4 if you have ever used an Otterbox commuter before.Once the case is actually on the phone the kickstand works fine and doesn't fall out at all.  It isn't super strong and is made of plastic which makes it feel pretty cheap but it works as a stand just fine and when you are finished it snaps into the body of the case so it will not be flopping all over the place when not in use.  I think a majority of the negative reviews of the kickstand are people who did not have the phone yet.  When the case is not on the phone the kickstand will fall out since it is sandwiched between the two pieces.  With the phone inside the case the kickstand is sturdy and will not fall out.Surprisingly the buttons are just as responsive as without the case.  You can still feel a satifying click when you use the power/volume buttons.  The buttons do not stick out though so it is kind of hard to know where the buttons are quickly.  I would imagine with a little use you will get used to the location.My only real complaint is that I wish there was not a cutout for the Motorola logo.  I am not sure why they felt the need for the logo cutout.Overall I think this is a solid case and worth the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0NGKT7OEB1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OH4I2IC#wasThisHelpful","R2E0NGKT7OEB1K","A9B0AGEKRKTQB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9B0AGEKRKTQB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good quality hose.  Home Depot of all places did not even have a spot for a 1-1/2 discharge hose.  They only had 1-1/4 with a 1-1/2 reducer.I think some people are confused by what this is for.  This is not supposed to be for connecting directly to your sump pump and out your home regardless of how it is advertised.  You should use PVC for that purpose.  This hose is the hose you connect to the PVC on the outside of your house.  This hose carries the water away from the foundation of your home.  Because the fittings are all standard you technically could screw this directly into your sump pump, which I see some people are doing, but it isn't really designed for that and you're asking for trouble if it cracks or breaks.  You should really use PVC for inside your home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXOGZ5ZV236Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EI5IB4#wasThisHelpful","R1SXOGZ5ZV236Y","A9B0AGEKRKTQB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9B0AGEKRKTQB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This hat is of great quality.  I have a large head and it fits me well.  If you have a small to medium head it is going to be too big. Yes, the back is adjustable but what I mean is it would be too deep.  If I pull the hat down on my head so it is comfortable the bottom edge is just touching the ""valley"" of my ear.  If I pull the hat down hard on my head it would make my ears stick out.  I get the feeling a lot of these hats run pretty small but this one does not.

"The buttons and dpad feel great.  I would say the buttons are console quality  (10 out of 10) and the dpad is very, very close to console quality (9 out of 10).  The dpad very close to being as good as a Nintendo dpad.  I think it has ever so slightly more travel than I am used to but it is very, very minor.  If you gave this controller to someone who doesn't do a lot of gaming they would say the dpad and buttons feel as good as the dpad and buttons on any Nintendo controller and that is saying a lot.  The feedback of each button is very satisfying.  They aren't clicky buttons (like an xperia play or psp go) but rather have the same membrane feel as a Playstation or Super Nintendo controller.On my Android phone (Nexus 5 and 2013 Nexus 7) and tablet setup is a breeze. All you do is.Turn on bluetoothTurn on the controllerTap to pair the controllerEasy as that.  Then in any game, emulator or app you use you can customize the buttons how you would like. Because the Steel Series Free only has 8 buttons plus a dpad (not counting analog sticks) all of the button work without the need of any special drivers which is really nice.I cannot comment on the analog sticks as I don't use them much.  I have used the left one a single time in a DS emulator but I think it was mostly just mimicking the dpad.  It felt really nice but it wasn't acting as a true analog stick.  I believe to make it act like a true analog the controller would have to be officially supported in whichever app you are using.  If it isn't officially supported it will act just like a dpad where it's either all or nothing.Size... What can I say?  It is the smallest controller I have ever used.  It is slightly larger than the Gameboy Micro I used to own.  I am 6'4"" tall (or 193 centimeters for you metric people) and I have pretty large hands.  This controller is very comfortable.  The shoulder buttons are designed so that you have your index fingers almost touching in the middle and you press down on them right near the middle of the controller.  If feels natural and good.  Had the shoulder buttons been placed at the outer edge of the controller I think it would cause cramping.  Because the controller is so small you tend to hold it with your fingers rather than palming it like an Xbox controller.Overall I am quite happy.  I paid $49.99 (half a benjamin) on Amazon for it.  I am not sure it would be worth more than that.  I wouldn't have bought it had it been more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LR9VUTY4N04V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AOFNU4#wasThisHelpful","R2LR9VUTY4N04V","A9B0AGEKRKTQB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9B0AGEKRKTQB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These gloves are ok for the price.  The thumb section is my main complaint.  It is slightly small.  When I put the gloves on they fit perfectly on all portions except the thumb is tight.  Also, the way the thumb material is cut means the seam of the thumb rests basically right where the pad of my thumb is which is kind of annoying.  The seams should run alongside the thumb.  It is like the thumb material needs to be twisted so that the seams are on the sides of my thumb.Overall, I will wear them this season and probably find a pair locally next year.  They are average.

"I bought this watch band to replace the one that came on my Pebble.The leather is stiff but soft.  I expect it to loosen up over time as I wear it.  It seems to be constructed well.  I do worry that there seems to be no stitching holding anything together, especially around the pins but I wanted a leather band that looks as close to the original Pebble band as possible which means no stitching.  This band seems to be held together with glue only.  Time will tell how it holds up.The fit at the pins on my Pebble is perfect, not too tight and no extra play at all where it is fastened to the watch.The reason I deducted one star is because it isn't what I would consider ""Extra Long"".  The Pebble comes with I believe a fairly standard length band.  It is hard to know where to measure from but if you go end to end it is 8 3/8 inches or about 213 mm and this ""Extra Long"" band is 8 1/2 inches or 215mm.  Due to the location of the holes on each band the new band has essentially 10mm or 3/8 inch more useable length to it.  I would consider this barely meeting a ""Long"" but certainly not ""Extra Long"".  Another reviewer basically said it right when he said you get about one extra hole out of the band.  I wish it was a good half inch longer but it should work.  (Maybe If i lost a few pounds I wouldn't need a longer band).  It is possible over time that the leather will stretch a little and maybe give another few mm but time will tell.It would help if these companies would put the length in the listing...I included a few pictures comparing it to the watch band that comes with the Pebble.  Overall I would say it looks great.  I wanted something that looked stock but had the comfort of leather and this pretty much fits the bill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E08G5VXWLB0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008SBJ0CW#wasThisHelpful","R1E08G5VXWLB0C","A9B0AGEKRKTQB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9B0AGEKRKTQB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The microfibre cleaning cloths feel the same as those you would receive with a pair of glasses at an eye clinic.  They are a little larger though.  I use them for a tablet, smartphone and a couple handheld video game systems and they work great.  They typically clean the screens without needing any cleaning solution at all.  Just wipe and go.

"If you're wondering what all the coconut oil hype is about recently, but you bought some and got a greasy lumpy glob of white smelly stuff, then you bought the wrong stuff. Fractionated coconut oil gives you all the benefits of coconut oil, but with a silky, smooth, liquidy non-greasy-ness. It's not that there's anything wrong with the other coconut oil, but if you don't keep it warmer, it does become more solid. This stuff won't go solid unless you put it in the fridge, and even then, it mostly just gets cloudy.The bottle is a good shape and size for using, but what surprised me is that it came with your choice of a pour spout top or a plunger top with a dispenser. I can see ways I'd use this both ways, so it's nice to have the choice.This is a perfect oil for mixing with essential oils as a carrier oil, but it can be used all by itself for all the health benefits of coconut oil. Whether you're using it cosmetically on your face or as a skin conditioner or in your hair for helping to keep it silky and smooth and stopping frizzies. And this one can also be used for oil pulling.However, I would not recommend ingesting this oil. I can't tell what grade it is from looking. I'm going to assume it would be safe, but I think you're better going with the food-grade product for ingestion. This is a topical product.It has a very light scent, but it won't interfere with your oil scents or your perfume. Just a fantastic fractionated coconut oil. I'm really glad I was able to get one in exchange for a review. I'm a big coconut oil nut, so I love trying new brands and finding the best quality products!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FZ1STTK0NRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8CQK90#wasThisHelpful","R39FZ1STTK0NRC","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a touching, moving and emotional book, sentimental and memoir-ish in style. It's not a book that will keep you turning pages on the edge of your seat, but more one you will curl up with under the covers and take the journey with Chirp, our lead character, while she learns to navigate growing up and dealing with the struggles life brings.Chirp has a mother, father and older sister. We learn early on in the book that her mother is sick and her mother isn't handling her illness well. Set in the early 1970s, a poignant time for me, since that's the era I was born in and grew up in, it's interesting to see how society is so different then compared with now in dealing with things like illness and in particular, mental illness.Chirp then has to deal with one of the worst things that can happen to can happen to a child growing up, and the events of her decisions cause her to have to learn how to grow up a little faster too.I absolutely loved the character development in this book. Chirp, of course, is the character we get to know the best, since the story is told in first-person from her point of view. But her best friend, a young boy her same age in her class in school, is a great character with strong development, showing some early signs of OCD and hints at the possible causes for that anxiety in him.If there were one negative thing about the story, it's that we never do know for certain what happens to her friend when he goes home at the very end. Other than that, the story and the ending is satisfying and is quite well written.Though the main character is a child, the story isn't necessarily for young children, and I think anyone from tween to teen to young adult would enjoy it, and here I am in my forties and I really was able to delve deep into the universe the author wrote too.It's a good book, a solid book, with consistent and good writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK421E4GOIFNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1IQV64#wasThisHelpful","RK421E4GOIFNE","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited when I was asked to give an honest review of this item in exchange for a free product, because I love humidifiers and had been specifically looking for a cool mist one for a some time. I also had hoped I could use this for diffusing essential oils.Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it didn't work. When I plugged it in, all the lights flashed and then kept flashing. None of the buttons worked on the front panel. The lights just kept flashing and not doing anything else. We unplugged it, plugged it in again, same thing. We tried pressing the buttons harder, wiggling them around, everything, and nothing changed.I followed the poorly written instructions exactly and still nothing.So I contacted the seller. In response, they told me to read the instructions. I informed them I had, and told them exactly what had happened and how the lights were flashing. They informed me, in broken written English, that maybe something was wrong. You think? They then informed me that perhaps the unit was defective, said it happens sometimes, that they were sorry, and they'd keep me in mind for future items to review.Well, I can't very well give a good review to an item that is defective, and my integrity says I have to honestly review it. So since the item simply doesn't work and the sellers don't want to send me another replacement item, I can't honestly give it anything more then a 1-star, because it was defective.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M4EQKNF6YGQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3KIHKY#wasThisHelpful","R2M4EQKNF6YGQ1","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I got this kite for free in exchange for an honest review, and I was so excited when it was offered to me, because it's been years since I've flown a kite! So I immediately decided we would take it out to the beach on a sunny day and pretend to be kids again!This kite if very pretty. It's also huge! Well, good sized, anyway. The vinyl it's made with is sturdy. The kite wire for flying it is stronger and better than just kite string, it's got a metal-like strength to it. It comes with a nice hand grip that it wraps around and then tucks into it to close it and keep it from unwinding.The metal rods (aluminum) are lightweight but sturdy. They pop in and out easily for assembling the kite, and then when the kite is disassembled, it folds up easily and neat into a case that's provided to protect and easily carry it.This is a super nice kite. So much nicer than the ones I used to fly as a kid. I'm so grateful to have been asked to review it, because it was a fun day out on the beach with my grown kids, us all acting like we were kids again, like when they were little. I hope we can go out again and do it more than once. We'll take a picnic basket and go out and spend an afternoon flying kites.It was great re-living a childhood memory. I wish more parents would consider creating memories like this with their kids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R234B7YFRRU7BH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTACALE#wasThisHelpful","R234B7YFRRU7BH","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful light and looks really pretty hanging in my tree. I intend to buy several more so I can hang them scattered throughout my pear tree. The light isn't very bright, so it doesn't do well if you have a well-lit area, but once it gets dark enough, the light is just perfectly lit. It changes colors automatically and slowly goes through all the colors.I've had it out on the tree for over a month now and it's held up well to heat (over 100 here in the Gulf Coast) and rain and thunderstorms, and it's still just as beautiful as when I first put it out there. The rechargeable solar batteries seem to be working well too.I received one of these for free in exchange for an honest review, and I liked it so much I bought a second right away, and now I intend to get about three more for my pear tree to hang by the pool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYO1VTSHLMSKJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBSC3J0#wasThisHelpful","RYO1VTSHLMSKJ","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pants are fantastic. They're very slimming. They run just a little large. They are snug but not binding. I like the way the seams work, because that's part of what makes them so slimming.If you remember stirrup pants from the late 80s, these pants look and wear similarly to those, but without the stirrups. They have a good length. I'm very tall, and these are a little short on me but not bad.The one thing I don't care for though are the zippers on the sides. They are a little uncomfortable and they have a bulky look that shows through a shirt worn not tucked in. I sort of wish they didn't have the zippers.But all the rest about these pants I really like.

"This is a fantastic bag. If I have any complaints, it would be two minor ones: 1) it's super heavy, weighs a ton! and 2) the zipper has a tendency to come open on its own with tugged or pulled, causing it to open on its own sometimes when you toss it around.The bag has short handles and a long strap and you can use it either way. It's great like a messenger bag to toss over your shoulder or you can carry it like a satchel. It's big enough with a firm bottom to carry some books but flexible enough to be a nice throw and toss bag. It is big enough to use as an overnight bag and you can carry a bunch of stuff in it.The canvas sides are sturdy and firm, strong and not prone to tearing.The bottom of the bag has an insert that keeps it flat and makes it easier to grab and go and helps keep the things inside a little more organized. there are internal and external pockets with zippers that are secure for cellphone and other small things.It's an attractive bag. Definitely worth considering adding to your wardrobe. I'm certainly glad I received one to review!

"A small but sturdy plastic waterproof pouch bag. It says a waist strap and I guess you can use it as one, but it's not very large or long, so you'd have to be smaller to use it that way. For me, I just grab it and carry it. But it's perfect for when you go out on the pier. My mother has a boat at the marina, and this bag is a great option for storing a cellphone to keep it from getting wet if you happen to slip or drop the bag. It floats too. I actually tested that in our pool and I tested it's waterproof effectiveness. I figured it's always better to test it at home and have it fail before you need it to protect your phone and items. It's small enough that it's not hard to carry but large enough it can hold a phone, some money, a small wallet or a few other items. It would probably hold a medium-sized brush too, some makeup or lipstick for while out and around.It's not the most attractive bag, but after I received a reduced price item in exchange for testing and reviewing it, I did test it to make sure it works. I completely submersed it in the swimming pool and swished it around, and it didn't leak at all. Then, when I let go of it, it floated right back up to the top, and that was with a brush and a pack of cards in it, so it wasn't completely light. If your bag were to fall into water briefly, it would definitely keep your items completely dry. It works great, seals completely. The fact it's not that attractive is what gets one star knocked off. The fact it works and protects items from water well gives it the four stars.I would still test yours by putting it underwater and checking for leaks before you put anything of value in it and use it and expect it to work. Great for waterparks and vacations at the lake or beach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LW5JUSP83LXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXLHYXE#wasThisHelpful","R1LW5JUSP83LXZ","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you're wanting to see if you could pass a drug test after using or if you want to check up on your kids or spouse or someone in a drug program, this is a cost-effective tool you can get without involving doctors or clinics or law enforcement in the process. I had a family member who once was separated from her spouse and she would only let him come back home if he agreed to take a weekly drug test to prove he was staying clean. This would have been an inexpensive and accurate way to show that. Though I have to say, if it's come to that point... but I'm digressing.Back to the review. Each test comes in its own sealed foil packet and is super easy to use. Reading it is a bit more difficult, but once you know what to look for, it's easy to understand. The results are quick and sanitary too. You don't have to handle any urine to read the results of someone else's test if they use the sticks.So I tried the test and it was negative. A friend of mine who uses THC pills and it was also negative. A friend who smokes regularly tried and it was positive. So I don't know what the difference is between the pills and the smoke, but there you have it.I don't know how accurate they are, but if you are looking to test before having to test for work or something, I'd say it's probably close enough to help you out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBACKCZW5WG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UYFAKYW#wasThisHelpful","R2QBACKCZW5WG4","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an inexpensive but flashy-looking wireless mouse. It's plug and play so it's super easy to set up and use. The plastic is a bit cheap, but if you take care of things, it would last fine. If you travel a lot or move around a lot with your mouse, it might not hold up well though because it's not super sturdy. For me, for my son, he has paired the mouse to his laptop and likes it. He loved the bright yellow colors.It has a good feel in your hand, and the flywheel is nice for scrolling. It comes with a couple of batteries to start. The only real downside is that it's not a true bluetooth, so you have to have the receiver in a USB port. We were hoping my son could use it on his Kindle if it connected via Bluetooth, but it doesn't, and it will require one USB port open to use it. Other than that, it's a sweet little inexpensive mouse that's perfect for travel or if you have someone who is hard on equipment and you want something that doesn't cost a lot of money in case it gets broken, so you don't mind replacing it. It works great for ordinary computer use.Don't even consider it for gaming or anything where you need a super-fast response time though. It's one of those you get what you pay for types of things. It's great for a cheap, useable mouse for ordinary stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MUXIW7AW4D2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OROC04Y#wasThisHelpful","R2MUXIW7AW4D2O","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As long as the water doesn't get too hot, this is a really good matcha tea. IF the water gets too hot, you're going to have a bitter tea. The temperature is really important. Also, it takes VERY VERY little of this tea to make a good cup. If you're used to using weak tea bags and such, you're going to be surprised by how little it takes. We use just a tiny tip of a regular spoon full of it. It's not much and if you use too much, you get that bitterness too.Goes absolutely great with organic honey and lemon, or just drink it by itself. I like it with a little stevia when I'm wanting it sweetened too. I use an electric kettle that heats the water to the desired temperature and it's perfect.This tea has a great powder to it--it's very fine. It does leave a slight silt at the bottom of the cup--I've been told (not sure if it's true or not) that this is a good thing. The color is a good, solid and bright green. The resealable bag that is metal lined is a nice touch. A bag of this is going to last for a very, very long time if you're a casual drinker.We also used this for cooking--we made green tea muffins with it and the color turned out really nice--the flavor was good, and the green coloring showed through nicely over the browning.Would definitely buy again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4OQAWHUMRT60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDT116M#wasThisHelpful","R4OQAWHUMRT60","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We played with it in two different vehicles. First, it's not a very sturdy looking unit. It feels lightweight and cheap when you get it out of the box. Second, we tried and tried and never could get it to set off. It never blipped at anything, no matter where we drove. But then we drove my a Kroger grocery store, and it blipped every time we drove by the front door.

"My doc recommend I take a probiotic once daily, to help with regularity and because I take a lot of antibiotics too. The probiotic helps to replace some of what the antibiotics take from my body. I will admit that I feel better when I take the pills. They stink LOL but smell isn't important. These are easy enough to swallow because they are gel caps not huge horse pills that are rough or crumbly like a lot of probiotics are. I'm not sure why most probiotics are like that, but all the ones I've ever taken were. So I was really surprised to see the gel caps--but also VERY happy about it. I have trouble with swallowing pills, so this really helped me.I don't notice a huge difference when I'm taking thee pills, because I was already taking probiotics regularly. But when I missed two days, I certainly notices more gas and stomach upset. So I'm convinced these probiotics are doing their job. I'm not going to stop taking probiotics!Because I was given a complementary bottle to provide an honest review, I didn't know what I was getting when it arrived. Discovering the gel caps made me quite happy and I will now be purchasing these for myself regularly. It makes it easier to put them in my pill minder (the other pills start 'activating' or change color and crumble), and they are easier to swallow.

"I had to play with them a little to figure out the best way to use them. The first batch of muffins I made using these didn't turn out well--well, they did, they were great, but half of them stayed in the cup. I thought the point was to be able to bake with them without them sticking and not needing to use oil.So I tried the next time, and did a little research online, and I learned there's a trick to it. First, you have to wait until the cupcakes or muffins have completely cooled. If they are still warm, they will stick a little and that's where I went wrong the first time. So once I let the cool completely, out of the metal pan, just sitting on the counter, I was able to come and take them out by literally flipping them inside out. It's a trick, but once you figure it out, it works perfectly every time. You hold it upside down, grab the sides with your fingers, and then push the bottom with your thumb. In one swift movement, push with your thumb while you pull back with your fingers, and the cupcake/muffin just 'pops' right out. It worked beautifully for me every time.Another trick I heard was to dust with a tiny bit of fine flour or superfine sugar before putting the batter in--but I'm not sure that would help much in this case. But I did read it.I received these complementary in exchange for using them and providing an honest review. My honest review is, I bought two more sets of these shortly after I learned how to use them. I love to make breakfast muffins and then freeze them for the kids to reheat so they can eat 'good food' without having to cook, so I'm always using muffin cups to do that. This will save all the waste.

"These are cute and they're fun, but they are better used for things other than making ice. With ice, you can't really see the design or the fact they are lego or anything else. But with playdough, clay, baking, jello (jello was fun!) had a lot of fun making designs with them. Jello was fun because we tried to connect them to each other and build things--didn't work, but we laughed a lot while we were doing it.So you can get them for ice if you want, but I don't really recommend it.

"I really, really was excited when I got these to review. I wanted to like them so much. And I sort of did. They were fun to play with. The problem is, without any instruction, filling without getting water all over the place while we figured it out wasn't much fun. My son and I finally put it together and used a little funnel, but even then, I ended up with some balls of ice not being completely round, a couple having little 'plugs' where they were overfilled and then the water also leaked between the two silicone plates, causing lines and losing some volume on some of the spheres.So for kids to play with for fun with their drinks or something, this might be fun, but for making fancy ice for a party or adult cocktails, I fear it will probably provide more frustration than it will pretty ice balls.Still, my son and I did have a lot of fun playing with them, and then later, we realized since they were silicone, we can actually use them in the oven--seriously.

"It works good in that it makes large cubes of ice. the problem I have with it is two-fold: 1) it's difficult when full to handle to move from the place you fill it into the freezer, because it's flexible and wiggly. There's nothing firm in the center like on some other trays I've used to keep it from bending and wiggling so much when filled and 2) there's  no 'lip' in the center part where you fill it, to fill the cubes up to--no fill line, or 'platform' or whatever it's called, so that the only way to get the cubes all the same size and the same height is to fill it all the way to the top so it is flat, or measure by eye or amount to make sure you put the same amount in each. It would be so much easier if it just had a fill line platform with a lip on it so as you're moving it around to put in the freezer, it doesn't spill.Other than that, it's a great product. It will make nice, large sized cubes and because of the material, they come out of the tray very easily.

"I absolutely love the smell of this lotion. But I'll warn you--I think it smells masculine. It reminds me of my husband's aftershave, and that's really part of what I love about it. But it's also fresh with a light tingle to it and it feels cool when it's put on. I use it with the sugar scrub and a body wash in the same scents. The bathroom smells amazing after a shower with the sugar scrub and body wash, then this to seal the moisture in. It's also very good at opening the nasal passages and helping with breathing--mixed with the warm water and humidity, it's a great lotion/body wash combo for using when feeling a little stuffed up or under the weather.The only reason it doesn't get five full stars is because it's got just a little bit of a 'sticky' after film that it leaves.

I don't mind it too much on my body and arms and such, but on my hands, it feels a little sticky so I end up having to wash them after I apply the lotion instead of just rubbing them together and rubbing it in.Other than that, I really can't complain. I also like the lotion bottle. It's glass, and it's recyclable. I worry about breaking it on my tile floor sometimes, but that's my issue. I like the dark green glass--and that I can recycle it--and I have reused the bottle for making other things with my essential oils too, because it's such a nice glass (darkened) bottle.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EDZRRGJ2ZZ71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NSDFH8#wasThisHelpful","R3EDZRRGJ2ZZ71","A214DG8Y09M3W9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A214DG8Y09M3W9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love flowers and floral stamps have become one of my favorites to add to my ever growing collection. Stampendous has some very beautiful floral stamps and I am hoping to get the other floral bouquet sets that Stampendous has. They make very beautiful notecards, greeting cards, mixed media, art journal, or even just framed art pieces. I highly recommend this set along with some Prismacolor pencils, Promarkers, or Watercolor set to color in these images.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A6GB703HZ341/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V51UFGC#wasThisHelpful","R3A6GB703HZ341","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has to be one of my favorite stamp sets in my collection. No matter where you stamp this it always comes out beautifully. It really pops when you stamp on craft paper cardstock *brown paper bag colored* and then color in with Prismacolor colored pencils. As with the previous reviewer the center part of the stamp is tricky to get to stamp down but a few tricks around that is stamp on top of a sheet of fun foam and another is to lay down your stamp block and place the paper on top and gently rub around the stamp image to transfer over the ink. I suggest Memento Tuxedo ink.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US81O0H4FKF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M6ZVNY#wasThisHelpful","R1US81O0H4FKF3","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My main reason for buying this Boogie board is to save paper when I do random doodling or drawing when bored. For me ... I call my Boogie Board the Bored Board. I am a bit sad that I cannot save or upload what I had randomly drawn but nothing a snapshot from my smart phone - uploaded to my Instagram can't fix. As an Artist my favorite part about the Boogie Board is that you can get different textured patterns using different soft objects. Just rubbing your finger lightly across the screen gives you a very pixie dust look trail of dots in different sizes, using an LCD cleaning soft cloth gives you bubbles that look like a aquarium, and best of all I love that you can make thick or thin lines depending on the pressure. For those of you who are grumbling over the screen not having a backlight so making the board somewhat useless in dark or low-lit areas ... buy a clip on book light and that'll solve your problem easy peasy !! I have a very bright LED book light that runs on AAA batteries and easily clips to the top of my Boogie Board. I love how some people ask me if that's a *new* iPad or Tablet and they've never seen it before. I just think it's a great thing to have when you just wanna take quick notes or jot down a memo or just wanna doodle while in line at the DMV. It's a great device and I'm so glad they made it so you can replace the battery. Highly recommend it !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39G0HRYFZ3F77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5Q25F4#wasThisHelpful","R39G0HRYFZ3F77","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this product for mainly for my oldest dog whom is 9 yrs. old. His teeth are getting old to the point where he has difficulty chewing hard things even dry kibble. I noticed that he was starting to get very foul doggie breath and requiring his brushing to be more frequent. I got this product hoping it'll help him a bit with freshening his breath and keeping his teeth clean. I felt it wouldn't hurt for my youngest dog who's 3 yrs. old to be benefiting from this as well. All I can say is it clearly works as his stinky dog breath is gone and he's even up for eating some crunchy treats like milk-bones which before he just purely avoided.

"Maybe the previous reviewer had their standards set to high but I love this pen. I actually bought a 2nd one after I bought the first one because I lost the other nib. So when I purchased a 2nd one I put the nib that I lost on. So now I have two(2) separate pens with different nibs. I started my passion for calligraphy with this pen as a beginner and it's perfect for a beginner to learn with. Get yourself this pen set, a good calligraphy font book or google online for some, and some paper to practice and you're good to go. I think this pen set if pretty decent quality and yes the gold ring  does come off whenever you unscrew it to change ink barrels and you can easily look the gold ring like I did on my 1st one but it does not hinder the use of this pen at all just a fancy accessory piece.

"I am a HUGE Iced tea lover and will easily pass up soda at the fast food beverage stations if they got Unsweetened Iced tea. I always wished I could just have a pitcher of it at home but I know in order to do that I'd have to boil lots of water, steep the teabags, transfer it into a pitcher, put it in the fridge to chill or add ice before I can enjoy my iced tea. I've tried many of the Lipton powdered tea mixes and they foam up like soapy water which made me uncomfortable to drink it and they tasted horrible !! Summer is usually the time I consume the most amount of iced tea as it's a great way to stay hydrated than drinking pop. So I usually bought a large from a fast food place but once it ran out I was back to wishing I had a endless pitcher of it. I learned about this Liptop Cold-Brew and hesitated to purchase it until my lust for an ice cold tea that tastes like the kinda you'd get from McDonald's got me to buy and try it. IT'S AWESOME !! At first I wished they had single serving sizes and not just for pitchers but I put a teabag in a 16oz glass and let it brew thinking it's gonna come out too strong and bitter since it's made for pitchers but actually it was perfect !! Previously for my instant iced tea fix I was using Mugicha which is a Japanese roasted Barley tea that is generally drank in the Summer months in Japan. It has a distinct nutty flavor of barley but it still wasn't that iced tea taste I was looking for. Cold-Brew definitely is that and I will be buying this often and always keeping a pitcher of it in my fridge. I'm happy that I can finally create my own unsweetened tea concoctions too. I love mint and tea but often times the mint teas I find on the market are either too sweet, can barely taste the mint, or tastes chemically. I'm glad that I can put some cold-brew tea into a portable bottle, toss in a handful of mint, a lemon wedge and it tastes like a lemon-mint tea should taste. Definitely recommend this for iced tea lovers !!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWOAWIP1SJ27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LIDZ26#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWOAWIP1SJ27","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this pack of ink pads to use on a floral tree scene stamp set and the colors are very very light that you can barely see the color on even white cardstock they were very very light. The only use I found for them was to use them as background blending stamps where you actually rub the inkpads onto your card base to create a colored background.

"I have to agree the previous reviewer about the pad shedding little hairs. I was kinda disappointed that it wasn't a double sided pad as I thought most were. The pad does do it's job or cleaning your stamps but many little hairs are rubbed off while you are cleaning your stamp so I dunno how durable that will be in the long run when the cleaning pad is bald and lost most of the scrubber hairs.

"Ok, I know the title of this review was kinda an oxymoron to say it's not really necessary but then it sorta is a Must-Have. L0L But lately I've gotten into cardmaking and making Shaker cards is one of my favorite types of cards to make. I was using my general craft scissors to cut up slices on Foam Tape to make the border which contains the sequins and shaker card materials inside. The foam tape is very sticky and left adhesive residue on my scissors making them hard to use again for another craft. I usually wiped off the adhesive residue with some Goo gone solution which works great but I was having to do that every time I cut Foam tape with my general craft scissors. Over time the blades on the scissors started getting dull and I sharpened them but I just didn't wanna cut Foam tape with them again as cleaning was tedious. I purchased these scissors and they are amazing !! I cut some Foam tape earlier for a Birthday Shaker card I am making and it did not stick to the scissors or gummy up the scissors at all. Plus the tiny precision blade made hand-cutting images out really easy than using a full sized scissor. I highly recommend these scissor if you're cutting any type of sticky adhesive whether it'd be Self-Adhesive fun foam, Duct Tape, or Full Adhesive sheets. You can't go wrong with Fiskar brand anything whether it's Scissors, Paper Trimmers, Paper Punches, etc. with the Lifetime Guarantee why would you buy anything else ?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13EV0NOENQMKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2QUR5M#wasThisHelpful","R13EV0NOENQMKH","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These stamps are very beautiful ! They are my 1st set of floral stamps where as before I was handrawing my own flowers but I wanted some floral stamps I can use when I am short on time and unable to handraw flower images to use on my handmade cards. These bundle together nicely into a floral bouquet or just as a few single stemmed flowers. I do wish they gave you some leaves or stemmed leaves to go with the flower blooms that don't have stems attached but you can easily just draw in some of your own. Really love these stamps and would highly recommend them but be sure to use a good stamp pad to get all the details of these flowers crisp and nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F1ZIL1UJCABP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV6G2LY#wasThisHelpful","R3F1ZIL1UJCABP","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have places some muddled mint leaves and lemon wedge inside to add to my iced water, I have used it to add some crushed fruit, etc. I have found that not many of my local stores carry loose tea as everything in in teabags but you can just cut open the tea bags and pour it into this tea strainer. I think it's really cute and I had to make it extra unique due to my creative nature and I sharpied on a more bolder expression on his face.

"I got this product as a gift. I agree with previous reviewers that the instructions on how to load the sticker tape is very vague and not detailed. But you eventually figure it out. As far as making stickers it does the job but my only reason I knocked off two ☆'s outta the 5 ☆'s is bcuz it wastes a lot of sticker tape. About 2"" inches of sticker tape is wasted before your actual sticker part passes through. Often times the clear tape that goes on top of your image is wrinkled or not smoothly applied. A trick I learned if you wanna cut your stickers without leaving a border is to take some double-sided tape or an adhesive tape runner and cover the entire back of your sticker image then stick it onto the sticker tape. That way when you trim around the sticker without a border the sticker paper will not fall off. Overall this product does it's job although not a very good job.I highly recommend just making your own stickers with clear transparent tape like packaging tape and an adhesive sheet or just use a adhesive tape running. Print your image or item you want to turn into a sticker and tape transparent tape over the top first then place double-sided tape or adhesive tape runner on the back then trim to your liking. It's cheaper and less wasteful that this machine !","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MA9VXCM4ZUFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GXK8KS#wasThisHelpful","R3MA9VXCM4ZUFH","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When temperatures dropped to record lows my Husband and I purchased this heater as a gift for our elderly landlords for Christmas but later we purchased one for ourselves as the cold was just unbearable.

When we first got the heater the weird odor that it gave off bothered us but when I contacted Lasko they said to run the heater on MAX for a few days til the odor disappears. Sure enough it worked and the odor is gone. But I have to knock one star ★ off because the plug get's really hot and burnt the plastic outlet plate to a brownish color like toast from a toaster.

"To many dogs are not just pets but family and to some our children in fur coats. I was previously feeding my dog Pedigree but she seem to be getting tired of the same old stuff. So I added a cup of this to her usual pedigree to give her a flavor boost and a little more variety. I didn't dramatically feed her this but gradually added it to her usual food. This stuff gives her an upset stomach and terribly soft stool. I also noticed she's incredibly thirsty after eating more than usual. Please, don't feed your dog this junk.

"I'm loving my Stone Wave pot more and more each time I use it. I just wish it came with a better recipe book that contained more recipes to give you ideas on how to cook with it. But I made a Turkey meatloaf with it last night and it was done in just 3 minutes compared to the hours I'd have to wait if I popped it into an oven.I am aware of the warning that it contained lead and it does concern me a little but everyday we're exposed to something in tiny amounts. I'm still going to continue using my Stone wave and might actually buy a 2nd so my husband has one of his own. I'm eager to try baking cakes in this but so far I've only tried soups, scrambled egg, meatloaf, mashed sweet potatoes, baked potato, and an a poached apple bake.But I love this and if you're always tight with time this is a great product to have. Be great to use in a office or workplace to make quick hot lunches. Just pack a ziplock or tupperware with ingredients and pop them into the pot then microwave. Everything I've made generally took under 5 minutes to cook. It's tiny size will fit perfectly into a office locker or locking file cabinet drawer.Definitely recommend giving this product a try and it's perfect for those who are trying to cut back on the portions.Here's a recipe to try for my poached apple I made ... Granny Smith Apple or any Apple you like - Peel the apple, Remove Core2 Tablespoons of Almond Milk or any Milk½ Tablespoon of Vanilla Caramel powdered coffee creamer *You can use any flavor you like*Teaspoon of Cinnamon and SugarPlace the apple into the stone wave - Pour in the milk - and Powdered ingredientsMicrowave for 3 minutes - Check with a fork if the apple is still hard ...

"My Husband and I purchased this product on the box description that you can cook perfect rice in 5 minutes. When you open the package it comes with a single page recipe flyer which right off the bat lies from the 5 minutes perfect rice time. It says White Rice even just 2 cups can take 13-15 minutes. We tried that and followed the instructions on the recipe flyer the rice didn't cook fully in 13 minutes so I put it in for another 5 minutes and still wasn't cooked so I put it in for another 15 minutes. So in total that was 33 minutes to cook 2 cups of white rice ! The same amount of time it would take for a rice cooker. I don't think this thing is going to be able to pressure cook a beef roast or chicken in half the time a real pressure cooker would. If it can't even cook 2 cups of white rice in the time they state. I doubt this would work for anything other than steaming vegetables. Just get a real Pressure Cooker.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4UHUT922TI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TLM6A2#wasThisHelpful","RL4UHUT922TI0","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I upgraded from the 3DS after I accidentally cracked the screen on my 3DS. I have to admit I am glad I got the XL. The larger screen really makes gameplay a lot better. The sound on the 3DS XL is different from the 3DS for on the 3DS I had the volume set on less than ½ way and it was loud enough but the 3DS XL at least this one the volume setting is on FULL. The screen brightness also is different on my 3DS the screen brightness was on low and still pretty bright but this 3DS XL the screen brightness is 1 down from full brightness. Overall I like the bigger screen and hopefully I won't accidentally crack the screen. I highly recommend a 3DS XL if you're looking to get a 3DS for a Christmas gift this Christmas.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DISBJTDBULFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAXECXK#wasThisHelpful","R3DISBJTDBULFA","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a avid artist most of my Life since I could first hold a pencil. I am also an Big Animal lover so animals have always been my main subject in artwork.

"I am physically disabled and due to my disability when I am at home I walk on my knees. Knees aren't exactly meant for walking on so I tend to develop sores and skin infections on my knee. I've tried many different types of knee pads from strap on knee pads, knee pads for volleyball use, etc. The strap on knee pads shift positions, unstrap, or the straps doesn't fit around my calf area which is very thin due to my disability. Other knee pads that I've tried like for volleyball use the padding was too thick and made it difficult to walk on them. I purchased these knee pads and they're completely comfortable and does their job. They do not shift around, they have just enough padding for protective support, they're comfortable to even wear all day long, and since wearing these the skin on my knees have dramatically improved. I no longer have dry, callous skin and no longer have any infections like I did prior to this. They are great and I recommend them to anyone who's kneeling or walking on their knees. These might be perfect for gardeners who are kneeling on their knees while tending their garden. I recommend them for anyone looking for protective knee pads. These are the best and I've tried many from expensive brands to different types.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18FSES0MRGGNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJNCGI8#wasThisHelpful","R18FSES0MRGGNO","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always had this brown spots right under my eyes at the cheek bone area. They're not quite freckles but just dark spots and I've always hated the way they looked. I purchased this product and upon 1st time trying it I noticed they were alot lighter in color and slowly getting lighter and lighter as I continue to use this product. I've even noticed some small birth marks fade in color. I haven't been using this product long enough to really tell you how visibly they disappear or fade but I do know that it smells great, makes your skin feel soft especially if you're using it on your face like I am, and I think it legitimately works.

"My husband loves Pineapple and before I bought him this product it was a messy task to cut and slice a pineapple cleanly without getting juices everywhere. This product works effortlessly and leaves very little waste behind. You can actually re-purpose the hollowed out pineapple for your serving bowl. I've made Ambrosia salad with fresh pineapple and served it inside the hollowed out pineapple shell. Makes a great presentation and easy clean up when empty. If your wondering what you can do with the center core besides throwing it out ... give them to your dog as a treat. I put some in a ziplock and place it into the freezer as a cooling treat for my dogs. Overall this is a great product to have and I highly recommend it for pineapple lovers.So sorry to Spongebob who's pineapple house is being eaten by people who own this tool.

"I have had this item on my wish list for quite some time. I love the concept of having multiple different looms without the clutter of storing them all. I currently have most of the Knifty Knitter Circular and Rectangular looms and I can tell you that I had to get a box big enough to store them all but even then I've lost some of the smaller sized looms around the house. This loom I can create both circular, rectangular, weaving, and in different sizes as well from BIG to SMALL. Bonus is they all come apart to neatly store away without losing the looms.Now I had to dock off one ★ mainly because the pegs aren't very snug into the holes and pop off like popcorn while working on a project and the instruction book that comes with it isn't very detailed or thorough in it's instructions. For example ... Weaving ! The pictures of the woven product you see the warps and wefts are thick *4 strands* but the instructions does not tell you how to get the thick *4 strand* warp and wefts. I've never woven with yarn before but elastic loops from a potholders kit. Luckily for YouTube LionBrand Yarn does have Tutorials on how to Warp and Weft on his loom kit. You need 2 skeins of yarn and warp/weft them together to get the 4 strand thickness. *Little Tip ... When you buy a *new* skein of yarn there's loose ends on both ends of the skein. Pull out both left and right strands and slip knot them together. That what you do not need 2 skeins of yarn but to work from just one.*A little help I found in keeping the pegs in tightly and not popping off is to give each peg a gentle tap with a rubber mallet. It will set them into the holes a bit more snug but not too snug that they won't come off when you need to store it away. Other than the issue with the pegs being a little loose and the instruction book not being very detailed in instructions. It's a great product !! With colder months ahead I'm looking forward to creating some gift scarves, slippers, and blankets. Currently starting on a woven blanket using the weaving loom.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZX0UWL0Q9RDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W8W2V6#wasThisHelpful","R1ZX0UWL0Q9RDY","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the same keyboard except that mine if for an iPad *the Original 1st version* and the elastic bands that hold the iPad in place aren't exact fit to the iPad but none the less it works perfectly. I am able to jot down my thoughts better without tapping the on screen keyboard anymore which is a lot more comfortable. It comes with a micro USB cable which is used to charge the keyboard's internal battery. Although I have not charged it once since taking it out of the packaging. Out of curiosity I just tried to see if this keyboard would connect to my Samsung Galaxy SIII phone and guess what ... IT DOES !! Now I am able to type on my SIII phone too without using the on screen keyboard and since my phone has internet build it I can update blog entries or type emails a lot easier, faster, and more comfortable than using the on screen keyboard.

"A lot of the reviewers posts are about children using this watercolor set. I am a self-proclaimed Creative Artist on a tight budget so I try a vast range of inexpensive art supplies. I liked the fact that this didn't require water but either my set was defective or just dried out but I followed the instructions and the pad never seem to stay moist so I recommend you still have a tiny cup of water if you're a grown-up trying this. I dipped my marker brush in water then rolled it onto the emery board shaped pad then grabbed colors. Grabbing colors you need to make more of a stabbing motion into each color pot rather than just dipping/dunking it in to get a good saturation of color on the brush marker. I really recommend this set for children as the colors are mixable so children can learn about color mixing and the color theory. I generally enjoyed using this watercolor set and since it is mixable the color pallet choices are endless if you know the color mixes or have a color wheel to help you out. Clean up is really easy just rinse the white pad out and the brush marker tip. If you noticed the color pots becoming a little dry take a small medicine dropper or if you can get some a pipette and add 2-3 drops of water into each color pot to revamp the inks.Little hint : To make brown mix ... Red + Green + a little Yellow. Add more green or a tiny dab of blue for darker browns ~ To make black mix ... Blue + Purple + Red + Green til you a dark black. Add more blue or purple if it's still not dark enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21VK129LUK8CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M04TKY#wasThisHelpful","R21VK129LUK8CD","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I sometimes draw Anime/Manga characters and also trying to practice getting better at drawing people. I was finding it difficult to find skin toned markers or colored pencils. I purchased this pack as it's supposed to be a multicultural skin tone set but what it actually is is a spectrum of different tones of Brown. The colors aren't very accurate from the cap colors as even Beige and Apricot are a light tone of brown. It doesn't include a peach or lighter skin tone colors just tones of brown ranging from a tan to a dark brown.

"My Mom and I both have a large amount of photos that we've been storing in our cameras that we never got a chance to print out. She wanted to get a photo printer as some family members were asking for some copies. After doing some research I found that this printer was a good one. We were both surprised by the size of it. But after giving it a test run I myself was hooked and bought one myself. I generally like that the language choices does include Japanese which is useful for my Mom who is Japanese. I was overall happy with the print out but please buy the refill set along with the printer. It does give you a starter ink and paper set but it only prints out like 10 photos and runs out of ink and paper. The refill set gives you 108 photo paper and three(3) ink cartridges that each print out 36 photos each. Compared to my Sister's Picturemate printer the ink and paper is relatively inexpensive. My only dislike about it is that the prints have a perforated border which you tear off and that leaves a jagged edge to the photos compared to photos you'd get from a photo lab. Overall it's portable size fits well in a suitcase for travel or even a backpack or tote. I'm glad I purchased this and my Mom feels the same way. Now I need to buy albums to put my photos in. :P L0L","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQGTN45MKP2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HK8V4NC#wasThisHelpful","RJQGTN45MKP2T","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you draw portraits of people or anime/manga characters this is a MUST-HAVE set as it includes skin toned colors such as Almond and Soft Peach. I just love how smoothly the colors blend and that it doesn't leave any streaks of your marker strokes behind.

"I've looked at this product millions of times in stores but was never enticed into purchasing it. I thought it was just another form of Play-doh but actually this stuff is pretty great. I originally started making a wire armature sculpture using Polyform Air-Dry clay but after the clay dried I noticed lots of cracks in my sculpture. I was trying to think how can I fill in/fix these cracks. I thought maybe a layer of polymer over it would do the trick but being it's Hot and Humid Summer I really didn't wanna use the oven and the hot temp that polymer clay needs to bake at might destroy my Air-Dry clay sculpture to dust. I had purchased a pack of this Model Magic stuff as it was on sale with the back to school supplies. I figured it's also an Air-Dry clay so adding another layer of Air-Dry wouldn't hurt. This stuff is very easy to smooth out and filled in the cracks very nicely. Let me advise you that Model Magic does not dry to a rock hard consistency. It's more or less and soft foam texture when it dries. But for my armature sculpture that I thought was a fail was rescued by the model magic. It gave my sculpture sorta a layer of skin over the cracked Polyform Air-Dry clay beneath it. I was able to continue patching up and fixing my sculpture and it turned out great and better than what I had intended before which was to hand-paint the Air-Dry sculpture. This skin layer or Model Magic skipped the task of hand-painting. Now I just gotta get more to finish up the final details. Would buy this again to make soft foam-like charms or mini sculptures.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QCBNCC0GM6ZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007VEQQ3S#wasThisHelpful","R1QCBNCC0GM6ZN","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have bought multiple packs and each pack has been useful in marking my handmade items with a handmade sticker so that they receiver knows that it is/was handmade. It gives all your handmade crafts a personal touch but yet professional too. The way the stickers roll out of the packaging is a bit off and a sticker get's peeled off the paper backing getting the sticker strip jammed inside the packaging.

"I bought this Air Dry clay as it was on sale but it's great for making picture frames or for children to make their own creations. But as a clay artist or one of advanced skill this clay isn't the best air dry clay to use. It doesn't seam or blend very well meaning when you're trying to attach say an arm to the body and smooth out the connecting seam to blend into the body this clay doesn't do that very well. Even with a little bit of water the seam still separated. Also this Air Dry clay dries up very fast !! You can't just pull out a large blob and work bit by bit off pieces from the blob. After just 10-15 minutes the blob clay is no longer soft and pliable but dry and crumbly. If you're looking for a air dry clay for minor use then this might be a good choice. But I think the Crayola Air Dry clay is a better although your finished products can be heavy and crumbly too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14UA08H4DN6CH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WDNU1E#wasThisHelpful","R14UA08H4DN6CH","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although the jar shows it as a Ice Cream Topping it isn't just for Ice Cream. You can make very very delicious Sodas using this as the main flavorizer *Is that even a word ?* I'm sure you've gone to places like Taco Bell with their Cherry Lime Sparkler or Jack in the Box with the Mango Mayhem Coolers. You can make it at home and you'll feel better knowing what you put into it is real fruit. I have tried making this soda with the Breyer's Cherry and Mixed Berry topping. I think Cherry is my favorite.

"I just got this product today and I titled this review be very very careful because my husband accidentally dropped the tool on his foot and cut open his toe. It was a very deep cut to where blood spurted out and required a long amount of pressure to stop the bleeding. In the video they make it seem so effortless to remove the coconut flesh in one whole piece but I found it very difficult to get it to come out in one whole piece. Aside from my husband cutting his toe open it does work and makes getting the coconut meat out faster and in larger chunks than before at least in my situation. Just be extra extra careful when using this knife as it is very sharp and the packaging even warned of that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVKO8CUIODN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006OCS5ZU#wasThisHelpful","RCVKO8CUIODN1","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased a scale which is similar to this one but by MainStay brand. I use it for my Polymer Clay crafts to weight each clay slab before I sculpt so I now every clay ball is same size since they're same weight. But this scale is very accurate and great for not just kitchen/food use but for crafting as well for example you can use the liquid weight measurement mode for making sure your resin poured out is exactly the amount it should be. I have used it on many occasions in my craft work and love it ! It's very easy to clean with a baby wipe or a spritz of rubbing alcohol and a wipe. The LCD screen is very easy to read compared to my old manual scale which you had to have propped up on a block or read at an angle to see. It takes up very little space and I think is a great scale to have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HXD3L104UIDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMMTT5C#wasThisHelpful","R3HXD3L104UIDL","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big fan of Chips Ahoy cookies but I am a fan of anything coffee flavored. So when I saw this was Mocha flavored I had to give it a try. After one cookie I was pleasantly surprised by the strong coffee flavor. It felt as if I was sipping a cup of Mocha coffee and what's even better is it's a soft chewy cookie which I prefer over cripsy. Being this is a Limited Edition and will eventually disappear I would definitely buy it again whenever I'm craving something sweet. I recommend any coffee lover to give it a try.Note : I believe it does contain caffeine from the mocha they infuse into the cookies.

"Ok, So I finally gave in and bought myself a rainbow loom product. I always eyeballed the rainbow loom but the price just never felt worthy to me. I had made my own loom using simple items like push-pins and a oversized novelty eraser. It worked and I was able to make simple fishtail/single chain bracelets but I've seen a few more advanced designs that caught my eye. I finally gave in and bought this mini Loom as it said it makes thicker bracelet designs easy. It was slightly disappointing that you don't get a metal loom tool but a crochet hook works just as well on it. I like how it's very small and easily fits in your purse, book bag, or pocket. I think it's a great product for children with small hands and being it's small size it travels with you very well. Long car rides will be peaceful when children have this product and a baggie of rubber loom bands. I highly recommend watching YouTube videos by a channel called JustinsToys. He makes very awesome designs !","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBXSKBJVO34Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7PI4MU#wasThisHelpful","R3NBXSKBJVO34Z","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got two of these and they're bright enough to light your path whether it's down a hallway or down a stairway. The double-sided adhesive that comes with these isn't very strong. The adhesive peels off as both my lamps fell off from the wall not even after a day of installing them. Just a pack of double-sided wall mounting tape of use those 3M removable adhesive strips. Overall these are very useful and the bulb flips up or downward angle. I have one mounted by the stairs to help you see as you go up and down the stairs at night and the other by the bed.

"I have drank this tea previously but not enough to vouche for the previous reviewers but I love this tea ! I love that it's low in caffeine content and it has very fruity hints. I taste hints of peach and mango with a small hint of lemon. Green tea is high in antioxidants and very healthy for you. I always try to chose green teas. When it comes to iced teas I generally chose iced teas and cold teas to go I always bought Arizona teas but I think I'll be grabbing a bottle of this if it's available instead. It's very light in taste, fruity after tones, and not too sweet. I picked it up thinking it's gonna taste like the other green teas where it's sweetened with a bit of honey but was pleasantly surprised by the fruity hints. I'd recommend this if you're looking for a healthier caffeine fix than a bottle of coke. It's not too sweet and healthier option than soda.

"I purchased this item and the first thing that bothered me was even though you tightened the wing-nut bolt the bottom half of the jig still swivels around and if you try to tighten the bold tighter to keep that 2nd half in place you'll strip the bolt in the long run. I found a temporary fix is to make a paracord bracelet that will go around the bottom piece and make it one size too small so it's a bit tight and it'll keep the bottom part from swiveling around. This is just me but I docked off two(2) stars bcuz one bolt isn't enough to keep the two pieces from sliding and swiveling around and I found it difficult the gauge the tension that I'm working at. When I have it in my hand I can guage how tight I'm pulling the weaves and able to make sure everything is tightly woven but when it's placed on the jig I have trouble making sure everything is tight without the jig moving around. It was kinda poorly assembled as well. There were parts where the wood seams had a gap which means the wood pieces weren't flush with each other. Some wood filler fixed that issue but I think for the price you're better just going to the hardward store and making your own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLOP2IJ5JSL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DV6EZK6#wasThisHelpful","RNLOP2IJ5JSL9","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So having two indoor dogs ... one being a Medium/Large size often means major clean up in the bathroom. Our Bathroom is not only human bathroom but also for K9s. They are newspaper trained and although it's difficult to obtain newspapers these days Leila sometimes has boo-boos where she pees off the paper or it rolled off the paper and being she's a Medium/Large dog it can be quite a large puddle. I was using the old fashioned method of a moist mop. I have to unscrew the mop head, rinse in water, wring it out then start mopping. It was hard work and sometimes it didn't really mop anything but rather just push the PP around. My Sister was using a Swiffer to mop the kitchen floor and I remember it looks so effortless and easy. So I bought myself a Swiffer. Normally they were a tad outta my price range to afford but I found one on Sale and jumped on it. Instantly gave it a try and at first I was a bit taken back by how soaking wet ... I mean dripping wet the wet cloths were but once I got it on and mopped away it was wonders. The smell was pleasant and not harsh like Ammonias, Pine Sol, and other cleaners smelled and it easily glide across my floors. Even days after the room I mopped in smelled fresh and stayed clean. I'd definitely recommend this over a old fashioned mop head any day !! With this mopping the floors is a pleasure and not a chore.Little Tip : (*u~) Use an old sock that is missing it's partner as a reusable/washable swiffer cloth. Just slip it over and dry sweep or dampened in warm soapy water then slip on and mop away. When it's dirty pop it in the washer. Now you got a useful use for all those socks missing it's partner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK54JMTSVNMWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00512DYKA#wasThisHelpful","RK54JMTSVNMWG","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Times are changing and you have to find alternatives to everything these days. Lemons when it's not in season can be very expensive to buy. Either they're $1.50 a pound and the lemon sizes are so large that just one alone would be $5. I like using freshly squeezed lemon in many things. It's refreshing just added to iced water or in iced tea. This stuff is really good !! I carry a couple in my pocket all the time to add to whatever whenever. I'm liking that it's 100% natural lemon with no other additives. If you love added a squeeze of lemon but can't afford to buy lemons this is the next best thing.

"As a Creative Artist and Avid Crafter I am always looking for *new* things to try and add to my endless crafting repertoire. I've bought a paracord bracelet before and wondered how difficult they are to make. This kit is perfect for beginners starting out on learning to make paracord bracelets. The instructions are pretty straight forward but the instructions on how to finished the bracelet is a little tricky. Luckily there are video tutorials available on YouTube to help you out with that. This kit makes 6 bracelets but it's so easy to do that you'll be looking up advanced techniques and patterns after just making one. The price for this kit is very affordable and there are several different kinds each with different colored paracords. This one has a really pretty rainbow colored paracord and some cute pink patterned cords. Overall it's great for beginners but I warn you making these paracord bracelets are just as addicting as making those rainbow loom bracelets. Be creative and experiment like using chunky yarn or bungee cord, string beads as you weave, clip charms to it, etc. It's really fun and easy !!

"(⌂¬) I dunno what the previous review is talking about but this AC unit rocks. I felt that it deserved to have a proper review. My husband and I have had this AC unit for years now. Never have we had to dump out any water or had any issues with it. We love that it adjusts digitally by temperature degrees unlike window AC units that just have a switch for COLD to HOT. We leave ours at 69° degrees and every Summer or Heatwave we are cool like being inside a walk-in fridgerator. It does have multiple features like Heater, Fan, etc. We've never used the other features besides AC. Only thing we've ever done was dust off the filter but never had to dump out water or do anything else other than plugging the unit in. It's been probably over 5+ yrs. we've had this and it works great each and every time. Only thing that's starting to go bad is the remote. It occasionally starts to malfunction.

"I have to say the instructions that come with this french knitter isn't very clear. The instruction state insert the yarn through the top like shown in the instructions but there's nothing showing such step. Online isn't much help as most of the video tutorials and instructions are for 3 or 4 pronged knitters and not this 6 prong. Luckily, I know how to loom knit on Knifty Knitter looms so I just went with what I know from loom knitting. Word of advice though ... keep your tension very loose. I'm a tight tension knitter and I was knitting a little too tightly that one of the prongs on this french knitter got bent. I was able to bend it back into place and loosened my tension but I think if you want a stronger more durable spool knitter just get a wooden dowel or a wooden table leg from the hardware store and nail in some carpenter nails also known as round lost head nails.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO6N6969Y4EEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GBO9S2#wasThisHelpful","RO6N6969Y4EEI","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These clay cutters aren't what I thought they would be. They stick to your clay ! I rolled out a medium sheet of clay and pressed out circles using the cutters. The clay was pressed onto my surface which in my case is a ceramic tile. It pressed the clay into the tile that when I went to lift up the circle cutouts they got distorted and warped. These cutters are very difficult to use. The Spring loaded ones might be alot better. Otherwise just save your money and make a rose by rolling clay into different sized balls and pressed them flat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QNN0H0JB8CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004BN7Y0Q#wasThisHelpful","R17QNN0H0JB8CI","A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38IEZF0P3ZUQJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this Konjac sponge.  I was worried about using it when I took it out of the package.  The idea of using something that had charcoal in it kind of scared me.  I did not know if it was going to scratch or burn so I was really hesitant.  I was wrong on all counts,  the first time I used the charcoal sponge I decided it was going to be part of my every day beauty regimen.  The sponge did not burn, scratch, or bother me at all. In fact, it felt nice.  It was like using a mild facial scrub. The konjac sponge was easy to use, all I did was let it get wet then run it all over my face.  It really does make a difference in my skin.  After the first time I could tell my face felt smoother.  It felt really clean too.  I use the sponge every day before I go to bed, then I immediately apply my serum.  I thought since the sponge makes my face so clean, my serum would work  really well if applied immediately.The konjac sponge is easy to take care of, after you use it you just wet it, squeeze it and hang it up to dry.

"I do not believe there could be anything more comfortable to wear than this knit poncho.  It is super soft,  only touches me on the shoulders, arms, and upper back.  There is nothing about it that doesn't feel comfortable.  I love how easy it is to wear too, no matter if I wear a cami, long sleeve t-shirt, a collared button up, or even a dress, this poncho is going to look perfect.  It has a great bohemian vibe, and I plan on wearing it with jeans, cami, boots, and several necklaces.  The fringe on the bottom gives the poncho a great retro look.  The poncho is well made,  I checked the knitting and could not see any missed stitches.  The fringe is all even too.  The knitting yarn has a bit of silver thread running through it around the neckline. The yarn this is made from is a polyester/acrylic blend, so to wash this I would recommend hand washing it and letting it lay flat to dry.  It is very pretty, and I love how I look in it.

"This is a beautiful bracelet.  I love the contrast of the leather and metal band.  It is unique, unexpected, and gorgeous.  I love the pretty faceted Swarovski crystal surrounded by smaller crystals. The crystal centerpiece is a great blue color with just a hint of blue tint.  The brown cord is leather and I believe it is waxed so it will not rough up easily. The  gold metal is stainless steel so it is very strong, and should not bend or turn colors.  The closure is made from a loop in the leather and the little hook in the metal just catches it.  I have collected costume jewelry for many years, and this is the first bracelet with this type of band I  have ever acquired.  I truly love it.  The Mondaynoon bracelet can be worn with anything.  I can easily wear it with jeans and boots or with a pretty dress if I choose.  It could easily be worn with other bracelets for a nice layered look.I would recommend this bracelet to anyone, it is simply gorgeous.I purchased this bracelet at no cost in return for an honest unbiased review.

"I love this cute but casual maxi dress.  It is absolutely perfect for a curvy girl- the sleeves are down to the elbow, the waist is knotted and rouched, and it is floor length but has a split up the side.  The material is stretchy so it skims over my curves.  I love the cut of the dress and i love the light gray.  It is very flattering on me, especially the rouched waist.  I am saving this dress for a movie date night.  I checked out the quality of the dress and it is well made.  The stitches are all present and there is no puckering or missed stitching.  Also the seams are even.  The dress is a pullover, you just slip it over your head and go.  I am so pleased with it.*****PLEASE NOTE******  This dress runs small, I knew this when I ordered it so i ordered up two sizes.

"This is a very nice set of pillowcases.  The pillowcases aree made from 100 % cotton and feel really nice. They are thicker than what I am used to but they are still very soft. They are well made with double stitching (see picture), so they should last a long time. The extra details on the opening of the pillowcases adds a nice touch. I washed the pillowcases in cool water and then placed them in the dryer using the easy care option.

"This scarf is so nice.  It is more like a blanket and it is huge (55 inches by 55 inches),  do not let the huge size scare you.  It is soft and thin so it will not be huge and bulky on you.  It is just the perfect thickness and size for you to wear it like a blanket scarf.  I have wore it twice in just the past three days and I love it.  I have worn it around my neck so it looks a lot like a cowl neck.  I also doubled it up and wore it over a long sleeve t shirt.  I just doubled it, and laid it on me like a shawl.  It is a nice easy look for fall, it looks like you made effort to look polished but really it is just so easy to grab it, drape it around you, and you are ready to go.  The second picture I have posted is the scarf doubled up, I wanted to make sure you knew the blanket scarf was much larger than you see pictured. To wash the blanket scarf you just hand wash it in cold water and let it line dry.

"This is really a deluxe teeth whitening kit.  I have tried several teeth whitening kits but none as nice as this one by EZGO.  This kit has everything you need for 50 applications, so it will last for a long time.  When I first looked at the kit I was a bit overwhelmed and wondered where to start, but there was a instruction guide that made it simple and easy.  Basically you use the whitening gel in the two teeth trays that came in the kit along with the mini LED light.  You do the treatments twice a day for seven days.  I have been doing the teeth whitening treatments now for five days, each time lasting about 20 minutes. You can leave the treatment on up to 30 minutes safely.  I can already tell a difference in my smile.  It is a bit brighter and whiter, I can not wait to see how my teeth will look after the seventh day.  The instructions that came with the kit said to take a 2-3 day rest period between each seven day series of treatments. I want to mention that normally with teeth whitening kits my teeth will hurt and my gums become really sensitive.  I have not experienced that with this kit by EZGO.  I also have not experienced the little white spots that people sometimes get with whitening treatments.  I am really pleased with this kit. The application is easy, and it works.

"I am a huge fan of using organic coconut oil for beauty purposes.  I think any time you can use a natural product you should.  This lotion is made from organic coconut oil, chamomile, argan oil, vitamin c, vitamin e, and 2.5% retinol.  All great things known to make your skin look better, younger, and smoother.  I have been using this lotion for about a week now. I love it, I like how it does not just sit on my skin but rather it feels like it is melting right into it. I realize I have not been using it long enough to see a major difference but my face feels very soft. Plus I have used organic coconut oil on my face for about a year and I know it works magic.  So with the other ingredients along with the coconut oil, I can not see how it would not do well on anyone's skin.  As far as the scent it is very very mild.

"These three pair of dress socks are probably the one of the most comfortable socks I have ever tried on.  Buttons & Pleats always has the best socks! These three pair are made of bamboo/acrylic/spandex, so not only are they soft and comfortable but they are breathable and able to fight bacteria.  They are very stretchy too.  I tried them on, they fit me (I wear a women's size 6 shoe) and fit my son also (he wears a size 10 men's shoe).  The crew dress socks are perfect for my son to wear at his job where he is to dress in all black, so he was very glad to get them.  I liked the little design that goes up the side of the sock, I thought it was sharp looking.I also want to make mention of the seam in the toe.  I am so picky as to the socks I like to wear.  I can not stand for my socks to have a rough seam in the toe part that rubs when I have shoes on..  These dress socks have a very fine seam and they do not rub at all.

"This is a well made sturdy umbrella by Woogwin.  I like how it folds up to be small enough to carry in my tote but is a full size umbrella when it is opened. This umbrella is heavy duty, you can tell when you take it out of the package it is really nice.  The umbrella has a really thick material (thicker than my other umbrellas) that is completely waterproof.  Sometimes I have fun with testing products to see if they do exactly what they are promised to do. So I sat this umbrella in the shower to see if indeed it was water proof.  I left it in there for about five minutes, then checked the underneath side to see if it was wet.  It was not wet, so I have no worries about using this umbrella.  I almost forgot to mention this umbrella is automatic, you just push one button and the umbrella goes up.  You press it again and the umbrella will collapse.

"This pair of leather gloves surprised me. I wanted a pair of nice looking gloves I could wear but still use my touch screen on my phone.  So I thought the gloves would not have the fingertips in them. But when I opened the box here was this beautiful pair of full hand gloves.  The leather was soft as butter and fit me perfect.  I checked all the stitching and lining and was all done beautifully.  The leather is calfskin so it will wear well. The lining is a soft faux fur and feels nice on my skin.

"I absolutely love this pair of jeans.  I am really picky when it comes to the jeans I wear.  I like for them to fit well, look great, and to be well made.  I normally purchase my jeans at Buckle and wear the Maddie style jeans.  This pair of jeans by Eurssto fits the same exact way that the Maddie jeans fit thru the waist, hips, and derriere.  They are made from cotton and have a bit of elastane.  This means they are soft and have a bit of stretch, that is why I think they feel so comfortable.  They are low rise but have a little extra length in the derriere part, so they do not go so low to be showing your behind. The pockets in the front are deep enough to keep your money safely and the jeans also have the little extra pocket that is so popular with the more elusive brands. The back pockets are plain, which I LOVE, and they are well placed, not too low or too high.  The legs of the jeans are skinny and are fitted all the way down to the ankle, making them perfect for under boots or to be cuffed.  The material the jeans is made of has a bit of a weathered look so the jeans do not have that stiff brand new look of dark unfinished denim.  I checked the jeans all over to see if there was any flaws or cons to make mention of.  I can find none.  Everything about this pair of jeans is perfect for me.

"This bag/backpack is so original. It will work as a backpack or a carryall.  The bag is made from canvas, which I love because it just looks better the longer you carry it.

You could carry your laptop so easily in it with much room to spare. The handles are nice, they have an ergonomic fit so it is easy to carry. The backpack straps are padded and adjustable so anyone could the bag comfortably.  The thing I like the most though is how the bag can be a backpack or a duffle type bag.  I can choose what way I want to carry it with just zipping or unzipping one part of the bag.  It is as easy as that.  Either option is attractive and useful.  I checked out all the stitching on the backpack and it is perfectly stitched. I have no complaints or cons to make mention of.

"I love that this set of colorful knives sits in this crisp acrylic stand.  The stand lets the knives stand out, which is great because the knives are beautifully colored and designed.  The blades on the knives are ceramic and white as snow. I like using ceramic blades because they rust resistant, germ resistant, and stay sharp.  The handles are bright yellow, green, blue, and red.  They are ergonomically designed so you can get a good comfortable grip.  You can store the knives in the stand or with the plastic sheaths that are included to protect the sharp blades (and to protect you from the blades too).I used a couple of the knives this evening so I could check them out.

"This is probably the most simple of designs but it works perfectly. When I pulled this out of the package, my sister could not figure out what it was.  She had no idea that it was a hair remover. Then I tried it out for her.  I picked up the hair remover and held it by the pink handles, then placed the coils up as close to the hair between my brows as possible. Last I just twisted the handles in opposite directions to make the coils grab the hair.  I just twisted until the hair pulled out.  I am not going to tell you this was painless, it did hurt. It hurt like a sweat bee sting.  However it did pull out several hairs at once, rather than just one at a time like with a tweezer.  I like this hair remover, it is much quicker than a tweezer and SO much less expensive than going to a salon. To clean the hair remover, I washed it with an antibacterial soap, rinsed, and lastly shook as much water off as possible then placed on a towel to dry.

"I could not have picked a better time to purchase this pastry scraper and chopper. During the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons I bake pies, cakes, and cookies.  As in hundreds of cookies....  This pastry scraper and chopper should help me save time and it should be easier than doing everything with my hands.  The scraper is made from stainless steel and has a rubber handle that is super comfortable to hold. When I was younger I never gave a second thought about handles on things.  Now that I am older and have arthritis, having ergonomic handles really makes a difference.

"I love this pair of fingerless gloves!  I was surprised how well they fit.  When I first pulled them out of the package I was surprised at the pretty faux fur, it was plush and full.  The gloves are made to fit from the middle of the forearm down to right past your knuckles.  There is a hole for your thumb, so you are able to do whatever you need to without taking the gloves off.  I wore them for about an hour today just to see how they felt and they stayed up on my arm without rolling or folding down.  I could text with the gloves on without any trouble.  The gloves are really cute and I can not wait to wear them out somewhere.  I took pictures so you could see how the gloves look on and how they fit. I could not be more pleased.  I purchased the black pair and will probably buy another color before winter arrives.

"Ahhh, lemon essential oil has dozens of uses.  Ranging from homemade beauty products to cleaning your home.  I purchased this large bottle-4 ounces- of lemon essential oil to clean our hardwood floors.  I just add three tablespoons to five gallons of hot water and map as usual.  The floor comes out shiny and clean.  It saves me money to use essential oil instead of common household cleaners, plus it is so much more earth friendly.  We used this brand tonight and I am so pleased.  It worked just as well as another popular brand that is twice as expensive.  Dispensing is easy with this bottle as a glass dropper is included (less mess).  I have some other essential oils by Radha and all have worked really well.  This oil is no exception!  I would recommend this essential oil to everyone, it is useful and can be used in any home.  I purchased this bottle of essential oil at a no cost in return for an honest and unbiased review.

"I absolutely love this wristlet.  It is made from leather and is unbelievable soft, like butter.  I had several colors to chose from and I chose black. I am so glad I did because this black leather is so gorgeous.  It is a bit bigger than the wristlets I carry, so it holds more which is great.  On the back of the wristlet is a zippered pocket, which I am using to hold my keys.  On the inside of the wristlet is a small zippered pocket on the side.  On the other side is small compartments perfect for holding your cell and ID.  The main compartment in the middle is zippered also. Then a zipper runs the entire length of the top too. You do not necessarily have to carry this as a wristlet, there is a very pretty chain included so you can carry it as a crossbody.  Or leave off the strap and chain and carry it as a clutch.  I checked out everything on the bag to make sure it was well made and it is, I really could not be more pleased.

"I love this brush set.  Everything I need to do my makeup for an everyday look or a special night out look is in the brush set.  Eleven brushes are in the set, each perfect for different applications.  I can use the brushes to blend, stipple, contour, and line.  There is even a spooler included, this is the brush that looks like a mascara brush. The brushes are well made with synthetic bristles that are very soft.  I made a point to tug on the bristles to see if any would pull out.  Maybe one or two came out which was great.  The brush handles are well made and are not too thick or thin so they are easy to hold.  I have used three of the brushes so far. The spoiler brush I used to brush my eyebrows with and to get them looking shaped.  I used the small angled brush to put a darker shadow in the crease of my eyelid.  I used the biggest brush to put a little bit of illuminating powder on.  All the brush worked well and felt really soft on my skin.  I love the bag the makeup brushes came in, I actually think it is cute enough to carry as a purse.  The silver color and black polka dots make it cute and charming.  I am pleased with every piece of the makeup brush set and would recommend it to anyone that wants an economical but well made set of make up brushes.I purchased this set at a no cost in return for an honest and unbiased review.

"This shaving set would make such a nice and thoughtful gift.  The shaving kit has everything needed for a nice close shave.  Included in this set is a razor, shaving brush, razor blades, blade sheath, and a stand.  The razor has a longer handle for a safer shave and is double edged.  The shaving brush has badger bristles and is thick for some serious lathering.  The razor blades included are Gillette 7 o'clock sharp edges.  To top it all off, this set has a leather sheath to hold the razor blades safely.  The brush stand is well made and has slots for both the shaving brush and the razor.  I love everything about this shaving set, even the box it came is really nice.  You wouldn't even have to wrap this up if you do not want to bother with it.  The box is so nice you could just gift it as is.  I tried out the brush on my legs just to check it out and I love how it lathers up.

"I love how little girls look with large flowers in their hair.  This set of Mookiraer headbands is so cute and charming. The set includes five headbands, each a different color-orange, pink, white, hot pink, and purple. I really liked these colors-they match most of my little niece's wardrobe.  Each band has a matching flower attached to it.  The flowers are cloth so they are not heavy and will lay right when the headband is on.  I like that the headbands are nice and soft, my niece will hardly ever wear anything in her hair but she likes this probably because they are so soft. She actually wore one for over two hours without taking it off yesterday.  The bands are stretchy so they should fit most girls under three years old.  I would recommend these to anyone who has a little baby girl in the family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GVH6VAQP6Z1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MG80WQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GVH6VAQP6Z1D","A2MHGNV7I743XA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MHGNV7I743XA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice crossbody purse. I chose the mustard yellow color because it goes with most of my wardrobe. I like carrying crossbody purses like this one because it keeps my hands free.

There is a large pocket compartment on the front side of the purse and several on the inside, including a pocket for your cell phone.  There is a wrist strap if you decide you do not want to carry the purse with the adjustable long strap. I actually like carrying it without either of the straps.  This purse is made from real leather, and it is well made.  All the stitching is in place, there is no missed or loose stitches to make mention of. The zippers are all well placed and zip freely. The hardware is placed neatly and looks expensive.  I could not be happier with this purse, it is sharp looking and I will be carrying it often.

"I really like the design of this silicone baking mat.  I have several other baking mats but not one of them have the high and low places like this one by Xpassion.  This baking mat has raised blunt ""spikes making it perfect to bake meat on. (bacon!!)  The food will not lay in grease as it cooks, which means the food is healthier and lower in calories.  The mat measures just a bit shy of 16 by 11 1//2th inches.  The directions say you can cut the mat to fit your baking sheets but I didn't.  I just placed it on my largest baking sheet.  To clean the baking mat you can just place it in the dishwasher or hand wash it.  Another plus of this mat is it takes very little room to store it.  You can either roll it up or lay it flat, either way it will not take up much room.

"I really like trying out different moisturizers, so many claim to do wonders for your skin but most do not.  Based on that, I am always a bit skeptical when trying out a new brand.This one by Cosmedica Skincare surprised me though, it actually made my skin feel great.  I liked that this moisturizer has essential oils in it,  I love using products that are pure and not full of chemicals I can not even pronounce.  I applied the rich creamy lotion on my face right after taking my shower in the morning, and right before bedtime my skin still felt and looked moisturized.

"This is a very nice weight lifting belt.  I was shocked at the quality when it arrived at my home.  It is made from a high quality reinforced leather and is thick. The belt comes in two sizes, and I purchased the larger one as the belt is for my son.  It will fit a 32 to 40 inch waist, it is adjustable by using the extra belt holes.  The belt buckle is heavy duty and is made very well. On the back of the belt is the company logo which makes it attractive.  Which brings up the next thing.  When my son came to visit yesterday I was telling him about this being an attractive lifting belt and he laughed and told me that people that lift were most concerned with the fit of the belt and how much support it provides.  So of course he took it home to try it out.  He called me this morning and I asked how he liked his new lifting belt and he said he really liked it.  I asked if it was comfortable and he said it was very comfortable especially on his back.  He also said he liked how the belt was adjustable as he is working on losing weight and it should still fit him when his waist gets smaller.

"“The history of the Holocaust is not over.  Its precedent is eternal, and its lessons have not yet been learned.”  No one can doubt or challenge he validity of the above statement found on page xii of the Prologue.  Mr. Snyder argues quite effectively on the complexity of the issues involved in the study of the Holocaust, and he emphasizes that the Holocaust is not only history but a warning.I found his explanation of Hitler’s thoughts with a heavy emphasis on ‘Mein Kampf’ to be a bit difficult to follow, but is clear in its conclusion on the emphasis on nature and its struggle  above morality or even the state in Nazi doctrine.  In Hitler’s ‘ecology’ Jews were a ‘global pollutant that had to be eliminated.  In the Nazi view of the world, science was paramount… but with one glaring rejection.  The Nazi’s had no belief in or room for a “green revolution” that would increase the food production of Germany and the world.  This belief and was fundamental in every action that they took to assure ‘lebensraum’ for the German race.  ‘Black Earth’ the title of this book is a reference to not just to an earth that has been blackened with death, but also to the rich agricultural soil of Eastern Europe and the Ukraine.Snyder argues that the Holocaust started first in Poland, the Ukraine, and the Baltic States and from there spread to the West.  This is because the areas that first saw the Holocaust were those areas in which the state, its institutions, and the morality which was supported by both were first destroyed.  He also argues, that the areas where the Holocaust was delayed or prevented from occurring were those places were the states and its institutions resisted the longest or delayed the Nazi orders.In his conclusion Snyder argues that the ‘green revolution’ running out of steam, ecological disaster, climate change, and perhaps most importantly the destruction of state systems that we see taking place in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East can cause more holocausts to take place. In fact, Snyder argues that “In a Middle Eastern War for resources, Muslims might blame Jews for both local problems and the general ecological crisis; that was, after all, Hitler’s approach.”  Snyder is a strong advocate that the state must do something to prevent climate change; in fact, he is a strong advocate of powerful and effective political states as a solution to most of the world’s problems.  It is rather odd, that Snyder, like Hitler has little or no room for the importance of individual morality.The book has a very impressive bibliography together with footnotes that are both informative and extensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B93JGH6C6MP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101903457#wasThisHelpful","R2B93JGH6C6MP4","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"“The Prize” is control of the Newark School system with its one billion dollar budget and all the political patronage jobs and contracts that it implies.  It is also the story of the attempt to reform an awful school system that has destroyed the promise of the future for thousands of poor children.  American schools have now been in a state of ‘crisis’ since 1983’s report entitled “A Nation at Risk”.  Both political parties are divided on this issue:  Republicans wanting charter schools and choice, yet opposing national standards; Democrats although wanting a better educational system for the poor, being unable to face-off against the unions and the loss of urban political patronage.This is an extremely well-written work that pulls no punches on the difficulty of reform.  It is also the story of the attempts of Corey Booker (first mayor of Newark in 44 years not to be indicted!), Governor Christie who technically ran the Newark school system, and wealthy philanthropists from Wall Street and Silicone Valley to change the system.  In their attempts to accomplish this they ran into two incredibly powerful bodies: the teacher’s union and the local system of political patronage;, where the school system with its enormous budget was not only the largest employer, but also the employer of last resort.  These two groups knew they could win by simply outlasting the outsiders; they would take the money, and then ignore, obstruct, and delay.  They seem to have won this game, as the reformers eventually gave up and left.I am familiar with the topic of school reform; I have taught for 41 years in mostly urban schools in New York and New Jersey; and have been an unhappy member of both the AFT and NEA; and for virtually the entire period have seen them change from advocates of both teachers and quality education to become one of the prime obstacles to educational reform. The attempts to bring about educational reform and competition to the “marketplace” (I personally have been hooted down at union meetings for referring to students and parents as our ‘customers’) through charter schools, closing failing schools, buying out bad teachers and administrators, and rewarding good teachers was doomed to fail.Most reform seems to fail because it is heavily top-down; rightly looking upon the entrenched power-groups and bureaucracies as the enemy (which they are) and not focusing enough on supporting the parents and the best teachers.  It is also the story of the arrogance and impatience of reformers, who believe that modern management models can be quickly and effectively employed to change the system.The book has excellent notes and two addenda; one of which shows “Where the $200 Million Went”, and the other “Newark Schools By the Numbers”, which of nothing else raises the issue of whether or not funding is related to school performance.“Education reform is too important to be left to reformers alone.” (page 211) This, of course is a restatement of Clemenceau’s “War is too important to be left to the generals”.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPX8EBXTNQI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547840055#wasThisHelpful","R1MPX8EBXTNQI6","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a variation of Heroscape with inferior components; as only the Planeswalkers are painted. If you are already familiar with Magic then the game is easy and flows very well.  The game setup is fast (the one benefit of some of the cardboard terrain), and seems well balanced. It is so tempting to try and add on some Heroscape squads, yet this would require considerable thought as to the conversion of point vales and the assignment of ‘color’.  Killing Planeswalkers are all that really matters in the game; you have to summon your squads and they fight the next turn.  You use the spell cards to bolster the squads; this is a crucial tactic.  It would not be very difficult to paint the unpainted figures; even a spray on base coat and a few colors with a stain would be of great benefit.  The board should have and could have been double-sided, to provide more varied terrain.  You can however, use Heroscape terrain and perhaps you should to replace some of the more annoying the cardboard pieces.It really needs the add-ons to enrich play; and this raises the key question: When will the expansions come?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KF359R9QDKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCRA#wasThisHelpful","R5KF359R9QDKG","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The title story is a pleasant three page piece, but not very memorable.  There is an interesting essay on writing alternate history, one about Chanukah written for the NPR crowd, and one about the influence of ""The Lord of the Rings"" on the Videssos Cycle, which is perhaps the most interesting work in the book, and does Turtledove realize that he is as blind as the settlers of Chalcedon?

"Kahuna is a European award winning game that has been around about twenty years.  It is a fairly simple and fast two player board game in which you are a Kahuna and play cards to establish control over an archipelago in the “South Seas”.  The Kahuna who controls all the islands will be the ‘Big Kahuna’ and after three rounds has the most point will win the game. You use the cards to place bridges from island to island.  When you own the majority of bridges, you control that island, plave an ownership token on the island and remove your opponent’s bridge.  This often has a cascading effect as this may cause him or her to lose control of another island.  You can also remove an opponent’s bridge by playing two cards for the same island.  These are the key strategies in the game.  When the draw deck is exhausted the round ends.  After three rounds the points are totaled up and one person has won.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EEBCGUYVWH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0GY9GG#wasThisHelpful","R3EEBCGUYVWH","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wrath of the Righteous is the third `base game' (master set would be a better term) in the very popular Pathfinder card game series.  It comes with the starter adventure set ""The Worldwound Incursion"", with five more card sets planned for this game.  The rules have been slightly updated from the two earlier base games in the series, and these are clearly highlighted in sidebars for those already familiar with the rules.The quality of the components are excellent with a few minor issues: 1) While the almost 500 cards, are beautiful, they are still a bit too ""anime"" for my personal taste (although perhaps not as bad as before).  2) The dice are very blah, and should look much better (these of course can be easily replaced).  3)  The box the game comes in is too big, and designed for someone who is so proud of owning this game that the wish to have it on display.These are obviously very minor issues in a game that has so many strong features.  Its open design, without the constriction of a game board, allows for enormous variety of play, even with only the introductory adventure set.  This game can truly be played with a small group each running its own character, and is even enjoyable for the solo player using one adventurer,  although you may of course run multiple characters.  It really has the true feel of a role-playing adventure, perhaps because without the limitations of a game board, the feeling of depth and involvement seems to be enhanced.  If you would like to see `how to play' videos, I strongly advise you to check out this game title, or the original game in the series ""Rise of the Runelords""Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Base Set on YouTube or Boardgamegeek.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SNPPSOTSDRG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","R3SNPPSOTSDRG3","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent game to teach logic spatial relationships and planning.  Although the rules call for six cards being drawn in a normal game, you can use two or three with a very young child to have them follow the rules and enjoy the game.  The timer adds another aspect to the game.  At times it may be impossible to follow all directions (for example, if one card calls for twice a many blue balls than green, and another card twice as many green balls than blue), it still requires you to make the best logical choices.  If you have an older printing of the game, please note that the authors have done away with most of the odder point scoring possibilities to provide a cleaner game.

"My teeth often look yellowing and I have tried many tooth whiteners- even a tooth whitening treatment on a cruise ship.  I also purchased an expensive tooth whitening system.  They all seem to help but require sustained use to be effective- there are no miracles.  They whiten your teeth over time  and I get lazy and stop using them.  The Crest 3D White toothpaste set are an excellent idea.  They will slowly whiten your teeth and ensure that you brush your teeth for a sufficient amount of time.  It seems to be working (Ive only been using it for about a week) and I am glad that the 2 toothpastes ensure that I am brushing my teeth for a longer amount of time.

"It is always a pleasure to read works from the “Golden Age” written by one of the masters.  Although this collection does not contain my favorite “The Big Front Yard” (we’ll have to wait for the second volume of the series), there are some excellent works in this volume, including the never before published “I Had No Head…”  Five of the works should probably be considered novellas, rather than short stories, although only three of these are divided into chapters. One of the stories “Gunsmoke Interlude” is a not very impressive Western.  The editors will probably publish all fourteen of his published Westerns, as the volumes of this series are meant to be “The Complete Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak”.  Perhaps these Westerns should be omitted or published in a separate volume; for in truth, this illustrates the principle that “less is more”.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BPZKZTABTNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1504012674#wasThisHelpful","R38BPZKZTABTNY","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The author places great emphasis on how their strengths, weaknesses and capabilities influenced their tactical doctrine.  A key point was the interesting fact that by this point in the war the American tank crews were far better trained than the Germans, and the ease of maintenance of the Shermans gave them a great numerical edge on the battlefield, which coupled with the poor production quality of the Panther and its great difficulty in maintenance, more than made up for the ""statistical"" superiority of the Panther.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDIZ7USH3JZS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4X7LC#wasThisHelpful","RDIZ7USH3JZS1","A224O69F7AVXDR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A224O69F7AVXDR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's embarrassing to have to take things out of my suitcase to carry on just to get below the 50 lb limit. It's also irritating because as I was packing, I thought I was packing light. I have a really nice suitcase but it's downfall is that it's heavier than some because of all its features contributing to reaching the limit without even being full. This scale will alleviate all that stress.It comes with a handy dandy manual but you really don't need it. It's very simple to use. I accessed all its features before looking at the manual. I'm not sure why it has a room temperature feature. I can't imagine why we would need this. But it's there. I really love the big and bright green digital display and the soft touch navigator button. The battery cover fits like a glove over the lithium battery provided so its impossible to put the battery in wrong because you wouldn't be able to push the battery cover in. It only goes in one way. The entire unit is heavy duty and its design is ergonomically correct making it easy to hold while weighing your luggage.I was provided a sample to try and test as a consumer and provide my experience and opinion of this product. I don't think there is anything negative to say about this product. I also appreciate the love note (customer service card) from the seller inside the box.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8HRLIE00YLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016M9MMSU#wasThisHelpful","R3F8HRLIE00YLR","A20P47HM0X87SI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20P47HM0X87SI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought that the ear buds that came with my phone were the best I've ever heard. My HTC beat the iPhone for sound after all. But... Not So! These Tyon earbuds by Sentey delivers true high definition stereo. I'm not all that picky about sound because my sound was pretty good but I could tell a big difference when I put these on. Something about the Nickel plated stereo plug. Now I can't go back to my old buds. I'll keep them for backup.Sentey's packaging is made for gifting. They spare no expense there but it's only a preface to the pleasure you'll experience when you try on what's inside. These are smart looking and they provide 3 sizes of silicone ear tips for the perfect fit. The ones that were already on the unit was the perfect fit for me. The In-Line microphone and In-Line Control are also in the appropriate spot. The removable cable feature I don't really understand. Maybe someone could help me out. I was provided with this sample to try and test as a consumer to evaluate and review. I think in this price point, you'll be hard pressed to find better sounding earbuds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAKVEP5H1JCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMZ746#wasThisHelpful","R1AAKVEP5H1JCF","A20P47HM0X87SI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20P47HM0X87SI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased one rectangular cube priced at $14.95 and the quality is no better than these cubes. This set is a great value. I read some reviewers taking issue with the mesh but that's one of the things that I love about them. It allows for expansion and visibility. I really like the cord pulls. The bags are very well constructed and I especially love the high quality zippers. I also think the sizes of the bags are appropriately sized. Jewelry and accessories, toiletries, shirts and  pants. I would use the other rectangular cube that I have for undergarments and pajama's.I appreciate the bonus items. The laundry bag is nice that it's lined in the event that you threw a wet swim suit in there but it's a bit small for all your dirty laundry. I think it's more of a wet suits and towels bag which is fine and nice to have. As far as the sleeping mask goes, I'd never use it but my Mother would so I'll be gifting it to her. I will say it is a nice sleeping mask. I tried it on and its very soft, comfortable and light blocking. She'll like it. The light from the clock will keep her awake.I ordered the navy blue but I received the bright blue. That was fine. I was struggling between the two colors anyway. I was provided this set to try and test as a consumer and provide my experience and opinion. Overall, I'm happy with this set and it makes me yearn for a vacation but that will have to wait. I do know it will be much more enjoyable with my suitcase organized and my clothing less wrinkled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KTGPGGIV06IY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VQDC3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1KTGPGGIV06IY","A20P47HM0X87SI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20P47HM0X87SI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another impressive product from LoveArtsCrafts. I have their crochet hooks which are amazing and now I own their matching yarn bag. First off, the price is a bargain. It's made of a heavy duty canvas and meticulously constructed. There were no corners cut in it's construction. The size is perfect. It's not too big and not too small. I love that it has a detachable strap for traveling. Best of all, you can keep the yarn in the bag as you crochet and keep it from tangling or away from the cat for that matter. Worthy of mentioning is the way that it's packaged. It comes folded in a bag but done so with precision as to not disturb it's shape. There will be a few lines but only for a couple of days. Honestly, that made me feel like this bag was painstakingly cared for before she made it home to me. I was provided this bag to try and test as a consumer and provide my experience with it an my honest opinion. Thank you for that. I truly love this bag and she'll be with me for years and years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HDZ4NU6AGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015HVQDIY#wasThisHelpful","R4HDZ4NU6AGP","A20P47HM0X87SI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20P47HM0X87SI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first experience with a French Press. I understand the concept and it makes really good coffee but it's too much work to use on a regular basis for me. I'm reserving it for the weekends when I want to show off or for road trips and camping. It would be also useful if the power went out overnight. Now that's where it'll really come in handy. During the week, I don't have time to boil a pot of water just to warm it up before I start to make a pot of coffee. Instead, I have my coffee maker set on a timer and it's done by the time my alarm goes off. So I consider this a luxury item. It's a beautiful piece of decor that I will be displaying but will likely be using it on limited occasions.

"I work for a mortgage company. We use these on a lighted neon board welcoming the new homeowners to their loan closing. Our buyers feel very special when they arrive at their closing to see their names lit up in neon lights. The instructions tell you that you have to push the marker tip down to get them flowing. I also like that the tip is reversible. Be sure to read the instructions. They are important! These markers also easily erase without mess. All the colors are just right for visibility. Very nice set! I do feel like it's missing the sound of the ball moving mixing up the ink and I really wish one of the colors were black.

"These party bulbs are really bright. They almost had me believing that that they were LED but they couldn't possibly be. I've held off writing this review because I wanted to show them to some experts at the hardware store since the box said they were LED. In coming back to this listing, I was pleased that the seller had revised their listing to an accurate description. I believe it was simply an honest mistake and it's good to see the error's been corrected.Back to the party lights. These are great for deck or patio lighting where you have access to electricity. Unfortunately, where I need them I don't. I really need solar so these are going to make a great gift to one lucky family member. The construction of the string and the bulbs are heavy duty, made to tolerate the elements of nature. They're packaged well and I do love the tone of the light. It's almost soft white only super bright. I received them to try and test as a consumer for evaluation and review purposes.

"These lights are very pretty and very difficult to picture how nice they are. I received two sets. I turned on the switch, charged them for one afternoon and they promptly lit up at dusk and stayed lit til Dawn. The only disappointing thing about these lights are that the colors don't light independently. It seems at least two stems are lit at the same time with the same color. The posts are nice and sturdy. I like that their metal. The ones I've purchased from the store in the past were always plastic. Everything about it reflects a higher quality light than you can find at the big box stores. The solar light itself is heavy duty and the switch to turn it on isn't cheap either. I've lost the use of solar lights in the past from the switch breaking. I don't see that happening here. The stems are equally substantial and unlikely to break. My box included 4 dragonflies (pictured), 2 birds and 2 butterflies. I like the dragonflies so I'm keeping this one. The other one will be gifted to my gardener daughter. I was provided with this sample to try and test as a consumer for evaluation and review purposes.

"This is by far the easiest diffuser to get working. That would explain why it doesn't come with any instructions. The only instruction you do need is to plug in the base before you add the water. I have another diffuser that requires that it be plugged in last so I found this out the hard way. It's very hard to plug it in if it's filled with water. The plug sits in the unit a bit funky and I don't really understand its placement being in the front. I personally have an issue with exposed cords so this could bother me more than it would you. Still, not a deal breaker enough to lose a star in my review.I tested it with a combination Ylang Ylang Oil and Lavender Oil. As soon as I hit the mist button, there came the mist. I ran the rainbow of colors before deciding on a favorite. It was a difficult decision because their all pretty. It was between the blue and the green. The green won. It turned off automatically when it ran out of water after 4 hours and 45 minutes but I don't believe I had my water level to the max line.

The top notch full zipper back and the peek a boo sides are very sexy and the criss cross belly accentuates the breasts in a good way. It's subtly sexy.

Previously, I tried one that was like chap stick. It had a waxy consistency that never really went away but it did work to an extent but took months and months of twice a day application. It was minimized to a degree but this product appears to be finishing up the job.

After all, most people who will use their products are aging and our eyes don't work like 20 year olds. This product does allow me to push that thought to the curb. Whatever it says; I don't need to read it. I can watch it work in action. I don't have dark circles but it clearly diminishes my puffy eyes and so far this is the only one that does.

"Treating the world as an onion, Jared Diamond covers 13,000 years of human history in a mere 500 easy to read, lively and entertaining, yet devastatingly precise, and informative pages -- telling us in the process that he thinks modern human development was due to the latter, the luck of the environmental draw, rather than to superior biological intelligence.The thin outer layer of his narrative onion is modern man; the deeper layer -- the rest of humanity -- is pre-literate societies. Since pre-literate societies represent the root node of modern man, and since modern man cannot really learn about the world only by studying himself, it was a ""no brainer"" for the author to turn to pre-literate societies to better understand how they eventually developed into modern literate ones.What he discovered is that eleven thousand years ago, the world was flat: all people were hunter-gatherers and existed at the mercy of the ""the luck of the environmental draw."" A people landing in terrain with a rich biota had a leg upon survival that was much more important to the history of human development than superior intelligence of a given tribe.From this unique vantage point, peeling back the onion and uncovering the basic substance -- the ultimate factors, and the fundamental interactions and strategies that made up the substrate leading directly to modern societies -- proved to be a straight forward if not an alway easy task. In fact the author gave a graphic picture of the whole dynamic process on page 87.That diagram summarizes the substance developed in the text, and what it shows un-mistakenly is that from literally only a handful of domesticable plants (no more than 200) and animals (only 14!) eventually spread out across the entire globe, world societies came into being.Moreover, it also shows that due entirely to nature's skewed distribution of these domesticable plants and animals -- a distribution that importantly heavily favored the Eurasian continent -- a slow multi-millennial chain reaction of events was set in motion. This chain of events spread out over the next eleven thousand years, would be the predicate to modern societies.But arguably, it was the glue that connected the dots across these years that proved to be the game changer. Pre-literate societies often elected to acquire domesticated plants and animals from others rather than domesticate them in-house. It was this choice of acquiring domestication from others -- this experiment in sharing and trading vital survival knowledge about plant and animal domestication -- that proved to be the game changer. It was this human interaction designed to improve their own chances of survival that unleashed the slo-motion chain reaction of events that would lead to modern societies.The chain as depicted in the diagram on page 87 unfolds across the eleven thousand years somewhat as follows: Proximity to easily acquired domesticable plants and animals through trade and cooperation led directly to the ability to produce and store food on a large scale (but it also led to diseases acquired from living in close proximity to these same plants and animals); the ability to produce and store food, led directly to large-scale stratified sedentary societies; large stratified societies, led to the use of draft animals for farming, for conflict and for conquest. These uses inexorably led to technological advancements, such as development of the gun, the iron plow and to oceangoing travel. Oceangoing travel and the gun, led to the transportation of diseases to distant lands, and often to their conquest.All of this and more is packaged into an easy to read narrative that explains in clear analytically supportable terms how around 1500 AD, mostly European societies formed into organized political units, and afterwards, began to exert their power, accumulated wealth and influence across the globe.Until this volume, however, our history books had been almost negligently silent about the role the luck of the environmental draw played in the development of human societies. Undoubtedly they were smugly content with another origin story of modern man.For instance, in most of our history lessons, we knew that the way Hernan Cortes and Hernando Pizarro tricked both the Aztec King, Montezuma, and the Inca King, Atahuallpa into submitting to them, had little to do with biological superiority -- unless guile is considered the best measure of such superiority. Even with guns and horses and a coalition of the respective kingdoms' enemies, these Spanish warriors barely prevailed. Yet, we continued to hold on to the belief that the discrepancy in power and dominance was due entirely to iron-making, guns and horses, and of course to biological superiority. Our histories were deathly silent on the decisive advantage that the rich environmental draw had given to European development, and thus to European conquest. Also, only occasionally was the important role diseases play in conquest mentioned either? As an article of faith forever true to Western catechism, it was assumed that discrepancies in wealth and power among societies ""could only have been"" due to superior intelligence and superior technology by certain privileged peoples, viz., Europeans.However, this book, by replacing historical chauvinism with testable hypotheses, shows that the truth is vastly otherwise, that the successes in human development were due much more to the luck of the environmental draw than to anything else. It shows how the biota and the environment mediated and facilitated modern man's development at every step of the way, and thus this book fills in a glaring hole in the historical record.

"It is about time someone with ""hefty legitimacy"" sounds the alarm about our nation's shadow government. Arguably, it has been around at least since the Eisenhower Administration. And as Fletcher Prouty claimed in his book ""The Secret Team,"" was responsible for the assassination of JFK -- who in the view of those running it at the time, thought JFK was leaning too far leftwards, and was being too accommodating to blacks -- among other unforgivable sins.Which gets me to my main criticism of the book: In an era where there is so much hard evidence, why has the author elected to allow the text of the book to remain so theoretical, sol full of hypothesized (but few hard-nosed real world) examples -- this narrative is almost abstract?Does this not unnecessarily leave the backdoor open for the uninitiated to claim foul -- to relegate this fine analysis to the dust bin of being just another nutty conspiracy theory? How I was so yearning for more meaty hard-nosed examples like those that occurred in Fletcher Prouty's ""Secret Team,"" etc.Indeed, at this late date, it is the book's very abstract nature that raises a hidden suspicion of mine: that so long as the Shadow Government continued to ""lean heavily rightwards,"" as it has done throughout its existence, then the author would have seen no reason for alarm? That is to say, so long as our democratic rights are being usurped and co-opted by a ""libertarian, right-leaning coalition of misfits,"" no need for alarm, right?Wrong! Now that it has finally been fully trained on black Americans -- with the embarrassing incarceration of the male side of an entire race; and laid the foundation-stone of the prison-industrial complex, and test-driven an economic collapse on the subprime melt-down, etc., the ""Shadow Government has now finally graduated to oppressing and usurping the rights of ordinary white people too. And thus has also become an ""equal opportunity ideological and racial oppressor?"" No one ever expected that did we?So, only after its graduation, and now that the hand writing is on the wall, that all along its target was white people, has the author's organization finally begun to see the light of day; and only now has he begun to sound the alarm? (Shades of ideological and racial hypocrisy to me, huh?)That such a hidden government has existed at least since the JFK assassination (of which Watergate Plumber, E. Howard Hunt referred to as ""the big event"") is not rocket science. What we needed here more than anything else was more hard-nosed facts like in Prouty's book, not more abstract insinuations, speculation and more inchoate hedging.We are long past the point where the idea of a shadow government is just an academic exercise. The rubber met the road on 22 November 1963.  Today, we are now avowedly in the ""red zone,"" in the area of ""can this nation still long endure?""

"This poetic pre-history of the North American continent, dramatizes in ""an Indian-friendly way,"" the environmental history of the continent. And while it is beautifully and sensitively written, the idyllic picture it paints of Indians as the ultimate stewards of the land is probably overdrawn in light of the most recent research about the land before the white man arrived.The research I refer to in particular is that reported in the very informative and entertaining book ""1491,"" which gives a much more balanced portrait of Indian environmental practices. They show them to have been a mixed bag -- that some Indians were good stewards of the environment, while others were not. In particular it points to the widespread practice of ""slash-and-burn"" or ""controlled burning"" as a way of renewal of the soil. It is now well-known for instance that although in the short run, such burning may not have damaged the environment, this is not true in the long run and when it is extensive, as it was when Indians did it.And while the Indians did eventually learn about the value of crop rotation, etc., it was not done on a wide enough scale to make a continent-wide difference. On the the other side, and as this book notes, they did engage in many practices such as irrigation and using natural fertilizers that did prove to be much more progressive than the environmental practices of the white settlers, who for three centuries seemed to be completely ignorant of conservation techniques and proceeded to rape the land and deplete the forest and seas of it animals.While I enjoyed the poetic portraits, in light of more recent scientific findings, I'd just as soon settled for a more balanced report. The Indian-friendly reports now seem a bit quaint and dated.With the planet rapidly dying after a half millinnium of being raped by white environmental ignorance, neglect and muderously insensitive industrialization, the author's larger message no longer needs a body guard of quaint noble savages running interference for it. Whether we want to be or not, with global warming bearing down on us, all but the crazies among us (spelled Republicans) are now environmental adults.

"This is not the normal storybook version of the Thirty Year’s War. For that one is better off referring to Wikipedia, which lays it out in an organized and comprehensible way even for a layman like myself. The version in this book is a highly technical (but nevertheless, in my view, a rather disorganized and incomprehensible ) collation of archival materials for use by esoteric scholars of the war.Despite this, I gave the book ""a school boy's try,"" biting off more than I could chew. And, before I got very far, I realized I did not have the proper historical background – i.e., a firm enough grasp of the sweeping geopolitics of the regions of the period, of the various components of the war, its players, or the ever-changing challenging problems of religion that served as the war’s backdrop, to understand this book.So I punted early and reverted to Wikipedia, which did indeed more than satisfied my curiosity about the war.So, in the end, not being sufficiently competent to judge the book on merit, I had no choice but to give it a ""middling"" rating of three stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSJPFCNXB2Q8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0415128838#wasThisHelpful","RLSJPFCNXB2Q8","A3RFXU3P0XKKF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFXU3P0XKKF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This quirky, funny, often wonderfully intense book is a history-crime thriller and psychoanalytic study all rolled into one. It is as rich in folklore and mythological-history as it is in interesting imagined characters and weird fragments of medieval existence itself.The protagonist of this story, Gilbert Brand -- the bland, non-descript carto-kleptomanic, extraordinaire, who made a career and business out of razor-blading maps out of valuable map collections -- in the end, is almost irrelevant to the larger story of how maps have played a dominant role in the construction of our reality about the world.  Yet, the author nevertheless persists in trying to give life to Brand’s psychoanalytically dead body. He wants to know why Brand did it? What a pity! -- as the book would have been just as interesting, with a ""placeholder"" instead of Brand himself appearing in the narrative.Since I had just completed reading Bernard Devoto’s wonderful book “The Course of Empire,” about the exploration of North American during the 284 missing years between “first landing” in 1492, and the American Revolution, I was especially interested in how maps remained so essential to world consciousness from that time clear up through the 19th Century.What was most striking about the Devoto book to me, was how similar the stories were by North American explorers, to those in this book. During both periods, the best explorers of the respective eras always had faulty maximally misleading maps. And thus, a forced reliance on ignorance, mythology misconceptions, superstitions, and fear conspired to create a fantasized world in the presence of uncertain knowledge.Given that most Europeans at the time were just awaking from the Feudal Dark Ages, one wonders how they acquired a reputation for being a swashbuckling heroic type?It is even rumored in the book “1421,” for instance, that the Portuguese actually stole their maps from the Chinese and that this was kept a deep state secret until this fact was recently released from Portuguese archives. It is reputed (by the Chinese at least) that indeed it was these maps that Columbus used to navigate across the Atlantic. It turns out that it is at least true that the Chinese seafaring mariners had mapped the North America coast long before Columbus or the Vikings had touched the continent.But more to the earlier point, it was the French, not the English colonists, who were intrepid enough to use the Indians to help them explore the interior of North America, giving the French an enormous comparative advantage in the fur trade that lasted for a century. In fact, it was largely French maps that guided the Lewis and Clark expedition, not English maps.  The English Settlers were as scared and superstitious about venturing into the interior of the continent as were the men in this story were fearful of sailing the seven seas.

"Since reading Gerald Horne's earth-shattering book, ""The Counter-Revolution of 1776,"" I have been on a vain search to find respectable (i.e., non-pandering) historical treatises that would overthrow his thesis: that the so-called ""American Revolution"" was in fact little more than a slyly-staged counter-revolution against the threat that the ""patriots"" might be forced to end slavery.So far, I have come up empty: Every respectable piece on the history of the period, including this book, simply further confirms Horne's mind-bending thesis. Here Alan Taylor, another award-winning American historian, in this book, ""The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia 1772-1832,"" confirms virtually everything Horne sets forth in his thesis -- and then raises him a chip or two by giving us the context with all of the missing moral nuances.There are two parts to the book: The story in the foreground about how the slaves in Virginia reacted to the shameful contradictions of the impending calls for ""freedom and liberty"" by the white slaveholding founding fathers (the Virginia quartet in particular of Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Mason), as the American Revolution approached.The slaves simply gathered as many of their family members as they could in canoes and rowed, in the middle of the night, out to the British ships anchored in Norfolk harbor and joined the Revolution and fought for the other side. Prominent among them were some 800 or so slaves from Jefferson, Paine, Madison and Washington's own plantations. Others grabbed their children and as a family jumped into the sea, committing mutual suicide rather than enduring the horrors of slavery for the rest of their lives.And then there is a second story, the one in the background, the subtext of events: the psychological state of mind -- the thinking, planning and plotting of Jefferson, Madison, Randolph, Paine, Washington, and others -- as they went about the business of building a libertarian case for a revolution against the British, while at the same time very self-consciously and violently repressing every instinct of liberty and freedom in their own black slaves.On page 83, for instance, Randolph summarizes the situation about as aptly as it can be done, when he says that ""slavery is a social system that distorts the morality and justice of otherwise decent men ... It could not have endured without the support of attentive husbands, good fathers, pious churchgoers, and conscientious citizens ... It holds good men as well as slaves as its captives.""It is thus inescapable that the Virginia patriots proceeded along this morally bankrupt path willingly and with a mixture of greed, hubris, deep fear both of their slaves and their God, yet with self-serving moral blindness and laxity towards a goal they claimed was about freedom and liberty.These men knew from the start that there simply was no way of squaring the circle between the barbaric practice of profiting by treating human beings as property, and also maintaining a self-respecting humanity for themselves. Yet they proceeded to prove themselves world-class hypocrites, while discrediting their humanity for all times.From these two stories, juxtaposed against the wider geopolitical and moral context of the revolution, the reader gets two stark pictures, the moral implications of which can no longer either be denied or defended, for it is not just unmistakable but also impossible to misread: In order to maintain slavery in a steady state, living morally blind and contradictory lives, there is no other way to put it except to say that our founding fathers had to be ""much diminished moral human beings."" And thus in the end, history too must ultimately judge them, as men of their own times judged them, as moral ingrates: moral villains instead of heroes -- men corrupted by greed for profits, hubris, racial prejudice and a lack of any sense of moral decency or accountability.In short, this book clears out all of the moral underbrush and leaves our founding fathers exposed, naked, out in a fully contextualized moral clearing. Unlike many other historians, who rationalize and make excuses for them (as Professor Roger Wilkins did below for instance), in both parts of this book, the author leaves the primary architects of the American Revolution, hanging in the wind, to sink or swim based only on the degree of their own moral culpability.He allows them no escape routes as he nails all of the facts down securely, giving us not just the facts -- as cold-blooded as they often are -- but also leaves nothing to chance by giving us their context with associated nuances too. In doing so, he lays the facts out end-to-end, without commentary or sentimental editorializing, allowing them to fall where they may, so that the reader can connect the dots and determine for himself, once and for all, whether the Virginia quartet were indeed heroes or villains.In this regard, I am repeatedly reminded of a similar book called ""Jefferson's Pillow,"" by the nephew of Civil Rights leader Roy Wilkins. In it, Professor Roger Wilkins tried vainly to square the same moral circle of contradictions between the immorality of slavery and the false claims the American patriots made -- that they were fighting for freedom and liberty against a colonial tyranny.The best argument Professor Wilkins could proffer in the end to support his case was the old familiar cliched trope that ""they were simply men of their times?"" The irony that at the time he wrote the book, Dr. Wilkins was himself a Professor of Political science at ""George Mason"" University, did not escape me.But to this author's credit, that old dog ""they were men of their times,"" will no longer hunt. Alan Taylor made the buck stop with this book: He never used that excuse here. For here the moral context of the times is laid bare for all to see. And the American patriots are condemned, not only by their own acts, but also by the commentary of very men of their times, men like them, who also had once been engaged in the degenerate business of buying and selling humans and then sitting back and living off the profits of their slaves' free labor.Moreover, all three of the major contending powers, France, England and Spain had freed their slaves and had agitated for ending the transatlantic slave trade. And while it is true that they were greatly urged along in these pursuits by the slave revolts that lit up the Caribbean, their hearts as well as their policies consistently leaned in the direction of freedom for everybody: If freedom was good for the white man, they all argued, then it was also good for their slaves too.Not so for the American Revolutionaries, as they consistently argued that even freed black men in America -- including those who had fought for the revolution on the side of the patriots, no less -- had no secure place of freedom in revolutionary America.In fact it was the French revolution that sparked the revolt in Haiti that would bring both France and Britain to their knees. And while Jefferson was busy fighting a coalition of French, Spanish and Indians on his western and southern borders, he nevertheless saw the slaves' revolution for freedom in Haiti as the much greater threat. So much so that he viewed his own slaves as ""internal enemies,"" possessing the potential of exploding into revolt against the planters at any minute.As a result, Jefferson, among many other things he did to advance the causes of maintaining the slave system in place, also reversed the policy towards freedom in Haiti of the previous administration. Whereas John Adams had assisted the Haitian slaves' fight for freedom (as much as a way of undermining French efforts in the hemisphere, as to support the causes of freedom there), Jefferson, on the other hand, reversed Adam's course and did just the opposite, lending support to the very enemy he was busy fighting on his southern and western borders?Equally unconscionable, even while the British were giving citizenship, full pay and freedom to all slaves who would come over to their side and fight against the American Revolution, (as later was to happen in the Civil War), only when they were losing badly did the Americans allow freedmen and slaves to be armed to fight.And while some 500 slaves would be granted their freedom as a result of fighting for the American side, about 8000 who fought for Britain, began new lives as respected citizens in both Canada and Britain after the war. Some even wrote letters back to their old masters, telling them that they were doing much better in Canada than even their masters were doing back on the plantations in Virginia.But for the blacks who had won their freedom by having fought for the patriot cause and were on the winning side, a free black man living in Virginia was almost as bad off as were Virginia slaves. The Virginia quartet made it clear that freed black men were a greater threat to the peace than the slaves were themselves. In fact, Jefferson argued at the time, (as Lincoln would do too during the Civil War), that all blacks, both slave and free, should be shipped off to another country.However, this did not prevent Jefferson or other slaveholders from producing an annual crop of mulatto babies by raping their female slaves. Six such mulattoes acted as house servants in Jefferson's mansion. They were often mistaken by visitors as family members. And if recent DNA tests can be trusted, the chances are good that they were.To his credit, this author does not lean in either direction -- towards our founding fathers being either heroes or villains -- but allows the facts to speak for themselves. And when they speak, they roar like a 400-year old cold wind, howling against the deaf conscience of men claiming to be seeking freedom from British tyranny, but who in fact, only sought to continue the comforts that the barbarous and brutal system of slavery had provided for them.If the American patriots were indeed ""men of their times"" as Professor Wilkins claimed they were, then the ""contradictions of those times,"" hit our founding fathers right between the eyes like a moral lightening bolt, leaving them scorched and nowhere to hide. There was no moral cover or shelter to be found between their professed rhetoric about liberty and freedom, and their everyday barbarous practices of slavery.The case against the American patriot has never been better put than the eloquent speech made by Frederick Douglass on July 4, 1852 in Rochester New York, where he ends his speech with the following flourish: ""Your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings — with all your religious parade and solemnity— are, to him (the slave), mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety and hypocrisy, a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the Earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States, at this very hour.""I would say to Professor Wilkins, that Douglass himself too was a man of those times, was he not?Neither the comfortable shelter of historical lies about American exclusivity; nor the shelter of high and mighty but empty rhetoric about cherished principles of liberty and democracy, can continue to plug the holes in the moral dike. Our founding fathers are not heroes at all, but just as Lord Dunmore, another man of those times, put it on page 21: The American patriots were just ""shameless, canting hypocrites who preached liberty while practicing slavery.""This book proves that they were barbaric corrupt racist villains, and little more, period.

"I received this book free in exchange for an honest review.My honest review is that this is a sophomoric attempt to push the Libertarian point of view without actually acknowledging it – that is, by not putting both feet in the Libertarian camp.The author falls just short of not believing in government at all, and refers to himself as an anarchist.He sees “free trade” as the answer to all of our ills. And although he does not fall on his sword for Trump, he could find only two negatives, versus finding 10 positives for him. Most of the positives fall in the emotional right-leaning ideological political lane.His faith in Trump is based on wholly on Trump's success in business.  Trump, like Sarah Palin, gets a “pass” on being intellectually prepared to serve as the leader of the Western world?That Trump is a mildly unbalanced megalomaniac also does not seem to bother the author at all. His case for Trump, mirror’s Trump’s own case for Trump.The author’s analysis of the problems that beset the U.S. are nave, shallow and rightward leaning ideologically.I failed to see a purpose for the book, except to subtly push both the Libertarian point of view, and to push Trump as a fresh face.

"This book, ""The Course of Empire,"" winner of the national book award, is a novel -- a ""factional"" account as it were of the struggles for empire during seventeenth and eighteenth century North America. The narrative focuses sharply on the two hundred and eighty four ""missing years"" between ""first landing"" in 1492, and the American revolution in 1776, a period that, except for the French-Indian War, and the revolution itself, gets scant attention in American History books.The author's purpose here thus has been to use the geography of the land as his canvass for painting a picture that explains what actually happened on the continent during those three missing centuries. How, for instance it had occurred that by utilizing different approaches, each of the competing powers -- Spain, France, England, and to a lesser extent, the Netherlands -- came dangerously close to succeeding at achieving empire and becoming the dominant power over the North American continent. It is a richly textured, sometimes very ugly story that must be told.What we now know for sure is that in the 284 years between Columbus' voyages and the American Revolution, bands of illiterate white men, fresh out of the Dark Ages, were sent to the ""New World,"" most as loosely defined contract employees of European kingdoms, or as indentured servants, which at the time was a euphemism for ""slave."" They came, following the model of conquest set by Spain, in search of gold and other booty, and to eventually establish a North American Empire for the Kingdoms of Europe.These bands of men, mostly seafaring pirates, privateers and buccaneers, and in the case of England, men and women indentured servants, did indeed converge on the continent from different directions: The Spanish came from the south and were bent on repeating the successes of Mexico and Peru in North America. The English, Swedes and Dutch followed Columbus' route across the Atlantic and landed on the Eastern seaboard.The Dutch, a tiny country, punching well above its weight, came only to get rich by selling beaver furs and then taking the money back to Amsterdam, which at the time was the most prosperous city in the world. And except for a challenge from the English that would eventually ejected them from the continent in 1684, the Dutch came very near becoming the only empire in North America.The Swedes on the other hand, came to settle on the land, live peaceably with the Indians, and farm. However, they too were ejected from New Jersey first by the Dutch and then later by England.And then finally we get to the French, which, for reasons that became obvious as the narrative progressed, was covered in much greater detail.France and England were the main protagonists of this narrative. They both came exclusively to establish an Empire on the North American continent for their respective Kings. But as will be discussed in more details later, the two countries went about the process of empire-building in entirely different ways.It is how these differences got played out that make up the main story of the book. It is a story about how in the end none of these competitors were able to achieve their aims. Somehow each of them found ways to snatch defeat from the jaws of certain victory, squandering away their opportunity.The climax of the book is the surprise that history has presented to us about what the mutual failures of the competing powers meant: History records that instead of achieving empire for one of the competing powers, their defeats merely left the spoils to be picked up by a loose collection of thirteen ""English colonial city-states,"" made up of a ragtag bunch of English settlers -- privateers, seafaring buccaneers, religious fanatics, and indentured servants, all fleeing the hardships and oppression of the European Feudal Dark Ages. These British subjects would inherit the wind, the waters, the land, and in the end, the spoils of the competition taking place above their heads, a competition that would allow them to go on to become an empire themselves -- even before they had become a nation!As the author's story unfolds, we learn that what separated the European competitors from each other was not heroics on the many battle fields taking place during the period (they were uniformly horrible soldiers), or advantages in technological prowess (iron muskets were no match for the long bow until deep into the 19th century), or even superior European civilization (they were just beginning to wake up from the horrors of feudal Europe). But somewhat surprisingly, we learn that it was colossal ignorance of geography, bad judgment, bad timing, bad decision-making, badly composed and badly played-out geopolitical strategies, internal bickering, geopolitical posturing, hubris and colonial overreach, calculated duplicity in negotiations and in business practices, and racism against the Indians (even when their lives depended on tribal assistance for  survival) -- that separated them and got in the way of achieving empire.But equally, the main focus of this book, is also about the astonishing degree of ignorance of the land generally, and the interior of the North American continent in particular. It thus is not an exaggeration to say that, to an embarrassing extent, this book highlights the role ignorance of the geography of the interior of the North American continent played for 250 years in framing the continent for empire-building.In the end, this is a dense, rich, often ugly, but always honest and entertaining narrative picture of how blind greed and royal hubris intersected with duplicity and colossal ignorance about the land, to undermine the attempts by competing European powers to forge a North American empire.The crescendo of the book occurs in the aftermath of the French-Indian War, with the Louisiana Purchase, where the century of mutual geographic ignorance and duplicity reached a climax that conspired to checkmate the two rival powers, France and England, leaving the backdoor open for the thirteen colonial city states to pick up the pieces and ""back into"" empire by fiat.Other things being equal, the author makes clear that what served as a dense counterpoint to the infinite beauty and grandeur of the land, was this almost indescribably complex matrix of hubris and instability of European leaders, their inability to plan and execute sound geopolitical strategies an ocean away, their relationships with Indian nations, lack of support from the home office, the French-Indian War (and the role Indians and African slaves played as proxies in it), as well as their skill in competing in the fur trade. It was these and much more that served as the backdrop that set the parameters for empire in North America.In passing, it must also be said that serendipity played its role too. As but one example, a reader will be hard-pressed to find anywhere in American history books, the fact that a mini Ice Age was in progress during the last half of the seventeenth century, and that it was this climate change more than anything else that made trade in furs and other materials for European clothing so much more valuable than gold. During this cold and dark period of nearly 300 years, the world economy (like would later be true of tobacco, sugar cane and then slavery and cotton), turned on the axis of the North American fur trade, that is to say it turned on beaver and otter pelts.Likewise, the wars in Europe coupled with the slave revolts raging across the Caribbean, especially the war in Haiti, played a decisive role by sapping the energy and strength of both Britain and France, permanently weakening them in their quest for empire.The slave revolts in particular, were responsible for the embarrassing collapse of Napoleon's army (as well as the 50,000 British troops that came to rescue it). By its end, both the British and the French economies were on the brink of collapse. But no doubt the greater damage was done to France, which had its own revolution going on back home.One thing the reader will discover with France's lost of place and geopolitical status after the defeat in Haiti, is that American history has minimized the role France played in establishing a North American empire. Perhaps one reason that this is so is because of the complex maneuvers taken by the French King to reassert French dominance in the aftermath of France's fall from grace, which only opened the gates for colonial America to become an empire itself.What at the time must have seemed like either a supremely clever or a colossally stupid way out his difficulties, was Louis XIV's strategy of first ""quick deeding"" his North American possessions to Spain for temporary safekeeping. And then, within twenty days, selling them all to colonial America for 23 million dollars?!Among other things, the crafty French King knew his sale of the Louisiana territories would not only temporarily thrust the little weak set of colonial city states onto the geopolitical stage as a sworn rival of England, but as a bonus, it would also make them a permanent geopolitical thorn in England's side, hopefully paying dividends to France well into the future. If the strategy had succeeded, the French King believed it would serve to slow down England's designs for Empire, allowing France the time and space to fully recovered from its debacle in Haiti. After which, dispatching of both Spain and England's colonial irritant, would have been a routine matter for restored French power.But as reality would have its say in the matter, things got played out quite differently, and the wish that had propelled the French King to sell Louisiana turned out to be little more than a royal ""wet dream."" For the Americans and the British did indeed become enemies as he had predicted. But despite this, it did not prevent them from forming ad hoc military and trade alliances against France.It was these temporary alliances designed specifically to stop France's attempt to reassert its power on the North American continent that proved to be France's Achille's heel. One worked especially well against France's century long monopoly of the Western fur trade, as the Hudson Bay Company was brought in to stalk the French fur trade all across Canada as well as across the western colonial territories, greatly interrupting the hard currency being sent back to Paris, and stalling French attempts to reassert its dreams of achieving a North America empire.But there is another more important historical twist to this saga. When France sold Louisiana to America, no one knew exactly where the northern and western boundaries of the ""Louisiana Territories"" actually were? Unbelievably, for fully 250 years -- until after the American Revolution -- when, Jefferson secretly (and deviously) sent his two military spies Lewis and Clark to investigate and find ways to finesse the border issue, the American colonial settlers, despite lush tales of the heroics of a handful of intrepid frontiersmen, like Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett, were in fact deathly fearful of exploring the western territories. They were deterred as much by myths as by hostile Indians, who not only were seeking to protect their hunting grounds, but also had become aware that being close to white men meant a mysterious certain death to Indians.But providence would come to the rescue of the weak wayward but crafty little set of colonies. In perhaps the most stunningly brilliant stroke of political genius ever executed -- certainly the most astute move during the entire colonial era -- Jefferson took full advantage of the general ignorance of the geography of the North American continent, by sending two military spies, Lewis and Clark, to ""map-out"" the Louisiana territory so that the boundaries Jefferson would later use at the negotiating table, would present the two main protagonists, Britain and France, with little more than a carefully ""pre-cooked"" geographic and a geopolitical fait accompli.Since neither power was in a position to challenge Jefferson's unilaterally determined border designations; and since both, for their own reasons, were content with America being at the center of the North American empire, rather than their rival, the negotiations to settle disputes over the borders that would double the size of America, was a ""no lose situation"" for the colonies, one that at the same time checkmated the main competitors for empire on the continent.Thus, Jefferson's unilateral boundary designations for the Louisiana territory, sealed the deal for America as the unchallenged inheritor of North American empire.The French King's strategy had not only failed but had back-fired and rebounded to the benefit of a single geopolitical player: the colonial settlers.In one stroke of the pen, the King of France had catapulted a disorganized bunch of colonial city-states to the very top of the North American empire-building pyramid, thus creating by fiat, a North American empire that no one had expected, and that the colonies, not yet even a nation, could not have acquired in any other way.As a footnote, to the French King's maneuvering, there is a back story to the successful American coup that is worth telling. It is told as chapter III in the book, and is a mini geopolitical saga of how the French, after having a tremendous head start in the race for empire in North America, somehow managed in the end to lose it. It goes somewhat as follows:In the late 17th Century, the French settlers, not having a racist instinct in their bodies, came to North America under tight instructions from Louis XIV to bond by any means necessary with Western Indian nations. Unlike English settlers, they intermarried with them, establish religious missions in their towns and camps, preached the gospel of equality, brotherhood and racial intermarriage, and made enduring alliances with Indian nations -- all in an effort to harness and cultivate the invaluable knowledge the tribes had of the geography of the interior of the continent.Until then, the Holy Grail of all explorers was finding ""the water route"" connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean? For a century, the French were the only ones who knew that no such route existed. And as a result, a full century before other European nations understood the ""Northwest mystery,"" France had, with considerable Indian help, ""mapped-out"" the area well enough to parlay its relationship with western Indian nations into almost complete control of the lucrative fur trade.From Quebec to New Orleans, Frenchmen became the key agents and continental intermediaries for the fur trade. Their alliances with Western Indians gave France control of the indispensable interior waterways, a system that ran from the Great Lakes, to the Mississippi, from the Ohio territory, to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, and even as far west as the Missouri and Columbia rivers. This monopoly over the knowledge of the Western territories, alliances with Western tribes, and control over the interior waterways, constituted a formidable comparative advantage in the fur trade for France in its quest for Empire.However, this advantage would be quickly squandered through royal hubris and corruption back in Paris as well as in graft and corruption in the fur trade in North America itself. Plus, it did not help that unlike Britain, France had a difficult time recruiting Frenchmen to settle in the New World. The result was that throughout the period, when France was poised for empire, it suffered a population deficit, which made it increasingly dependent on their Indian friends for the fur trade, and eventually on Indians and slaves, to fight their wars on the continent as French proxies.The British, on the other hand, were profoundly racist and followed the Spanish model of pursuing a random search for gold. They chose to see Indian nations as little more than savages, and kept them at arms length -- except, that is, when they needed them to kill the animals that fueled the fur trade, farm their lands, to help fight wars against France or Spain, or to use Indian women as sex slaves to satisfy their sexual needs.This tableau happened so often during the ""missing years"" of exploration that to have included it as part of canonical American history would have been an embarrassment to the racially inspired narrative of white superiority, which included moral superiority as one of its chief components.But beyond this, history has recorded that the English strategy failed utterly as is evidenced by half a dozen or so failed attempts at settlement, where in each case, Indian tribes were repeatedly called upon to bail the the English settlers out. Eventually they did begin to learn how to take advantage of what the Indians taught them -- such as how to grow and cultivate a plant Indians had discovered, tobacco. Tobacco would become the crop that would eventually make English settlement in the New World a sustainable enterprise.But the English settlers were lazy and morally incorrigible: They learned the art of how to ""trick,"" ""game"" and ""exploit misunderstandings"" with the Indians, and did it to a fault. One such misunderstanding is emblematic of the period and proved decisive for the English aim of acquiring Indian lands.Indians, having evolved their economies along what today would be called a socialist model, generally had only one understanding of land ownership: as a shared tribal enterprise and as a way of binding allies together as extended tribal members.In the face of tribes being decimated by European diseases against which they had no immunity, finding new tribal members to ""fill-in"" for losses due to deaths, was an urgent existential matter for competing Indian nations. Most tribes were anxious to increase their tribal numbers by any means necessary, including by signing contracts with white settlers, who would then not only become extended tribal members, but could also help them get tradable goods, fight off enemy tribes and share the burden of otherwise sustaining tribal interests and survival.Thus, according to Indian tradition and understanding, signing a land deed was simply a way of forming an alliance, an alliance in which the signatories effectively became extended tribal members. Indians understood a land deal to mean that its signatories had entered into a tribal bond of mutual and shared defense, into an arrangement in which everything was shared among allies -- such things as hunting grounds, the fruits of the hunts, the giving of and sharing of presents, living together, going on the war path together, and even intermarrying.But since the English were much more racist than the French, they were having none of this extended tribalism nonsense. Instead, they purposefully misinterpreted Indian understandings to suit their own needs to acquire their version of gold: more and more Indian lands. Thus, whenever it suited them, the English ""gamed"" the Indian version of contractual understandings, and for years tricked and swindled land from them in unsavory and unconscionable schemes.Bogus contracts were sold back in London, causing an avalanche of Englishmen, Irish, and Scots fleeing the hardships and harsh conditions of England to take a chance on buying land and establishing a homestead in the New World. As the Indians died in huge numbers from the diseases acquired from Europeans, the rush of English settlers to fill the vacuum, gave England a comparative advantage in population, in settling new arrivals, who upon arrival often took over whole Indian camps and farms.Population increase would soon become colonial America's most potent secret weapon. Add to this the fact that Indians were uniformly reviled by the English, and that, as early as 1712, they were being referred to collectively as savages and as ""red n*ggers,"" and one can see why the English Settlers had a difficult time with Indians.And although it is true that the English settlers did occasionally engage in alliances with Indians, with the powerful Iroquois in the New England area in particular, it was almost always on English, rather than on Indian terms. As a result, English-Indian alliances tended to be extremely fragile and almost always temporary, based on expediency, and invariably crowned with mutual suspicions.Yet, despite these handicaps, the English proved to be better businessmen than their most fierce competitor, France. And thus what they lacked in racial tolerance and social graces, they made up for in business savvy and in competitive business practices. From the very beginning and throughout the two hundred years of competition with the French, England consistently produced and sold better quality goods more cheaply, on a more timely basis, and often used these advantages to strip away tribes from their alliance with France.But the English had some of the same deficiencies that other competing European powers had: The British treasury was in free-fall. They thus got minimum help from London; they too were heavily engaged in European Wars, and the slaves in their colonies were rebelling all across the Caribbean. In addition, they were locked into the narrow strip of land on the Atlantic sea coast. With the colonies serving as proxies for exploration of the interior, English exploration was literally limited to the fears held by the colonists, who despite the exploits of a handful like Jim Bowie, David Crockett and Lewis and Clark, were scared to death to venture out onto the Western frontier and into the interior of the continent.

"This is the story told by the author, Kenneth C. Bucchi, a ""supposed"" veteran of the CIA Drug Wars.As he tells it, during the time he was being recruited out of college to serve in the CIA, Bucchi apparently made an ""off-the-cuff"" remark about a ""pseudo Miranda plan"" that got CIA Director Bill Casey's attention. Casey later asked Bucchi to brief him on his idea.As the the idea was explained to Casey, all the stakeholders to the international cocaine trade were to be assembled in Switzerland and presented with what essentially amounted to a CIA fait accompli, in which they would be forced to agree to a new mode of operating the drug trade, one intended to stabilize and regularize it. Indirectly, the CIA would maintain exclusive control and oversight over the trade by allowing the two major drug cartels to operate as an international monopoly. In exchange for relinquishing control, they would enjoy a suite of CIA designated privileges.As it is explained on page 27, the agreement that was finally struck between the CIA and the two dominant drug cartels -- the Cali and the Medellin cartels -- empowered the CIA to destroy half of their cocaine stocks, while at the same time completely destroying all of the stocks, the processing plants and distribution networks of the smaller competing cartels. This would thus leave a clear open field monopoly to Cali and Medellin -- that is, to Pablo Escobar and Fabio Ochoa.Escobar and Ochoa acquiesced to this arrangement in exchange for never being threatened with arrest, prosecution or extradition, and in exchange for the CIA purchasing the remaining 50% of their existing cocaine stocks. Additionally, the CIA would also guarantee them unrestricted access to the lucrative U.S. inner city cocaine market, including escorting the cartel's narcotic-carrying aircraft over protected U.S. air routes and territory allowing them to land onto protected airstrips in Arkansas, Texas and other southern and Western states unmolested.The bulk of the story is what I have termed a ""pseudo novella of CIA disinformation"" -- mostly a tale about the romantic ""derring-dos"" of a half dozen carefully-selected multi-racial and multi-gendered CIA recruits, who, like Bucchi himself, were earmarked to make the ""pseudo Miranda plan"" happen.Their story follows the well-worn (and tiring) story of CIA agent exploits -- of plane crashes, shootouts, bombs breaking up jungle drug labs, expelling tons of pure cocaine from the cargo bay of airplanes, and otherwise getting caught in cliff-hanging situations that all but a couple of ""reality-style CIA heroes"" would escape.Does the story make any sense?Given what I know about the potential for the international economy to be destabilized by the global drug trade, it does not surprise me at all that the USG, through its intelligence agencies, would get involved in trying to manage and better regulate the drug trade. The need to do so is rather transparent: to ensure that the world economy will not de-stabilized by a handful of resourceful Third World criminals. However, knowing that this could happen, certainly does not justify a CIA take-over of the drug trade? Nor, would it necessarily be any better for the world economy if First World criminals instead of the Third World criminals were to take over the trade.And anyone who fails to see the logic of the necessity to regulate the global drug trade -- due primarily to the insane sums of money that flood the global economy -- need to first remember Miami during the 1980s, and then read ""The Underground Empire."" There, the reader will see how, just from the enormous sums of cash resulting from the sell of marijuana, a handful of criminals came very close to destabilizing the world economy in the 1970s. It is frightening to try to imagine how much larger that potential would be today in the marijuana, cocaine, heroine and amphetamines drug environment?That said however, I have serious doubts believing that this ""fictionalized"" account of a CIA takeover of the international drug trade happened in exactly the romantically scripted way that this author's formulaic narrative has described it here -- indeed if it happened at all? One reason for doubt is that it follows to the letter the well-worn script of CIA disinformation: It is a romantic heroe's tale of derring-do, in which the inessential facts could easily be true. However, in all such scripts, there is never a way to verify or validate any of the ""essential facts"" or to connect the dots between them, because invariably they are classified top secret, and thus remain shielded behind the U.S. national security screen.Another important reason I doubt this narrative is true is because the truth in the drug world is stranger than fiction: there are enough true ""non-fictionalized"" exceptions to this disinformation narrative that have leaked out and embarrassed U.S. administrations, that perhaps this ""soapy"" variation is needed to ""cover"" and discredit these certifiably true versions of CIA and USG involvement in the drug trade? And here I mean in particular the exposes revealed by Barry Seal, Dr. JD Brown, Eugene Hasenfus, Terry Reed, Gary Webb ... and the list goes on.U.S. government involvement in the global drug trade is much too serious an issue to be turned into a cheap CIA Disinformation movie script. Clearly this manuscript was ""cleared"" if not written entirely by Langley's disinformation writer's staff.Altogether this book is a sophomoric attempt to tell us a sanitized story that implies that although the USG is indeed interested in controlling the global drug trade, it has absolutely no interest in making use of the power and money that controling the drug trade implies? This story thus suggests that U.S. politicians are more chaste than Caesar's wife -- that they can get in bed with the Cali and Medellin godfathers, the rabid dogs of the drug universe, and not become rabid dogs themselves?But the truth that has seeped out from behind the national security screen -- in the list mentioned above -- tells quite another story. The stories these exposes tell is about how the power and money of the drug trade have infected, penetrated, and deeply corrupted the American political class as well as the American body politic. What we see in Mena, Arkansas, Iran-Contra and Miami, are no different than what we would expect to find in any Banana Republic.Thus, this sophomoric attempt to deflect us from the underlying truth revealed in those exposes, in my view has failed. Because, anyone who remembers Miami during the 1980s -- when every dollar that passed through a bank teller's window had traces of cocaine on it; or that illicit but legal banks laundering drug money sprung up like mushrooms -- cannot deny that America is as corruption-prone as any other nation.This book thus does us a disservice by not allowing us to confront the truth about the deep corruption of our own politicians. And in doing so, it ensures that we too will just remain an out-sized Banana Republic, pretending to be a respectable democracy. When the unalloyed truth is, that since 22 November 1963, we have been run by a ""shadow government"" hidden behind the screen -- of the very national security apparatus responsible for this disinformation tract that is posing here as a true history of America's participation in the drug trade. What a pity.

"While this edited volume of a select collection of articles does not take sides on the controversy about Freud's sexual theories on women, it does add up to a rich and robust historical trail of his intellectual development on the issue. In particular it shows more or less step-by-step how he boot-strapped his way from one proto-theory to another, final ending up with a two-sided theory of the Oedipal complex, with transference.  This narrative is the reviewer's compiled summary of the articles in the book. To him they reveal this development as having emerged somewhat in the follows way:Freud's work in psychoanalysis of course began with his work on hysteria in women, which at the time was thought to be an ailment that was peculiar only to women. His theorizing began by noticing the very real differences in sexual attitudes between men and women: Women invariably adopted a defensive or a passive stance, while men did the opposite: They were aggressive and more open about sex.This coupled with the fact that the problems of hysteria within many of his patients began in the marriage bedroom, where it took on the character of being more a violation than an erotic seduction, led Freud to suspect that these attitudes probably had a pre-sexual root that began in childhood. From there he slowly discovered from his patients, that, more often than not, hysterical symptoms had been triggered as a result of some form of sexual abuse (real or imagined) by a father, or father figure.He thus became more and more convinced that memories from childhood sexual traumas lay in the background of adult hysterias. Locating the precise timing of the triggering event seemed to be of paramount importance. So he drew up a table of childhood stages that would suggest ""what primal experiences"" could lead to ""what hysteria symptoms."" He and his colleagues concluded that such symptoms could have begun as early as the age of four.This prompted him to posit a theory of erogenous zones -- of the mouth, the anus, and the genitals -- areas that were exciting to children at various ages and thus at different stages of their sexual development. Satisfaction and dissatisfaction with these experiences, which incidentally could also have involved auto-erotic pleasures even before they involved passive or seductive experience with adults, undoubtedly made up an important part of the psychic history of his hysteria patients.First he tried to associate particular sexual experiences with particular neuroses. Being especially aware of the role childhood fantasies play in generating hysterical symptoms, Freud no longer assumed that the father -- either through actual or imagined abuse -- was necessarily always the only source of the neurosis. Later this ""train of thought"" would be referred to as his ""seduction hypothesis."" Summarized succinctly, it hypothesized that ""sexualized fantasies"" had been repressed in females -- especially in those representations where the female felt more masculine.Freud would find this hypothesis to be unproductive and he eventually gave it up in favor of the richer framework called the Oedipal complex. The Oedipal complex posited a framework that assumed opposite-sex love and same-sex rivalry in both girls and boys. Its foundation assumption was that both genders have a death-wish for the parent of the same sex, and a corresponding fantasized sexual involvement with the parent of the opposite sex.Since a single source for hysteria could not be found, Freud then focused on correlating ""wish fulfillment"" of repressed thoughts in dreams and fantasies with hysterical symptoms -- always being alert to the possibility that the symptoms might have deeper bisexual meanings, especially in women who tended to strongly repress masculine meanings within their sexual representations.In the case of Dora, the only case publish among his his written research, the puzzle of her hysteria kept getting more complex the deeper it went. The Oedipal elements remained prominent, but they took on ever more complex forms: Her repressed sexual representations now had two objects, both her father and his mistress (recomposed and refocused as a second-order repressed representation of her mother).As Dora fled from analysis, Freud understood why she had to do so: A treatment can relive existing symptoms and stop formation of new ones without actually halting the ""productive powers"" of the neurosis, which in Dora continued through an ever deeper and more subterranean mechanism called transference: Freud, the therapist himself, had become Dora's replaced sexual object -- a recomposed and refocused ""stand-in"" for one of her repressed parental sexual objects. Freud understood that Dora's love had been played out in a transference to him.Since he was not sure of these materials, he did not stop until he had worked them through and tested them in a non-pathological domain. This resulted in a monograph called ""The psychological Pathology of Everyday Life.""Even if in the final analysis a reader is not convinced of Freud's theories about sexuality in women, no one will be able to deny that he and his team engaged in research of the highest order. This sample of articles convinces me that this is indeed the case.

"Although the author marshals some heavy historical artillery to make his case, I believe he nevertheless builds a rather thin case for a revolution occurring in the U.S. -- at least not in the classical way revolutions have occurred in his historical examples.In fact I would argue that if we ""factor-in"" what we know about the uniqueness of the American character and how that character has affected the stability of American society, and the unique course the history of the American nation has taken as a result of it -- especially in the face of severe hardship -- I think one may come to an entirely different set of conclusions about just how imminent another American revolution may really be?While what the author says about the present economic and political conditions, and the instability of U.S. society that they portent, is all devastatingly true. (Which, greatly summarized, is essentially that there is a crisis of disappointing expectations within the American middle class.) It is also true that the difference between the way stability is created and maintained in the U.S. and the way it was created and maintained in societies that led to revolutions in the past, while subtle, is still vast. And this subtlety is way more than just a difference in the political and economic nuances suggested in this book.Thus, I would argue that when the uniqueness of the effects of the American character on the stability of American society is fully taken into account, a revolution of the historical type is much less imminent than the author makes it seem. However, that said, this of course does not preclude the possibility of a revolution ""American style"" being just as imminent as the author's suggestions. But in that case, the constellation of reasons would be vastly different than those given in this book.Thus, to know just how imminent a revolution may be in America, of course revolves around knowing precisely how stability is forged and maintained in U.S.society rather than on textbook historical examples. I believe the author's narrative and the examples he used to support his case, actually subtly skirted this very important issue. And therefore the book, perhaps unwittingly, but subtly, only begs the question of just how societal stability is actually created and maintained within the U.S.Getting right to the crux of this matter, I wished that Mr. Hedges, one of my intellectual heroes, would have argued that stability in U.S. society, unlike in most other Western societies, does not rest on the normal political and economic factors, but instead rests heavily on a peculiar hierarchy of emotional issues that point to an embarrassing hierarchy of U.S. values, values that are as often as not acted out subconsciously, and reflect the peculiarities of the American character that go all the way back to the way the American nation was founded and has evolved ever since.It is no accident that much more of American politics today revolve around emotional issues than around normal political and economic issues. That they do so, more than any other reason, is why the author's formulas derived from historical examples of how revolutions evolve, do not always apply to the U.S.?The American character still rests heavily on the fetish of having been established as an exclusively ""white run nation,"" one that conquered the colored peoples that once owned the land --as well as those that were brought here to  ""service"" it.  And whether or not white America admits and acknowledges it, it is this fetish about race and the collection of related issues, that serve as the cornerstone to the stability of the American nation.As long as the fetish of race remains a wedge issue, you will never get a soldier or policeman to side with revolutionaries against a white run government, no matter how corrupt that government might be, or how economically devastated those soldiers may be. It simply will not happen, period. End of the Hedges paradigm for an American revolution that overthrows a bankrupt immoral, mean-spirited capitalist system.The fetish of race is still a value that dwarfs and trumps all others. It is such a juvenile value, that rightly so, most Americans are embarrassed by it and by the fact that it still remains at the top of the American tribal totem pole. Yet, it is what it is. And for anyone who would like to dismiss this as being an exaggeration of the post-modern American character, with its mulatto president, I challenge you to show me a single decade since 1619, when race was not one of the most, if not the most important issue on the American agenda?All other values are subordinate to this one. Thus, so long as the racist status quo remains essentially undisturbed: all is seen as being right with the American way of life -- no matter what else happens on the political or economic fronts. Another way of saying this is that there is a lot of ""play"" left in the way the other variables that affect the stability of American culture can be arranged and can get played out when the racist status quo remains undisturbed. In fact I would argue that the amount of play is darn near infinite!For instance, so long as race remains in a steady state, whites on all sides of the political spectrum have virtually infinite faith and confidence in the magic of the capitalist free enterprise system. This is so in part because built into the Protestant Ethic of Capitalism, the catechism of American capitalists, is the hint of white supremacy, just enough to send a ""dog whistle"" to anyone of the least bit of the Ayn Rand Libertarian persuasion to know what side of the bread is buttered white. That is why ""the government"" (as if the government is not just We the people"") and not the evils of capitalism is always the target of white America's angst.Here is a guaranteed formula for the next American revolution: Allow equality between the races to break out in such a way that blacks actually can, through their own efforts, pull even with whites. Now that is a guaranteed formula for the next American Revolution. All hell will break loose if that ever happens.All we have today is a situation where the political elite and the ruling classes have discovered that it is equally profitable to them to continue the racist wedge by spreading the ""benign-neglect"" once only reserved for blacks, upwards to the rest of the population all the way up through the middle class. That way they no longer have to help pay for any social services, no schools, no infrastructure, no healthcare, no nothing.They can quietly dismantle the country as they have been doing without fear of a collective negative reaction because there is no such thing in a racially divided America as a ""collective reaction:"" We are a nation split right down the middle into three parts by race: On one side there are the whites. On another side there are those who are ""trying not to be black;"" and then there are the blacks.There is no way this triangle of racism, America's highest value since its inception, will ever become a collective. So the ruling class can relax: The revolution after all, will be televised. It will be a ""reality show"" disseminated via ""social media,"" and Donald Trump with be our next white President, and America will be great again.

"Here, Charles Murray makes a very weak and I think a very tortured ""pseudo-Madisonian"" case, for the need of a Libertarian revolution? Early on he quotes his version of the Jeffersonian mantra: “It is part of our national catechism that government is instituted to protect our unalienable rights, and that when it becomes destructive of those rights, the reason for our allegiance is gone. At that point, revolution is not treason, but the people’s right.""I say he makes a weak pseudo-Madisonian case because in my reading of the Federalist Papers, it was Madison himself, who launched a cleverly engineered coup against states rights that resulted in the establishment of the federal government in the first place? And if that is so, how is it that despite this, Libertarians like Murray, still see Madison as the champion of both states rights and small government? Their position defies common sense? It thus seems to me this is a clear purposeful mis-reading of American history.I doubt very seriously that, to Madison, ""Big Government"" would be the same root of all the nation's evils as it is made out to be here by Murray and his likeminded ideological cohorts? Nor, do I believe that Madison would see FDR's ""New Deal Programs"" as being the generator of all the evils of Big Government, as Murray's Libertarians do? It seems rather self-evident that ""Big Government"" for these guys is just a convenient ideological canard: bad only when it does not serve the conservative and Libertarian causes, and good otherwise?Somehow through the twisted contradictory logic of Murray and his likeminded ideological cohorts (of Denesh D'Sousa, and Thomas Sowell, in particular), FDR's New Deal programs are seen as being responsible for all of America's problems. I think this is true in the eyes of the Libertarians/conservatives only because they see those programs as drawing a bright line between what they see as the ""common good,"" and what they see as the ""so-called job creators;"" between what they imagine to be the ""productive citizens"" and those they see as ""waiting for a handout;"" between the ""smart and creative people,"" and what they see as the ""dumb dull and the uncreative perpetual down-and-outs.""Libertarians, who love Ayn Rand and have no moral problems with Gordon Gecko style greed, believe that no such line is needed because the notion of a ""common good"" is no longer via or needed, and thus should be abandoned altogether despite its clear inclusion in the U.S. Constitution on par with ""providing for the common defense?""The U.S. Constitution and ""authentic"" American History aside, the only meaningful division to Libertarians like Murray is between the ""so-called"" ""job creators"" and those who ""wait for the job creators to feed them;"" or failing that, those who wait for the government to provide them ""meals on wheels?""Do we really need a revolution to reduce the oppression from too many regulations on corporations and too many pages in the tax code? How about a revolution for evading taxes by sheltering them in illegal off shore accounts? How about a revolution against dismantling American factories and jobs, and then shipping them off to Mexico and China? Wouldn't these be better ways to spend our national treasure on a revolution? And if this is a serious revolution, why make it non-violent?Did Mr. Murray miss the fact that the Libertarian revolution has already occurred, and has been won? So, why do the Libertarians like Ron Paul and that ilk keep crying foul? Bush privatized prescription drugs, and now the same drugs cost the American public six to ten times what they cost in Canada? The prisons have been privatized; and now inner city communities have been further decimated by drug infestation and dumbed-down education, in order to keep the pipeline of criminals open thereby ensuring that the beds in the pre-planned prisons of the prison-industrial complex, will be filled thus allowing them to remain a ""going concern."" We now also have ""for profit Colleges."" And in less than a decade, they alone have succeeded in making student loan debt second only to home mortgage debit? When the firewall between regular and international banks went unregulated, by tearing down Glass-stegall, we got the sub-prime loan crisis, and the world lost 60 trillion dollars in wealth?Every time an American institution is privatized, or deregulated, or what is the same, handed over to the ""so-called job creators, a handful of greedy amoral people get rich, and America's problems and those of the rest of the world multiply and continue to expand to the point of festering?I say to Mr. Murray, who has correctly abandoned some of his previous ""hard-hearted"" conclusions promoted and then defended in his previous books (i.e., in “Losing Ground”, “The Bell Curve” and ""Coming Apart.”): We don't need another Libertarian Revolution, what we need is a Libertarian Counter-Revolution. Indeed, what we need, more than anything else, is a war on Libertarian greed and mindless profiteering.

"Bliss Broyard, woke up after it was revealed at her father's death, by the infamous ""One Drop Rule,"" that she and her brother Todd, shared with our 45th President, Mr. Barack Obama, the fact that even though they all are of mixed racial lineage, they all still are definitely considered black.Her way of getting over the shock of it all, even though there had been a string of clues trailing her throughout her ""tony"" life in ritzy upscale Connecticut, was to strike out to New Orleans to find out more about why her, writer father, had chosen to remain in the ""racial closet"" throughout his life, ""passing"" for white.What she found along her journey to New Orleans to find her roots makes for interesting reading as well as for a robust experiment in racial self-discovery. In fact, what she discovered (only after she had determined that by the default rule of ""one drop of blood,"" that she was now black), is something any keen observer of American culture will discover at first sight: That American cultural waters are little more than a sea of raging mean-spirited, passive-aggressive white racism; that one cannot live in America without first being a racist -- for racism is not only the air we breathe, but is also the air that defines the norm -- the white people's humanity. It is the swift moving cultural waters that we swim in; and it is the set of cultural rules that all Americans inhale from birth onwards.The first thing that Bliss discovered along her journey is that American culture had ""programmed"" her unconsciously to invest in, defend, and then assist in maintaining a culture of  white supremacy. Without any conscious intervention on the part of her mind, and without ever having had any contact with blacks, she had learned how to judge blacks by the behavior of the worse of ""them."" She had learned to be disgusted with behavior committed by blacks, that when whites routinely engaged in the same behavior, it did not even bother her.Now that she had no choice but to accept that she was no longer white, only then did she become both appalled with, and alarmed by, her own racist behavior. That is to say, that only in a ""new found blackness"" did she begin to recognize that she had been ""programmed"" into being a regular ""dyed-in-the-wool,"" ""garden variety,"" white racist. The only way Bliss saw to undo the damage living as a WASP had done to her, was to ""deprogram"" herself. On pages 99-100 she describes how this process worked:""I developed a method by which I hoped to deprogram myself. First, I would forgive myself, because the only other choice, self-censure, didn't leave any room to correct the problem. I reasoned that given the pervasiveness of racism in America, it's impossible for a person to escape its effect. Of course I was a racist, meaning I made judgments,  valuations, and assumptions about people based on what I perceived their ethnicity to be. After all fitting information into categories is how we make sense of the world. Perhaps if people were less apprehensive about acknowledging their racists thoughts, then they could move on to addressing them.Next I would try to identify which particular stereotype of African Americans had fueled the belief in question: that black men are dangerous, or black students aren't as smart as white ones, or black girls have no ambition. And then in a logical fashion, I would attempt to debunk it: What proof did I have that black men were more dangerous? Well, they are  incarcerated at a higher rate than white men -- but isn't that also due in part to the bias of the justice system, issues of class, and a historical deprivation of opportunity? If all other things were equal, was there evidence that black men would be continuously more prone to reckless behavior than white men?  Hadn't I in fact known white men who were  reckless and black men who were not? And why should the (school bus driver who molested white girls) be made to stand in for all other black men and not, say, for all other people  who drive old sedans? Couldn't I just as easily judged him as yet another inconsiderate old-sedan driver? Once I was satisfied that my belief was unfounded, I would made a  pledge to myself to try to do better the next time.""It was strange to take such a systematic approach to changing the way I thought and  behaved, as if I were making myself the subject of a psychological experiment. And it was hard work. Trying to be constantly vigilant wasn't fun or easy. Sometimes it was difficult to resist the desire to feel superior over another person. Sometimes I got a thrill from thinking something that was ugly and extreme, the way that smelling a terrible smell can be perversely exhilarating. But mostly I didn't feel I had much choice in challenging these thoughts. Along the way my loyalties had shifted without my even realizing it.""It is not only strange, but also sad to have to admit that only as a ""newly minted"" black person, did Bliss become conscious enough of her racist ways, to then her own 12-step program to correct them? I did the same thing to overcome my own sexist ways. Presumably, had Bliss remained ""captured"" in the white racist orbit, it would have been nearly impossible for her to have mustered the ""escape velocity"" needed for the self-introspection required to overcome her racism.Sadly too, this also means that unless whites' cozy arrangement at the top of the racist totem pole is threatened, they are simply too invested in maintaining white racism and white supremacy in a steady state to do anything about it, or about themselves.However, the most interesting part of the book is the history of New Orleans from 1850 onwards. Included in that history is the explanation as to how the Broyards became a mixed-race clan: In a twist of racial irony for the ages, her great grandfather, Henry Broyard, actually married a free woman of color, Pauline Bonee, solely because he loved her. He went on to have four children with her and as a result became the grand patron of the Broyard clan. And here is the irony: Since it was illegal for blacks and whites to marry in New Orleans in 1850, Henry legally changed his race from ""white"" to ""black"" solely because he was in love with a black woman.

"This visual compendium has the virtue of being broad but the disadvantage of not being very deep. Plus, the text is mostly what is accepted as ""settled history,"" never the least bit ""contested history."" So readers must be aware that unlike science, where ""bad science"" is inevitably weeded out and replaced by ""tested or falsified science,"" the same is not true of history.""Bad history"" lives on until another, mostly political consensus, forms that reaches a ""critical mass"" around updated information that is sufficient to overthrow the previous ""bad History."" However, since its criteria are always subjective, and thus equally contested, the diffent between ""good"" and ""bad"" history is always a problematic concern.My concern here was with the fact that so much of ""Western History"" is being contested that thee is a need to speed up the process of updating it. Sadly, even when there is a critical mass among professionals has been reached, historians still drag their feet in updating outdate historical facts.When will mainstream general compendia such as this one make the decision to update its materials, so that at the very least, they keep up with the better AP High School History textbooks?My compliant is not that I did not enjoy this book, or value having highly it as a handy reference guide, just that so much of it needs serious updating. Also, while it is good to have many glossy pictures associated with the periods in question within the text, it would be more useful if they were chosen and inserted only on the basis of relevance -- not just for the sake of filling-in a blank spot?

"Despite what can only be described as sophomoric academic research. The results reported on here had only a single objective in mind: to embarrass, bully and intimidate ""professional black men"" in such a way as to forever corral and keep them on the segregated sexual plantation where they are only available to black women. However, that strategy does not seem to have worked. In fact, arguably, it has had the opposite effect. The best evidence that it is not working is that professional black women as a group have become more and more agitated as they watch the procession of the old segregated sexual preserve -- one that they once commandeered by the default of a racist social order -- give way to a new multi-racial and interracial sexual social order that leaves them out.As one who has done extensive research in this area, and who has had a keen interest in these issues as well as one who has kept up with recent developments on this front, I believe the author's research design suffers several defects.For one, her research design needs interviews of at least three additional groups: (1) non-black women (whites, Latina, and Asians primarily) who are now using their new found more tolerant racial attitudes and feminist ""agency"" to overcome the racist inhibitions in American society against marrying black men; and (2) non-black men who, in statistically significant ways are electing to marry women other than professional black women? And finally, the author needed to administer a third questionnaire to professional black women in order to discover why they are marrying fewer black men, at the same time that they are also ""out marrying"" less than professional black men.On the second of these missing questionnaires, the Pew Research Study on Interracial Marriage and Dating, provides partial answers. And although it was not available at the time this manuscript went to print, it nevertheless reveals that non-black men as a group (not just black men), have the same reticence to not marrying black women: because both groups share a perceived beauty, trustworthiness, and combativeness deficit in black women when compared with ""comparable marriage eligible"" non-black women.Likewise, to get at the second missing questionnaire, in an unpublished 1991 MIT Master's thesis -- simulation research study, I used the results of an Ebony Magazine designed and administered a questionnaire on the respective marriage qualifying criteria black men and women used for marriage selection. These results ""drove"" a computer simulation model designed to reproduce the illegitimacy spike that occurred among black women that first appeared with alarm in the 1985 census data.What the simulation reported is that ""marriage formation"" among blacks was down by nearly 80 percent from just a generation prior. This shocking reduction in black family formation, few seem to have noticed, is not due to ""so many black men being in prison as black women tell us, but was due in large part to the large pool of ineligibles, the residuals left over after both groups apply their marriage rules to the opposite sex within the black race. When black women apply their qualifying rules to black men, fully 51% of all black males are eliminated. But the real shock came when the simulation reported that when black men apply their marriage qualifying rules to black women, a hefty 67% of all black women were disqualified and were found to be ineligible for marriage within the black race too.After running my simulation repeatedly, it was clear that practically no one was left among blacks to ""in marry?""The minimum qualifying criteria were used on both sides: For black women, any black man who had a job, did not use alcohol or drugs, was not in jail, and was religious, qualified. For black men, any black woman who was not obese, did not already have children out of wedlock, and was not be on welfare, also qualified.When these two sets of minimum marriage qualifying rules, were deployed in the computer simulation, its results reported that the pools of ineligibles on both sides, dwarfed the numbers of blacks that qualified for marriage. Put another way, the pool of ""marriage eligibles"" men and women within the black race shrank to such a vanishingly small rate that, as noted above,  black-on-black marriages dropped by nearly 80 percent from the previous generation?And thus, since marriage was virtually ""off the table"" for so many blacks of marriage age, no Sociologist, or Social-Psychologist like the author, could have predicted as my simulation did that the resulting ""reject pools of ineligibles,"" were nevertheless engaging in high risk sex at rates several times higher than that of even black married couples!  Anyone who reviews the statistics of sex in the 1985 census data as I did, will not need a computer simulation to come to the exact same conclusions.The alarming sexual activity of the two pools of ""ineligibles"" is carefully buried in the census statistics.Thus as a result, the simulation reproduced the alarming illegitimacy rate that raised so much concerned during the 1985 census report. It took a computer simulation to put all of the factors together into a mate selection and sex activity matrix that revealed the true source of the problem. The spike in illegitimacy was literally a mere accidental byproduct of unprotected high risk sex between two very large pools of ""marriage ineligibles.""As for the third missing questionnaire, the unintended answer given by the famous actor Yaphet Kotto, on page 89 of this book, probably gets as close to an answer as we are likely to get from this author. When the author asked Mr. Kotto why he married a white woman instead of a black one, he answered that it was because since he was ""a very large man with very dark skin."" As a result, black women would not give him the time of day. He said that he was so often rejected by black women because of his size and his dark skin that he had no choice but to date women who did not see it as a problem. (In this regard, I can personally attest to at least one anecdote, in which one my black female friends asked me if Mr. Kotto was from Nigeria? However, before I could answer, she had already said: ""He looks just like a big old gorilla -- and snickered. I did not see anything funny?).And in this same regard, it was not too many years ago when Howard University, where the author teaches, had its own ""Brown Bag test"" for skin color. Those who failed, severely reduced their chances of being admitted to Howard, and forfeited all possibility of pledging a fraternity or a sorority.The more important point here though is this: In this new race-free sexual social order, it is not so much black professional men who are taking the lead, as it is Latina, Asian and white women, who are using their new changed attitudes towards black men, and their new found feminist ""agency,"" to overcome the racist and sexist rules of American society. It is they who are using both their new attitudes and their new found feminist agency, to embrace black men as sexually attractive marriage partners -- the same as one embraced Mr. Kotto, who, not coincidentally, is now happily married to a white woman, and has two children.One would think that such changes in non-black female racial attitudes and empowerment, would be seen for what they really are: welcomed indicators of racial progress on the sexual and marriage front. However, that is not how this author sees it.Since non-black men have not been returning the favor of using their own changed attitudes and their own ""agency"" to similarly embrace black women as potential marriage partners -- at least not in numbers equal to that of non-black women towards professional black men -- this author has mis-framed the issue of what is really a ""lagging interest in black women by non-black men"" as a problem of too many black men bolting the old race/sex-based plantation and ending up in the beds of too many non-black (i.e. white) women?Clearly my computer simulation, among other things, proved that this is not what is going on here at all.Although the most recent Pew Research Study on Interracial Marriages, does confirm that ""out-marriages"" by professional black men are indeed a full eight times more likely than that of professional black women (not just four times as this book claims). This could not have happened unless women of other races were not becoming both more tolerant of black men, and felt freer in exercising their agency to overcome society's racist resistance to non-black women marrying black men.And, despite the author's attempt to paint a distorted picture otherwise, these women continue to marry professional black men in increasing numbers. The other important point here is just as it is not wholly a decision of black men when they marry black women, the same is true when they marry non-black women. More often than not, it is women, and not men, who are the choosers in both cases.Rather surprisingly, and incongruously, instead of praising America's non-black women for their new racial open-mindedness, the author has instead misdirected the reader's attention from this new important indicator of dramatic racial progress, to one of trying to denigrate and bully black men back into remaining on the old segregated sexual plantation, where their choices are limited only to black women?In other words, this author has turned an asymmetric in ""out-marriage by black men,"" which should be a deep indicator of racial progress, into a negative, by energetically and openly trying to undermine and oppose this ""out-marriage."" And having done so, the author has aligned black women with the most regressive and racially intolerant groups in America. Those groups too argue as this author's carefully ""rigged taxonomy"" on page 88 has depicted black men: as just cardboard cutouts of society's mindless sexual predators? Why would any men want to marry women who would characterize them in such demeaning terms?However, that is not all. Rather incredibly, this author goes these anti-black groups one better. To her not so clever arguments, the author throws in an important additional ""kicker:"" She argues that by marrying outside the race, these black professional men, are also hurting the black family?""In past generations, racist whites used a similar rhetorical canard with a similar stinging lament: What will happen to the children of these interracial marriages, they asked with feigned fake concern?To both fake concerns, I cannot resist ending this review by answering both queries in the following way: There once was a black Harvard Phd, from Kenya, named Barack Obama, who married a white Kansas Phd, named Dr. Stanley Ann Dunham. Together they produced a son, who in 2008 became not only the first and only black president of the USA, but also the first and only US president both of whose parents were doctors.So I say, so much for the argument that interracial marriages hurt the black family, or their children. Indeed, how many black-on-black marriages have produced a U.S. president? Or more to this point, how many black mothers do as Dr. Stanley Ann Dunham did with Barack: get their ten year old sons up at 4am daily to study?And make no mistake about it, there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever, that it was this one white woman, Dr. Stanley Ann Dunham's, parental study regiment, of getting little Barry up at 4am, that had a lot to do with him eventually becoming president of the US.

"This, very much ""after-the-fact book,"" reporting on the criminal tornado called the Bulger brothers crime wave, most reminds me of GW's excursion in a ""standoff presidential helicopter"" surveying the damage of Katrina. Like Bush Jr, these two ""not so intrepid"" reporters did all they could to keep their heads down, and their hands clean in the wake of the murderous knee-deep mire that Jimmy and Billy Bulger's crime waves left across the Boston moral landscape.So they turned this book into a ""stand-off reporter's legal brief,"" a palatable, but clinical back-handed de facto hero story ""in waiting."" It is seemingly a story specifically designed not to make waves or jar the Boston sensibility too much, but one that would curiously preserve the right to make ""Whitey"" a bona fide hero later -- if, that is, it turns out that after his capture, he should ever be set free again. Certainly these authors were hedging their bets that he might indeed be set free again someday?As a result, no one should be surprised that Whitey has endorsed this book; or upset with the fact that these authors interviewed Steve Flemmi's lawyers, the judges, and the spectators on the margins of the courtroom ad nausea, and yet say nothing at all about the dead bodies that are left in Flemmi's and Whitey's wake lining the swamps on the margins of the Boston freeway. These authors thus have proven to be consummate professionals at creating a manuscript that nibbles around the edges but never quite gets to the heart of the Bulger carnage.Thus, perhaps unwittingly, they have succeed in reducing crime reporting to the fine art of knowing when and where to ""pull their punches,"" when and where to interview already tainted ex-FBI agents; when and where to minimize the vast corrupt system in place from which the Bulger brothers simply picked the already ripen low-hanging fruit. Instead of plumbing the depths of Boston's reservoir of corruption, here they are content with ""dotting all of the legal ""eyes"" and ""crossing all of the legal ""tees?"" That way they can then take a more relaxed clinical approach to interrogating and investigating the court records and interviewing the prisoners locked in cages behind bars, instead of digging into how Boston's own corruption led to the corpses strewn along the marshes lining the Boston freeway. Or, indeed how that fine and cultured city created the likes of Whitey and Billy Bulger in the first place?Sadly, it is left as an exercise for the reader to conclude that those bodies are in fact not all just souvenirs from the Whitey Bulger category-five crime wave, but are also grim monuments to Boston's culture of crime and corruption. So, I say that these authors have made a fundamental mistake in producing a clinically clean book that ignores how all those dead bodies got there, yet leaves the backdoor open for the Bulger brothers to one day become de facto heroes. No wonder Whitey wanted this version of his story to become the movie script about  his life.But I believe that these authors have assumed erroneously that the dead cannot speak? This is where they have gone wrong. The dead that now line the marshes along the freeways entering Boston, do indeed speak: I can hear them now. (Listen closely and carefully), they say: ""In Boston, crime pays, so long as it is tribal and so long as it has the prefix ""Whitey"" in its name!"" And anyone who doubts this can just ask our families. Or, better yet, look at the way the whole Boston moral ecosystem is today? Does anyone remember Charles Stuart?But in addition to forgetting the families, and forgetting to look objectively at the way Boston morality really is, these authors also forgot one other thing: The crime scene is not just restricted to the marshes bordering the Boston Harbor freeway. The Bulger brothers crime wave IS the new Boston moral ecosystem. The crime scene is all of Boston. It has affected not just the City Government, the FBI, the city police and highway patrolmen, it has also affected everyone and everything else in Boston too, including these authors. Whether they recognize it or not, their own timidity as reporters is an integral reaction to, and thus an integral part of the Bulger crime wave.This book, soon to be a movie, whose script has already been endorsed by Whitey, is nothing if not a carefully orchestrated social production under the direction of the ethics conducted by Billy and Whitey Bulger. If it were not so, why else would they so carefully tiptoe around every sensitive issue? If it were not so, why else would they not talk about those dead bodies Whitey and Flimmi left lining swamps near the Boston freeways? If it were not so, why would Whitey endorse it? If it were not so, why else would these authors fail to indict the criminal ethos of Boston that both created and allowed the Bulger brothers to thrive, and then run amok?I lived in Brookline, Ma., on Upton Street while doing a post-doc at MIT, during the academic year of 1991. One day, as I exited the subway station going home for lunch, there was a big commotion in the Strip Mall yards away from the subway stop. When I asked what had happened, I was told that a man had been shot dead trying to rob a bank. Then, as I approached my basement apartment two blocks away, I saw yet another set of police lights flashing with the tale-tell yellow ribbons around one of my neighbors' house. Again, I asked what had happened, but this time no one would answer. However, once inside my apartment, I flipped on the TV and the news was reporting that a Harvard Law Professor had been raped and knifed to death two doors from my apartment? And although I know that these were just two random events, things like that do have a way of leaving a permanent and jaundiced imprint on the mind.But even before this eventful day of two violent but random crimes, the only two I have witnessed in my life, so near my upper middle-class neighborhood, I had sensed and had already concluded that something was wrong with the Boston DNA. Everyone had a scowl on their faces. Everyone was mad about something, and whatever it was, I was not in on it? There appeared to be an evil vapor in the air. It undoubtedly must have been a part of the mystique of the Bulger ghost that still haunts the ethos of Boston today. And as beautiful and as cultured as Boston is, there is no city in America that scares me more. It is more tense, more racist, more unscaled, and yet, on a per capita basis, as violently criminal as any city in the US. I think twice every time I have to go there.It thus struck me as odd that even before they were implicitly threatened by those acting on Whitey Bulger's behalf, these authors had already adopted a ""prevent defense"" for writing this book, one designed more to respect the ""criminal ways of Boston"" than to get at the unalloyed underlying truth about the nature of crime in that very much troubled city. And who, in the last three decades have been most responsible for shaping those criminal ways? None more so than the infamous Bulger brothers.There is an evil spell hanging in the air in Boston, and here these authors, wittingly or not, rather than exposing it, have deferred to it. By deferring to the ""ways of Boston immorality and crime,"" and giving the Bulger brothers too much undeserved respect, and too much moral running room -- by giving us here a sanitized version of the Bulger crimes -- they have tipped the scales and their hats in the direction of the existing Boston criminal ecosystem. They too have proven through and through that they are true Bostonians; that they too have been affected by, if not totally socially-adjusted by, Whitey and Billy Bulger's criminal ways of life; they too have drank the macho Southie tribalistic Kool Aid that says that Irish tribalism is more important than morality.Had I not read and reviewed several other books about both the ""high"" and ""low"" criminal careers of the Bulger brothers, books that now allow me to properly assess the devastation of their respective crime waves, I too might have been inclined to give this book a pass and say of it, and of these authors, the same as what other reviewers have said: ""a job well done.""However, after having read and reviewed several other books about this Boston criminal tornado, and after my own negative experiences in Boston, it is easy to see that these authors ducked, and took the easy way out. They merely tasted the slurry with the cream on top, not the bitterness beneath, wrought by the Bulger criminal tornado. They are thus wrong in their conclusions: The Bulgier brothers did not just change the FBI and Boston law enforcement departments forever, they also changed the moral ecosystem of Boston forever too.The movie based on this book will make a lot of money, because I am going to go see it myself. But if it too genuflects and bends in the direction of the two ""maestros of Boston crime,"" as this book does, the moral ethics of James ""Whitey"" and William Bolger will be the winner of the Academy Awards. This book and that movie, will just help establish Whitey as another morally-damaged, undeserving criminal white folk hero, like Jessie James or Bonnie and Clyde, or General Custer. Let us be clear about one thing: Whitey Bulger is, and always will be, just another two-bit serial killing rat, a Southie thug and nothing more.

"This is a well-argued but rather pessimistic essay written almost two decades ago by one of the heavyweights in the field of particle physics. It is based on the author's belief that the present search for  a unified theory of everything (TOE) -- based mostly on the developments in string theory -- is a misguided effort.At the time this book went to print in 1992, he believed that string theory and its related mathematical techniques, were all of low predictive power since they relied much too heavily on a suite of untested often ad hoc and speculative semi-deductive techniques of theorizing. These ""partial theoretical techniques"" seem to bootstrap their way up a never-ending deductive chain completely suspended in the intellectual ether, where he believed that they could never properly under go systematic scientific testing. The most important of these techniques being those that relied heavily on mathematical techniques that predicted symmetry-breaking.The author argued two decades ago that these techniques were based mostly on mathematical speculation, and thus were of low predictive power. Despite this, they just kept on expanding into an entire family of related symmetries-breaking ideas such as supersymmetry, supergravity, super-force, and superstrings themselves. It was the author's view that they all existed as a result of undue reliance on extra-scientific theorizing, theorizing that in the end he believed would be worthless since they could never be tested with real data?Yet, since this book went to print, in 1992, the LHC at CERN, using the theories that this author was so pessimistic about, has been able to produce hard and testable evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson particle, a finding that at least goes a long way towards confirming the standard model. It goes without saying that it was based primarily on the techniques the author gauged to be of low predictive power.Although, in the author' favor, the CERN predictions did not go beyond the standard model to, for instance, predict the W' or Z' gauge bosons. So, at least technically, the author remains right about the lack of scientific verification of models that go beyond the standard model of particle physics. However, given what has been discovered so far, I would not be too sanguine if I were in his position.

"Immediately, the reader will get the impression that this book has been mislabelled. The subtitle is ""A biblical, Philosophical and Scientific Exploration"" of the theories on the creation out of nothing (creatio ex Nihilo). However, Philosophical and Scientific theories do not enter the discussion until the last three chapters, the last 100 pages of the book. The bulk of the book, five of its eight chapters, 2/3 of its 266 pages -- very much after the fact -- are devoted exclusively to trying to establish a religious argument that justifies and supports a biblical interpretation of the Big Bang Theory.After reading the book, it would be an understatement to say that the religious energy devoted to this effort has been energy poorly spent, as they all have been maximally confusing and mutually inconsistent -- but curiously always toeing the orthodox religious line.In fact, after trying vainly to make sense out of all of this religious ambiguity, the reader will surely discover as I did, that there is at least one heavy-hitting high level religious advocate on every side of these discussions, including on the side that warns against trying to coordinate biblical interpretation with scientifically derived facts. Of all the topics that one would think are most critical to religious beliefs -- creation out of nothing -- the reader will also discover that there is no consensus, nor even a minimally consistent biblical view?In other words, sadly, and after 166 pages, these religious scholars' arguments curiously all remained at right angles to each other?  In the end, exactly nothing was resolved!My own conclusion is that the ""religionists way of proof,"" that is, proof ""by the fiat of divine authority,"" may have inadvertently hoisted them by their own petard, and thus, may have left them hanging in the wind, way out on a slippery slope, one that like one of the roads leading away from Nob Hill in San Francisco, leans steeply and precipitously downwards.It seems to me that the best of the many religious arguments put forth here, do little more than set up a spurious dichotomy between the cosmological facts of science (i.e., the Big Bang Theory), and the theological affirmation (or is it confirmation?) of it by God through jerry-rigged, and shaky after the fact established scripture-based truths (i.e. by the fiat of divine authority as read in the scripture).However, having set up this spurious dichotomy, I believe Kwasi Wiredu's and Hans Swartz's warnings about ""not too quickly identifying religious interpretations with the temporal scientific beginnings of the universe,"" is well advised and correlate well with my own views. For doing so, begs the very important question of what happens when the scientific facts and theories change, as invariably they will?  Does God's authority then also change? Are scriptual references then to also be updated as was the case with most of this book? If they do, then does this not simply mean that God's authority will always be ""playing catch-up"" to the latest scientific theories?Since the idea of scientific proof is just the opposite of religious proof -- that is to say, it does NOT just sit back and defend forever singularly established scientific facts, truths, or theories, but instead, it puts them all through the most rigorous of scientific tests: the test of falsification.Like religionists, scientists too do start out with but one goal -- but it is the opposite of what religionists start out to do: Scientists try as much as they possibly can, to overthrow and thereby try to falsify their own theories. Only those that survive this most brutal and rigorous process of falsification, will survive as true well-tested theories.What this means of course is that the Big Bang Theory is itself forever ""an open-ended hypothesis"" about the nature of creation -- not a once for all times scientific truth. The Big Bang theory therefore must forever be opened to future falsification. So far it survives because it has not yet failed a singular attempt to falsify it. And if in the future it should fail even one attempt at falsification, it will then be declared forever, an invalid theory. And the process simply begins all over again with a new trial hypothesis about the nature of creation.Therefore, the regionalists must be careful. If they hook their ""creationist's wagons"" up to the Big Bang Theory, inadvertently they are also hooking it up to the scientific method's mode of falsification. Now, do religionists really want to do that? I don't think so?

"The topic of this book is the science of the Ishango Bones. With dedication and patience, and wherever it was possible to do so, use of the highest research standards, Mr. Marshack has shown beyond a reasonable scientific doubt that the groupings of markings on the bones of tribesmen of the Central African Congo of 35,000 years ago, is probably the first instance of man engaging in science -- mathematics in particular. Beyond a reasonable doubt, he has shown that these engraved scripted bones, at the very least were the first recorded lunar calculators, used to chart and predict the lunar cycles and all survival activities associated with such cycles.Many who read and engage in research on the early history of mankind, feel that something is very much amiss in Archaeological theorizing? Even if it is only a deep feeling within their bones, many feel as I do that since the Archaeologists often get the time-scale of fossils wrong by orders of magnitude, and are constantly revising their theories of intellectual and cognitive development in early humans, being caught on their back foot seems more the rule than the exception, more like an occupational hazard of the field? And although errors in time-scale estimates may be due in large part to the porousness and scarcity of fossil finds, errors in theorizing, it seems to me, is wholly a product of lack of imagination. And, as this author argues, an unwillingness to venture too far from the orthodox line.Perhaps it was my own naveté that led me to believe that Cognitive Archaeology thus would welcome and embrace the radical new platform for theorizing offered up here by Professor Alexander Marshack. However, the more one examines Marshack's thesis, the more revolutionary and formidable, and thus threatening, it can be seen to be to the established orthodoxy. It would not be an exaggeration to compare its impact on Archaeology to the impact Darwin's theory of Evolution has had on religion. Protectors of the state-sanctioned orthodoxy have circled their wagons to resist any new theoretical encroachments.Stated as simply as it can be stated, Mr. Marshack has hypothesized that any Archaeological theories of human intellect based on ""supposed"" changes in brain architecture, unless such changes can be accounted for experimentally, are likely to be wrong. This is true, as he sees it, because the brain architecture of pre-humans and modern man, at least for the last 100,000 years, as far as we can tell, has been essentially the same. So the science being performed by the Ishango tribesmen, and the PhD scientists at the Jet propulsion Laboratory, are different only in degree, not in kind, different only in the content of the data used and problems being solved. The processes used, however more complex for ""modern man"" than for ""primitive man,"" are still the same as that used by the Ishango Congo African tribesman.This is certainly true as far as it can be determined through their respective cognitive functioning brain architecture. The author thus argues here, rather convincingly in my view, that since the beginning of time, man's creative thinking has always been both purposeful and time-bound -- directed almost exclusively at the problem of survival for the moment. As a result, while the content of thinking may have changed over various epochs, ecologies and cultures, the process of thinking itself has not.His crowning point is that, as much as Western man would like for it to be so, ""mind development"" is not quite the same thing as ""brain or architecture development."" Like cultural development, mind and intellectual development are almost never ""a bolt-out-of-the-blue"" - the de fault category when no reasonable explanation is forthcoming -- but like culture, man's intellectual development, such as science, is a continuous, connected, layered accreted process that takes place over long periods of time. It seems that for reasons having to do with modern chauvinism alone, incredibly, no one in Archaeology has ever begun with such an assumption about brain architecture versus the process of human cognitive development, before. I do not believe it would be an exaggeration of the author's point to suggest that almost all of man's development -- in agriculture, in art, in economics, politics, etc. -- is also of the process sort.

"This book is one of a trilogy of books penned by Charles Mann. They bracket 1492, the fateful year of ""discovery.""  It tells the story of what happened the last year before the European invasion of the Americas. It is a revealing historical research/travel-guide -- overlain with, and guided by, a forensic-like Anthropological debate between two heavyweights in the field, both of whom were in search of the truth of what actually happened before, during and after the conquest of the Americas.It is a spirited search that literally leaves no stones unturned. It is thus a tribute to the author that the book is an even-handed and balanced report on, about all there is available to report on in the field of research on this issue. It is a report best characterized by the author's flair for getting out of the way of his own story, allowing the narrative to breath, and the data to speak for themselves: And boy what an interesting story they have to tell.A quick and dirty summary of the book is that the most recently uncovered data, thoroughly massaged with an amazing compliment of modern research tools, concludes that the history we have been ""force-fed"" since Grade School, and is best represented in Allan Holmburg's Cornell PhD thesis as ""Holmburg's Mistake,"" is simply wrong.For instance, the Americas were NOT unoccupied virgin lands, but were quite the opposite: well-managed lands cleared of forests and underbrush, populated by estimates of up to 100 million people. The data reviewed here proves that distinct cultures of Indians went back for at least four millennia, and slivers of evidence exists that they may even have gone as far back as 30,000 years ago!What the European invaders mistook for virgin lands was in fact the mere remnants, the remaining stragglers and the last flickers of a dying people, people who as a result of the mega-deaths caused by exposure to European transported diseases, had simply abandoned the lands and were wandering about trying find their bearings as the forests began to reclaim the land. It was these reclaimed forests and these scattered groups of wandering survivors that the invaders actually saw. In point of fact, before the invasion, the Americas had been well-managed for millennia, by, among other techniques, the continuous use of controlled ""slash-and-burn"" fires. And although this technique did put more stress on the environment by emitting more carbon into the air, it also renewed the soil.The Indians were not, as Allan Holmburg's mistaken Cornell Phd thesis implied: ""among the most uncultured and most backward peoples to ever walk the face of the earth."" In fact, once researchers were able to move beyond the wandering stragglers that the early settlers had confronted, they found that the Indians were a varied group of people who lived and survived in cultures that respected nature as best they could, for at least four millennia. Some succeeded brilliantly at it -- even beyond anything to be seen elsewhere in the rest of the world until at least a millennium or so later. Others failed at it, some damaged the environment, and some didn't survive at all.As for Holmburg's notion that all Indians were cultural backward, except for a pocket of culture in Renaissance Italy, Europe was still digging its way out of the feudal Dark Ages. England, for instance, even within the monarchy, had not yet invented the bath and personal hygiene, On the other hand, Indians bathed daily and could not stand the stench of the body odor of the invaders. In one of the most colorful examples in the book, a Connecticut tribe so detested engaging up close and personal with the unhygienic invaders, that they traded with them by conveying goods back and forth across the Connecticut River by rope and pulley. To further show their disgust, the Indians across the river laughed and ""mooned"" the Settlers as a final mocking and derisive insult to end their transactions. Indians were taking daily bathes when Londoners were still throwing garbage into the streets from their windows, creating a cesspool for the breeding and proliferation of rats as well as an incubator for spreading diseases like small pox and the plague. It was England's own lax hygiene habits coupled with its extreme poverty, that were in large part responsible for both the later ""white flight"" to the ""New World"" and for the diseases, poverty and rats, they brought along with them.But beyond hygiene, at least two millennia before Europe was even thought of as being a viable continent, Indians had experimented with, and succeeded at inventing modern forms of civic interactions, such as municipal governments and administrations, including their own forms of representative democracy and socialism. They polities had no poverty or taxes. They lived in literally hundreds of well-run city states, flung across two continents from Canada to Chile.Under government administration, they built large-scale monolithic monuments and infrastructure projects like dams, viaducts, irrigations waterways, roads and highways, engaged in collective farming, raised animals and plants, successfully bred a wide variety of plants; were the first to produce potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, cassava, bananas, peach trees, maize, tobacco and engaged in both domestic and international trade. The Indians of Peru/Brazil, invented a soil compose that was 880 times as fertile as anything we have yet seen in modern agriculture. This potent form of dirt is a mystery still being studied in universities across the globe. And even though it took them two millennia to understand the full uses of metal, which they smelted but used only for ceremonial purposes; and the wheel, which they used only to make children's toys; and also failed to invent money because they had no need for it, Indian cultures nevertheless did engage in Astronomy, using megaliths like Stonehenge to reckon the stars and the moon; mathematics by inventing the first calendars, and accounting practices. As well, they were the first to invent the zero, and bootstrapped the accounting and the zero into the invention of writing.At ""first contact,"" new uses of both metal and the wheel were re-introduced to the Americas, and this reintroduction proved to be a game changer. For Indian culture, these new uses were transformative, as it allowed them finally to see the importance of guns, and of even more importance, they could finally replace stone axes for iron ones. Trading with Settlers for metal goods like pots and pans and iron axes was so important that whole Indian communities moved closer to settler communities in order to be first in line to buy the Settlers' metal products. Wars were even instigated among Indians in order to control access to trade with Settlers for metal products with their newer uses.As for conquest itself, this book clears up many matters previously shrouded in obscurity, or left as a mystery to history. First, while the European gun was frightful, it was not into the late 18th Century before it was as accurate or as lethal as the Indian longbow. Moreover, the two most important allies of European conquest were not the superiority of European soldiers or their guns as we have been repeatedly told, but the much more subtle and silent allies that remained unknown and unknowable to the Europeans at the time: diseases and demography.The research here shows that European diseases killed and removed Indians from the land so rapidly and in such large numbers that Settlers would take over their camps and villages lock-stock-and-barrel just as quickly as they died. Where upon, unsavory entrepreneurs, sponsoring ""pie-in-the-sky come-ons for voyages across the Atlantic to promote imperial expansion, radically increased their promotion ads in order to ""con"" more and more poor and disgruntled Europeans to move to the Americas. This increase in numbers would eventually possess a quality of its own. For within decades, the increased population helped those with the larger numbers, to commandeer larger and larger swarths of land. Larger numbers alone, invariably translated into both more wealth and more power for those who took over large tracts of land. Unfortunately, those that did so, were almost exclusively the landed gentry, among them being pirates and smugglers, as well as ship-owning and ship-building corporate enterprises. Only rarely did an ordinary immigrant, seeking their ""proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" promoted by unsavory ads, end up with large parcels of land. Most ended up as indentured servants.As but one example of how the phenomenon of catastrophic losses due to diseases worked in wars of conquest, the research here proves that, at a very minimum, it drastically changed the calculus of divide and conquer, and did so decisively in favor of the Settlers, as it made it infinitely easier for decimated tribes, acting out of pure survival desperation, to be willing to side with the Settlers in an effort to outmaneuver and thereby out-survive their tribal enemies.There also was yet another not quite so silent ally to European conquest. It too was one that saved the North American Settlers from themselves -- i.e., from their own incompetence in survival skills, and their poor ability to wage war, as well from their own well-known laziness and infighting. This ally was a plant, one of the many that Indians had learned to harvest and that quickly became a profitable item of trade between American Settlers and European markets.That plant was called tobacco. And according to the research reviewed here, at the time that tobacco was being introduced as the saving grace of North America's transatlantic trade (a trade that would eventually become second only to slavery), it was probably more a potent hallucinogen than the equivalent of one of today's more innocent habit-forming ""nicotine vehicles"" called cigarettes. The point being that only after Catholic Maryland and Protestant Virginia began to export the drug tobacco in large amounts, was the survival of the colonies ensured.In summary, the author's storyline centers on the academic debate that among many other things, demolished ""Holmburg's Mistake."" That debate, as it turns out is an academic ""battle royal,"" that will simply titillate the reader to no end. But I would point out that it is a deadly serious debate, the likes of which, we have not seen since Newton and Einstein ideas squared-off in debates over the true nature gravity. And like in that battle, the differences between the sides in this one too lies in academic nuances, not in the main revised storylines. Here, importantly, and to their credit, both sides agree that ""Holmburg's Mistake"" can no longer stand as acceptable and respectable American History.Representing one side of this debate is Dr. Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian Institute, who advances the rather contentious notion (that later research simply does not back up): that the Olmecs of Mexica, were the end point of the Native American cultural line, putting the oldest Indian culture back to being no older than about fifteen centuries old.On the other side of this debate is Dr. Anna Roosevelt, of Yale University, who retraced, and in part, replicated and then went well beyond the research of Dr. Meggers, concluded that the true cultural history of Indians goes back much further, as far back as four millennia, and perhaps as far back as even beyond the era of the oldest city known to man, Sumer.As a result of Roosevelt's findings, she now believes that if we accept Meggers' rendition of Indian pre-history -- that is, that it began with the Olmecs -- then we will have simply replaced Holmberg's Mistake with a more sophisticated but slightly updated version of it. One that instead of cutting Indian cultural history off at the neck, cuts it off at the knees instead. But perhaps more importantly, she claims that Meggers theories obscure more than they reveal. The very fact that their true cultural history and contribution goes back at least four millennia and possibly as far back as 30,000 years, makes it a second order crime to stop cultural exploration at the Olmecs. In any case, this debate is the headiest one raging across the generations that now exists in academia.

"This book outlines a scary new paradigm, which effectively upgrades and revises the old imperialist phenomenon once referred to only as ""Western Economic Imperialism."" This new version 2.0 of the phenomenon of ""Western Economic Imperialism,"" is presented here as a heady, smart, ""Marxist tainted,"" skillfully deployed, clandestine, information run, theoretical paradigm of a new global order. One that hypothesizes that the old familiar notion of imperialism is not so much dead and gone as rendered obsolete and no longer applicable to the capitalists' exigencies and necessities of our post-modern times.The newer model 2.0 has adapted, evolved, and inexorably morphed from the old limited state-centered modern economic-based capitalist model of production, that once loyally served and was well-integrated into the community within a nation state which it exploited, to today's much broader, much more amorphous, globally de-centered, almost detached, as well as de-cultured but information-based, stand alone post-modern economic, organism. This new organism has no discernible human attachments, and most of all, no return address. Its only known identity is its offshore secret bank account numbers in the Cayman Islands or Switzerland.This newer, epistemologically more slippery organism leaves the mistaken impression that state-based and citizen-based sovereignty somehow has declined and is withering away? But in fact, as these authors so carefully point out, sovereignty itself has not declined so much as has simply been moved on up to a higher plane into the ether of cyberspace by a new global cabal. And there it has ""parked"" and then been taken over by a ""new much more organized and much more sinister form of management,"" a form of management that is defined by, and operates under, the new rules of global empire.In short, the political controls, state functions, regulatory mechanisms and means of capitalist production that used to operate within carefully proscribed and limited territorial and state-centered grids, and more or less under citizen sovereignty, have now moved on to the higher plane where the new corporate rules of supra nationalism and global economic manipulation are invoked, with a vengeance.These are corporate rules devised by ad hoc coalitions of like-minded capitalist robber barons, having allegiances to no one but themselves and their global enterprises -- such as the race to the bottom of the global labor pool, buying and controlling politicians the world over, despoiling the environment, and maintaining control over the very lucrative international drug trade. In these endeavors, these new managers, unlike their forerunner and model, the managers at the CIA, now have no need to be associated with any known or recognizable state structures. This new amorphous cabal, and their self-defined rules, now constitute a new capitalist entity unto themselves, in the new corporate-run capitalist global world order.Remember the good old days when the reactionary right had an existential fear of ""one world government under UN auspices?"" No one could have ever imagined that the flip side of that fear, of that one world coin, would be much worst: that it would involve these same reactionaries colluding with like-minded capitalist industrialists the world over, to produce the much scarier scenario of another one world government: only this time it is a new global world order under a vicious ""dog-eat-dog"" global capitalist corporate cabal?

"This powerful poetic ati-war essay offered in the form of a novel about the universal meanings of war, and the significance those meanings attach to manhood, fear, bravery, cowardice and male character, is perhaps Steven Crane's best work. It is set in a war of ""blues"" against ""grays,"" and traces the ""manhood construction project"" of one generic soldier, called Henry ""the youth.""Henry had dreamed of the valor and glory of joining the military to fight and become a war hero. He luxuriated in his imaginary glory, until, once he was on the battlefield, the stark reality of the brutality of war, hit him. The shock of this reality caused him to question everything: the purpose of war, morality, his own bravery, as well as his own character.The story is brilliantly told along two parallel tracks: the raw brutality of the reality of war and its utter indifference to man on the one hand -- as well as through the inner voice and conscience of one scared and confused young soldier, Henry -- on the other.Until the fighting actually began, Henry had smugly decided that war was quite boring, rather senseless and that all of his commanding officers were incompetents. But then, once the shooting started -- in the heat and fury of battle -- Henry's self-confidence and superior attitude gave way to instincts of self-preservation, which came into play in a big way. Henry's ""fight or flight"" instincts were severely tested during his second battle, and the flight instinct apparently won out, as he failed the only manhood test war had offered him: He had fled from the battlefield.While going AWOL, Henry hovered along the periphery of the battlefield spying on what was taking place. He did this long enough to see his unit routed, his best friend killed and many of his comrades wounded. The guilt of seeing his best friend killed, his comrades in arms injured, and himself on the sidelines as a bona fide deserter and coward, overwhelmed Henry and he slowly and slyly tried to find a way back into his unit without his desertion being discovered. While falling in the line with a group of retreating soldiers, he asked an annoying question of one of them. In anger, the soldier smashed Henry up side the head with the butt of his rifle.He rejoined his unit still bleeding from the head wound, and naturally his comrades thought he had been injured in battle like the others. And with the injury serving as his new ""red badge of courage,"" Henry was accorded the full attention deserving of a soldier ""actually"" wounded in battle.For the rest of his military career, Henry not only found it convenient to hide behind the lies of his desertion and his fake wound. His life was re-centered around a delusional version of himself --  as a wounded war hero who had never fled from the battlefield. He learned to live hiding behind his lies, fashioning a new ""life script"" of courage and heroism built on this delusional foundation.Having had his life redeemed through fiat, with no one the wiser, allowed Henry to faced down his fears as well as the horrors of war, the same as any other brave warrior would have done. He thus surprised himself by then going forth conquering his fear and acquitting himself well in subsequent battles, in the end becoming a decorated war hero who had achieved the glory he sought. However, he did not acquire it without having been given a second chance, nor without the benefit of the kind of self-awareness that comes with maturity.His redemption, although it came as a second chance masked under the guile of self-deception, nevertheless allowed Henry to find the space to better contemplate the meaning of his life --  as well as to better understand the morality of war.Among other things, his introspection taught him that morality was man-made rather than inherent in nature. Under such conditions it was thus indeed possible to be a coward and still overcome one's fears and become a hero based on actual deeds achieved on the battlefield.There are many morals to Crane's story beyond those acquired by Henry, foremost among them being that war is senseless. But a related one is that the pursuit of glory through the senselessness of war is even more senseless. Also, Crane's novel is a redemption story that parallels the Christian story of redemption. Only here the redemption is achieved through ""actual"" exploits on the battlefield, rather than through the single symbolic act of Baptism, which, to the extent it is a deed at all, is one centered on ritual.

"Given that it was a Clint Eastwood directed movie, who as a Republican, had no choice but to ""crop"" the political context -- finessing the fact that the Seals ended up in Fallujah under the misimpression sold to us by the Cheney-Bush administration that Saddam Hussein had WMD -- it was a decent well done movie.For an American war movie, the acting by the lead, was strong, understated and superbly played. It will surely garner a Best Actor's award. Although, the dialog was contemporary ""Texas-American,"" it was surprisingly realistic and devoid of overly syrupy patriotic mush. I enjoyed the movie despite its formulaic nature and the fact that the 911 dialogue in the set up piece was intended to mislead the viewer politically.The script was not deep, but what there was, was economic and tightly written. The only negative was that it left the unstated impression that all American soldiers, and especially the Navy Seals, are all politically tone-deaf patriotic drones: that they click their heels and die for any American cause, without asking any questions, the ""my country, right or wrong"" syndrome. Those who questioned the war were either seen as cowards (like Chris' brother, who cashed-in early), or made their views known posthumously (as in a letter read at the funereal of his fallen best friend).I give the movie four stars, reserving five stars for my pick as this year's Best Picture: ""The Imitation Game,"" which is actually much too smart; too well done, and too British to be selected as Best picture. So, by default, ""American Sniper"" may indeed win. If it does, I will not be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGWCW246C3YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RFHVCFI#wasThisHelpful","R3VGWCW246C3YR","A3RFXU3P0XKKF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RFXU3P0XKKF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well written, carefully researched biography reminds us of what Richard Pryor, the man and his life has taught us: How to navigate and survive the complex existential set of fears called ""American Society.""Richard too came into this world ""an innocent."" He learned indirectly and brutally from his own immediate family that in this world he was alone and had to navigate it all by himself. The only real friends Richard had were his ever-present inner demons. Those demons can be seen etched in his eyes on the cover of this book: Richard Pryor, the black comedian extraordinaire, until his premature demise, had good reasons to be scared to death of this world and of where his own life might take him in it.He feared his parents, especially his violent father Buck, who his own sister had said about him at his funereal that he had screwed everybody, and that Richard should be happy that he had escaped being screwed by him too. But also there was his Grandmother Marie Carter Bryant, the ""madam,"" no less brutal than her sons, who ruled over her family and her black female sex slaves and prostitutes, in the same way that John Gotti ruled over the mob: brutally tyrannically and with purposefully cultivated fear. This of course did not deter her from manning the front pew of her Baptist Church every Sunday morning -- apparently she had existential fears of her own?Richard was scared of the rest of his family too, as they were a clan of societal misfits who made their living on the backstreets of American ghetto life, in the underground economy of Peoria, Illinois. Which is another way of saying that they were a tribe of low-lifes: criminals, who lived on the edge and died by the codes of the streets. From day-to-day, their lives, as was Richard's, was always up for grab, an existential ""crap shoot:"" You were as likely to get shot or hauled off to jail as you were to eat a ham sandwich.Richard's innocence was stolen from him, as is too often the case in the US, through societal osmosis. He was fearful of the carnal knowledge that he had picked up peeping over the transoms of his Christian grandmother's whorehouses, a knowledge he had acquired while he was still too young to understand, but which nevertheless had a lasting effect on his always fragile psyche. It taught him how to be numb to sex, numb to love and to all tender feelings, as well as to most other emotions -- even before he possessed the maturity to understood their meanings. It also taught him how not to trust anyone, including and especially his grandmother, even though throughout his life he pretended that she was the only one in the family that he did love? That he loved Marie, is itself much too twisted for even the best Psychologist to make any sense of?He was fearful of American white society too. But despite his fear, he was nevertheless dumped into it against his will via the racist white schools he was forced to attend. They too robbed him of his innocence by telling him early and often that ""black boys"" (they used the N-word) were not wanted, and that there was no place in American society for him. He got the same message (and the same N-word) from his commanding officers while serving a stint in the US Army in Germany, defending democracy overseas but not here at home.He also got it in Hollywood when he refused to continue ""playing-the-fool,"" the only role carved out and reserved for black Comedians. That is one of the reasons he chose to follow in the footsteps of Dr. William Cosby.On his way to the kind of freedom and success that America reserves exclusively for the handful of black comics that toe the racist social and political line, Dr. Cosby had cornered the market for the role of America's first ""neutered race free black comic."" Richard decided he would be the second. Until recently, Cosby never looked back, gained unheard of wealth and fame -- that is until all of the recent revelations about him drugging and raping a whole parcel of young ingenues and star-seeking females, hit the tabloids.And in perhaps the oddest paradox of his life, the sliver of humanity reflected back to him as the class clown, as Cosby's doppelgänger, another black comic in ""blackface,"" something he had learned out of necessity to gain attention within the family, to avoid the daily beat-downs at school, and in order to get a job in entertainment field, set the parameters for the rest of his life. It wasn't much to hold onto, but throughout his life, this was the thin reed that ""America's master comic"" held onto.Most of all, Richard Pryor was scared of himself. He desperately wanted (indeed needed) to first know who he was; and then he wanted to be loved. Both needs made him vulnerable. His deepest fear however, was that with or without love, he would not survive -- and that even if he did manage to survive, he would end up like the rest of the family tribe, a backstreet low-life; a hypocritical Christian -- forever gaming on other blacks just to survive a miserable second-class life.Thus, Richard Pryor's life, paradoxically was an ""object lesson"" in how, in America, to successfully wrestle one's demons to the ground, and still not win the battle, and still not pin them to the mat; that is, and still come out on the other side, a loser.The idea that ""ignorance is bliss"" has been a flawed ground rule of common sense since time immemorial. However, I believe that Richard's life finally and conclusively proves this simple-minded ground rule of life is nonsense. While it is true that the less we know about the world, and about ourselves, the less chance we have that our demons and fears will ever trip us up, over take us, or turn us into catatonic zombies, but it is equally true that remaining ignorant of self and the world around us is one of the worse strategies for survival and for finding enlightenment, enjoyment, meaning, love and richness in life, known to man.However, you couldn't tell that to a ""Christian madam"" like Marie Carter Bryant, Rich's grandmother? She had her own brand of bliss, all of the answers to life were in her book, where bliss was born, raised and lived on the bed side tables in the rooms where her whores were ""being serviced."" The ""holy water"" from being a Baptist, obviously inoculated and protected Marie from all of life's foibles, including especially self-knowledge.Lets be clear about this, Richard Pryor was nobody's saint or hero. He was a talented comic but a severely flawed piece of humanity. All one has to do to confirm this is to just look at his eyes on the front cover of this book. His eyes say it all: that, I don't belong here? --wherever here might be.But Richard was brave in this one sense. He did not always react to fear in the expected way. As for the fear of his family, for instance, he ran -- as far away from Peoria as he could get and never looked back. As far as his fear of race and sex, like most Americans, he tried all combinations and seemed to have never mastered either.But on the more important plane of conquering the fear of being and becoming Richard Pryor, he used comedy as his creative cudgel, his personal club to hit others over the head with to see what their reactions said about him. He was the reflection in his audiences eyes, and nothing more. It was a colossally ineffective way to learn about ones self, but again, it was all that Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor really had. Pryor's life was little more than a painful, long-running experiment in acquiring self-knowledge the hard way.His journey began as a class clown in an integrated school in Peoria, Ill., and ended as a beloved ""truth-teller"" who had gained fame and ""reflected love"" throughout the world, but little real love and even less personal peace. Clowning got him a seat at the white table, both as a kid and as an adult. When he confiscated Cosby's persona, he was another ""neutered black clown"" without portfolio. But who was this black man in ""blackface"" standing on the stage in Las Vegas, and staring back at Richard in the mirror? Even he did not know?Despite what Oprah and Dr. Phil tell us, there is no roadmap to either success or self-knowledge. One must find his own route, and then keep knocking at the door until it cracks open and then be prepared to jump in. The door opened for Richard Pryor several times, but as intelligent as he was, as talented as he was, and as good as he was at conning others (as well as himself), he never acquired the emotional stability or armor and equipment needed to feel himself worthy to walk in that door on his own and in his own shoes. Someone should have pulled his coattails and told him that what he was looking for in life rarely exists: A world of honest people, deserving of a self-aware Richard who will tell him the truth and then accept him as he is?His melt-down at the Aladdin in 1967 was his moment of truth, his ""come to Jesus"" moment. It was the point at which he had become tone-deaf to his own jokes. When he heard them coming out of his own mouth, he did not laugh; and when he looked into the mirror, he did not recognize the person staring back at him?  That was when he walked off the stage at the Aladdin ...When Richard finally reached the top of Mount Self-knowledge, having conquered most but not all of his fears, all he saw on the other side staring back at him, were pygmies just like the old Richard -- other people with the same demons: the same America that he had run away from: in Peoria, in New York, in Las Vegas?Rather than go around that wheel again, one has to presume that Richard decided to take the shortcut home. This time Richard decided he needed just one friend and it was not Paul Mooney: It was the one that would soothe all of his fears, always be at his bedside; the one that would accept him unconditionally; the one that would never judge him; never betray him; the one that would always laugh at all his jokes, the one that was always on his side through thick or thin; the ultimate white girlfriend: cocaine. End of the story of how to become Richard Pryor.

"Since I knew Oprah was affiliated with this project, I figured somehow it would be twisted into another half-baked ""Uncle Tom/Aunt Jemima"" trope, the same way that everything else she and Tyler Perry get involved in. As a result, I told myself I would pass it up. But my curiosity got the best of me. And I am happy to report that it was a well done movie. A tightly crafted screen play, after obviously having been pieced together from what undoubtedly had to be sporadic and fragmented materials.Both LBJ and King came off as believable human characters although Coretta leaned too much in the ""expected cardboard Aunt Jemima cutout"" direction to be believable. Also, I was very disappointed that Malcolm X's speech at the Church in Selma was mentioned but purposely nixed. The times (and this movie) cried out for the new ""Malcolm unity move"" that he single-handedly was trying to integrate into the King-led movement. However, it is a measure of the kind of conservative forces controlling the script that it was omitted: Shame!Also, the role that Harry Belafonte played in getting a bunch of Hollywood heavy hitters down to Alabama for the march (he spent well over $200K) was very much minimized. Those writing the script should have read what William Cohen's wife had to say about Harry's role, or what reverend King, or Marlon Brando said about him in his autobiography, or indeed Harry's own honest description of those events provided in his own very fine autobiography.Oprah, as usual hogged center stage -- front and center -- in her usual uncompromising Aunt Jemima role. [C'mon Oprah, have you no shame? Grow up: when are your going to give that Aunt Jemima trope up? Jeez, you are a billionaire? Relax, your slip is showing?]This is an okay movie, with honest intentions, but not Academy Award material in my view.

"The Imitation Game is far and away the best picture of 2014, and 2015 so far. A beautiful, mature tightly written screen play, about the life of codebreaking math phenom and homosexual, Alan Turin.It is based on the book about his life and is written with believable dialogue and a minimum of frills, props and pyrotechnics -- and thus in this sense is very un-American.Superbly cast and a lot of straight ahead superb but very challenging acting. Treats mature themes sensitively and believably. It did not hurt that it was also situated in an upper class English setting.Were it not so intelligently done, it would be odds on to win the 2014 Academy Awards. However, being both intelligent and the complete cinematic package -- screen-play, casting, acting and mature no frills themes -- these will surely disqualify it from serious consideration for the Academy Awards.

"Into the Woods should win the academy award for ""Best Kids Movie of the Year,"" for having cleverly and seamlessly patched together several famous Western Fairy Tales.However, it cannot win the ""best adult movie of the year"" award because, for the first time, the adult movie goer will get to see what happens when the quality of the roles do not quite measure up to the quality of the actors performing them?It simply means that the actors ""get a free ride:"" They get away with murder by being allowed to ""underperform"" their way to a big payday: The ""over-qualified actors"" are let off the hook and left to their own devices to find clever ways to ""dumb-down their acting"" in order to meet the diminished demands of their respective roles. Here they did so by either ""coasting"" or ""putting-on"" in rather hammish ways.

"The claim made in this book, Dope, Inc. is a provocative, almost outlandish one: It is that the British Crown has been at the top of the pyramid of the international drug trade since the days of the East India company. It is well known that Britain ruled both the slave trade and the Chinese opium trade through the East India Company for well over a century. But since then, London's control over the international drug trade has been more clandestine and certainly less well known.One reason it has flown under the radar is that control over the trade was not consolidated until the end of prohibition. It was only then that the syndicated infrastructure used during prohibition -- to distill, transport and distribute alcohol -- was then converted over to an operation sophisticated enough to control the world wide drug trade. This top secret, top-down ""British run syndicate,"" involved three hierarchically-ordered rings of power, all radiating downward from London.The first ring is made up of trusted aides, including court Jews (known as Hofjudens, or house Jews), who, since the days of Feudalism have served the British Crown loyally as its preferred courtiers. In the drug trade, Hofjudens were among a group that also included high level military and intelligence operatives, who served as ""cutouts"" for sensitive operations. Their job was to establish the arrangements for the international drug trade, and to manage laundering drug monies, and then investing profits through European and American banks -- all to be done under the watchful eye of UK national security.Among the Hofjudens discussed here are the Rothchilds, of England and France, the Brofmans of Canada, and Arnold Rothstein of the US. The Rothchild family had been engaged with the Crown in international finance, war industries and banking during both world wars, while the Brofman family and Rothstein, had run liquor for the Crown during prohibition.The second ring of power included the use of Sicilian as well as Jewish mobsters to distribute drugs to street vendors and users. Foremost among members of this ring was Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano. The mob group jointly led by them, also had deep illicit ties with both the Crown and the USG -- first through liquor running that went as far back as prohibition, and later through the Navy during WW-II, up through gun-running both for Israel and for and against Castro's revolution -- after which, Lansky was summarily kicked out of Havana.Right after the war, at the time Israel was being established, Lansky's drug trafficking routes doubled-down as gun-running routes, where both became indispensable in providing needed military and financial assistance in establishing Israel. Along with Lansky, the Hafjudens, that had been loyally to the Crown, were now deeply involved in running surplus weapons from European armories and American ships into Israel, as well as using drug profits to provide the much needed hard currency to finance the development of the new state of Israel. Ship loads of stockpiled Allied WW-II weapons, somehow, just managed to get diverted to Israel.The third and final ring of power emanating out from the Crown, was the circle of power that involved aspiring politicians, those in a position to facilitate bringing drugs in through the front door of the countries where it was needed to be done.This multi-layered structure was overseen and tightly insulated from public exposure by an intelligence blanket called the SOE. Through high level infiltration by British intelligence into both friendly and competing agencies, the UK was able to gain a foothold inside the KGB, the CIA, Division Five of the FBI, and similar organizations in the Caribbean, Mexico, Canada and Australia -- as well as in Israel -- where it helped set-up the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad.A final most important aspect of this secret drug infrastructure, was a string of shell ""business fronts"" and safe houses, ""cutouts,"" as it were, strategically placed to serve various needs, as necessary. One such business entity that first hit American newspapers during Jim Garrison's investigation into the JFK assassination, was the nefarious entity called Permindex.Ostensibly, Permindex was to be the headquarters of world exhibition centers, but in fact, as this book claims, Permindex was little more than a ""clearing house"" for a group of about a dozen well-trained and well-paid assassins that made up the Crown's version of Murder, Inc. And while these authors claim that Permindex was used to carry out important hits at the behest of the crown, Michael Collins Piper's  book, ""Final Judgment,"" insinuates that Permindex was an Israeli, rather than a British creation? And further Piper, claims it was David Ben Gurion, who first resigned as Prime Minister, and then ordered JFK's murder in order to avoid having to allow the IAEA to inspect the Israeli nuclear facilities at Dimona?I have read Piper's book carefully, checked his references, and am willing to admit that he is an honest scholar and has marshaled impressive documentation to back up his claims. However, in retrospect, it now seems quite clear too that he also used a bit of creative license: as he first ""cribbed,"" and then ""improvised,"" a wiggly path away from pinning the tail of the assassination donkey on Great Britain, where it belonged, and instead, pinned it on Israel?The real story of this book thus is not just in providing the reader with the full history and associated details of this enormously powerful secret apparatus (often referred to elsewhere as ""The Trust,"" or ""The Octopus""), but it is also to give the reader a sense of just how powerful and all-encompassing this top-down drug syndicate really has been. The best examples of the use of its powers are presented as two ""asides"" to the main narrative of the book.The first example is a novel explanation of why Nixon's ""opening to China"" was so successful: According to theses authors, it was because the skids were greased by (Hofjuden) Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy (on behalf of the Crown rather than on behalf of USG in his role as Secretary of State), where it was agreed that the West would cover-up rather than expose the Communist Chinese leadership's long-term involvement in, and profits from, the British opium and heroin trade.To say the least, and for all the obvious reasons, Kissinger went ballistics over the book's allegations generally, but particularly over its characterization of him as being an ""in-house Royal Jew"" and a ""double agent"" at the same time.The second example is the assassination of JFK, which the book claims was simply an unfortunate instance in which the Kennedy family had used up its ""get-out-of-trouble-free-cards,"" having once again run afoul of the rules of the game and the interests of the Crown, and thus suffered the expected consequences. The Kennedy's were heavily in debt to the crown as far back as when Joe Kennedy was running liquor for them during prohibition, before he was appointed Ambassador to England with the Crown's intervention, or was finally appointed to the job he would have died for, and the one that made him filthy rich: the first SEC Chairmanship.The reader may recall that Joe was later recalled to Washington for running afoul of the Crown by gushing over Hitler and indiscrete public comments about the UK's chances of losing the war. Then, to add insult to injury, a generation later, the Kennedy sons screwed-up the Bay of Pigs invasion by not providing Air cover, threatened to abolish the Federal Reserve, went after the mob with a vengeance, and then JFK decided to secretly ""kiss and make up"" with both Khrushchev and Castro after the Cuban Missile Crisis, but behind Britain's back. The last of these, apparently was the final straw that broke the camel's back. So JFK had to go. End of the JFK assassination story.But what is most fascinating about this rendition is that within the context of the syndicate apparatus, the JFK assassination was nothing special? It was a routine off-the shelf operation: Colonel Clay Shaw, a functionary of the Crown, in addition to being both a CIA and a Mossad asset, was placed in charge of the operation. Guy Bannister, a veteran of the FBI's Division five, also a crown mole, along with David Ferry, were in charge of manipulating the pasty, Lee Harvey Oswald. Major Bloomfield, a functionary of the  Brofman gang out of Toronto, was responsible for the logistics of getting the funds into Permindex to pay the hit men and ferrying them in and out of the U.S. William Harvey, of the CIA hired two or three Corsicans and had them flown in via Mexico for the hit and the evil deed was done. End of story.What is so remarkable about these two examples is that both are minor details: utterly unremarkable asides to the main narrative of the book, a narrative that is neither about the JFK assassination nor about Nixon's China policy, per se, but about how they both got caught up in the larger much more powerful machinery of the Crown's drug trafficking apparatus.Oddly, and somewhat paradoxically, the very fact that the JFK assassination was a mere aside to a larger story, that Garrison's investigations fits into perfectly, lends independent credibility to Jim Garrison's findings. Indeed, is it not reasonable to ask: how is it that the Garrison details just happen to fit so perfectly into a seemingly independent and unrelated story about the history of the drug trade? ... Unless, perhaps that is, those details, somehow, just happen to be very close to the truth?Add to this the fact that the people who succeeded in scuttling Garrison's investigation (in favor of the very flawed fairy tale called the Warren Commission Report), are also the same ones who prevented this book from being circulated for more than a decade, and it is easy to conclude that maybe some very powerful people feared this book was on the trail of the truth?But a word of warning is in order for potential readers: Just like all of the JFK assassination stories and theories, this one too is heavy on self-confirming conspiratorial details, and at critical junctures, also, is very short on independently verifiable facts. However, it must also be said that this manuscript is still light years ahead of any others out in the JFK conspiratorial ether.This is true in part because it is cogent, has a context, can be confirmed or denied after the fact, and most important of all in my view: for no reason at all beyond its apparent validity, it just happened to confirm every detail of Jim Garrison's carefully scuttled investigation, and yet, somehow, it falls perfectly into place in the history of the international drug trade. Now what are the chances this would happen if the theory Garrison put forth were not mostly true?

"These two intellectual heavy-weights have combined their efforts to good effect in studying the universe and its history. With the idea of making mid-course corrections to the more obvious flaws in the way our fragmented studies and thinking about cosmology have failed to adequately convey the full significance of what cosmologists have learned about the implications of the wholeness of the world, these authors offer several brave alternatives that attempt to address these flaws.And while you may not always agree with them -- as they do not even always agree on the details themselves -- they do agree that the intellectual tools are available to develop another better way of thinking about these issues. These tools are deployed and are on vivid display in this fine two-sided exposition.Having read and reviewed two of Professor Smolin's books and five of Professor Unger's books, I know that both prefer to always first begin by grounding their theories in at least kernels of empirical truths, truths that lie close to the ground, near the root nodes of our empirical and philosophical understandings. In the present case those kernels of truths are: the fact that the universe is (1) whole (i.e., a complete unit not to be confused with one of its sub-parts); (2) relational (i.e., its order and its orderings are relational); and (3) that the universe has a history (i.e., time is inclusively real).That the fundamental order of the universe, as well as the fundamental ordering of things within it, is relational, is taken as a demonstrable given, an axiom needing no further justification. As well, seeing the universe as a singular whole that has evolved over time is also taken as axiomatic, but is one that also inevitably leads to the importance of understanding why ""becoming"" must take priority and primacy over ""being;"" why process must take precedence over function and structure; and indeed, I would argue, it also suggests why change is the only constant process in the universe.That change is the only constant process in a universe with a history, also implies that even the laws of nature themselves are mutable since they too inevitably must have evolved out of the big bang, taking on very different forms as the univers cooled, and thus must still be evolving along with all other evolving processes, functions and structures within the universe. In a similar way, having a history, necessarily implies that time itself -- the tool used to reckon history -- is inclusively real rather than a mere external artifact of our system of measurement and mathematics.These are all new ideas that have not heretofore been examined and explored carefully in the field of Cosmology.Under Unger's updated re-formulation of the Philosophy of Naturalism, which he calls ""temporal naturalism,"" ""newness"" becomes a natural emergent property of change: it is merely nature at work, and thus is simply a property that inheres in all change or evolutionary processes.It reminds me of David Bohm's example of whirling eddies in a liquid, where new forms, structures and processes are constantly ""coming into"" and ""going out of being"" as they morph in and out of different structures, functions and forms continuously. Thus, in a universe where change is the only constant, the emergence of new forms is the rule rather than the exception.These authors argue rather persuasively, that the science of cosmology cannot just be a reductionist Newtonian accordion, a machine scaled-up to relativistic speeds and sizes when needed, on the one hand, and then scaled-down and squeezed to quantum level details when needed, on the other. They both make the point that Physics is not just about the study of local particles, and their properties, or just about the subsystems and sub-functions of the universe. Were this the only view of cosmology, then there would be no way of accounting for the laws of nature or of the initial conditions that set the universe into motion, or indeed for the mathematics used to describe them. While all these may be seen as external to a family of hypothetical universes, they cannot be seen as external to our singular world, one that just happens to have a history, and of which these three are mere attributes, or sub-parts.If we are to ever answer questions about the inclusivity -- of the laws of nature, the nature of mathematics, or the initial conditions of our unitary singular universe (with a history) -- we are going to need ""a bigger philosophical boat,"" one that takes into account the wholeness of the universe, and one that is at the same time open to empirical confirmation and falsification.Here in 500 pages, presented in two separate but mirror image parts, one dealing with new approaches to the philosophy of cosmology, and the other dealing more with the physics of cosmology, we have a double-barreled shot at the rudiments of a new bigger, wider, deeper philosophical boat. And while it does not always make for easy reading, it nonetheless makes an impressive if only a modest dent in forging a new way forward, a new way of seeing and understanding what we already know about how the universe works.The bravery of having embarked on such a joint enterprise itself is surely worthy of five stars. But the fact that it also involves too mavericks going about their day-to-day work in their respective research fields, makes their discoveries like a chess move that requires both a question mark and an explanation point: Only further developments will ""tell"" whether their respective suggestions have been good or a bad moves. Only time will tell how important a contribution this new foray into philosophy and physics has really been. Undoubtedly it will excite and shake up the kibitzers!As but one note, since I have already used up my space, I was unconvinced by the heuristic Professor Unger's used as a guiding light to solve the ""multiple universe"" problem. I failed to see any value-added in crossing the threshold from finite to infinite simply by changing the direction of the history in which the train of multiple universes entered the picture?Surely at some level it is no different than approaching the limits of a convergent or a divergent mathematical series in calculus, or indeed rehearsing the Tortoise and the hare race of Zeno's famous paradox, or more to the point of the rest of the book, approaching (or leaving) the event horizon of a black hole. Steven Hawking has examined these issues ad nauseam and has, far as I can tell, continued to finesse theses issues in the accepted (but flawed) way.It seems to me that no matter from what side the infinite universes problem is approached, you cannot sneak up on the point at which the finite finally goes over to becoming infinite or vice versa -- whether or not the history of the universe you are in is finite and is involved. I get the point that these things cannot, in the end, just continue to be finessed and left undiscussed, but I think the kind of brain power needed is that on the order of Gregor Cantor, who spent the latter half of his mathematical life dealing with these issues. And what he taught us is that you cannot sneak up on that particular problem: Going from the finite to the infinite, at least in Cantor's case, always involved a quantum leap, a paradigm shift into a new mindset, as it were, not a more careful peek at the last few numbers before (or after) the shift. We finessed that in mathematical induction too, but there it worked only because when a series converges, it is like cheating: we knew that the process was so orderly that nothing untoward could happen in the gap between the finite and the infinite.

"Celebrating 25 years since their first release, ""Another Mayberry"", the band returns with another killer offering. 11 great new tracks produced by Grammy Award-winning multi-instrumentalist Steve Jordan  “Black Beehive” sees the band strengthening their roots while moving forward at the same time.Classic blues based instrumentation and Todd Mohr’s stylistic vocals, a fusion of several other genres such as country, rock and folk music “Black Beehive” is a melting pot of styles and sounds which will appeal to a variety of listeners both young and old.The album features several guest performers including guitarist Ronnie Baker Brooks and long time Howlin’ Wolf band member Eddie Shaw on Saxophone and harmonica.There are funky slide guitar workouts like ""Seven State Lines,"" along with a salute to the great Howlin' Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin on “Hubert’s Dream”, they have also returned to some of the easy, breezy melodic songwriting of their past which suits me fine.Mohr, Brian Nevin, Rob Squires and Jeremy Lawton return to the group’s laidback, jazz-inflected persona without losing their heightened awareness of the blues.This one has it all.I read...""There’s a topical feel to Black Beehive, as Mohr delves into issues both large (the Arab Spring uprisings, in “We Won’t Go Back”; the recent economic meltdown, in “Fear, Greed and Ignorance”) and small (Amy Winehouse’s sudden death, in the title track), but also a personal one, as Mohr explores the wonders outside our world “Everything About You”, and life’s strange coincidences “Forgive Me Bonnie”.""Almost a 3 year gap between this album and the bands previous release “100 Years of Robert Johnson” definitely worth the wait as both acoustic and electric instrumentation coupled with Todd Mohr’s stylistic vocals make this a must have for any BHT fan.There's storytelling and intimate admissions, serenading, splitting guitar solos,infectious melodic material, yes, this is musical love at its best,soulful and intense !","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MT04O9IIKZJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB77QHK#wasThisHelpful","R2MT04O9IIKZJ6","A5R336VHUTPQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5R336VHUTPQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Royal Sessions,” finds Paul Rodgers paying tribute to the sounds of Memphis with a set of classic covers recorded in one of the city’s best-loved studios “Royal Studios”, the historic home of Willie Mitchell and “Hi Records” and surrounded by some of the greatest Memphis sidemen musicians in the history of Memphis soul. Covers of great classics by the likes of Issac Hayes, David Porter, Albert King, Otis Redding, Smokey Robinson and Warren Moore and Ann Peebles to name a few.Many of the musicians who played on the original hit songs appear on the tracks of ""The Royal Sessions”. His band including organist Reverend Charles Hodges, guitarist Michael Tolls, bassist LeRoy Hodges Jr., keyboardist “Hubby” Archie Turner, the Royal Horns and the Royal Singers and drummers Steve Potts and James Robertson Sr. deliver the spirit that is Memphis.The studio became available for Rodgers and producer Perry Margouleff to set up shop in the building and record with such a talented band, this was an opportunity too sweet to resist for Rogers. The opportunity to record in such a hallowed place with musicians he considered personal heroes was a dream come true.“The Memphis players forged an immediate bond when presented with Roger’s formidable talent and sincere love of the songs. Deeply felt, powerfully sung and expertly played, it features a cross-section of material hand-picked by Rodgers, songs of great historical significance and personal meaning. “My favorite, Otis Redding’s “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long”, Rogers simply put, steps right into Redding’s injury, into his heartbroken spirit, and he makes those feelings his very own. What a performance.Every one of these songs has an intensity of character, and Rodgers interprets so much from each and every one.  Isaac Hayes , a scorchingly sensual “I Thank You”; “Walk on By,” dissolves into a bubbling cauldron of hurt, Ann Peebles “I Can’t Stand the Rain,” is given a hearty howl, there’s also a romp and strut through “Born Under a Bad Sign”. But this is not just a Memphis music tribute it is also an Otis Redding tribute and a very special one.I enjoyed ZZtop’s version of Issac Hayes, “I Thank You” and this take by Rogers ranks right up there along with it.""The Royal Sessions"" is a remarkable project and a must have to add to your Paul Roger’s library of classics. “The Voice” has done it again. This one is special.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSNP4APSMUG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJ7CSHG#wasThisHelpful","R3JSNP4APSMUG3","A5R336VHUTPQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5R336VHUTPQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Songs of turmoil and pain, clever storytelling by Robin. The vocals are soulful and gritty, sultry and sensual. It's blues, R&B and soul interlaced with some fine jazz sensibilities.

""She appropriately wraps herself vocally and emotionally around each and every track.""""Drunkard’s Alley"" this is an up-tempo piano-based blues number, ""Color-Blind Angel"" is a deep, mournful, slow blues written in tribute to the life of Viola Luizzo,  and the title track ""Treat Me Right"" is a swinging take on an old B.B. King tune.“Can You Hear Me Now” is a mid-tempo blues rocker,  “Nobody Stays” has a lilting raspy tone that matches her resignation to her series of failed relationships. Songs from the heart, sadness and emotion laced through the lyrics, this one brings it home in many ways.The sounds are easy and real, precise melodies to compliment the singer's personality.

"Tim ""Too Slim"" Langford, it's been a while since his last solo effort. Just Tim, himself with various acoustic and electric instruments, and he's made sure the wait was worthwhile. He performs admirably on all instruments from acoustic guitar, Dobro and bass to harmonica, ukulele and programmed drums.This one is a soothing Slim experience, cool ambiance, soothing vocals and the usual unexpected twists and turns that are signature Tim Langford, I love it.Slim has been around quite some time, one of the most popular bands in the US Pacific Northwest over the last twenty years. His blues and rockabilly outfit Too Slim & The Taildraggers have amassed an extensive catalog of recorded material during that time.This one offers 11 original songs, ""it's a semi-acoustic project fusing blues and folk-oriented styles with rootsy Americana music similar to that of Ry Cooder and Tony Joe White.""The music has a deep south feel to it, a kick back and slip off your shoes kinda feel. The storytelling pace is reminiscent of Lou Reed to me, but that is as far as it goes of course, two distinct genres and artists.I read...""Three Chords,"" Langford plays the acoustic guitar like it was an extension of his hands. He produces a deep beat that resonates throughout the song. This song sounds melancholy, but a little upbeat sound within it makes listeners feel better."" I agree, I felt it, I heard the message.An upbeat and happy song is ""Princeville Serenade"", with its cheerily strummed ukulele, the title tune ""Broken Halo"" rolls out a slinky blues-rock groove, almost Dylan-ish.""If you want music that you can listen to, while driving somewhere far, or when its raining outside, you should listen to Broken Halo, by Tim ""Too Slim"" Langford. His new solo album should not be missed. It is a treat to the listener's soul.""Slim is a craftsman, a true ambassador of the blues in his own way.

"I love this CD. Pure rock fury at its best.I read...""Pete Brasino has been playing his rock & roll-flavored brand of blues ever since he was in high school. He began to teach himself to play guitar as a 16-year-old and within six months he had become so proficient with the instrument that his classmates dubbed him Guitar Pete — the nickname that would become his performing name.""If you love ZZtop you will love Guitar Pete's ""Bad Intentions"". The style and vocals  remind me of a cross between Frank Zappa, Leslie West and Billy Gibbons, doused in Leslie West/Gibbons guitar licks. Cool tunes.The ramblin' guitar intro  of ""Snake Pit"" brings to mind ZZtop's ""Jesus Just Left Chicago"", with a slight Guitar Pete twist which is always over the top. The man is a fearless guitar warrior with a dominating style which will leave your eardrums humming long after the first intro. The tunes just keep rollin', pure perfection.This CD is a true rear and frontal assault of your senses so get prepared to rock ! Pete has ""Bad Intentions"" right from the opening note, bad real bad. What can I say, to sum it up every song is a winner.Known for his heavy metal style and ""axe attack"", Pete has a few albums/Cds behind him. This latest in my opinion ranks up top, breaking from his usual sonic, show no mercy style.

"""A Hiding Place"" is the second album from German retro rockers Zodiac, following 2012's well-received ""A Bit of Devil"".Full of catchy '70s sounds with the coolest of vocals & ripping guitar playing.A Hiding Place kicks off rather safely with the upbeat rocker ""Downtown"", a solid  blues rock/classic rock track, a bit laid back to me as compared to the first album's material, but then the band delivers the impeccably crafted seven-minute ""Free,"" with '70s styled blues rock guitars, powerful vocals, & Deep Purplesque influenced Hammond organ swirling about the mix, sure enough to have `future live classic' written all over it.Van Delft's guitar sets the pace through much of the album driving it forward as he plays a tight balancing act between melodic simplicity and frantic technicality, allowing the songs to evolve naturally.""Believer"" has a bluesy, swirling, psychedelic feel and some emotional guitar licks. Speaking of great guitar work, there is plenty to be found on the rumbling two part rocker ""I Wanna Know"", as well as the distortion laced cover of Neil Young's classic ""Cortez the Killer"".Staying away from ""sonic overkill "", leaning more towards warm and inviting, the songs classically unfold. It's a rock album, and a damn good one at that.Hey, it's not hard to really like this band & album if you dig vintage sounds. It is no surprise to say that Zodiac are hardly original, but what they are is tight and armed with an arsenal of great tunes that you'll remember once the album finishes. The band was able to capture a warm and clear sound, which I feel will grow on the listener with each playing.What's next ? Let's wait and see.

"I just recently came across this performer in my perusing of my internet trail of new and old artists. I can be like a bloodhound when I get on the scent of something good and this album is just that...sooo good!This Detroit-area guitarist deftly weaves the blues, his guitar soloing carries subtle jazz undertones, restrained without overpowering the vocals which are top notch. He has a John Scofield playing style but likes to mix it up a bit by exploring and interpreting funk, jazz and rock guitar styles. The record is an eclectic collection of all original music that explores many facets of Al-Saadi's influences.In Guitar World magazine (November 2006) Al-Saadi was heralded as sounding like ""Danny Gatton and Buddy Guy at their best."" With comparisons like that I definitely had to give him a listen.This was his first release and the Ann Arbor, Michigan performer, a talented instrumentalist and singer-songwriter puts it out there for all to enjoy. This is soulful Rockin' Blues at its best.The album features a dream-band of musicians such as Jim Keltner (Drums), Leland Sklar (Bass), Larry Goldings (Hammond B-3), Jimmy Vivino (Rhythm Gtr/ Backing Vox), Tom Scott (Sax), Lee Thornburg (Tpt), Brandon Fields (Bari Sax), Nick Lane (Trombone / Horn Arranger) to name a few.This CD has a great variety of sounds and songs with such a good flow to them. Laith has the technical prowess of a Jazz musician without compromising the feel for the Blues. His vocals are pure, a veritable treat for your ears. His ""Who Turned Out The Lights"" puts me in mind of Robert Cray, just a little bit lower than Robert's vocal range. ""Circle"" is one of my favorites, I love the guitar break in this one, having a Hendrix kind of echo to it without the effects and an Adrian Gurvitz style, clean and crisp...nice.I read...""His love of soul shines on the silky ""If,"" and his guitar soloing carries subtle jazz undertones on ""Who Turned Out the Lights?"" But the velvety flow of album opener ""Breathe"" and the grave strut of ""Mystified"" show that blues is what makes Al-Saadi's soul sing."" I totally agree.

"Update: 5 stars as of today.  this is a really good book!I like this well laid out and designed book, Building a Shed  (Build Like a Pro Series) by Joseph Truini.  I feel good enough about it to give it Four Stars, after going through the book last night.  I will keep it in my bookshelf for those resources I want to have close at hand to reach for when I just want to look through and enjoy the pictures of the many out buildings that are given here as examples.  It always gives me some good ideas for a building project, other than a shed, as the drawings and pictures put forward many other beginnings of other projects one would see on these pages, laid out for one to pick up and go with. Now I have found at least two outdoor projects I would like to build in the back yard.  Several of the illustrations Mr. Truini gives, are right for what I will need and his pictorials of building actual projects are helpful. This is a good buy if you are interested in building or even if you only want to see what has been built before.  With a little effort and good use of the tools you will want to own, you can come up with what you are looking for in a shed or out building. I am familiar with this publisher and feel like the Taunton series of building books offered are the best of the many on the subjects offered, of which the Fine Woodworking books and offerings are in my opinion, the best.  Mr. Truini offers many of his talents and knowledge up for just a little bit of money spent so the buyer can build like a pro.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257CAOIHO6YLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561586196#wasThisHelpful","R257CAOIHO6YLI","A3L1VJMHFWONCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1VJMHFWONCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this paperback ""idea"" book to try and come up with an outdoor shop and to do some woodworking I no longer have space to do in my Garage, where over time I have accumulated way too much stuff.  Also I could store some wood and get out of the house a little more.  This book, Sheds & Garages, is a good source for the ideas I am looking for and with the other three, I have determined a shed with some additions that will let in more light, as it will be under some trees in the yard. Most of the project ideas in this book include mini plans, which are enough for me to build with and at the back of this book are many plans you can purchase for the larger buildings.  Plan prices start at $20 and go up to $300+.  I like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F57QWVHOIB8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037601377X#wasThisHelpful","R2F57QWVHOIB8C","A3L1VJMHFWONCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1VJMHFWONCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in the area where this movie is being played out in the plot.  The use of Tig Notaro in this plot is both funny and tragic.  Any story where one looses a mother or father is tragic enough without having the main character dealing with the loss also suffering from just having a double mastectomy and being both physically weak and emotionally wounded.  Funny and Sad at the same time.

"After ordering a couple of SSRs and heat sinks, I found I couldn't find my heat transfer grease.  I ordered these  Banggood New 30g Grey Thermal Grease Paste Compound Silicone For CPU Heatsink Heat Sink, so I could go ahead and mount the SSRs to the heat sinks.  It is a convenient offering of grease, as it can be applied and used without getting out an applicator to spoon it out of a jar or can.  It can become a mess if you have to spread it around much, before assembly and this tube dispenser is easy to put it right where it is needed and if it is too thick, I just use the side of the tube and wipe it off afterward.

"I purchased this 220V 10A SPDT Nonslip Metal Momentary Electric Power Foot Pedal Switch from Amico, to use in a project to build a battery spot welder from a Westinghouse transformer, designed to power a welder.  It was a good bargain for the $5.50 paid with no shipping costs as a Prime Member with Amazon.  The plastic housing is a concern as it will be used by foot when making the spot weld and the short lead cable of about 6 inches will need to be replaced with a longer cable for make up to the Project box.  I am trying to keep from spending any more money than is absolutely necessary, after purchase of the transformer, rather than using an old Microwave Transformer that would need to be modified to get a similar voltage and current needed for a spot weld.  It is very light weight with a small 2+ inch pin as the hinge, that may not take too many repeated pushes on the foot switch.  If it performs well enough, I will return to this review and up the Stars to 4 or more, as needed.  It's OK.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVWX0HM4O4UQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWFTCYW#wasThisHelpful","RUVWX0HM4O4UQ","A3L1VJMHFWONCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1VJMHFWONCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, a 6 pack of these LED bulbs, it's a reasonable cost for these Led bulbs, comparable to any offering of 6-60watt equivalents.  They have a nice warm light for the living room and my cave- work room above the garage.  The bulb in the lamp or fixture looks most like an incandescent bulb when on, and the bulb draws a eco friendly ac wattage, checked on my killiwatt useage device at around 9.5 to 10watts, based on how long they have been on.

"I've been following this product for a while now.  Did you notice I am the only one who has reviewed the XSES-500 watt Solar Generator?  Well, there are a couple ways you can check up on a product and one is Amazon.  I f there is a listing and it has no reviews, it is a good sign that the product is over priced for what you get.  There are quite a few really well designed solar battery storage generators and have been for years.  Now with the better electronics and solar panels like the monocrystalline devised panels the generators can constantly charge lithium ironsulphate batteries of various Amp hours of storage.  The really professional units like, Movie studios utilize and most solar companies produce, using their own solar panels and Solar generators that are basically a combined collection of several parts normally found in home solar setups.  These self contained, portable units are usually comprised of Sealed Lead Acid Batteries in the past and now mostly Lithium based superior battery systems,  Power Inverters which changes DC Electricity to AC for use with cameras and lighting, charge controllers and protection circuitry, digital displays of Voltage & Charge Status, combinations of USB, DC and AC outlets and switches to control on and off, monitoring of storage capacity and charge indication.  Usually a cart or a dolly with wheels for portability allows the units to be moved from transportation to utilization on the job.  Much has changed with the improvements of the lithium charging and protection circuitry that is easily available.  One can design their own generator for much less than the expensive units sold to the pros who require a guarantee of reliability.  This unit is not represented by the reviews commonly associated with a widely successful product, thus the three star rating it deserves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R276J0CNP3ATSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0114Y4RU4#wasThisHelpful","R276J0CNP3ATSW","A3L1VJMHFWONCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1VJMHFWONCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The use of these paper lanterns with Leds is much better than with a 120vac powered light string, as the leds do not get hot enough to burn paper where there is always a chance of that with the ac voltage light bulbs.  These are about the right size for a standing lamp also and will glow enough with the lower lumens of the led to give ambiance and shadow for an evening light source in the background of the darkened porch area.

"I purchased a couple of these lights, mainly due to not really understanding what they were and what the designers were doing.  These are very unique bulbs, being both a light source in an AC socket and a backup light using the designed in battery for backup.  This bulb has a cover that comes with the unit that screws onto the threaded socked end and the switch can then turn on the light to be a flashlight(torch) source of light.  I am still amused and the light is warm white for use permanently in the house.  When I got the lights they worked, right out of the boxes, but I installed them in sockets to charge the batteries to the fullest level of charge.  I then turned them on to see how ling they would stay lighted, I gave up after an hour, as I became convinced this light would serve as a emergency light as needed.  I really like this product.  I is not armoured enough to use as a real flashlight, as it is plastic, but I have flashlights I like less than this light for the purpose!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36V6SBRJN4F2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R14E54A#wasThisHelpful","R36V6SBRJN4F2R","A3L1VJMHFWONCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1VJMHFWONCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Principles of Mechanism by Alex Vallance is a study resource for mechanics.  I give many old methods of mechanical design and equipment used in the past to perform work and transfer energy into work.  This will be obviously a trip into the past for anyone reading this material, but one can see where the designers of past equipment were coming from in design to get a piece of equipment built utilizing the engineering of the time and each of these designs were used effectively to provide the mechanical movement to accomplish a task.  Worth looking through, or even studying the concepts to learn something.  Worth the price I paid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O3HOWOOB0YRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003T20SFS#wasThisHelpful","R1O3HOWOOB0YRK","A3L1VJMHFWONCB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3L1VJMHFWONCB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, Handbook of Microcircuit Design and Application, by David F. Stout is dated from the early eighties and is still relevant, if you are learning or relearning electronics of microprocessor design.  Since this book has been written, Surface Mounted Devices has brought the design of electronics further along and much of this text has had many examples of more modern use of electronics advancement supersede it.  It can still be a source of learning, as the basics are here and can be applied successfully in a learning process, just not taken as how things are now designed.

I removed the two ended studs from the perch branches and reversed them to go into the predrilled holes in the top of the coat rack.

"When I ordered these COSMOS ® 5 PCS White cotton sports basketball headband / sweatband head sweat band/brace, I wasn't expecting much, just a sembalence of a head band and it is a little better than that.  I ordered the solid white, to avoid any color problems and they are good for what I wanted, to stop my toxic sweat from going into my eyes during warm weather activity and yard work.  I don't look even a little cool, so it is functionality I am going for and these are good or that.  If they hold up through a few washings, I'll revisit this review and give them another star.

"The TurnRaise Aromatherapy Oil Diffuser Ionizer Air Humidifier has a really cool design and shape. The diffuser emits a steady mist which fills the air with the fragrance of your favorite essential oil giving a soothing and calming effect. This oil diffuser is prefect for refreshing the room and cleaning the air with just some essential oil and water. I use tea tree oil in cold season to protect my family from all the cold and flu virus. I use lavender oil during night time in my bedroom, to help relax me before bed. I always prefer using natural ingredients to refresh the room and not the chemical filed room fresheners. I'm allergic to most room fresheners. The oil diffuser is very easy to use. Just fill the water less than 160 ml in the water tank with the measuring cup, add 3-5 drops of essential oil, screw the top back in place and switch ON the diffuser. I was amazed as it just took couple of seconds to start the mist. This diffuser uses ultrasonic waves to instantly vaporize water and essential oil in the tank to produce a cool, dry fragrant mist. The diffuser shuts off automatically if the water tank is empty. The light can be set to soft color changing, fixed at one color or can be switched OFF. The brightness of the light can be adjusted and can also be used as a night light! There is also an option to select continuous mist with a timer or intermittent mist (will switch ON/OFF every 15 seconds).Packaging Includes ::Woodgrain Aromatherapy DiffuserAC AdapterMeasuring CupManualThe is easy to use and easy to clean too.

"I love the Dare family series and have been eagerly waiting for a Max and Lucy's story. This is a bit of a friends to lovers story since Max and Lucy have know each other since their youth. They have also secretly (for Max) and not so secretly (for Lucy) been in love with each other for almost as long. Sadly, tragedy in their respective lives pulled them apart and Lucy's desire to distance herself from love, even the love of her siblings, drives her from NY to CA. But a wedding and a new restaurant brings Lucy back to New York and back into Max's life. And Max is ready to fight for the heart of the woman he has always loved and will blow through every single one of her defenses in the process.Dare to Seduce definitely contained Phillips' usual hotness quotient for this series, and I enjoyed seeing the couple heal each other through their love for one another. I especially enjoyed how Lucy encouraged Max to repair the rift between his parents and himself. She was there for him even when ""there"" put her in close proximity to the life she had with her parents before their deaths.Although I enjoyed the story, it is not among my top favorites of the series. Even though Lucy embraced and acknowledged her love for Max when he was injured I didn't feel a deep emotional connection between the couple as I felt for the other Dare couples. Lucy and Max's story missed that spark for me. I liked their love story but I didn't love it and was hoping for a bit ... more.That said, the Dare series is still one of my favorite family saga series and I cannot wait to see who's up next for this very eclectic family.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K3B2CFTNYMPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194228876X#wasThisHelpful","R3K3B2CFTNYMPI","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a debut novel for West, I believe that Wolf Bait was a well done story. Those who have read romances like FSoG and the Crossfire series will find the similar trope of an older more experienced man who is paired with a younger and far less experienced (read: virginal) woman. Although the theme is familiar, I think West did a good job creating a distinguishable story.Abbi Mitchell is a young and impressionable woman or high morals. She is in college and engaged to her childhood sweetheart, a preacher's son, when she discovers that he committed the ultimate betrayal. Using the excuse of ""sowing wild oats"" before he marries Abbi, he puts a pause to their relationship so he can see (and have copious amounts of sex with) other women. Abbi is devastated and heartbroken. Needed to get away from anywhere near a life that reminds her of him, she applies for a job at a high end resort in Alaska. Never imagining that she would get the job because of her lack of experience in the hospitality industry, Abbi is pleasantly surprised when she is offered the job. Escape. Freedom. Abbi is on her way to Alaska and straight into the wolf's den.Well, that is Henry Wolf's den...errr...hotel.Henry Wolf is rich, successful, and GORGEOUS and Abbi cannot help her instant attraction to him when she just thinks he's a sexy lumberjack. Yet, her attractions ramps up more when the lumberjack turns in the suave businessman that he is. Sparks begin to fly immediately between the pair, but Abbi is certain that her feelings of attraction are one-sided. Wolf often runs hot and cold with her. Awakening her desires with his burning gaze one moment, and then freezing her out with his cool disposition the next. But Wolf is fighting his desire for Abbi because of something that isn't revealed to the reader until the end of the story. Yes, it ends on the cliffy. And yes, Abbi is once again devastated. But, I cannot wait to see what West does to redeem Wolf and restore Abbi's confidence in men.Wolf Bait was an easy read with lots of sexy bits included in it. If you're looking for a new-to-you author, definitely check this one out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VYJ25X8GKAJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017S3J3X6#wasThisHelpful","R3VYJ25X8GKAJ2","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I feel supremely deficient giving this book. As with other reviews I might have provided my personal brand of recap for the story but I cannot and will not do that with Christian. There was soooooo (yes, the ""Os"" are important) embedded in this story that I would be provide a woefully inadequate recap of all the goings on.What I will say is that this series has not lost its potency. In fact, I would assert that it's only gotten more so as the battle with the Europeans ramps up. Reynolds dialed it way up with Christian's story. Book 10 in the Vampires in America series is rife with deception, subterfuge, alliances, and Reynold's trademark alpha male lord and a smart and sassy woman who manages to ""tame"" him. I loved the dynamic between Christian and Natalie. Sparks flew between them from the very beginning of the story. And although Natalie at first seems like an atypical heroine for Reynolds, her brand of strong heroine quickly shines through as she races toward helping Christian find out what's really happening with Anthony, the lord of the South. I really enjoyed how the story was crafted around Anthony and his ascension to being the Southern Lord after Jabril's ""retirement."" You didn't much about the southern territory after Jabril, which was book 2 of the series, and I kind of put it out of my mind as ""story over"" after that. I was supremely impressed by how the territory was reintegrated into my mind. Christian is an unlikely contender for the southern territory since he was one of the Europeans who was sired by Raphael's enemy Mathilde (that story occurs in Deception). Needless to say, not one of Raphael's allies trusted Christian's emergence onto the America vampire scene, but Raphael, ever the strategist, saw how much of an ally that Christian could and would be to him.This story was expertly written, and the twists and turns and bad guys popping up left and right, left me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire story. And can I just add that the little the teaser at the end about Sophia will you desperate to know ""what's next"".I am loving the direction that Reynolds is taking with the series and it's absolutely one of my favorites and one that I highly recommend to vampire romance lovers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDNOL7OUGSE37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016N8JOMC#wasThisHelpful","RDNOL7OUGSE37","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although this serial collection had the bones of a great read it felt disjointed and spastic in many spots so my enjoyment diminished a bit.

"I love Rosanna Leo's paranormal romances. She has a very imaginative and innovative spin on commonly written about paranormals. Her newest release, ""Night Lover"" is no different in that regard. Leo takes the theme of an incubus, a male sex demon, and kicks it up to the next level mixing in jumps to the past so you can see how his story all began. The incubus in this story, Hugh Dawlish, is rakishly sexy and mercilessly tantalizes the heroine of the story, Renata Bruno. Dawlish visits Renata in her dreams and masters her body but also manages to capture a piece of her heart as well. There are just two problems with that: Hugh is a 200 year old ghost and Renata's ex Finn Mackenzie comes blazing back into her life and he wants her for himself. As Renata battles her sanity, and her heart, she definitely learns that things are not as they seem, and there is a malignant darkness hunting for not her body or her heart, but for her very soul.Night Lover was very sexy and the story was unique. The characters were so well done that I was conflicted at one point. I didn't know whether I wanted Hugh or Finn to win Renata's heart. I loved the climax of the story because the character redemption was sweet. I was hoping for a but more WOW when it came to vanquishing the evil, but it worked solidly with the story. The only thing I had a mild issue with was the jumps back and forth in time. They didn't feel as smooth as they could have been. Once I discovered their rhythm the story was a much easier read.Overall, I enjoyed the story very much. Leo's interpretation of an incubus was one that I enjoyed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WN5XSRY984YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TMOHT2#wasThisHelpful","R2WN5XSRY984YD","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elizabeth Hunterhas an amazing gift to weave an interesting story that is intricate and highly multifaceted. For me, Desert Bound was no different in that regard. Desert Bound focuses centrally on Alex McCann and Teodora ‘Ted’ Vasquez (who you can find out more about in their introduction in Five Mornings: A Cambio Springs Short Story. Alex and Ted had more than a contentious relationship. They went from a young love that grew to much more to near enemies after Ted feels betrayed and abandoned by Alex for pursuing his career over her. Ted returns to their home to begin her medical practice while Alex is living the life of a business mogul in Los Angeles. But things aren't always as they appear on the surface. Alex has never stopped loving Ted and his return to Cambio Springs is more than just a business venture. He wants to win back his girl. But Ted isn't making things easy for Alex; however fate sends a little nudge in the couple's favor but causing situations that throw them together. A lot of siuatioms, too.Desert Bound is definitely rife with mystery and suspense and there is a lot going on with secondary and tertiary characters that you don't want to miss. I love how Hunter connected the threads of this story into a vividly intriguing tapestry that kept the reader fully engaged in wanting to know what would happen next. The epilogue beautifully sets the stage for Waking Hearts, Ollie and Allie's journey to a happily ever after. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189I07X0M8CYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1D8A2I#wasThisHelpful","R189I07X0M8CYK","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Tammy Falkner fans will this newest release in her Reed Brothers series. We meet Ryan toward the end of [book:While We Waited|24951809]. He is a new artist at the Reed's shop and also gains the immediate attention of Lark, one of the Zeroes. Ryan is hearing impaired and holds firm to his rule of not dating only hearing impaired women -- that is until he meets Lark. Although the story was not overly hawt, like some of the other books in the series, it was seductively sweet. I adored the story and Ryan and Lark's journey to love.Falkner definitely has a gift for pulling together unique characters from diverse situations and background to make the reader fall in love.  It's amazing to see how she has expanded the series that started out with a family of loyal brothers into a hoard of people who come from various backgrounds, experience real life challenges, but triumph because of their love and the community of people they have rallying behind them.This series is definitely a favorite and I highly recommend the Reed Brothers if you're looking for your next best read (and several amazing book boyfriends to choose from, too).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R396ZOSYCXQUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HAVEAY#wasThisHelpful","R396ZOSYCXQUX","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All the stories felt a bit too similar with me as far as the character types. Sure, the stories were all different in fashion but after reading three stories, it felt a bit formulaic for me.

"I have been a huge fan of Rosanna Leo's Gemini Island series since the first book. Each book drew you in with a storyline that was both sexy and interesting and characters that made you experience a whole range of emotions. But I have to say, the first few books in the series were light and fun. Soren's antics with Ryland were just hilarious. However, with the introduction of August Crane and the ""Alpha Brethren"" in Predator's Fire, the arc of the series began to grow more intense...darker even. I thought the intensity in Predator's Fire was as high as it would go for the series. There were some hair-raising moments but it was all smiles and happily-ever-afters at the end. Like I said, I'm a Rosanna Leo fan and her writing tends to lend itself to the lighter but sexy side of the spectrum, so I had a preconceived ending in mind when I started Predator's Trinity.I was WRONG. So VERY WRONG. This BOOK!!! I was absolutely blown away with Leo's writing in this one. Predator's Trinity still had one of Leo's essential style tenets: It was sexy! *Face fanning sexy*. Leo confesses that this is her first ever menage story and she did an exceptional job creating the triad relationship between brothers Percy and Byron Moon and Suzan March. The intimate times between them helped to bridge the more intense moments of the story with lighter and sexier interludes.I won't recant the story for you because I won't do it justice and this is one that you DEFINITELY need to read for yourself. There was so much crammed into those 140ish pages. Predator's Trinity was full of twists and turns that I was not expecting. In my head, I just ""knew"" how things were going to play out and I was completely wrong. Pleasantly surprised in one regard but so terribly devastated in another. The Gemini Island that we see in Predator's Trinity is not the same island that we first encountered in Predator's Kiss. There are no guests. There is no laughing. There is little joy. Things are dark and life is at risk because of the actions of the Alpha Brethren. Crane is a sick and twisted individual and all of his hidden secrets come out to play in this one. Predator's Trinity exposes a lot of information about his past. It also explains his freakish obsession with Suzi. In this one readers will encounter: new shifter types (there is one that will FREAK you the ""eff"" out), surprise connections, and devastating loss. I can say no more on that *sob*. But, this story will make your heart race and will shatter it into pieces too. Good doesn’t conquer evil unscathed in Predator's Trinity, but it does conquer it.At the end of the day the Gemini Island that remains is a shade of its former self but it is on the mend, as are its inhabitants. We are left with hope for the future in the new generation of shifters and in the new connections that were made. I am chomping at the bit to see what Leo does with the remaining books in this series. I am in awe and impressed by the level of depth and emotion that she conveys in her stories.All I can say is, ""WOW!!!"" about this series. Excellent job, Rosanna.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GLXUVUKE93UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0121M1ZQW#wasThisHelpful","R2GLXUVUKE93UO","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to give to L.P. Dover. For her very first paranormal romance, she did a stellar job! The characters were well crafted and had amazing stories to tell. I loved Bailey and adored Ryker *swoon*. There are classic villains in this story and some unexpected twists and turns that keep the story interesting and the pace fluid. There are also a ton of secondary characters that you will fall in love with. I especially cannot wait to read Sebastian's story (Bailey's protector). That boy and his brothers promise to bring swoon-worthy reads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D37XGB6EUCGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515398749#wasThisHelpful","R1D37XGB6EUCGQ","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first book by Kym Grosso but it won't be my last. I downloaded the free ebook as well as they Whispersync audio and enjoyed going back and forth between the two. The narrator did a good job conveying the story and it was enjoyable. I was a first cautious because it was a male narrator doing both the male and female parts but it was very well done. I liked the push/pull between Kade and Sydney. It was definitely more pushing and pulling on Kade's side because Sydney was definitely a tough girl who was not easily swayed. My only mild issue with the story was Sydney's oversexed persona. Every man in the story seemed to get her motor running -- her partner, Tony, Kade, the alpha wolf Tristan. They all seemed to make ""heat pool in her belly."" It made me roll my eyes; however once she and Kade got on solid footing, I enjoyed her character a whole lot more. The plot of the ritualistic killer on the hunt for power was intriguing and kept the story pacing interesting. I can't wait to read Luca's story next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D8LU49993VQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P6JJFY#wasThisHelpful","R2D8LU49993VQV","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved the story and the eff and flow of Everett and Layla's relationship. They seemed like the most unlikeliest of couples -- her all high class glamor and him with his gamer boy chic. Their differences aside, when they meet, it was kismet. They just knew they were mates and the passion between them was SERIOUS! There is also a bit of drama in the story that keeps it interesting and a crazy Effie who adds a humorous flavor. I'm hoping that North pairs Effie with Stryker.

"Once again some amazing storytelling from Bianca D'Arc in her continuing story arc from the Tales of Were/Redstone Clan series. I love how she has integrated the characters so that the series feels comprehensive and fluid. I  adored Matt and Morgan together and their story was a perfect pairing of intense and sexy moments. The plot of the Venifucus continues and their mission to bring back Elspeth the destroyer remains the primary driver of their actions. Although there are new players in Matt/Morgan's story, the arc connects beautifully with the other Redstone/Were books. There is a shocking reveal at the end of the story that had me screaming NOOOOOOOO!!! I cannot wait to see what's in store next.

"Paige Tyler does not let her fans down in the second installment of the SWAT series. Quite to the contrary. She even kicks it up a notch by adding a female werewolf to the story as the love interest of my most beloved Xander Riggs, senior corporal of the unit. Khaki Blake wasn't just Riggs ""The One,"" although it took him a reallllllly long time to accept that, she was a member of his unit which everyone knows is a no-no because of that no fraternization rule. Regardless of that fact, I love how Tyler worked the story -- conflict, sexual tension, and draHHHma in the form of a stalker ex. Everything worked out for Riggs and Khaki in the end but their happily ever after was full of bullet wounds and very clandestine loving. I cannot wait to read Becker's story but Cooper is definitely THE MAN to get a hold of :D.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4B3XJIFC9CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTWFVBM#wasThisHelpful","R3U4B3XJIFC9CC","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have enjoyed each of the books in the Dare series thus far. Each one provides a unique set of characters and interesting challenge(s) they must overcome as a couple to secure a happily ever after for themselves.In this respect, Avery Dare and Grey Kingston were no different.  Avery and Grey were high school sweethearts whose hearts called to like.  Grey and Avery were loners  -- both for very different reasons -- but that similarity is what connected them to one another.  Grey was a musician and a dreamer.  He was just waiting for the day he could leave his working class family (mother and stepfather) who he was actually ashamed of, and make a name for himself in the music world. He wanted to prove to his father,  whom he had a very strained relationship with before he died,  that he could in fact ""be somebody."" Although Grey's father didn't live to see his success, he achieved it and in a very big way.  Unfortunately,  his quest to outrun hid personal demons also caused him to run away from Avery in the process.  He left her...COLD...and never have her the chance on the choice to come along with him in his climb to the top. And,  it tore Avery up. Already having extreme abandonment issues due to her father's selfishness, Avery was heartbroken and closed herself off to serious relationships. But time does not dull the light of love. Grey was still very much in love with Avery and he wanted her back.  Only the adult Avery was more guarded and careful with her affections. But Grey was intent on having his girl back -- mind, body, and soul. However, things are never easy in the journey to happily ever after. Grey's swarmy record producer and a seriously crazy stalker almost thew a permanent wrench in Grey's plans to permanently reconcile with Avery.  Fortunately for him,  the adult Avery was also willing to fight for what she wanted, that is once she finally made up her mind about it.I absolutely adored Avery. She was actually one of the most muted Dare's in all the other Dare books. Sure, she had presence because she was the one who saved her half-sibling, Sienna's  life by donating bone marrow when she was a child.  We also knew that there was a story between her and the sexy rocker, yet she didn't stand out UNTIL THIS BOOK! Phillips did an exceptional job crafting a character that would tug on your heart strings and make you cheer for her, especially when you read her interactions with her father.  It broke my heart for her. But, I love how she confronted him when she found her strength, or rather tapped into her strength.  Although plagued by frequent panic attacks, Avery was stronger than she knew and it only took Grey's presence in her life to nudge that strength to the forefront.This book is definitely a Book Chick favorite!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRBFDKO9RPFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990584186#wasThisHelpful","R3RRBFDKO9RPFW","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rating: 3.5 🌟I am definitely enjoying the direction that Michele is taking with the series. It's full of twists and turns and super sexy. Although I enjoyed Max and Kenly's journey to a happy for now, I have to confess that I enjoyed Xavier and Zara's journey a bit more. Oh, don't get me wrong, I really liked the story and the connection between Max and Kenly. I suppose that I felt at times that TOO much was going on -- wolves, magic, a hidden identity, a lost crystal with powers,  a secret heritage. Normally, all that wouldn't be bad normally but because the story isn't terribly long it felt as if the reader was thrown a lot of detail with not a lot of time to absorb it. I suspect that will learn more in book 3 now that Nana O, Zara's grandmother and Kenly's grandmother's bestie, is back on the scene. Thor has been a fairly muted character so far but I look forward to reading his story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LY8IRTD52NTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PDD3FU#wasThisHelpful","R2LY8IRTD52NTF","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I typically prefer more contemporary romances but my one weakness and exception is stories about brawny Highlanders. I just adore them when they are well written -- the imagery,  the passion...the brogue *shiver*...all make for wonderfully engaging stories.  Fans of Karen Marie Monings Highlander series will fall in love with York's  Dundragon Time Travel Triolgy. You get a little bit of the old and a little bit of the new and they work in perfect harmony to create an amazing read. The story is not long at just under 150 pages but what IS there is a story with an intriguing plot line, multidimensional characters,  and a love that is potent enough to cross time and space. I loved the relationship between Dominic and Maggie. It was humorous, sexy, and intense...especially when the nefarious plot was revealed. There were some pretty close calls toward the end of the story but definitely work out in the end and there is most assuredly a happily ever after. I cannot wait to see what York has in store for Dominic's brother and Maggie's cousin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34UCIS415U4XQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EP0NT6#wasThisHelpful","R34UCIS415U4XQ","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The trope if this story will not be unfamiliar to romance readers. A sexy billionaire who is jaded by love but secretly wants it finds it with an unlikely and understated beauty. Throw in the elements of a secret wager and a well intentioned (and sweetly meddling) grandmother and you have this story.I enjoyed Nathan and Chloe together as a couple and their journey to finding love was rather sweet, although it felt a bit contrived. The powerful CEO in a haze of sickness becomes fixated on his one-day old temp. Chloe somehow equalled 'coolness' to Nathan's fevered mind and he wanted her near him. Chloe's temporary assignment of executive assistant morphs into nursemaid, and we all know what happens within close quarters in a romance right? Sparks begin to fly and passion heats up. Nathan and Chloe's working relationship quickly grows into more and soon enough they give in to the attraction between them. But as in any good tale, the road to a happily ever after is wrought with obstacles. There is a little wager that Chloe knows nothing about, Nathan's relationship with his father that is an albatross to him, and Chloe's reluctance to giving such a powerful and influential man her heart. Oh, there are other elements at play too but I recommend reading the story for yourself to discover all the other dynamics.All in all, the story was sweet and a good read overall, but for me it was missing that 'something' that would make it special.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JJIQOD1Y6P21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBZFIFS#wasThisHelpful","R3JJIQOD1Y6P21","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"B.N. Toler continues her Holly Springs series with Nikki and Parker's story. Nikki and Parker are best friends of the protagonists in The Suit. I have to confess that although I enjoyed The Suit, I adored The Anchor. It was something about Nikki and Parker's relationship that was just so painfully sweet. I think Toler did a beautiful job expressing the passion, connection, and love between the couple. There were certainly ups and downs, thanks to Nikki's background, but when she let go of her past and her reservations, she embraced the relationship and the love between she and Parker wholeheartedly. I love how she handled the office trollop. I can't wait to see what Toler does with Joey.

"Chelle Bliss starts her ALFA series off with bang! Sinful Intent is deliciously sexy and absolutely thrilling from beginning to end. This book is sure to be your next best read.Men of Inked fans will fall in love with Chelle Bliss's new crop of hot alpha men in the ALFA series. There will be cameo appearances from our favorite Gallos, including Izzy, but they are not the focus of the series. Never fear! Bliss doesn't let her fans down. Although the Gallos are in the background, you will not be disappointed with who takes the forefront. In Sinful Intent we meet Morgan DeLuca, favorite cousin to the Gallo clan. Morgan is a former troubled youth who was given a choice: military or jail. Opting for door #1, Morgan turned his life around to become a responsible adult and dedicated soldier. The story opens with Morgan and his mother Fran enroute to Izzy and James's wedding. The entire trip, Fran is reading Morgan the riot act about...well...everything. She is a sweetheart and you'll love her to pieces but she definitely stays on her boys back (which actually works out for Morgan toward the end of the story). The wedding reception lends itself to a good deal of family ribbing and fun times, but it leaves Morgan with a job offer from Thomas to join them at ALFA Investigations -- the PI business started by him and James. Morgan deliberated his decision for only a little while before deciding to accept the offer. Confident in Morgan's skills, Thomas assigns him a case right away. The client is Race True (you'll adore the meaning of her name) and she has a bit of a problem. Someone, an anonymous someone, is threatening to go very public with something very personal to her. She hires ALFA to see if they can help to unmask her blackmailer.Morgan and True have potent chemistry between them at their first meeting. Morgan is very attracted to Race, and she is as equally attracted to him; however, her professional ice princess mien reveals nothing to the effect. But that doesn't last long. Morgan and Race quickly yield to their passion for one another and through that passion their feelings for one another grow exponentially. As with any good story though, it's never that easy. Love doesn't conquer all without a few battle scars. Morgan is desperate to reveal who is blackmailing Race but the blackmailer plays some serious games with them that almost costs Race her life.The story is thrilling from beginning to end and I love the byplay and interactions between the characters. Bliss creates characters with strong voices that are similar yet so very different, too from her typical characters that we know and love. Sinful Intent definitely needs to be on your auto-buy list this summer!At the end of Sinful Intent we are introduced to Frisco, a new PI and a transplant from San Francisco. I cannot wait to get grabby hands on his story. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V6NS0XOFBEBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514340380#wasThisHelpful","R2V6NS0XOFBEBN","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love a good PNR, and I've enjoyed many of Celia's books in the past. Unfortunately, this one was a miss for me. It was an intro to a new series so it was chock full of information. Almost too much so because there was quite a bit happening toward the latter half of the story. It wasn't chaotic but it did feel....crammed, is the best adjective I can use to describe it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DD9S7DR2HYSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YI33ZJ8#wasThisHelpful","R3DD9S7DR2HYSV","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this series and Brenda Rothert has a truly amazing gift for story telling. Although Mason's story was MUCH different than Reed's it was no less an amazing read. And the pairing between Mason and April was absolutely superb. I cannot wait to see what she does with Kyle. My prediction is that his ladylove will be Alyssa, April's sister.

"Just when I thought I wouldn't love an of the Inked Menace boys more thanLucky, Hawk makes me turn my affections over to Oliver. I adored his character and the connection that he had with Amara. Lord, will her story break your heart. I felt her pain at the hands of the vile scientists who used her as a human/shifter lab rat. Despite Amara's PTSD, Oliver...dear sweet Oliver wooed her to the point that she could not resist the mating pull between them. Beyond the many smexy times in this story, Hawk brings the heat with an intensely dramatic storyline as well. This one will make you bite your nails and cheer for the good guys!

I fell in love with the characters and the sweet little town of Lovely. Ivy will certainly break your heart. Hard. But it was so heartwarming to see her fight her way back from such a great tragedy.

"Seriously, the cliffies are KILLING, and Desperate Domination doesn't come out until the end of July. I've pre-ordered it...but still. I hope that is the last in the series because I don't enjoy too many cliffies in a series. Although well written, there definitely needs to be an end to the Jackson-Hannah, and Deep Domination ended just when it was getting good. Jackson FINALLY figured out that Hannah and Harley were twins instead of one woman with an alias. But the story ends with Hannah escaping as she spies one of Jackson's punishments. One that would certainly and irrevocably break her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH20XIZUO1C7J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YASNK8M#wasThisHelpful","RH20XIZUO1C7J","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh man. This quick read, ending in a cliffy is the WORST case of mistaken identity. Hannah is confused with her conniving sister, Harley, and ends us having a night of exquisite passion with Harley's boy-toy of the moment, Jackson. Hannah offers token protests to Jackson's sensual assault but totally gives into his mastery of her body. That one night changes Hannah forever, in more ways than one. She finds out things about her family from her aunt Sybil that cause them to go on the run, changing their identities. Unfortunately for us readers, we don't discover the family secrets in this book but we know they involve her father, who is also a schemer.Fast forward a few years and Jackson finds out that Harley is still alive. Only it's not Harley, it's Hannah, the woman he remembers the night of explosive passion with, thinking it was Harley. Doesn't that just make your brain hurt?!? But the Jackson we meet night is no longer the considerate but dominating lover who played her body masterfully. This Jackson is bent on revenge because Harley duped him, crushed his heart, and landed him in jail. Again, we don't know the how or why of the jail stint by Jackson is serious about payback. He intends to use Harley (really Hannah) for his sexual demands for one month. He buys her submission with the offer of a million dollars because Hannah and her aunt desperately need the money. And man...when it's revealed who Jackson is, Hannah's reaction isn't as expected. Far, far, from expected.Dang cliffy! I'm moving on to book 2 now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KX93A1VH1HOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBR43FQ#wasThisHelpful","R1KX93A1VH1HOV","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only reason I didn't rate the story 4 stars was because I wanted to see more alpha-ness from Arik. He was quite the Prima donna alpha and the only time we really got to see him in his full alpha glory was when it came to dealing with his ex.

"Admittedly, I was hesitant about reading The Last Dragon. As a lover of romance, specifically the paranormal or contemporary variety, I just didn't know if the story would have would it would take to keep my attention. But, the concept of the story seemed unique and I love series like the Black Dagger Brotherhood and Lords of the Underworld and felt that this story just might be something similar. And, I have to confess that I'm glad I took a chance. As with any new series, the first book contains a good amount of world building and that fact was no different for The Last Dragon. The world building is hard (for any series) and you have to stick with it to get to the meat of the story. And boy did this story have MEAT. I was impressed how Milchon seamlessly wove together paranormal and fantasy elements without overburdening the story. Basically, we have shifters, elementals, and other types of fantasy personas that we get glimpses of but are not able to understand the true scope of their abilities...in this book. But the setup is definitely there for us to know more about them.Now a little about the story itself. There really is a lot happening in the story and to do any recap of it will be totally insufficient. But understand this, the characters and the storyline worked very well together to create an amazing read. I loved Drake and Sally together. You will feel for Sally because of her horrible family situation. I mean, her siblings were AWWWW-ful to her. She was Cinderella and The Ugly Duckling rolled into one and they never let her forget it. So when she meets Drake and encounters his desire for her, she has a very difficult time accepting it. But Drake isn't alone in his feelings for her, the men who are his ""brothers"", called Omegas, at the beginning of the story, but become his BROTHERS by the end, all end up having feelings for Sally as well. Of course all of their feelings are different, save for one of the brothers, but Sally endears herself to them very quickly. But a LOT is happening in the background that neither Drake or Sally know about. Sally is more than any of them could have ever expected and she is the first piece in a very long riddle that could lead to the ultimate salvation of the Omegas.The story had moments of sweetness and serious moments of intensity toward the end that will absolutely keep you ""IN"" the story. I definitely look forward to seeing what happens next as Milchon set the stage for the next Omega to find his love and salvation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23KQ3ECV9EBJK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0109ZB8CY#wasThisHelpful","R23KQ3ECV9EBJK","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Until JulyI discovered Aurora Reynolds recently and devoured the 4 books in the Until series with the Mayson books. I was SO looking forward to reading the nextgen story and was not disappointed with July and Wes' journey to love. The #BOOM works for the girls too. I adored how Wes and July met and even more how he inserted and then became a fixture in her life. We get to see glimpses of the now-older Matson men and they are still as bada$$ as ever. I appreciate how Reynolds writes strong female characters. When the chips are down and the girls need to get themselves out of jams they do. They love their men but are not damsels in distress. July certainly proved her metal at a critical point in the story, saving not only herself but someone else as well.And the jump to their lives in the future...I LOVED IT.

"I love Joanna Wylde and was looking forward to reading Silver Bastard. The story was had moments of sexy intensity but the characters just didn't do it for me. I didn't exactly care for Puck and Becca as a couple. Apart they were fine; however, when thrown together as a couple they felt disconnected and their relationship felt disjointed...even more so than other biker relationships. And Becca's gullibility concerning her mother was sigh-worthy. I understand a child's love for a mother but the disfunction in that relationship was at a premium -- even at the end when Becca was still holding out hope that her mother would be more. All-in-all, this wasn't my favorite MC book by Wylde but I still look forward to seeing what she does next. I hope we get more Reapers...think I like them the best :).","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27KAP93OP85KO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2BS3FW#wasThisHelpful","R27KAP93OP85KO","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sad to see the conclusion of the Men of Inked series and I was glad that Anthony finally got his HEA. The toughest of all the Gallo's, manwhore, Anthony was the one I never guessed would be felled by a woman as sassy as Max. Max was definitely time enough for him from the minute of their introduction up unto the point where she said, ""I do"" but the journey was well worth it. I loved Max's backstory and the fact that she made Anthony ""work for it"" with her."" But, sometimes, I just felt that Max was too acerbic. I definitely felt for her once I discovered the reason why she put Anthony on the emotional roller-coaster that he couldn't seem to get off off. However, there were times when I felt she was just too.......extra. Her attitude definitely rivaled Izzy's in the sass department but she was stubborn at times when she just could have relented. Poor Anthony had to battle out even the little things with her. I'm sure that was Bliss's intent because Anthony DESERVED it because of how he treated all the women in his past. But Max seemed to break him at every turn. The friction between them actually took some of the enjoyment out of the story for me. I didn't hate it but because of it, Without Me was my least favorite in the series. I was happy to see where they landed and the beauty that came out of the fight. As always I LOVED the family and even the connection that Marie had to Max's mother Ruth -- I thought that was sweet. Although I'm sorry to see the Gallo's go, I look forward to seeing what Bliss thinks up next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RLQVGPAFPFFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKR59BO#wasThisHelpful","R1RLQVGPAFPFFD","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm struggling with my feelings about this book. I loved Lana and Callum but didn't exactly love them together. Well...that's not right. I didn't love HOW they got together. Lana is on the heels of her breakup with Jack and Callum essentially becomes her rebound lover cum boyfriend. Part of her heart still belongs to Jack but then she gives the other half to Callum whom she has always had a strong attraction for. There is still drama in the story and her step brother Brock is still very much a thorn in her life. He has even infiltrated her one sanctuary, her course work, by dating her graduate adviser and friend. Brock uses every opportunity to torment her and even tries to turn her friend against her. Through it all, Callum is in her corner. But Lana finds out something that absolutely wrecks her...and this time completely because now the other half of her heart is broken too.

"I was a little sad to reach the end of the Stage Dive series. I mean, come on, let's be honest here. This series has bought us many sexy times, complete with highs, lows, and laughter, courtesy of Mal. I just wasn't quite ready to let my boys go! But, as the saying goes, ""All good things must come to and end."" Yet, I give mad props to Scott who did not disappoint with Ben's story.Throughout the series, Ben was always the one band member that I could never quite get a bead on. He was aloof and muted when compared to Dave and Jimmy and completely overshadowed by Mal. That said, I wasn't sure how I'd feel about him being the main protagonist of his own story. Did I say Scott did not disappoint? Well, I really meant it! In Deep she allowed us to see a depth in Ben that didn't feel present throughout the series. Pair a ""deeper"" Ben with a sassy Lizzy, and the story was a full-on roller-coaster ride. Poor Lizzy though. I felt so bad for her after she discovered her predicament of ""being in the family way."" She had to tell her sister, Anne, who she was afraid to disappoint *gasp*. More importantly, she had to tell a relationship-reticent Ben who made it quite clear that he was not looking for more *grrr*.I will confess that Ben's wishy-washy indifference/attraction toward Lizzy was maddening. He was sexy as all get out but he made you want to smack his face off because of how hot and cold he ran with Lizzy. But her heart and her body wanted Ben so she endured a lot of his behavior. Yes for the sake of their unborn child, but also because she held out hope that he would change his mind and see her for more than just a human incubator. Sadly, Ben's hot and cold attitude had a good run in the story, but the man does wise up and realize that Lizzy just ""might"" be the woman he wants. Oh he is plenty attracted to her but his heart was realllllllly slow in catching up with body. Insert a sexy male red-head, and one caustic sister, and the roller-coaster gets even more twisty. But I loved every minute of those twists.Scott did an excellent job taking the reader right up to the end of the story with no happily ever after in sight. I mean my Kindle was at 93% and I absolutely saw NO WAY for Ben and Lizzy to have their happily ever. But I breathed a sigh of relief while reading the remaining 7% of the story, including the epilogue. That 7% was totally worth the cuticle bitten nails.The joy in reaching the end of the Stage Dive series is knowing that it's not completely over. The sexy-redhead, Vaughn, will be starring in Scott's spin-off series Dive Bar, and I believe that we'll also see a reappearance from Marty, Ben's sister, and the security chief, Sam. Already the series sounds promising and it hasn't even been written yet. I cannot wait to get it in my hot little hands.I highly recommend this series to anyone who is in the mood for a romance series that is funny, sexy, and highly engaging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YYEC68GKA7PO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052394#wasThisHelpful","R1YYEC68GKA7PO","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a confession to make *takes a deep breath*. I started this book with very preconceived notions about what I thought thought the story would be. I was expecting something a little on the Fifty Shades of Gideon Cross side, but I was wrong. Completely wrong.Manwhore was quite an engaging story of Malcolm Kyle Preston Logan Saint or simply ""Saint"" and Rachel Livingston. This story was a breath of fresh air in that although the protagonists had some baggage from life (who doesn't?!?) they were not the typical broken souls that are often popular in modern romance. Rachel's father passed away at a young age so she does not really understand love between genders. She loves and cares for her mother with a protective fierceness but has no idea how to relate to the opposite sex on a deeper level. Saint lost his mother at a young age and his father is boorish, mean, and jealous of his son. A son who he doubted and reviled. Yet, that same son outpaced his father financially and success-wise. But where Saint's drive in the business world caused him to be a forced to be reckoned with, his salacious drive caused him to be popular among the ladies. So much so that he is known around Chicago for his raw sex appeal and ""manwhoring"" ways. Women want him and men want to be him. And that's what brings him on a direct collision course with Rachel Livingston.Rachel has always wanted to achieve success and acclaim as a reporter. Working for Edge magazine she has achieved a small modicum of success; however she wants her name to be a household name. She wants the fame to catapult her career and finances so she can give back to her mother, and provide her life a level of comfort they did not have while she was growing up. So, when Rachel receives an assignment to do an exposé on the ladykiller, Saint, she jumps at the opportunity. The mission is simple: Interview him, gain his trust, and find out every dirty detail possible about him and exploit it for the article. If only things were that simple though. The minute Saint and Rachel meet, a completely unauspicious meeting as it was, their fate is sealed. Saint is intrigued by the beautiful reporter who comes to her interview with him wearing paint-stained overalls. After the most awkward of interviews -- a whole 10 minutes -- Saint is whisked away to his next high profile meeting. Although disappointed, Rachel does not let that deter her from gaining access to his life. Her persistence allows her to gain one meeting after another with Saint. Each meeting causing their desires for each other to grow. Saint's interest in Rachel quickly goes from professional to personal. He makes no secret about the fact that he wants Rachel, especially when he calls ""Dibs"" on her after she sneaks into a party he's hosting at a popular club. Saint and Rachel play the professional role until an steamy first kiss sparks more than just passion. Their feelings for each other grow and the once aloof billionaire lets down his guard with Rachel in a way that he has not with anyone else. They share texts, calls, and visits and lots of sexy times together. You can clearly see that Saint is beginning to have deeper feelings for Rachel. It's really rather sweet the things he does for her -- Ellie the elephant *sigh*.But unfortunately...Yeah, you knew it was coming. Reality invades and Rachel's rival at the magazine, who played the classic frienemy role well, causes her world to absolutely cave in around her. As her feelings for Saint grew, Rachel really struggled with writing the article. She didn't want to write it at all, but a strong directive by the editor-in-charge, Helen, caused a fierce battle of conscious. When Helen discovered that the rival was going to write a tell-all article for a competitor magazine, she advised Rachel to write her story first! Rachel wanted to come clean and tell Saint what was happening because the article came out; however, he was out of town and they wouldn't be able to connect until the weekend. Rachel figured that she had a little bit of time because the rival's article was slated to come out on the upcoming Monday. But, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, right?!?! The rival's revelation came over the weekend. Way too early for Rachel since she never had an opportunity to talk to Saint and now EVERYONE knows about what she did. Rachel is devastated when she calls and texts him with no reply back. She implores him to let her tell her side of the story. After trying to reach him by phone -- unsuccessfully, she decides to show up at his office in hopes of gaining an audience with him. But that doesn't work either because she is summarily dismissed and escorted off the premises by a security officer. Rachel is absolutely heartbroken at Saint's departure from her life. She knows it is her fault; however, the pain of his loss in is immense.The end of the story ends in a major cliffy leaving the reader to wonder: Will they? Won't they? Stay tuned for the next installment of Manwhore in Manwhore +1 in July.

"I wanted to like this story because it contained many elements that I enjoy. Unfortunately, I had a difficult time getting into the story thus found almost no enjoyment in reading it. I love a PNR that draws me in from the first page and this one just didn't do it. The story felt scattered and the connection between the characters were virtually non-existent when the profession of love came. I know that insta-love is common in PNR but I am used to reading stories where at least some back story is provided to possibly show why the insta-love happened. I just didn't get any of that here. The story had good bones -- jealous she-wolf, crazy ex, two hot protective alphas but they didn't connect well for me. The resolution with Grant came abruptly and the end of the story even more so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH04F3YWFI1KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX9XFP0#wasThisHelpful","RH04F3YWFI1KJ","A2R7C9H41T6W9S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R7C9H41T6W9S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**UPDATE 4/15/15: Turtle Rock has released 2 new maps for free alongside a slew of balances and patches for some minor game issues. Turtle Rock has also hosted some community events and have been giving away prizes and skins for anyone who participates.**4 new characters have launched for Evolve, they all bring something new to the table and work well in unison, they are however NOT over powered nor are they just reskins of the original hunters. Players would not be faulted for skipping this purchase, though the new offerings are varied enough to add quite a lot to an already packed game. For the asking you might want to wait for a sale - but still the characters are great and if you see even 1 you must have then I suggest you go for it! The new characters are all more combat and damaged based and offer less defenses all around. My recommendation is to check youtube for the full character recap. Happy hunting!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AQTEFFK2HL5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S71M0W0#wasThisHelpful","R2AQTEFFK2HL5D","A2583O1GD0ASRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2583O1GD0ASRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Update 4/14/15: Servers have continued to improve and Visceral has announced the first wave of patches/balances coming soon. I also now HIGHLY recommend the ""Blood Money"" game-mode as it's very fun and very well designed for most maps; Blood Money is a bit of a mix of neutral Capture-the-flag and base defense. I have logged roughly a hundred hours online across all game-modes and still find the multiplayer enjoyable.**It could be too early to say, but I dare say the verdict is in: BF Hardline doesn't suck (and is fun too). After EA/DICE totally screwed the pooch with the release of BF4, Hardline by some miracle works far better than anyone could have expected. After plopping down around 16 hours in the Beta, 10 hours through EA access, and another 4+ hours last night (release day) I would be lying if I said my experience was anything less than satisfactory. Most surprising is that the single player campaign is actually somewhat decent and focuses more on stealth and gadgets then huge war-like battles, though it's not perfect and a few of the game mechanics are a bit silly (such as flashing your badge to instantly make enemies surrender to you, lol).BFH plays like a Battlefield and Call of Duty crossover, in the best and worst ways possible. Like BF you expect open maps with lots of vantage & entry points with a few vehicles thrown in to add to the mayhem, minus the military vehicles everything is pretty much the same. More to the tune of COD, maps are much smaller with more choke points; run-and-gun game play is key in most situations and you will die very FAST. The game suffers some of the notoriously bad habits of COD in that there are many instances of spawn death. Spawning in your base is ALWAYS safe however. If you spawn on teammates and objectives then you do so at your own risk and can expect to be gunned down if enemies are nearby, this is due to spawning much closer than ever before to objectives. While irritating it's just a side effect of having small maps; large game modes are a bit crowded and the chaos can be a bit too much.The biggest issue about BFH for me is that many matches are over in about 5-10 minutes, and some modes have lower ticket counts pending on the map, tickets also bleed very fast and I found most matches ended before I had a chance to get into it. I imagine this will be addressed if it bothers enough people as there's no reason a game of conquest should end in less than 10 minutes. The second biggest issue is the persistence of a known bug from BF4 where players ""trade kills,"" this alone is absolutely maddening. In 2 separate instances now I was melee'd to death AFTER I shot a guy and he died. I have video of this recorded and it's extremely frustrating when you die in 1 on 1 fights AFTER you kill the other guy; it wouldn't bother me much if it wasn't happening ever 2 or 3 deaths. Screw that!Speaking of the new maps, I'm actually VERY impressed with the new offerings thus far. There are some beautiful new levels that really capture the spirit of the ""criminal""locations they represent. Even on smaller levels there are a surprising number of paths around each map, including roads/water for vehicles. Each objective/structure has several doors (many of them interactive or destructible) and there's a lot of variety in map types. I was especially impressed with the use of elevation in some areas having not just 1 or 2 floors, but up to 3 or 4. It should also be mentioned that the inclusion of portable zip lines and grappling hooks is really great and adds a huge amount of traversal power.Some of the new game modes are decently fun too, Hotwire sends players to hop into objective cars and traverse the map at high speeds in order to gain points, it's really fun and the maps support this game mode well. Conquest and TDM return as normal, and while fun, don't really add much new. Heist is an objective mode that pits cops-vs.-robbers around a very specific set of objectives (like robbing a bank, etc): it's a bit hard to learn but is a nice change of pace. There are also a few others but in truth I haven't touch much outside these (I mostly play Hotwire and Conquest).All in all the game is fast paced, challenging, and needs a bit more polish. BF Hardline will be on sale before long so there's no harm in waiting for a price drop, it's not a perfect game by any means, but it does run smooth and has enough content to keep you entertained. My advice: don't buy the Deluxe or Ultimate versions, Premium isn't really worth it until they actually release new maps later on, and the starter ""Battle-packs"" give you random crap that won't help you (I know b/c I downloaded the Deluxe version and in NO WAY was it worth an extra $10). For those on fence, wait for a price drop as this game will most def be on sale before long.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G1APD5P9ZQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KME8JBQ#wasThisHelpful","R3G1APD5P9ZQ1","A2583O1GD0ASRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2583O1GD0ASRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"**Update 4/14/15: I have been playing through with a friend and have had only minimal issues with the online portion of the game, I highly reccommend buying the ""Name Engraved Ring"" from the cat in Majula, it allows you to easily find specific players for co-op (though you may need to drop your summon sign up to 3-5 times before it works).**Dark Souls 2 has often been called the lesser brother of Dark Souls (the 1st), and while I don’t think that’s entirely fair it’s also not entirely wrong either. They are for certain different games with many similarities; the first DS has a wealth of atmosphere and immaculately designed levels, and will forever hold a place in our hearts as the first time a game kick our collective butts. Along comes DSII with its sharp non-gothic style (boo!), its faster combat & better magic (yay!), and somewhat disjoined levels that aren’t quite as good as the first game but look nice all the same. I for one am more than happy to replaying my favorite game of 2014.Where Dark Souls exceeded in being terrifying, unfamiliar, and difficult DSII sought to twist the knife further by throwing more odd and difficult encounters into the mix. Scholar of the First Sin, meanwhile, gives us the best experience of DSII but ISN’T just a remake, it’s a remix: enemy locations have been moved or changed entirely, new foes roam the world, more traps and surprises throughout the game, new NPCs  give us more lore and help new players through the world. As well, enemies are a bit more aggressive and players may now summon more friends (and foes) to engage in jolly co-operation!DSII:SotFS also includes all 3 of the large DLC’s previously released on last gen consoles (and pc), all of which I HIGHLY recommend playing through as they are quite good and possible better than the whole core game alone. Each of the DLC’s has new bosses, gear, loot, and levels that add to the core game is great ways. FromSoftware has also improved all audio and visual content to help make sure the game looks great at all times, running in 1080p/60fps. It’s an obvious buy if you missed it entirely or just want to have more fun in a semi-new experience; SKIP this game if you hated it the first time, don’t like HARD games, or got your fill the first time around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFMBR6Z1KFW8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q03M3HY#wasThisHelpful","RFMBR6Z1KFW8E","A2583O1GD0ASRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2583O1GD0ASRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Child of Light is a sort of retelling or spin-off of the story of Sleeping Beauty but from the perspective of the sleeping princess; somehow COL works and isn't just beautiful, it's also charming and meaningful. I was quite impressed with the lovely piano heavy soundtrack, it sets the mood and is easily some of the best videogame music I've heard in a long time - but it is great music, and is more than just a soundtrack.COL is turn based 2D RPG and you will be flying through levels (quite literally) solving some minor puzzles, listening to dialogue and engaging in turn-based fights through the game. The fights are just challenging enough to keep you interested and allow you to use 2 characters (there's quite a few to pick from) with varying abilities against a good variety of monsters (and bosses too!), there's a number of special attacks and unique abilities pending on the characters you choose. There's also a good little gem crafting system which will allow you to mix up you damage type and resistances per character. You'll also be able to find a swath of armor other equipment to keep your dudes suited up.

"I started using this oil daily to see if my beard would begin to soften up, and after 2 months my beard doesn't feel much softer than before, the exception to this being if the oil is still in my beard. It makes my wife very unhappy when I kiss her and she gets a nice dab of oily residue on her face & I was hoping it would dry a bit faster. It does at least smell very nice but I can’t honestly recommend this product based on the price, quantity and lasting effect (or lack thereof). The oil seems to be a bit strong, many have said this oil is also good for the skin and sooths irritation, and while I didn’t have any problems it did burn a bit if it got anywhere near my eyes.

"Leon the Professional (“The Professional”) is a beautiful love story/action flick that tells the tale of a hired killer and the young girl he saves. One of my all time favorite movies, it’s very different in pacing and style then your run of the miller action movies, but I quite enjoy what it brings to the table. Great acting from all sides - especially the villain - Stansfield (Gary Oldman) will leave chills running down your spine.

"Ori and the Blind Forrest is one of the better games I’ve played in years, especially when you consider the $20 price tag. This game has so many wonderful selling points: a unique fully orchestrated soundtrack, butter smooth game controls, & a to-die-for art style. Ori is a small fox like forest spirit who’s trying to find his way in the world after the forest he’s from begins to die. It plays exceedingly similar to Metroid and Castlevania games, and I can assure you it’s a VERY good thing. It truly is a beautiful, emotional, and challenging game – there’s really no reason not to try it.

"**Update 4/14/15: Servers have continued to improve and Visceral has announced the first wave of patches/balances coming soon. I also now HIGHLY recommend the “Blood Money” game-mode as it’s very fun and very well designed for most maps; Blood Money is a bit of a mix of neutral Capture-the-flag and base defense. I have logged roughly a hundred hours online across all game-modes and still find the multiplayer enjoyable.**It could be too early to say, but I dare say the verdict is in: BF Hardline doesn't suck (and is fun too). After EA/DICE totally screwed the pooch with the release of BF4, Hardline by some miracle works far better than anyone could have expected. After plopping down around 16 hours in the Beta, 10 hours through EA access, and another 4+ hours last night (release day) I would be lying if I said my experience was anything less than satisfactory. Most surprising is that the single player campaign is actually somewhat decent and focuses more on stealth and gadgets then huge war-like battles, though it’s not perfect and a few of the game mechanics are a bit silly (such as flashing your badge to instantly make enemies surrender to you, lol).BFH plays like a Battlefield and Call of Duty crossover, in the best and worst ways possible. Like BF you expect open maps with lots of vantage & entry points with a few vehicles thrown in to add to the mayhem, minus the military vehicles everything is pretty much the same. More to the tune of COD, maps are much smaller with more choke points; run-and-gun game play is key in most situations and you will die very FAST. The game suffers some of the notoriously bad habits of COD in that there are many instances of spawn death. Spawning in your base is ALWAYS safe however. If you spawn on teammates and objectives then you do so at your own risk and can expect to be gunned down if enemies are nearby, this is due to spawning much closer than ever before to objectives. While irritating it’s just a side effect of having small maps; large game modes are a bit crowded and the chaos can be a bit too much.The biggest issue about BFH for me is that many matches are over in about 5-10 minutes, and some modes have lower ticket counts pending on the map, tickets also bleed very fast and I found most matches ended before I had a chance to get into it. I imagine this will be addressed if it bothers enough people as there’s no reason a game of conquest should end in less than 10 minutes. The second biggest issue is the persistence of a known bug from BF4 where players “trade kills,” this alone is absolutely maddening. In 2 separate instances now I was melee'd to death AFTER I shot a guy and he died. I have video of this recorded and it's extremely frustrating when you die in 1 on 1 fights AFTER you kill the other guy; it wouldn't bother me much if it wasn't happening ever 2 or 3 deaths. Screw that!Speaking of the new maps, I'm actually VERY impressed with the new offerings thus far. There are some beautiful new levels that really capture the spirit of the ""criminal""locations they represent. Even on smaller levels there are a surprising number of paths around each map, including roads/water for vehicles. Each objective/structure has several doors (many of them interactive or destructible) and there's a lot of variety in map types.

"Well all I have to say about this trimmer is that it works quite well and it’s very slick looking too. The Trym II comes with a charging base and cord, both of which look good and take up very little room on the counter. There are a decent number of guards for the blade for short and medium lengths, I would like a few more options for longer beard hair but I still found everything included to very satisfactory. The blade/motor seems quite capable and cut through my face pubes with ease and left me with a nice even cut. Great buy for the price; also included: some blade oil for the trimmer and a small brush to clean up with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R69G6IOLXZNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMB4864#wasThisHelpful","R1R69G6IOLXZNI","A2583O1GD0ASRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2583O1GD0ASRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dominion Intrigue functions as a standalone game or can be used as an expansion to the original or with any of the subsequent sets. It’s a rather good game that offers some new takes on the Dominion mechanics; more often than not you’ll have options that will allow you how you wish to receive your punishment or reward. DI comes with the entire core cards that allow it to function as a standalone game, and you may also choose to use it in conjunction with the base game.Having these extra cards will easily allow you to play with up to 6 (and maybe even more) players. It’s a lot of good fun and my only gripe is that I wish I had a better way to store all these games and their expansions.

"**UPDATE 4/15/15: Turtle Rock has released 2 new maps for free alongside a slew of balances and patches for some minor game issues. Turtle Rock has also hosted some community events and have been giving away prizes and skins for anyone who participates. As well, most version of Evolve are on sale, and now that the new Hunters and Monster have released it’s a great time to jump in and get your butt handed to you. Still highly recommend this game for hardcore team players or anyone who loves a solo challenge.**Hate to be the unpopular voice, but this game is damn good fun with a massively ridiculous learning curve, but the challenge is quite awesome. This isn’t a game for everyone, but truth be told I feel this is a wonderfully unique and inventive game. I know this review will get down-voted to oblivion but that's ok with me, my honest opinion of this game is that it's great (not quite perfect).Evolve focuses on game-play above all else (Don’t expect a deeply written story or very good tutorials), everything works as intended and the HUNT Mode is some of the best game-play with friends I've had since games like Team Fortress or BF: Bad Company 1-2. Yes the DLC model sucks but it's also not new to gaming either. I paid $60 for the digital version and I got exactly what was promised, 12 hunter and 3 monsters. I've put about 60+ hours into the game so far and have only scratched the surface of some of the characters and monsters. I've mostly been playing the Medic and Trapper classes (see: Lazarus & Griffin), and occasionally Support Class (Hank) and just recently finished “Mastery” on those 3 characters. I’ve really starting to get a hold of the different characters and abilities; it feels like I’ve just scratched the surface on the other characters though.Evolve looks beautiful and has some really fantastic lighting effects, there are rare graphical bugs but nothing that will ruin the experience. Evolve has nearly no lag and plays smooth about 99% of the time; there is an occasional bug where the game crashes back to the menu, but it happens very infrequently. Turtle Rock has continued game balancing from the Alpha to the full release and has already implemented a few patches and have announced the next round of fixes, buffs, and nerfs. Turtle Rock has also implemented a system where they can tweak the game in real time (but not change coding) to give players immediate updates without needing a patch! This was a great idea and something a game like this needed asap.To address the DLC, I'm neither happy nor upset; businesses charge for content and they have said since day one what they were planning (if anything they have been TOO honest). I'll wait and see if the new content is better or worse and only purchase something if I just have to have it, but based on the balancing thus far I don't see why you'd need more characters just yet unless they offer something fresh. The core set of characters are very good and offer enough differences to keep things interesting for many hours. *Update* I have purchased the new characters as they did in fact all bring new abilities to the table. They aren’t straight up better than the old hunters, but they do mix things up and offer some new ways to play.DO NOT buy this game if you plan on playing the hunters alone, while the monster is great fun by yourself, you will NEED a team of people communicating to win with the hunters. The game is also extremely difficult and caters to hardcore crowd. The tutorials are weak, and you will need to practice with different classes till you figure out which ones work with your play-style. Monster is much easier to play as you don’t need to rely on anyone but yourself and your instincts. SKIP Evolve if you do not like multiplayer, teamwork, or difficult games.You can play offline with bots, and there are custom game settings that allow you to tweak private matches just the way you like them (you still earn EXP). I usually play custom games with my buddies – Evacuation Mode gives you the most EXP and helps you level up fast. Turtle Rock has also announced (from the beginning) that all future maps and game-modes will be FREE, only new characters and skins will cost you.

"In the same vein of thought and design as the ""Souls"" Series, developer CI Games readily admits to being a bit more than just inspired by games like Dark Souls. The similarities are more than uncanny, they're absolutely deliberate. Players progress through a dark and bloody realm gaining and losing power in an ever increasing play-style that pushes (and punishes) the Risk-vs-Reward factor.CI Games takes some notes in the basic set up: if you die you lose all your EXP and all the enemies in an area respawn, the exception to the Souls formula is that enemies stay dead otherwise and your EXP will sit wherever you died and slowly begin fading away the longer it takes you to get back to your ""ghost."" You may however ""bank"" your EXP at checkpoints (checkpoints also allow you to level up and refill potions). When you bank your EXP or use a checkpoint you will reset your EXP multiplier (the multiplier increases with ever kill and no deaths).These all make for some fun changes, but do not detract from the style of Challenging Action/RPG you are hopefully expecting. It is by no means an easy game, but take it slow while you learn to manage your energy bar, practice blocking, and dodge attacks when you can.

"A Colorless Plainswalker, very cool card to use in nearly any deck (for Standard format or any of your choosing). I think it's a great card b/c of being colorless; mana wise it's very expensive (duh!), he really is very similar to Nicol Bolas but much easier to cast on account of being colorless and having similar flavor and power.Personally I think it's a great card but you will need a deck that can play him and keep him protected -- pretty much a guaranteed win if can cast him and keep him alive. Great art work, decent concept and power, I'm hoping to get a few of these guys. Price is damn high but I expect it to drop eventually on account of his extream slow speed, I think faster decks wil beat this guy down but time will tell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OO9JUFPO6TQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKHU03I#wasThisHelpful","R1OO9JUFPO6TQE","A2583O1GD0ASRO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2583O1GD0ASRO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the sequel to VIRGIN (My review: http://vsreads.com/2014/08/07/shes-desperate-to-not-be-a-virgin-a-review/ ) and is best enjoyed if read in sequence, though it CAN be read as a standalone.Ellie is a 22 y/o new uni grad living in a flatshare with her good friend Emma, and two men, Ollie (on whom Ellie has a total crush) and Will. The thing is Ellie's the only single one, and she's not happy to be stuck in the only single room of the flat.She wants to find men to have sex with, many men, preferably. She recently lost her virginity to a douche, and she is dying to get more experience. She feels as if she's crap at sex, and doesn't get that everyone is, at first. As she's hardly had a chance to experiment, Ellie agrees to sign up for online dating. This is intriguing and disastrous.Her first date is a bit of a train wreck, with Ellie bolting via a fire escape just to get away from this guy. The second guy was really a good guy, I thought, but Ellie has weird idiosyncrasies that drive her to push him away. Their sex scene did give me a laughter cramp. Ye gads, Ellie's so very uptight.This is a problem every time she meets a man, actually. She desperately wants to have an orgasm with a guy, yet when she's in the act she's so trapped in her head that she can't enjoy the experience at all. It was honestly painful being in her brain--and the lack of arousal she experiences *almost* put me off sex for more than 24 hours...  (It was a near thing!)She does meet a great guy, Nick, who's been quite hung up on his ex for too long. Ellie sees the opportunity to get her first One Night Stand out of the way, and does so--only to be stymied the following morning when he wants her number. And further confused when he calls her! And takes her on nice dates! Ellie is really a neurotic mess. She has roughly 3 ounces of self-esteem and cannot fathom how to behave as Nick's ""rebound"" girl--but her boss sees Ellie's dating nightmares to be fodder for a tell-all column in the online mag that she interns for--on an unpaid basis. The horrors that are Ellie's bad dates and bad pubic hair and further are now out on the 'net for all to read. It's mortifying, and she isn't even getting paid!While Ellie is a mess, she does get things together by the end. She makes bad, bad, bad decisions that upset her friends, family and flatmates, but she perseveres. She atones the best she can, and she takes control of her future in a way she had not considered before. Some of this is funny--uproariously so--but other points are raw. Ellie doesn't feel good about herself and this makes it easy for people to take advantage of her. She's trying to claim her life, but she really has no sense of being an adult, only a few vague ideas which make her feeble attempts at ""adulting"" poor. Her naivete is simultaneously humorous and sad, because it continually leads Ellie into poor choices.I liked how she worked through her issues in the end, becoming a far stronger character. I liked how she asserted her sexual independence throughout the book. She and her feminist friends attempt to redefine ""slut"" into a positive, which was an interesting concept, even if it didn't quite turn out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R373DM2Z9GEK84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425276422#wasThisHelpful","R373DM2Z9GEK84","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corey is a young, independent out gay man in a bit of trouble at work. He had a crush on a fellow employee and went to great lengths to seduce this man, only to have it backfire. Since then, hes been the center of office gossip, and a pariah. He quite literally runs into Remington, an attorney who is working a case for Corey's company, in the hall one day, spilling coffee all over Remy's suit.Instead of being incensed, Remy's cordial, and even asks Corey out on a date later in the day. Their chemistry is off the charts, and Corey's so sex-starved he has no qualms about being a partner to Remy--for the night, or forever.In truth, Corey's looking for a forever man, and Remy's never considered such nonsense, but being around Corey is addicting, Remy soon finds. If only the office gossip mongers would leave them alone!As they continue to date, Corey overhears some nasty stuff about Remy and tries to preserve his heart. What happens next is the sweetest wooing a man ever wished for. I really liked how Remy thought over his troubles with monogamy and relationships and saw the good in Corey far outweighed any risky business in the future. They are a sweet, and sexy couple and the book is hot!

It’s a stressful job and he relishes unwinding with some spicy BDSM scenes with his regular partner, Pez, a graduate student who moonlights as rentboy. Pez and Brian have been getting together twice a week for two years, and their relationship is really one that is more loving than a john and his hooker. In truth, they each have feelings for the other, but are afraid to reveal this. Brian, because his heart has been broken before, and Pez, because being in love with Brian means he’ll have to give up his lucrative escort business.Morgan, the stylish underwear model that broke Brian’s heart returns from his two year absence, begging for a second chance. Brian doesn’t want to give it to him, but Pez thinks he needs to–to see if their spark exists. If it doesn’t Pez is willing and able to take a permanent place in Brian’s life. Brian reluctantly allows Morgan to move back in, as long as he submits to Brian’s Dom games. Meanwhile, Pez nurses his broken heart by taking riskier jobs than ever before. As Brian and Morgan grow closer, Brian recognizes his love for Pez and Morgan is equal, and he needs to let Pez know–if he can track him down.This is a bittersweet read when considering Pez, but I think the story arc allows for Pez to found and redeemed, by Brian and Morgan. This book is really the base of a continuing story, and while it ends satisfactorily, it’s clear that there’s tons of heat and steam in the offing. I liked the interactions between Brian and Pez and also Brian and Morgan. Brian’s a very thoughtful protagonist and is a creative Dom. He breaks Morgan’s defenses into rubble, and this allows for Morgan to be less selfish and more accepting of Brian’s needs, even if that includes Pez. It’s an interesting and often sexy story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAEU8L4M1TF6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017K6ICWY#wasThisHelpful","RAEU8L4M1TF6R","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a sequel and the books should be read in sequence. For readers who do not like cliffhangers, the series ends here. (Well, there could always be another adventure, but there are no unresolved plot questions.)If you have NOT read BOOK OF IVY, some spoilers below.When last we left off:1. The world is in ruins due to war 50 years ago and collectives have endured these lean times.2. Westfall is a town divided. One side is wealthy the other, not. At age 16 children from one side of the town are married to spouses from the other side, to prevent rebellion and foster amity.3. Ivy Westfall's family founded Westfall, but the Lattimer family stole the power and maintains the government. Ivy has grown up in the bad side of Westfall, and has been diligently trained to hate the Lattimers. Her elder sister, Callie, was supposed to be married to Bishop Lattimer, son of President Lattimer, two years ago, but he refused. Bishop wanted Ivy.4. Ivy's father and sister want Ivy to murder Bishop.5. Ivy falls for Bishop.6. Ivy refuses to kill Bishop.7. Stuff happens and Ivy is put outside of the barrier fence that protects Westfall's territory and water supply. This is, essentially, a death sentence.In Ivy's case, she has little to no chance of surviving, but she manages to fend off two specific dangers, acquires a canteen and walks until she collapses. She is rescued by Caleb and Ash (Ashley) who tend her wounds and bring her into their settlement. They do not trust her, but she's identified as Ivy Westfall, and there are enough refugees of Westfall around to ensure Ivy a welcome. She is afraid they will learn that she married, and (gasp!) loved Bishop Lattimer, as these people are outside the fence due to Bishop's father's ""justice"". BTW some of them were put out for just cause, but many others were set out because they refused to accept their arranged marriages; they think Ivy was set out for this very reason and are sympathetic.During the weeks, Ivy, Ash and Caleb become friends. Caleb knows that Ivy is not telling the truth, but he cannot prove it. In the meantime, Ivy proves herself to be a quick learner and a hard worker. She gains other friendships, and feels a part of a community as she never did in Westfall--either side. Naturally, this all falls apart when Bishop arrives in the camp.There is animosity, but a steady growth of respect as Bishop sets out to prove he is ""not his father's son"" (figuratively, peeps). Ivy can't bear to be parted from Bishop again, but she also can't get close to him, fearing that she'll lose him all over again in this even harsher world than Westfall. I applaud Bishop's patience, because I wanted to hit Ivy in the face for all her tentativeness. <i>Live in the NOW, Ivy! </i> LOL.Anywho, Caleb and Ash find that Bishop is awesome, and Bishop gets Ivy to do what she never has done: tell the truth, of herself and her feelings. It builds a strong bond that is tested when Ivy learns that Westfall's in disarray and her family is at extreme risk.Ivy feels the need to make as much right as she can, and is disgruntled with Bishop, Ash, and Caleb who decide to assist. This seemed like a truly madcap enterprise, and I cannot say that I would have done what Ivy did, but I believe that Ivy did what she needed to do. (Even if I think it was utter foolishness!) That girl does love with her whole heart, even if she is hesitant to reveal it...The end is a naturally gruesome affair, though it was a better situation than I did predict. I was satisfied in the reading. I still like Ivy, and adore Bishop and hope that this future world nevah-evah comes to pass.Funny thing, Ivy and Bishop's marriage was annulled when she was put outside the fence. It struck me that Bishop never discarded the ring, nor did he ever plan to let Ivy go. His steadfast love was fairy tale in origin, and it made me (and Ivy) swoony. He never tries to dissuade her from her plans, and always seeks her counsel in decisions. He's an excellent partner, a rock really, who only wants to love Ivy as she is, whoever she is. That was heart-warming. They do consummate their love, but it's all off the page.As with all dystopian stories, I'd love a little more world-building, and some deeper survivor hardship on the page, but that's not the biggest issue for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVMPPIVPSF67F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633751155#wasThisHelpful","RVMPPIVPSF67F","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boomer has crushed on Rayce for a good long time. He's seen his sister and brother settle down with lovers and he's lonely in his big empty home. Boomer witnessed the fear in Rayce's eyes and her embarrassment over the ramshackle trailer she shares with her father. A father who's drunk more nights than not, and also has a right nasty mouth on him.Rayce seems to want to be with Boomer, but she's reluctant to let any one help her out. She works hard at Stone's garage and is fearless on the racetrack, so why is she holding back against his sure love? When Rayce pulls a disappearing act, Boomer goes to find her--and finds his worst fears confirmed. It's not a pretty home life, that's for sure. So Boomer does what he does best, takes care of Rayce. Moves her into his empty home and treats her with care and respect. They're roommates, without the sexy benefits. That's what Rayce needs, to prove that she and Boomer can co-exist and she isn't bartering her body for a place to live. Truth is, that scenario has happened before and it might happen again, if Rayce isn't careful. Her filthy ""father"" has a whole new set of humiliations in store for Rayce, and Boomer's the muscle that lifts her out of the darkness and the rock she needs to stand on.I was glad to see Boomer get his happy ending. He's such a caretaker, and deserves to have a partner who loves him with her whole heart. Rayce is a good woman in a bad situation, used and abused by the one man she believed should love her. It's not as gory as some of the Retribution stories, or even Brodie STEELE's book, but it does involve verbal, emotional, and even physical abuse of a woman--though some of this is off the page. It's clear that Rayce's father has no love for her, and the reason was plain to me early on. That said, I liked how this one was all tied up. It's not a sunshine and roses upbeat story, but there's a lot of love and a definite HEA. Also, it's a dirty dirty read when the sexytimes get going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SYV1XSIUURNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0150GZUA8#wasThisHelpful","R3SYV1XSIUURNL","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kate is a woman filled with self-doubt, mostly because men (her father and ex-boyfriend) have put her down, a lot. She's never had an orgasm with a man, and she's not sure she can ever fall for a man--not after witnessing her mother's destructive marriage, and her own disastrous single foray into dating.Kate's an artist spending a week in Paris hoping to learn what to do with her life--she has been accepted for her MFA in art, and she has a job offer at an ad agency. School, or work? If she can't get a better sense how to do her art, she's got to take the job, right.Naturally, for Kate, her vacation/vision quest begins badly. Her purse is snatched at a cafe. Her coffee is picked up by a sexy stranger, Rylan, who entreats Kate to spend some time together, as her guidebook is now stolen, and he knows the city intimately. Kate gets the idea that Rylan knows a lot of women intimately, and this idea is verified by Rylan--who, let's face it--is a lazy trust-fund brat having an extended temper tantrum. I do like Rylan, but he's exactly that. He let his father dictate his life, and he was seriously disappointed and unhappy with the result.Rylan convinces Kate to hang out, and also to let him seduce her--he's sure he can satisfy her sexually and he spends several nights doing just that. There is a lot of sex, most of which is non-penetrative. Kate is initially nervous about having intercourse, so Rylan satisfies her in other ways, and he's not specific about reciprocity. In fact, he counts his lack of action to be a penance for all the half-truths he reveals to Kate. He's led her to believe that he's a struggling ex-pat, though this is far from true. His father's tarnished legacy has fallen into his lap, and he wants nothing to do with it. He has a lot of self-hate, which makes him more sympathetic. Plus, he lives to get Kate off, which is kinky fun.Rylan wants nothing more than to spend these perfect days with Kate, but that gets snipped when she learns she's just another lying liar, like her cheating ex and her cheating dad. Expect a frosty break-up, and a chance at redemption. Expect a whole lotta sexytimes, and a fragile ego to become a burnished self-esteem. Kate and Rylan have serious daddy issues, and they deal with them in similar ways. By the end, neither of them is running, which was good. The planned sequel looks to be just as sexy, and will provide the end of this story, though there was enough closure here for the story to rest.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QR5KRGO2C32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MPQGDW#wasThisHelpful","R37QR5KRGO2C32","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a series, but can be enjoyed on it's own.High school senior Libby Garrett is a big girl. She has some hormonal issues that keep her from losing weight, though she's on a strict diet and exercises regularly. She's a math whiz, and part of the Science Squad at her high school in Utah, but she's gotten involved with a college boy who does her wrong. Owen, may be ""all that"" on the basketball court, but he's been hooking up with Libby on the super down-low for a year now. He's never met her parents, never gone out on a date with her, and won't even accept her social media friendships. He even arranges hotel stays for their trysts to keep Libby out of his dorm room.In the past year, Libby has changed her wardrobe--eschewing her witty cat t-shirts and jeans for (unflattering) lycra and mini-skirts. She's flaked on all her friends, multiple times, and hurt their feelings. Because, when Owen calls, Libby answers.Her besties, Avery and the rest of the Science Squad stage an Owen intervention, mediated by Adam--Avery's tattooed skater manager at the coffee shop. Adam's had a hard life and he knows all about addiction, thanks to his mother's alcoholism. He is the legal guardian for his younger sister, and sacrificed his high school diploma in order to work enough to support them both. He's always had a crush on Libby, but he's disappointed to see how her personality has changed since Owen arrived.Libby wants nothing to do with the intervention, or Adam, but a week after some hard truths, she decides to try. Adam and Avery continue to tell her that she's worth more than Owen's leftovers, but it's hard quitting him cold turkey. Libby's never had a boyfriend, and doesn't fell worthy of love due to her weight problem. Still, she wants her friendships back, and healthy, and she's tired of being a booty call. Adam agrees to be her ""sponsor"" and their close proximity brings Libby to a place she never anticipated.This is a refreshing YA romance. Adam's such a decent guy, and Libby begins to see herself as more than a ""fat"" girl. Her self-image has been low for a long, long time, and it's hard for her to accept compliments, especially from Adam. Adam tries to guard his heart, but he's a goner for Libby. That said, he's not trying to make moves on her. He's hoping that she'll find the strength to love herself, and then (hopefully!!) him.Expect the usual slow bond and misfire scenario. Owen's not eager to give up his feisty kitten, and he regularly tests Libby's resolve. I totally enjoyed the slow burn between Libby and Adam, and I felt that Libby learned a lot about herself, and friendship, in this story. Some grand gestures and humorous situations kept the pace rolling along. There's only kissing on the page, though we know Libby is a sexually active teen. There's a real HEA here, for both Libby and Adam, who are great characters to tag along with. It's a dual POV story so we get to peek inside both Libby and Adam's brains. A real treat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PVDKO158XKAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01328HWU2#wasThisHelpful","R1PVDKO158XKAZ","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this contemporary erotic menage romance. (M/M/F and M/M and M/F/M)Coben spent the last year of his service in the Royal Air Force in a clandestine love affair with a fellow soldier, Edward. They had a passion that was exceptional, but Coben wanted out of the military and Edward was planning to move higher in the ranks into the SAS. They share a bittersweet goodbye, and vow to always love one another, even if they never see each other again.Five years passes, and Sian has married Coben. She's elated in her marriage, and thrilled to have such an attentive husband. They are adventurous in the bedroom (or wherever!) and openly discuss their fantasies, including the possibility of bringing a third into bed--as a treat. It's not a fully-formed idea, but Sian is intrigued by the possibility of having two men at once, and also, indulging Coben in his desire to be with a man--one fantasy he had previously confessed to.Sian meets Ed, a gorgeous military man, when he shows up at her tattoo parlor, and they hit it off. Then, he's a guest at a dinner party she and Coben attend. She can't shake the feeling that Coben and Ed are unsettled around each other. Her intuition is correct, and she begins to press Coben to interact with Ed--finding out their history together is a huge bonus.This is a super sexy, erotic menage romance that really satisfies. I loved how Edward and Coben were so caring toward each other and Sian. The sexytimes are delicious and kept me awake and reading long after bedtime. There was no jealousy, only affection and understanding. None of the players seemed to feel left out--they were all engaged throughout the story. Their unconventional romance was a treat to experience, and it's an HEA X 3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HT8M9ZDYUTVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01770XX22#wasThisHelpful","R1HT8M9ZDYUTVV","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in a series that can be fully enjoyed as a standalone.I will preface this review with a couple misconceptions that I brought with me when I opened the book:1. I thought it would be sexy. It is a contemporary M/M romance, featuring an out-gay man and an asexual man. This is a romance, but do not expect any sex. Any.2. I thought it would be a paranormal/shifter story. I mean, Abe Behr (pronounced ""Bear"") is a six and half foot tall, grizzly of a man, who is gruff and loves to spend time in his isolated cabin, fishing. He's inordinately drawn to sweets. Like, he could (and does) eat a whole three-course dessert meal. Abe is a bear, but he is NOT the bear shifter I thought I'd find. (More's the pity, alas). Disclaimer:  My review isn't based on the the lack of shifterness, however. I'm totally cool with non-paranormal stories.Okay, so what happens is this:  Abe's been running his family's construction company since the ripe age of 16 when his no-account, alcoholic dad died of liver disease. He is now 32 y/o, a steadfast family man, very concerned about his two remaining younger brothers, Ben and Connor who work in the company, along with any of a number of uncles, cousins and in-laws. Behr Construction is a profitable company, but the books aren't lining up with the kind of profit that should exist. Abe hires Jeff Mason, a young, svelte accountant with great recommendations to go over his finances.[Aside: Jeff Mason's father and Abe's father did not like each other, and Abe's father had a particular hate for all the Masons.]Bringing a ""Mason"" into the Behr lair is tantamount to mutiny, for some of the Behrs, but Jeff does a great, and somewhat convoluted, espionage job with Abe at his side to learn who is scamming the company. It seems that the fraud is a team effort and the worst of the bunch are weeded out.Being in close proximity with Jeff awakens new feelings within Abe. He's never had an attraction before, and he's frustrated to find he's very much attracted to Jeff. Add to that, their cloistered area of California has a firebrand of a minister that's rallying the townsfolk against the Gays, who are moving into this area due to skyrocketing prices in San Fran. (Clearly The Gays don't like Oakland...)So, Abe is beginning to notice all the anti-gay sentiment and it angers him. He pushes back, hard, against his vendors and sub-contractors who are flying their bigot flag. It's a rough deal, because he's trying to come to terms with his own sexuality, and people he's known his whole life are newly homophobic.I'm going to say that I'd have liked this story a lot more if there had been a little less frenetic pacing. Abe spends a good bit of time pondering his three issues: dwindling company profits, same-sex attraction, and homophobic townsfolk. The crescendo for these issues came too fast, however. I had little time to savor the results of all the tension. Also, no sex. Abe has a wild night, his first I'm led to believe, and I got nothing. #HugelyDisappointed I love me a virgin hero, and Abe had all the makings of this, based on his asexual history. Like a teen boy busting his first nut, it was all over too quickly to suit me.I am sure this will appeal to readers who like low-steam romances. Abe is an admirable hero, and Jeff is a doll. There's a good lesson in there about family and loyalty and being the very best person to do a tough job, too. The characters are interesting and I wanted more of their soft side on the page.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UV0AKH4SCP03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016H7VXEQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UV0AKH4SCP03","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"London 1990. Martin is a mechanic's apprentice who's tired fo the club scene. His roommate and best friend, Graham's alwasy off chasing the women and Martin's tired of being a wing man, until Graham's newest girl brings friends one night and Martin meets Beck.Martin thinks that Beck is short for ""Becky"" and they dance and interact all evening. He's attracted to Beck's slender form and wants to continue their fun the next day. Martin takes a kiss from Beck, but later considers his evening partner may have been less female than he first suspected.Martin stews over Beck the next day, and is particularly frustrated when he's stood up on their date. He seeks Beck at the club the next week, and is no longer considering Beck's androgyny female. Nope, Beck's a dude, and this freaks Martin out--a bit. Well, he seriously suspected this was the case after their first meeting, and it's strange how that week of consideration gave Martin the strength to seek an answer to his ""Am I gay"" dilemma.They embark on a tentative relationship, fully intending to stay in the closet--masquerading as friends. His seems to work, at first, but it's hard to keep is hidden from Graham. Plus, the women at clubs find their glam look to be catnip.I really liked this quiet romance. There are some family issues, but honestly, there was less conflict than I had anticipated given the time period of 1990. I was not present in London then, but in the States there was a decidedly anti-gay sentiment, that was fueled by HIV/AIDS hysteria. It seemed to me that this may have been true in that locale, as well, considering the level of homophobia that exists today. That said, I wanted a bit more conflict, but the rest of it was enjoyable. I do love me some sexy British men wearing guyliner and spandex. That was a total hoot! Martin is a doll and Beck is adorbs.I received a review copy of this book from the author in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGCHXFNDPJ2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015KJG3SI#wasThisHelpful","R3KGCHXFNDPJ2S","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2015/10/review-a-place-to-belong-by-hurri-cosmo/3.75 stars.Logan is a home health nurse, the private companion and caregiver of a wealthy Texas matriarch, Gail McFarren. He has an esteemed relationship at the McFarren estate, managing all the servants on a day-to-day basis for Gail as she becomes sicker and weaker during his three-year tenure. Logan is thirty-three, and estranged from his family who disowned him for his acknowledged homosexuality, but Gail adores him and he has developed an amiable relationship with Gail’s grandson, Bradley, who hired him. Bradley is the object of Logan’s special esteem. In short, he has a crush on his beloved patient’s straight grandson.As the story begins, we learn that Gail has been battling advanced metastatic cancer and has opted to stop all but palliative treatment. She has faded in and out of comas for the past several weeks, but it seems that the current one will likely be the end. All the house staff are making the house in readiness, in accordance with Gail’s wishes, for her extended family to arrive and pay their respects. Logan is managing as best he can, while also keeping a bedside vigil for the woman who’s become like a grandmother to him. All along he is awaiting the arrival of Bradley, who is off on a business trip and cannot be easily reached.In the meantime, all of Gail’s scurrilous relations come acalling. People that Logan has heard about and never seen in all the three years he’d worked for Gail. He abhors the nonchalant attitude of these graspy people, and is pitted against a shameless and uncouth relation with designs on Gail’s treasures and light fingers that may be removing objects even before the good lady’s last breath.Throughout all, Logan wishes for Bradley to return, if only so he does not miss his dear grandma’s end. But, also, because Logan is sure Bradley—a strapping and formidable man—will keep his relations in check. And, there is the fact that Logan is hopelessly in love with Bradley and knows that their time together is now marked by the end of Gail’s life. For, what need will Bradley have of a home nurse once Gail goes?This is a very sweet read. Logan is a kind and nurturing man who has had some bad experiences in his past. Having been cut off by his family, he only desires a home of his own, and he has felt at home with Gail, and Bradley when he comes to visit. His pain over losing both Gail—his dear patient and friend—and his home is fully relatable. Also, I totally identified with his anguish on Gail’s behalf for the crap behavior of her family. The writing is strong and evokes a sense of kinship with this man’s plight.I think the misdirection/miscommunication when Bradley returns is a little over done. Bradley has important issues to discuss regarding life after Gail, and it pertains to Bradley finding love. Which, naturally, breaks Logan’s heart and causes him to completely avoid Bradley. The end was rushed, in my opinion. I really would have liked some better development of the funeral, and Logan and Bradley’s big talk, and all that came after. Still, that didn’t bother me. It’s a good sign when I want more, really. I had one glaring issue, however, which I will not spoil, but I will say I was really digging the book when I got sideswiped by an aspect of Logan’s sexual history that was wholly unnecessary and nearly unpalatable. With no preamble or foreshadowing, I honestly couldn’t suspend my disbelief of that “truth nugget,” and I had to call Logan a liar, which I didn’t want to do, at all, because I mostly adored him. Apart from that bit, I was really satisfied with the story. While I wanted more in the end, I was happy that Logan has his HEA. Also, this is a very low-steam read. The love doesn’t happen until the very last bit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20UXDJ6EWIZTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015VILKF4#wasThisHelpful","R20UXDJ6EWIZTQ","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark is the owner of an indie bookstore, Bookmarked, teetering on the brink of insolvency and is desperate to increase sales. He plans to host a series of author events, to bring people into the store, and he's sure if he can convince a local bestselling author to participate he'll have a chance at keeping the doors open longer. Trouble is, Sheppard Knight is a total recluse. He's never done a signing--or an author event.Mark reaches out, and is promptly rebuffed by Sheppard. Just as he had been when he identified the attractive, but quiet, man who spent hours writing in a nook at the back of Bookmarked. This time, Mark lets Sheppard have it for his rudeness, which sparks a change of heart. It turns out Shep has serious anxiety issues, and that's why he's shied away from public appearances.Mark and Shep begin to build a rapport over shared confidences, and it's almost more than Mark could hope for--his original interest in Shep is returned. Most heartily, I might add.This is a delicious little story. Maybe I'm prejudiced. Full disclosure: I'm a bibliophile. I love EVERYTHING about books. I'm 99% sure I conceived a child because of OUTLANDER (the book, not the TV show). So, the idea of two fit men getting it on in a bookstore is *shockingly* totally arousing. #SorryNotSorryThere's a wee bit of homophobia, and the chance for a recalcitrant teen to make amends. And an indie bookstore gets saved! Yay!I'm excited to spend more time in the ""gayborhood"" of Heartsville, Illinois.

"Joseph ""West"" Weston has no remaining family. He's a workaholic, chairman of his own venture capitalist firm in Chicago and burned out. Five years ago his beloved grandfather died, and West is still hanging onto the ashes, instead of committing them to the sea as he promised he would. Deciding that his rut is getting too deep to see out of, he gathers his few casual clothes, the urn and the keys to his Ferrari and heads west for Eureka, California. He free-wheels it out to the coast, but three hours from his destination West stops for gas and food in picturesque Canyon Creek, CA. There he experiences a pang of nostalgia for the quiet towns he and his grandfather had visited when he was a newly-orphaned boy. Seeing a vineyard, he's struck with a memory of the quiet vineyard location of his parent's wedding--one of his many trips with Gramps. Impetuously, he buys it.Rush loves his hometown of Canyon Creek. It's the only place his mind settles after surviving the horrors of being a Marine helicopter pilot in Afghanistan. He runs a Christmas tree farm on the outskirts of town, and is deeply unsettled when his parents up and sell their vineyard to an outsider. Rush never wanted to work the vineyard, but he doesn't want the vintages of his family name to become compromised. Still, he's not at all friendly to the flashy new owner. Nope. Rush hates ""Richie Rich's"" and he's sure West is a trust fund brat. He's wrong, but it takes him some time to accept that, and even apologize for his rude behavior.See, Rush isn't his real name--but he was given that nickname as a result of his impetuous habit of ""rushing in"" and making snap judgements. So, West needs Rush's help and Rush is a prickly peach of a man. Rush does agree to help, and they develop a detente. And, well, there's a rush to physicality, which seemed impetuous--but was apparently in character with these two. Neither one has good impulse control.While West continues on his break, he and Rush develop a strong bond. All this time the vineyard work is getting done, but West is ignoring his business back at home. I liked how the relationship developed in this part of the book. It felt very genuine, if idyllic. I fully anticipated West having a business breakdown, as did Rush and West. It happens and the necessary separation is a problem. Unfortunately, this is the weakest part of the book for me, as there was little discussion of longing or betrayal or abandonment, which all occur but are only briefly described. I wanted to have that ache, that need, really explored, but it was not. That said, there was a delicious grand gesture on Rush's part, and then and even bigger one, which was not well-foreshadowed, on West's.Again, the initial sex scene was abrupt; it wasn't my fave, though I did enjoy the close relationship that developed. Rush definitely rushes to judgement, and it sometimes causes problems. He's not impressed with West's money, in general, and that is a source of trouble, especially when West goes gift shopping. I liked how they make big in-roads in communication, though these skills seemed to evaporate once West returns to Chicago. Expect some serious HEA, and some serious lovin'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJKOADCNX4IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623807549#wasThisHelpful","RMJKOADCNX4IO","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Robert ""Mac"" MacIntyre is a best-selling sci-fi writer who helps out at Denver's library rummage sale, well, because he loves books. He loves writing them, reading them, selling them, smelling them. He's called in to assist a man move the several boxes of hardcovers he purchased out to his car. Mac's attracted to Tommy, and wants to put some moves on him, but they have an immediate problem. When Mac comments how he'll surely have a great time reading them, Tommy tells him he doesn't read at all, he turns the books into art. The horror!Mac is dumbfounded and furious, but he can't get the intriguing man out of his head. Their brief encounter becomes a bit obsessive, for both men. Mac begins writing a book that's completely outside his genre (Male/Male romance!!) Meanwhile, Tommy takes a Rob MacIntyre book and transforms it into a centerpiece of his gallery showing.Mac's unhappy to be entering his ex's (Stig's) art gallery a couple months later, only to find the new showing his agent dragged him to is of Tommy's book art. He's captivated and vexed to learn that the piece made from his own book is not for sale. He can't find the artist anywhere, and hasn't learned that Tommy is the artist, but he needs to buy his piece, and he cons his way into getting Tommy's info. Their second meeting is even more revealing than their first...This is a well-told love story. Tommy is a mystery that Mac is desperate to unravel. He becomes an unacknowledged hero to Tommy, making it possible for Tommy to provide important medical care to his brother and also to keep his business running, all at Mac's great expense. There are some consequences to Mac's (dubious) knightly behavior, in that he's overstepped and needs to be brushed back, and that seemed reasonable, and also the reconnection seemed reasonable. I think the second separation was a bit abrupt, and without the same logic.There are some nice sexytimes, and real emotion here. The book-within-a-book thing is a trope I can occasionally appreciate, and the vignettes were not so long to be terribly distracting. I liked the reasoning behind Tommy's art, and I liked that Mac adored it, once he understood. I did find that some of the language felt stilted to me, and I was stunned to learn this is an American author, as the formal diction, at times, was akin to Queen's English. I also wondered about the ""Federal pension"" business, and the weird ""State Hospital"" scenario, because, again, these seemed to be something outside of American experience. (I do know that there are state-run facilities for the criminally insane, but this is not the place a suicidal patient would be sent, even if he was completely broke, nor would a physician at one of these places attempt to cover-up a patient assault. That's grounds for dismissal and license suspension, so it troubled me...)That said, I did like the book, and found it entertaining. I wanted Mac and Tommy to get together, for real, and I appreciated their HEA. Also, there was great character set-up for the sequel which will feature two secondary characters finding a match. So, something to look forward to reading!  I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3U021A3UVZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01621EHPE#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3U021A3UVZY","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this book on the review/recommendation of Khanh, who rarely finds a 5-Star gem, and gushed over this historical romance. Thanks, Khanh!Madeline Gracechurch is a proper young Englishwoman whose stepmother and father wish to have settled favorably with a husband. At 16, Maddie is unable to mix in company, however, She suffers intense agoraphobia and knows that she will disgrace her family if pressed into London's social marriage network. She's a devoted penpal to her ""afianced"" however, one Captain Logan MacKenzie, A Highland Scot fighting the French--who happens to be entirely fictitious. She sends him letters and sketches, and arranges to have return letters from him delivered from him.This charade continues for years, Maddie feeling bad, but not entirely. She expects that her letters are being trashed somewhere, entertainment for anonymous troops who think her a flighty girl. Remorse does set in when her godfather gifts her a Highland estate so that she and Captain MacKenzie will be comfortable upon his return. She decides to end this ruse, now some eight years old, by reporting the death of the valiant Captain. She mourns him properly, vows to never wed and decamps form her father's home to her Highland estate, in the company of her ""ruined"" spinster Aunt Thea.Maddie has been comfortable in her estate for two years now. She has a tidy income from her scientific drawings and the working farm. She is a good mistress, knowing her tenants and ensuring their welfare. What she is not is a woman looking for a man, and one appears on her doorstep out of the bonny blue sky: Captain Logan MacKenzie.Not just the good captain, he has brought some of his displaced soldiers with him. To stay. Yes, Logan exists, and he received many a letter from a foolish English lass he expected to be decrepit or club-footed or have some gross malformation that rendered her unsuitable for marriage. The young, delicate comely woman who is terrified by his brawn (and assertion that they be married posthaste) is not at all whom he expected to find.Logan has has a bad time of life. Abandoned by his parents, left as an orphan and pressed into His Majesty's service by his ""adoptive"" family, Logan has never known a real home, nor real love. He doesn't believe in it, and figures that the spoils young Maddie received by conning her family ought to suit him and his cast-off men who have nowhere to live after all their sacrifices for the Crown.Aunt Thea is overjoyed, and canny. She wants her Maddie to have a love-filled life, and this rugged Highlander seems to fit the bill. Maddie, for her part, is attracted and intrigued, but she agrees to handfast her captain only because he threatens to reveal her subterfuge to all of London's society.It's a big mess, of Maddie's own creation as she acknowledges, and she womans up. She makes her vows, but allows herself some time to adjust to married life. In particular, she forestalls the consummation of their marriage in the hope that she can locate MacKenzie's cache of her letters and destroy the evidence thereby unsealing their deal. In the meantime, they spend quite a bit of time together, managing the estate. Maddie's even prepared to hand this over to Logan, in return for him letting her be, but Logan knows how the English change their minds and take back what they give in Scotland. So he won't be having any of her deals.Plus, he's mighty attracted. His initial lust tempers into admiration when he sees how compassionate she is to all those around her estate. A true affection blossoms between Maddie and Logan, one that is fierce. It scares both Logan and Maddie, but Maddie takes steps to protect her heart--until she recognizes that Logan's armor guards him too closely for very good reason.Maddie and Logan are two excellent characters. While Logan is a battle hardened man, he's not a brute. He's educated and appreciates Maddie's peculiarities. Maddie practically swoons when she find him reading her treasured copy of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, yet she can't allow herself to believe such a beautiful physical specimen could truly love her. In fact, she very much believes Logan when he tells her he cannot.There are some delightful sexytimes. Maddie is a virgin, and Logan has been celibate ever since Maddie's letters began arriving. He lived a model life to give his men hope, and when the letters started he couldn't set a bad example of carousing when the men believed he had a steadfast sweetheart. It has created a serious back-up of lust for Logan to carry. Logan's selflessness is a problem through the story--all the way to the very end, and yet, it's his most endearing quality.Where can I find me one of those magic mirrors or circles of standing stones? I need me a sexy Highlander, toot sweet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZNJSYWKT5X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQROPBC#wasThisHelpful","R3IZNJSYWKT5X2","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a Halloween-themed LGBT anthology which features paranormal sotires of all flavors. Most are romance some are not-so-much. There's a bit of steam in nearly all of the stories.In Nine-Tenths of the Law by Kiernan Kelly, Oliver discovers he has a haunted sex toy. I liked how this one turned out. Oliver is an out gay man now, but he wasn't always. Sometimes his poor choices hurt people in ways he hadn't intended, and he has the chance to make reparations. It's a little bittersweet.In Bear Hugs by Laney Cairo, Martin's boyfriend might be bear shifter and apparently that's news to him. This one is so cute. Really. Eric is a bear of a man who has found a real gem of a boyfriend, Martin. Martin loves Eric's hairiness, but he suspects that there's more going on with Eric than even Eric suspects. It's tender and amusing.In Houdini's Masquerade by Alex Cohen, when Lila meets a succubus, everything changes. This one was kinda sad, for me. Lila has a secret that makes her virtually invisible any night but Halloween. She meets a succubus, Tasha, who is captivated by Lila's resistance to her charms. It is tender and I so wanted Lila to get her happy ending. I think she did, in a way.In Prsidium by Katey Hawthorne, Thackeray needs helps from a witch who won’t help him until he explains his demon. Thackeray is a haunted man. Literally, which is kinda funny. He hunts demons in the human realm, assisted by his ""companion"" Seir. There's a whole lotta mess building in advance of Samhain, with a coven of witches trying to bring a demon across, but Thackeray teams up with Matthew, a witch who helps him gain access to the ritual space just in time. If only Seir would take a hike so Thackeray and Matthew could get it on in peace... I liked  that this was a story of two black men--I love diversity in M/M romance.In Black Cat by Jamie Jennings, when a cat shifter can see ghosts, Micah's simple life suddenly isn't. This is a short one. Nico is a tenant in the same building as Micah, only Nico doesn't live alone--a ghost of a beloved lost haunts/hunts him. Micah is able to see this ghost in his cat form and helps Nico find peace. Very brief, wished there was more.In Haunted Honeymoon by Aaron Michaels, Dylan and Jake seem to be sharing their non-honeymoon with a couple of ghosts. This was such a lovely one. Not too long. Dylan and Jake are newlyweds sneaking off for a quickie honeymoon weekend at a resort that's rumored to be haunted. Dylan is surprised to see a pair of men wandering the estate hand in hand. He'd thought there wasn't many guests...and he was right. It's a sentimental story.In And the Tarot Cards Said by Jacey Mills, an insistent ghost shouldn't be too much to handle for psychic Vassily and his Tarot-reading assistant Ben. Ben has real talent reading Tarot and other mystical oracles in his job as soothsayer for ""psychic"" Vassily. Vassily is a complete snake oil salesman, until the one night he takes the stage and wings it completely. Ben had been having disturbing Tarot for a while, and is stunned that he can't recall a single part of Vassily's big show--despite his photographic memory. Ben has held a secret crush on Vassily for years now, and it is only after Vaissly confesses the reason he could take over a show that they can finally acknowledge Ben's role in his life.In Spirit Wolf by L.J. Hamlin, when Dawson rescues an injured wolf shifter, it's not just his book that gets worked on while getting back to nature. Dawson is a best-selling author with writer's block. He takes a cabin in the woods to try and reconnect himself, as a shifter, and he finds an injured wolf with the help of a spirit guide. It's a sweet tale that also has a bigger message about tolerance.In Wet Nails by Shira Glassman, it's not every day a glamorous '50s actress comes out of a TV but lonely grad student Adina isn't complaining. Adina is a science grad student who has a serious crush on a Hollywood bombshell, Rose Hamilton. Late one evening, while fantasizing yet again, Rose steps forward in time and give Adina the night of her life. Sweet and sexy.In Possessed by Love by Sheri Velarde, a storm trapping them together gives Andrew and Damian the chance they've been waiting for. It's a blizzardy evening, and the main street of their small town is clappered for the night. Andrew stops by Damien's cafe to grab some food to last out his siege and finds it deserted, excepting the sultry owner. They take refuge in each other. Their passion leads Andrew to do some investigating regarding the powerful urges he felt that first night together, and it may be that some wronged ghosts may have been able to make things right...through them.In The Last Night by Kassandra Lea, Eric gets one night a year and he always picks one particular Halloween. This is such a bittersweet one. Eric is a Reaper and many years ago he shared a deep love with a mortal. His relief for the transport of souls is to get a single night with his love, and he cherishes it. The tone is wistful and nostalgic.In Molly by Mychael Black, Detectives Cameron and Chase discover the murderer plaguing their city is more sinister than they could have known and not entirely human. I had a chuckle with this one because it reminded me of some horror flicks back in my youth. A bit of steam, a lot of gore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R113JO91O1HCVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016LVX0HG#wasThisHelpful","R113JO91O1HCVD","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a new Courtlands series that features the developing relationship between Seth and Bilal and also has chapters that revolve around Seth's father Nick's relationship with Allison and Eric.Seth and Bilal have just graduated form Cornell, and they are struggling to figure out what to do next. Seth wants to move to NYC, and jump headlong into the art scene. Bilal relishes the quieter life of upstate New York, and is offered a job in one of Eric's companies working in Rochester. These are incompatible ideals.One thing is for sure, Seth and Bilal are set to spend a month in England, first for Bilal's sister's wedding, but also to take a break since the end of school. They decide to take it easy on the decisions until that time is up, but their best laid plans go seriously awry.I do not want to spoil here, but I will say that there is a forced separation that is especially harrowing for its resemblance to real-life issues of the LGBTQ community in the Middle East, and also some anti-Muslim sentiment. Bilal knows he can never return to Iran, but he's got an expiring visa and needs documents from his mother's effects, currently with his sister in Oxford, in order to continue living in the US. All he wants to do is get there, get his paperwork in order without returning to Iran, and well, it doesn't QUITE work out.Expect some serious baddies to intervene. And expect Eric and Nick and some assistance from an ex-CIA hacker to bring everyone home safely. This was a tense read, with lots of reflection and remorse on the part of both Seth and Bilal. Their early squabbles regarding mutual support and life plans pale in comparison to this real situation, and the possibility of permanent separation.I think the reason I didn't rate this higher, however, was due to a bit TOO MUCH anger. Bilal has some real issues with communication, and he internalizes his hostility and frustration with Seth's family constantly stepping in to ""help."" His overarching desire to be his own man causes a real rift that puts himself in grave danger, and it irritated me. I had to keep reminding myself that Bilal and Seth are barely 21 y/o and they are gonna do dumb stuff, especially as this is their first real relationship.There is a decent bit of steam, both M/M (for Seth and Bilal) and M/F/M as Allison regains her strength and begins having relations with Eric and Nick again. For their part, Eric is continually being asked to return to the Senate and he may just cave this time. Nick's been working on a book with his CIA contact, and Allison's stepped away from most things in the process of recuperating from her recent MS flare.The Courtland saga continues...though there is sufficient closure in this book to be a satisfying break.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G626P1H6DEEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015W2RPBM#wasThisHelpful","R2G626P1H6DEEX","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in a series, and I'm probably sure I should have read it in order. That said, I still was able to enjoy this book--after I sorted out the backstory.This is a historical romance of Ancient Greece featuring Olympian god Apollo finding love, unexpectedly, with a mortal princess.While the pantheon of Olympus squabbles regarding the vengeance Demeter wishes to wreak over a shade who hunts her daughter Persephone, Apollo and Hermes travel to Delphi to compete in the Pythian Games, celebrating Apollo's ancient victory over a dragon.  En route, Apollo catches sight of a huntress in the wood, Coronis. She is a fantastic physical specimen, and her form while hunting is admirable. He is taken by her physical charms, and thrown off by her acid tongue.Coronis is off-balance whenever she encounters the beautiful and arrogant (she assumes) Apollo. However, the longer he competes in the games, the more she realizes that his pride is well-deserved. Time and again he stands up for her, and risks much to save her from a forced marriage to Damocles.Poseidon and Daphne, both angry with Apollo, are set on separating the pair, even after Apollo pledges to marry and remain faithful to Coronis. One reviewer complained that there's a lot of sex in this book. Ha! The first sexy scene between Apollo and Coronis happens on their wedding night, and there are few scenes after that. It's not THAT much sex, enough to cement their relationship, which is something that Apollo doubts greatly.He has never experienced real love, and Coronis possesses such a feisty, hard-won heart that he's not sure she truly does love him. HE feels that he loves her heart and soul, and wants to make her an immortal, the sooner the better, as he's had troubling images of her being attacked since they first met. He also sees their son growing strong, so he knows they have a life together, but--and this is probably mythologically accurate--it's not exactly a happily ever after. I won't spoil this, but the end is more bitter than sweet. The scheming Olympians have their way, and it leads to heartbreak and bloodshed.I liked the story. It was interesting and creative. I felt a part of this ancient society, and found it playful and engaging. I'd love to have a god worshiping me, as Apollo did for Coronis. His heart was open, and he reveled in the moments that he felts hers was, as well. There was plenty of plot to move the story along, between Coronis' unknown lineage, Damocles' antics, and Apollo's champion performances. How comical when the man you've been sniping at is suddenly revealed to be the god you worship and appeal to for guidance! Poor Coronis, I really did sympathize.I did have a serious problem in the amount of grammatical errors I found in my review copy. Not sure if I was sent an ARC, but there were so many errors (misused homophones, missing words, punctuation, misspellings) that I truly hope so, and I hope all was corrected in the for sale copy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17CKYHD951XEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116KFAK2#wasThisHelpful","R17CKYHD951XEC","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a series, but can be enjoyed as a standalone.Tristan and Gabe met once in the bathroom of the gay bar Gabe's fathers own, Big Dick's, in the previous book in this series. Gabe was struck by Tristan's vulnerability, it flipped all his care-taking switches, when Tristan had a panic attack after he forgot where he was. This book picks up two months later when Tristan returns to Big Dick's with his friends Noah and Shane--and Gabe takes total care of them.See, Tristan was gay bashed three years prior and his short-term memory is around 30 minutes. He copes by taking copious notes of all his interactions. His best friend, Noah, was also attacked with him--though Noah came out of it with only physical and emotional scars. Noah visits Tristan twice a week, oftentimes with his boyfriend, Shane. (The previous book was about Shane and Noah, and they have important recurring roles here.)Gabe knows Shane from work--well in a couple ways. Gabe has been a gay porn actor for two years and did a few scenes with Shane in the previous book. He knew Shane wanted to get out of porn, so he helped Shane to get hired as a go-go dancer at Big Dick's. They are friendly, though there is no spark between them.There is, however, a BIG SPARK for Gabe and Tristan. Gabe is drawn to Tristan, and wants to protect him. Gabe has his own troubles, though. He is living with, and paying the mortgage for, his verbally and physically abusive alcoholic mother. She never got over her husband being a closeted gay man, and Gabe suffered her abuse and disease for some time, before he was raised by his dads.Tristan's memory is a problem that Gabe works through by having email communication. This way, Tristan has a physical record of their connection. In addition, they video chat and Gabe begins to make an impression in Tristan's mind. Add to this, Tristan is offered inclusion in a drug trial that may increase his short-term memory retention. The risks can be severe and debilitating, but they are worth it for him to try.This is a sweet and sexy story that really felt complete. I liked Gabe bunches. He's a caring and compassionate lonely man. And Tristan is the same. He has been kicked, beaten and kicked again when he was down. Yet, he does look for a better life, a whole life that he can share with someone he loves. Gabe seems to be that man, but what will Tristan think about his mom? Or, the porn?The results were positive, and smoking hot. I never felt like either man was ""settling."" There was genuine attraction and affection throughout. Each man was as honest as he could be, and the full truth was not nearly as devastating as they expected. Expect an HEA and two guys who wear each other out the second they get some alone-time.

"This book is a two-fer of BBW shifter romance. One wild erotic ride, and one suspenseful adventure. Both stories can be read on their own.FERAL PASSIONS is the first story, and I liked it best.  Cherry has always been put down for her weight and has a painful past with men. She's conned into a week-long vacation by her sister and her sister's BFF. While staying at the beautiful, isolated, mountainous wolf reserve, Feral Passions, Cherry is stunned and suspicious of the interest she receives from two of the ranch hands, Brad and Cain. Both men are stunningly beautiful, as are the rest of the staff. Cherry was approached by a good looking man before, and he tore her world apart, so she's loath to accept their overtures--until she decides to follow her heart and treat this as a fling.Brad and Cain share a secret with their fellow males on Feral Passions land-they are werewolves. Capable of shifting into their wolf forms at will, they entertain the female-only clientele in the hopes of finding a mate. For Brad and Cain this is more of a challenge, as they are themselves a couple, and looking for a third. Could Cherry be The One? They have a very sexy week trying to convince her.This is a lighthearted breezy read with lost of sexytimes and a bit of minor conflict. I loved how Cherry was a bright woman, and had those guys all figured out! I also loved how sensual the sexytimes were, and Cherry's willingness to accept Brad and Cain as a pair. Delish! 4 Stars.THE ALPHA'S WOMAN was not my favorite, but still interesting.Kira is an Alpha female, raised to the perfect mate to an Alpha, but there isn't an Alpha in her current pack for her to mate. Her current Alpha is her father, and he's turned his back on her, allowing his Betas to assault her in the attempt to claim the top of the pecking order. She flees and ends up dragged into a new pack, against her will. Blaez is an Alpha who will never claim a mate. His parents tried that, and were destroyed by vengeful Greek gods, leaving Blaez and orphan. He can't bear to lose another family, but he also won't leave Kira on her own, knowing some other pack will claim or kill her.This story has a lot of world building and mythology that doesn't advance the romance. Most of the time Kira and Blaez were at odds, and unhappy with Blaez's highhandedness--yes, Blaez even made himself angry. The story jumped a bit, and left me wanting more romance, for sure. That said, I enjoyed the end. 3 Stars.I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V26IYHY5VNI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDWNK1E#wasThisHelpful","R3V26IYHY5VNI6","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is best enjoyed after reading the previous books in the series. When this book opens, Cael and Ash are still healing from wounds sustained in the previous story. That said, they are finally developing the bonds that Cael has long hoped to build. Sure, they had been the closest of friends, and definitely affectionate, but it had never gone past the occasional tender kiss, or cuddling. Cael wants more, and Ash wants more, but Ash has a long history of self-loathing.As a child, Ash had feelings for another boy, and a series of tragic incidences chased him far from his love and all the people he held dear. He grew up in a testing facility for cast off Therians, alongside Sloane Brodie. Ash survived the emotional and physical testing to later join THIRDS as one of the first agents in the program. He’s kept his heart held tight, but now he’s thinking there’s one person who would keep it safe: Cael.This is a definite hurt/comfort story, with both Ash and Cael working toward the kind of relationship they have always desired. In the background we have another diabolical plot hatching–one which had first come to light in BLOOD AND THUNDER but the full extent is only now being revealed. Someone has been developing a drug to control Therians in their animal form–creating drones with ultimate killing capability and no consciousness or conscience to stop them. Ash and Sloane are among the targeted, due to their history as Therian test subjects. It’s a dangerous and covert business, getting control of the drug before it’s used, and might put Cael in specific danger, as well.I really enjoyed the careful relationship building. Just because Ash and Cael have been close for several years, Ash is stunned to learn of Cael’s tragic pre-THIRDS history. Ash knows he needs to tread carefully, but it’s not that long before he recognizes that he can’t be the man Cael needs without taking chances on love. There’s a lot of vulnerability here, and super sweet steps toward coupledom. I think THIRDS fans will be well-satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2REMQ1WS47N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012J8ESLC#wasThisHelpful","RZ2REMQ1WS47N","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roger George Cottingham is a scourge to his noble family. The younger son, a bookish sort, continually passed over for affection by his parents in favor of his gregarious elder brother, Hugh, Roger knows he's second best. When it was time to enlist in the war against the Hessians, he balked. No, he didn't just balk, this Cambridge-educated man who speaks several languages refused to join up--knowing he was unable to kill a man. He was jailed for a miserable year as a Conscientious Objector before he was sprung and worked as a cryptographer for the Navy.Hugh was killed in a mission that seems quite dodgy on its surface. Roger's been tasked by Hugh's bereaved fiance (and Roger's close childhood friend) to find out if there's truth to the rumor that Hugh's espionage mission was leaked to the enemy beforehand. Inquiries have led Roger to a boardinghouse, home to Matthew Connaught, an amputee veteran of the war--and the man who Hugh replaced in the covert mission. Roger takes a room at the house under the pseudonym, George Johnson, in order to befriend Matthew, and glean information regarding Hugh's death--information which might implicate Matthew as a spy.Trouble is, Matthew is a fantastic man. He's upbeat, and lovely, and he and George immediately hit it off. Not only that, George is attracted to Matthew--and it seems that Matthew may return his interest. For George this is a revelation that is fraught with pain. Could he possibly be falling for the man who had a part in Hugh's death?All of his instincts say no, that Matthew is too kind and honest a man to have been a spy, but the deeper he gets involved, the more he recognizes that Matthew has some deep secrets--and he knows more about Hugh's death than George could have predicted.I absolutely enjoyed this book. Do not expect a lot of steam--though there is some, for sure. George has a day of reckoning in his future, and his inquiries result in peace for more than one family--though it causes a significant amount of distress for Matthew, and himself. For his part, Matthew finds himself in more than one uncomfortable position, and his confessions are a balm to George, as well as Hugh's fiance. I ached for George throughout. He's been abandoned and cast off his whole life, and Matthew provides the compassionate friend and partner that George has been too afraid to admit needing. This is a true hurt/comfort story, with an HEA for men who've suffered much, and carry on in the face of grief and loss. Plus, the historical details were a delight. I truly felt as if transported to that era, and was glad for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRAY9VC8D36O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX4QGV6#wasThisHelpful","R3RRAY9VC8D36O","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was something that captivated me in this story. There were things that didn't work, too, but mostly it got me. Or, I got it. Or, something.This is a YA dystopian story of survival, in a way--excepting the fact that we know from the start that the main character, Greta, will die. Yep. Greta Gustafson Stuart Duchess of Halifax and Crown Princess of the Pan Polar Confederacy, next-in-line for the throne, will die.Here's how:She is a hostage, sheltered and educated in one of Preceptures for royal hostages. This is Earth, 400 years into the future. Earth ruled by alliances that one hadn't dreamed possible, but that's what happens when the ice caps melt, there's widespread famine, and wars to end all wars have ravaged the globe enough to hand the control of the orbiting weapons systems over to AI in order to save humanity.Talis, specifically, was the UN AI in charge of conflict abatement. And he stopped the wars.  I saw the plague pits, I saw the starving armies, and eventually I...  Well, it was my job, wasn't it? I saved you.  I started by blowing up cities.  By city number seven--Fresno, because no one's gonna miss that--I had everyone's attention. I told them to stop shooting each other. And they did.  But of course it couldn't be that easy.The general terror led to a global stand down, and now Talis enforces peace by ""making it personal""--essentially keeping a Child from each territorial ruler as a hostage. This Child of Peace will be killed if that ruler goes to war. Simple, brilliant, and effective. Despite marginal resources on a global scale, there have been modest amounts of incursion, and fewer wars.Greta is a Child of Peace, raised in the 4th Precepture since age 5. She regularly visits home to her mother--like all Children of Peace--so as to reinforce the family bond, but her actual home has been on a self-sustaining farm in what was once Saskatchewan. Now 16 she has grown up around other Children of Peace, her cellmate Xie, who is considered to be descended from a Goddess in her homeland, and Atta whose people consider him a prophet, among others. They work hard raising goats for milk and cheese, fruit and vegetables and grains and honey--all the foodstuffs they require, and they learn about war, and peace and philosophy. Greta is an excellent student, but Greta's time is coming close. She knows because her land has water (Lake Ontario) and the people to the south, the new Cumberland Alliance, cannot survive on the dregs of Lake Erie. When a Child arrives from their current War Secretary, Elian, Greta recognizes that her life is likely numbered in months, or even weeks.Elian is like no other Child of Peace. He was raised in his home, with his parents. His Grandmother rules the Cumberland Alliance. He knows there will be war, and he knows he's been sent to die, and he will not go quietly.The Precepture is guarded by electronic monitors that use electric shock to keep the peace. As Elian soon discovers, he will be tortured until he is compliant. Greta and her comrades have seen nothing of resistance in their years there. Being raised from early childhood they learned to comply, to code their speech so that it didn't sound insubordinate or revolutionary, but Elian has no scruples, and his torture breaks something open in Greta. She was resigned to death, but perhaps it doesn't need to be something she accepts.I was caught in the state of constant readiness, alongside Greta. Most of her comrades are safe from the threat of death, by virtue of having no encroaching enemies, or too much power in their region. Greta and Elian should be enemies, but she cannot hate him. It is not his fault their people are at the brink of war. This is where the usual dynamic goes awry. People will expect Greta to fall for the bad-boy rebel Elian, and she does, but not the usual way.  He did not seem happy about it. ""I don't get it. From the day they dragged me here, I was going to die--we were both going to die--and you were okay with that.""  ""I was wrong.""There are a whole lot of fantastic, unprecedented changes in store for the Children of Peace, not least of which is meeting a hostile enemy and the savior of the human race.At no point does Greta become a soppy mess of a lovesick girl. She does change and affection comes, but it is unexpected and bittersweet.  ""You don't love me.""  ""Oh, Elian."" It was not that simple. Not nearly. ""I--I'm sixteen years old. And I've been asleep my whole life.""  ""You woke me up, Elian Palnik.""I found the almost Stockholm syndrome scenario of Greta's world to be intriguing. She knew that her mother could not/would not save her. She was resigned to sacrifice, and yet, she made choices that enabled her a modicum of freedom, in a way. A death of her choosing. Greta dies, but she also lives on--and not in a martyred memory. She is wise and she is capable--the unelected leader of the Children of Peace in her Precepture. She reaches out for help, and she sways a god. In her cool and calculating mind she finds a middle passage that saves hundreds of thousands, and, in particular, the one she promised to save.There is a love story here, but it is not between Greta and Elian. He is boy she hardly knows. No, Greta finds love with the people she has leaned on throughout her childhood. That love she never allowed herself to experience, fearing she would lose it becomes a purpose in her final hours.  If I was going to put my life down--as Wilma had--then I wanted to mourn it. I wanted to regret it, and fiercely. Maybe the grey room would kill me, and maybe not, but one way or another it would transform me, and this life would be done. I wanted to be alive before that happened. I wanted to be alive before I died, and I wanted death to terrify me, not slip in like a long expected guest.As for the book, there were parts I wanted to move faster, that then became important later. Those deft touches, and full-circling, brought my enjoyment back when it began to falter. There was a sharpness to the narration, a gallows humor, that kept the prose light. I did not weep for Greta. I did admire her, and I expect that her sacrifice will bring change to her world. And that's the best compliment I can give to a protagonist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S9YHKRJJPNT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBKUWQC#wasThisHelpful","R1S9YHKRJJPNT8","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Becca is a junior in high school, as is her BFF Tori and Tori’s twin brother, Toby. Becca has known the twins for more then ten years, and has been best friends with Tori nearly that long. She’s grown up with Toby and can’t help appreciating all the ways he has grown up, too. Toby’s a fit boy, captain of the basketball team and an all-around popular kid. He’s always been nice to Becca and Becca has a secret crush–one that she can never reveal to Tori, because Tori will dissolve their friendship. It’s happened before with other girls. Plus, Toby’s popular and Becca’s not–he’d never go for her…Then, Becca’s risking failure in trig, and Tori insists that Toby help Becca out. It’s heady, being alone with him, even if it is to study trig. But that not all that’s happening behind Toby’s closed bedroom door. Nope. He’s admitting to having feelings, and they decide to “try out” dating in order to see if it’s worth upsetting Tori over. They keep it behind closed doors, but Tori’s suspicious of Toby’s excellent mood, and Toby’s ex-girlfriend Meredith is ALWAYS turning up to cajole Toby back. Well, until Meredith learns that Toby and Becca are together. She’s had a mean streak over Becca for years, and seizes the opportunity to hurt Becca while also getting Toby back.This is a high-stakes high school romance that is pretty clean. I really liked both Becca and Toby, who want to find a real connection without the interference of sisters and exes and best friends, but it’s just not meant to be! Tori and Meredith are not nice girls, in this book. Meredith is the worst kind of conniver, and is set up to be the truly bad guy, but Becca makes plenty of dumb decisions, like going along with Meredith’s mean spirited plans. At first.Toby’s caught in the crossfire. He’d happily reveal all, and see if he and Becca can withstand the pressure, but he caves to Becca’s needs–Tori isn’t just her best friend, she’s her only real friend. Losing Tori is not an option, at least, until the decision is taken from her.I really did like the high school cattiness, to an extent, because it was so high school drama. That felt painfully real, but it carried on a bit long for me, and the resolution was super dramatic, with an auditorium reveal that is straight out of a sit-com. Meredith’s ultimatums were a tad too mean-spirited and hinted at illegal. That said, there were plenty of real emotions of the page. Becca never wants to hurt anyone, and FINALLY that included herself. I loved when she got over her self-sacrificing for Tori and began living her own life; it made the final pages much better, for me. I liked that Toby was a good, human, kid. He’s not perfect, doesn’t pretend to be, but he acts maturely throughout. He’s a good boyfriend to Becca, and a good brother to Tori–who is a spoiled rotten queen of a girl who only wants more social power. I really didn’t care much for her until the very end, and then only a little.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5B3HREY1Z3YN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VTLM4O#wasThisHelpful","R5B3HREY1Z3YN","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fiona's a struggling uni grad, working in a tavern and wondering what to do with her degree in creative writing when she finds a job listing for a PR associate. It sounds like she's a perfect fit, but the application period closed the day prior! Undaunted, she sends in her resumé, and is ecstatic to learn she got an interview. And, soon, she's being whisked off to posh Mayfair as the newest member of the Totally Five Star London staff.As all staff members are able to live in the hotel's discount employee quarters, Fiona's really on her way. She loves her job, and she's making new friends--among them a pair of wealthy guests who are regulars of the exclusive penthouse suites.James and Logan are delicious. Women and men alike are drawn to them, but they are also funny and sweet--well they charm Fiona, at first. She recognizes that they are a couple, and cannot figure out what they'd want with a woman, but it turns out the James and Logan are bisexual, and have a strong desire to add a third every now and then. If only Fiona will have an open mind...What she finds upstairs, however, isn't the tawdry business she suspected. Instead, she finds a kinky tableau that intrigues her, opening her eyes to a wider world of sensuality. I really enjoyed how her expectations were completely flipped, and also how she fit so well with Logan and James' dynamic. There are some mild scenes of BDSM, but they are not the focus of the action. Instead, it's more of a passport to a new sexual freedom. As she and the boys explore their kinky sides, she's excited, but also saddened. It's tough being a third wheel...but is she really, or is that how she sees herself?I liked that Fiona was a strong, independent woman. She went after what she wanted, be it a new job, a promotion, or a kink education. She was fearless, and I think that's what really drove James and Logan to dig their hooks in--she was an equal part of their experience by the end, and a happy threesome they made.It's smoking hot, and (bonus!) has a plot. *swoon*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDJBKN7NR6FOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784307882#wasThisHelpful","RDJBKN7NR6FOV","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was originally written for Joyfully Jay Reviews and can be accessed here:  http://joyfullyjay.com/2015/09/review-crossing-borders-by-z-a-maxfield/When I found this book on Joyfully Jay’s Favorite Coming Out Stories list, I jumped at the chance to review this for the Reading Challenge. I’ve read a few ZA Maxfield books in the past, and have enjoyed them, so the re-release of Crossing Borders piqued my interest. As I didn’t read the original, I can’t comment on the extent of revision or editing, but I will tell you that the book in current form is spectacular.Tristan is a 19-year-old, sexually-confused college student. He’s been sexually active with girls for several years, but he’s thinking that he is, perhaps, gay. He doesn’t seem to get that turned on with girls, and he’s had lots of gay fantasies. So, Tristan’s out to trap a guy, and find out for sure. He gathers up a bunch of gay literature and plants himself in the café of a Borders Books (back when they existed!! *sigh*) in plain view of the customers, one of whom happens to be off-duty Officer Michael Truax, the very same cop who ticketed Tristan years ago for skateboarding without a helmet.challenge monthTristan is not happy that “Officer Helmet” is lingering in the café, and he’s even less happy with the text commentary the good cop offers on the men who do attempt to pick Tristan up. When Tristan’s fishing expedition is a bust, Michael pushes Tristan to have lunch together, and that’s when the Tristan gets the bombshell: Officer Helmet just picked him up.The thing is, Michael is really a good looking man. He’s 26 with a gorgeously restored Craftsman home, and Michael’s clearly gay. And willing to help Tristan become less sexually confused. I absolutely melted along with these two as they spend an afternoon and night talking and working out the sexy. Tristan is a man-boy, old enough, but so nave and so appealing to Michael, who admits he’s harbored an almost-creepy attraction for “Sparky”—the nickname Michael gave to Tristan the first time they met.As the book unfolds, Tristan must come to terms with his sexuality. He does so with his family and friends, being the bold kid he always has been, but honestly he’s so tender. Being in his POV as he makes himself vulnerable is fantastic. Tristan has a lot of abandonment issues. He father died of a brain aneurysm and he’s living at home instead of going away to college so that he can be a role model to his younger sister and brothers, and help his mother with their care. He’s an admirable, stand-up guy, despite being a self-admitted adrenaline junkie and a tad reckless. Being with Michael is a little reckless, for Tristan, because Michael’s a young cop who has the worst detail and works nights often. Fear for Michael’s safety definitely becomes an issue for Tristan.I don’t want to reveal too many of the plot points here, but I want to remind readers that the book was written in 2007, published originally shortly thereafter, and for the characters in the story gay marriage is being banned nationwide, being out and proud as a cop is dangerous, and gay partners have no rights in the hospital. For goodness sake, BORDERS was a popular bookstore all those years ago! While times change, and laws change, and attitudes change, the feelings in Crossing Borders are timeless. Tristan’s family is flabbergasted with his news, and it takes them a bit to warm up to Michael. Michael’s family, friends, and work colleagues are suspicious of the “boy” who’s hanging around. They have problems, and issues, and reality. It’s not easy being together. But nothing worth fighting for ever is, right?I can easily see why this made Jay’s list of favorite coming out stories. Tristan is engaging and brilliant as a main character. He’s cocky and self-assured, but smart enough to realize that he doesn’t know it all. When presented with challenges, he rises to the occasion time and again. The story is well-told and approachable, with details that enrich, not distract. Michael is a protective man, seeing the dangers on the street on a daily basis. He’s had a rough time of his own, emotionally, and never wants to see anyone suffer. For all his witty banter, his heart is bigger than Texas, I think. I adored how Michael keeps his restored home free of many of the modern conveniences—like cable TV and internet—which are out of period with the house and it’s furnishings. It really struck me how Tristan’s deep appreciation for architecture allowed him to connect with Michael’s “old soul” ways. Their conflicts pulled me in; from overprotective misunderstandings to big ole abandonment problems, I wanted to see Michael and Tristan come out stronger on the other side. Also, hoo-boy, a break for a cold shower won’t come amiss. This book is hot and heart combined. Expect a rough road to the HEA, and some tear-jerking moments. Best advice: plan for an immediate re-read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOM8EYU5DCVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619231034#wasThisHelpful","R3FOM8EYU5DCVY","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Stars for this contemporary M/M romance between an aging porn superstar and a blushing virgin.Mike Scott is 44 and a bartender at a gay sports bar in Altlanta, with a 20 year career in gay porn. He's well known by his trade name, Scott Masters, and isn't that keen on relationships since his last ex left. Too many guys have a problem with his porn work, it seems. Not that Mike does. It's a job, and it's getting to be a drag. Studios are pressuring the guys to do more bareback (unprotected) scenes and new gay-for-pay actors are more hassle than they are worth, in Mike's opinion. He's getting jaded, really.Tommy is a 19 y/o gay college student trying to step out of his closet. He grew up in a tiny, God-fearing town with parents who took him to church all the time. He has never watched porn, and has no interest in it, in drinking, or in casual sex. Still, he knows his urges are homosexual, and he fears his family's reaction. (With good reason!) His roommate, Ben, is bisexual, but hasn't told his parents, either. Still, Ben spends his Saturday nights in the gay bars hooking up as often as possible. He hooked Tommy up with a fake ID so he could go clubbing too, but Tommy's more into the quiet life. So he goes to Woofs, a gay sports bar---where he's stunned by the beauty that is Mike.Mike can't miss the Cherry Coke drinking corn-fed farm boy who takes the last stool at his bar every Saturday night for weeks on end. He's mighty polite, and darn quiet, but he is an eye-catcher. Mike's fellow bartenders, Kevin and Patrick, all want a piece of Tommy, but they can see he only has eyes for Mike. And, they work a bit of magic to keep Mike from making serious mistakes--like letting Tommy walk away.When these two finally connect, it is so sweet. Tommy has confessed that he's a virgin, and that he's like Mike to be his first. He has no knowledge of Mike's porn career, and that's probably the only reason Mike agrees. Mike's been propositioned uncountable times by fans, and he doesn't need that pressure. Plus, there is something so absolutely irresistible about Tommy's freshness. He's been so sheltered in his life--his parents controlled his TV, radio and literature choices, in the meantime shaping a quiet, conscientious and compassionate man. He is nothing like the men Mike usually chooses, and that's also refreshing.The biggest part of the conflict is Mike's porn career, because Mike doesn't want to reveal it. As he and Tommy spend more time together, Mike realizes that he doesn't want to lose Tommy in his life, and that's happened too often once he reveals his career. So he keeps it quiet, but it is giant, hairy problem, especially once Tommy finds out.The way this is dealt with is really excellent, however. Love had bloomed, and Tommy's not sure what to do now. Can he deal with it? Should he have to? Expect a lot of tears, and some well-placed advice from seasoned bartenders.The entire book is a fantastic journey. I really dug being in these guys brains. Mike's has a real ""Come-to-Tommy"" moment and it made all his other decisions easier. The issues of being a career porn actor were so clearly described, I thought I was on set. I've read a few porn star books, and the ""business"" end of it is clearly less glamorous that the normals (like me) imagine. Tommy has some family issues that were devastating, and, yet, uplifting. Ben and his family are the most awesome folk--and the end is so HEA it'll rip the tears right out of your eyes.Or maybe that was just me.I gotta have more of these peeps, so I'm hoping to see a Ben book, or even a Kevin + Patrick book down the pike... Just sayin'","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LM1VSVD0B6VK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155KSKJC#wasThisHelpful","R2LM1VSVD0B6VK","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this historical M/M romance set in 1820s London.Anthony, Viscount Rawling, has known since he was young that he preferred men--and mostly, that he preferred Gabriel Tilden, elder brother of his childhood friend Pearce, above all other men. They shared one kiss seven years ago, while Anthony stayed at the Tilden's over a summer party, and Gabriel promptly married a woman. Now, Anthony has the occasion to see the recently widowed Gabriel as he escorts his sister around London.Gabriel has shameful lust in his heart and mind. He knows he's foul, and he married a woman he never desired in order to mask his frailty. He's never been with a man, though he's desired young Anthony for all his adulthood. Gabriel is in London to escape the sham of his life, and the fact that he has nor remorse over the death of his wife. Part of that escape is his reconnection with Anthony, who is all too eager to initiate Gabriel into the delights of man-love. The other, is gambling.These two star-crossed lovers have unknown hurdles to surmount. Anthony, as NO ONE knows is dyslexic. He has no ability to read any of the hundreds of missives he receives regarding his estates or society invitations. He attends the Houses of Parliament in person because he has a fantastic memory for all he sees and hears, and this is how he manages in society.Gabriel is ashamed for his trysts with Anthony, but he is more ashamed by the debts he is accruing with his nightly visits to the gambling dens.I loved Anthony--he is so kind and heart-on-his-sleeve. Gabe, well, he's a self-loathing man, which is hard to warm to, especially as he's rather a poor partner to Anthony. Still, he redeems himself, and his debts, which are numerous and great. I respected that, and I also respected the solution that he created to keep them together. This is an HEA with some of the recurrent characters from the Gambling on Love series making significant appearances--though one does not need to read those books to enjoy this one.I liked the story, but I almost felt it was a bit too long--and Gabe's penchant for hiding EVERYTHING from everyone got irritating. I wanted to shake him, and smack him, and shake him again. That said, I liked him in the end. And I always loved Anthony, so I was anxious for his HEA. I've read other books in this series, and adore the writing style and also the attention to detail and manner of the period. I'm never wondering if I'm reading anachronisms, because they aren't present. It's a wonderful escape to a historical period.I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B8MXQNK5STI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQVDZ98#wasThisHelpful","R2B8MXQNK5STI2","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a quickie ménage scene that answers the question: what happens when a vampire, a werewolf and a human walk into bar?Aneesa is a human in love with a sexy, non-sparkling vampire, Ace. They’ve been dating for eight years, enjoying the many splendors of love with each other, but both have a ‘bucket list’ ménage fantasy to tick off. Ace has chatted with his friend, Barton, a werewolf with an insatiable sex drive, about the possibilities, and he’s down for it. (Or should I say up for it?) Regardless, Barton wants to get it on, and isn’t above a bit of (harmless) stalking to get the party rolling.Thing is, Aneesa’s simultaneously put off and aroused by Barton’s interest. The deed goes forth with sexy results.For a sexy short, it packs a lot of heat, and the whimsical writing kept me smiling throughout.

"This book marks the end of Martin and Henry's initial stories (though I dearly hope that they are back again in some form, in some way!!!) and needs to be read in the sequence of Ganymede stories, or else it makes NO sense. It is set in NYC 1902 in an alternate world where slavery is fully acceptable and Companions are purchased for wealthy teens to use as valets and sexual outlets (for ""health"").Martin has recently reconciled with his master and lover, Henry Blackwell. Henry is a very wealthy 16 year old, the son of NYC's wealthiest man, Hiram Blackwell. Henry's family is an odd mix, and not quite what Martin had hoped for when he was being sold as a Companion last September, but Martin has found love and devotion in his master and he could not have wished for better circumstances.The book is a wrap on the series, and mostly follows the final three days of A COLLAR AND TIE, from Martin's perspective. It is lovely and wonderful, and I want more!I think I might not go gracefully into this goodnight, Ms. Glass!Martin does wrap up his thoughts on the 14th Street debacle and his misery over Henry's bad temper quite well. I was so glad to see his playfulness and thoughtfulness come out so strongly. I think Martin is finally comfortable enough to be a partner to Henry, and not solely his slave. I do so want to see them try Chinese food, and go out adventuring with Mr. Ross and Simon! To see them play with Mr. Wilton and Russ.I am not ready for this series to end. And I am eager for further stories to bring them back to me.*crosses fingers**contemplates pact with the devil*","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJ1R9BU4LU19/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UA5YZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3RJ1R9BU4LU19","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the FINAL book (sighs from the loss!) of the Ganymede Quartet, and the books need to be read in order.I have faithfully followed this series, loving every second of Henry's angst and Martin's solicitousness. The books are set in an alternate historical period, NYC circa 1901, but in this world slaves are still present, and Companion slaves are purchased by wealthy families for the personal use of their teenaged children. Martin is a Companion from the House of Ganymede who was purchased for Henry Blackwell, scion of the industrialist Hiram Blackwell, seven months ago. Henry's darkest secret is that he loves Martin, even though it is unnatural and unacceptable gentlemanly behavior.Henry is a romantic fool, wishing that he could change the world so that his love for Martin could be shared with any, and every, one. He has no desire to marry a woman, even though he knows this is expected. He fears his father will take Martin away if he learns of Henry's proclivities, and yet he cannot contain his ardor. *swoon*Henry is a desirable partner for the ladies, because he is wealthy and handsome, and his lack of interest is almost catnip for some of the girls of his acquaintance. Still, Henry's impulsiveness is bound to get him into more trouble--when he steals private moments at the Metropolitan Ball with Martin. His indiscretion leads to a falling out with his best friend, Louis, and a hasty retreat into the bowels of NYC's seedy gay society.I was so enamored of this part--of Henry finding common folk with whom to share his joy over being with Martin. Being that he's still only 16, Henry's compass doesn't necessarily point in the proper direction. Martin's attempt to steer him rightly is unwelcome, and leads to further discord. Oy vey, Henry! It is meant to be, child, just not the way YOU want it to be...I had my heart broken along with Henry, though I knew he was being petulant and rotten to Martin. I awaited reconciliation and, like Martin, was rewarded for my patience. As a romance, this book (and series) hits all the marks. It is sexy and sweet and sad and joyous. I have angsted alongside these boys for the better part of a year--and I could go ten more years hearing their wondrous tales.All the main issues are accounted for: Hanry and his parents have a better relationship. Henry learns to deal with his love for Martin in private. People want to be around Henry, despite his ""invert"" issues. Martin is fantastic and lovely and wonderful and Henry will be a better man for loving him.This book ends with a satisfying resolution, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm a little bitter that this is the end, in truth. I need more Henry and Martin in my life. I want to know how their lives change. I want to tag along to college, and to see Henry attempt to court a lady. I want he and Martin to live long happy lives together, filled with adventure and love.I know I won't see them again like this, and I am melancholy over it.Sign of a fantastic series....","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QIZJHACL0J5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UA5UYW#wasThisHelpful","R2QIZJHACL0J5A","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a series, and is probably best enjoyed by reading in series.Tom is a 44 y/o divorced man who came out five years ago ending his marriage. He is a successful, renown architect, and his first serious boyfriend, 22 y/o Cooper, is also an architect.It was hard for Tom to come to terms with his attraction for Cooper in the first book in this series, but now that he and Cooper have been dating for a couple of months they are beginning to break the news to their close friends and family.Tom's son Ryan already knows--he was a college friend of Cooper and visited Tom's Manhattan apartment often enough to catch Toma and Cooper early on. He's come to terms with it, but Tom's ex-wife is stunned. Sofia was Tom's college sweetheart, and devastated by the divorce. Plus, she's only known Cooper as Ryan's friend--the introduction as Tom's beau is...awkward? Nope, not a strong enough word. Add a few F-bombs in front and the picture becomes clearer.Cooper is convinced that Sofia is still in love with Tom, and he's probably right. Expect some harsh words and a fly-by of Tom's parents who would NOT understand.Cooper's family is less-than-enthusiastic, too. Funny how parents get miffed when your boyfriend is older than your dad...The fast pace of both Tom and Cooper's jobs is also a balancing act. Tom is appreciative that they share architecture in common--so they can spend late nights poring over plans and drafting boards together. That was especially sweet.Honestly, there is a lot of heart here, and I really dug the way I saw Tom and Cooper grow together as a couple. It is apparently true for people of every age that censure builds a stronger bond. For all slings and arrows sent Tom and Cooper's way, their affection increases exponentially. By the end, Tom gets Cooper exactly where he needs him, and that was super sweet.There are some down moments and melancholy bits, but this is a solid romance so expect happiness by the end and some sexytimes--though I'd have liked a bit more of those!!!Looking forward to book three.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1GORUZKLATN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013R6F8UK#wasThisHelpful","RV1GORUZKLATN","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review was written for Joyfully Jay reviews and can be accessed here: http://joyfullyjay.com/2015/08/review-betwixt-and-between-by-alexis-duran/4.25 stars.Ian Evers is a reporter for a fringe newspaper that reports on the activity of magical creatures. It’s not much of a day-job working in contemporary Seattle, but he does okay. Until the day he hears a haunting melody that hooks into his brain and tugs him toward unknown disaster. Ian has known that magic exists; his “Aunt” Cleona is a part-time witch and he’s been attended by Alistair, Cleona’s friend and possible Aleut shaman. This music is surely a spell, and Cleona’s not up to the task of breaking it. What Ian doesn’t realize is he’s been targeted because the spell caster senses his inherent, but unknown, magical power.Ezekiel, as a dark elf or svarta, is duty bound to bring all magical creatures to his Queen, so she can harvest their power for all her subjects—yet, when he senses the magic in Ian, Ezekiel knows he must taste some of him first. He tries to lure the novice in with a charmed song and interacts with Ian in his dreams, one of the realms betwixt and between, but his magical ties are severed by Ian’s friends. Still, Ezekiel is addicted to Ian’s light power, and won’t quit trying to harness the not-quite-human Ian, especially once the Queen finds out about him.This is not a light-hearted fantasy. The Queen is a bloodthirsty, powerful dark elf who has enslaved her clan of svarta for centuries. They hunted the liosa, or light elves, almost to extinction. I really enjoyed the mystical world built within Seattle’s confines, though I was sometimes confused about where I was—in what realm, that is. Ezekiel is able to transcend the realms, to some extent, but Ian cannot, at first. His gradual building of liosa powers was excellent. I hate when a character learns “I have powers” and is immediately awesome at using them. Ian is not, and most of his use is low key and measured.Both Ian and Ezekiel develop an attraction for each other, but this is a tricky dance as their clans are sworn enemies—Ian shares none of this history, having been raised by humans, but the prejudices for Ezekiel are centuries old and harder to break through. I admired how Ezekiel initially clung to those silly notions, and worked past them in a believable manner. The hunger for power, both from Ezekiel and the Queen, was a palpable and real force in their characters and took the plot in different directions from those I was expecting. Ezekiel and Ian learn that their coupling creates more power than either can alone, and this might be the answer for the magic-starved svarta suffering under the Queen’s avaricious rule.This book is more magical fantasy than romance, but the romance is still present, and there are a few steamy (and acrobatic!) scenes. I loved the language and imagery, getting a real feel for the world through descriptions that involved a lot of sensory information. The point-of-view is shared by Ezekiel and Ian (and later by Alistair) so I had great insight into their emotional landscape and decision-making. Both men question if their attraction is real or conjured by magic, and struggle with the consequences of maintaining any connection at all. I had as much trepidation as Ian did regarding a love with Ezekiel—who could have easily overpowered him and turned him in to the Queen—but I was glad that his faith and trust were rewarded. For Ezekiel, the question to capture or love Ian is one of life or death. But the path to life or death is far different than he first imagined, too. This story is billed as the first in a new series, but the resolution has no cliffhanger. The next story must center on a new dilemma.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LDVQ7WMS86BR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010O6IP8S#wasThisHelpful","R3LDVQ7WMS86BR","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ryan is wrecked watching his only sister die of pancreatic cancer. Desperate to save her, and spare her daughter becoming an orphan, Ryan does something he can't even believe--he makes a pact with a demon, Zavier. For the exchange of his soul, his sister will be saved. Ryan is given a five year delay on collection, but when he seals the deal with Zavier something equally extraordinary happens--both men feel a deeper connection.For Zavier, touching Ryan unlocks the history of his human life--the one he sacrificed when he made a pact with a demon to save the life of his dying lover, Ryan. Fifty years have passed since Zavier's contract came due and he entered Hell's ranks, but how could his new client Ryan have opened Zavier's locked memories? Zavier begins to investigate his own contract, with the help of a guardian angel and a lesser demon with mad computer skillz. The answers are as infuriating as they are shocking, and Zavier is torn between his demon duty and his love once lost.I thoroughly enjoyed this romance. Do not be looking for lots and lots of steamy sex--there is a bit of physicality near the end, but it's a small part of this bittersweet story. The story is told from Ryan and Zavier's points of view, so we really get to see their insights, throughout. The descriptions of Hell are interesting and compelling--I definitely enjoyed the ""corporate structure"" and how the demons and angels jetted about with a touch of a cell phone.The star-crossed love between Ryan and Zavier is allowed to develop in a new realm--with Ryan being a more equal partner in love than the man Zavier sacrificed his mortality for all those decades ago. Still, things happen fast. Zavier's boss is frustrated by his slip-shod efforts at signing new souls, and collecting souls come due. I adored Zavier's sense of morality--he's the anti-demon, all conscience and no avarice. His best friend is an angel, for goodness sake!As Zavier works to protect Ryan from his own selflessness, Zavier makes the same mistake he did when he was human--and his keen protectiveness nearly ruins the tenuous love they are building, now. The end is nothing short of a miracle, but what can one expect when the angels hear your prayers. I know there are more books in this series planned, and I'm eagerly expecting Adrian (the guardian angel)'s story. I want that guy to find love again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29WDLNP4GOM4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147D7CMY#wasThisHelpful","R29WDLNP4GOM4A","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a piece of historical fiction from Judy Blume. The first, I believe, she has ever written. It centers on Elizabeth, NJ in 1951-52 dubbed “Plane Crash City” because three commercial aircraft crashed there within 58 days of each other. Ms. Blume was living in Elizabeth at the time, a little younger than the book’s main protagonist, Miri Ammerman, a 15 y/o Jewish American girl whose world seem to split at the seams in the wake of these tragedies.The story is an ensemble piece, built on short news articles and longer vignettes from probably 15 different characters, though the main voice is that of Miri. She is a girl who has never known her father, raised by her mother, grandmother and uncle–and they barely make ends meet. Her best friend, Natalie, is from a well-off family; her parents are married and her dad is a dentist.Miri and her mother are eye-witnesses to the first crash, as is Miri’s Uncle Henry, a reporter. He ends up making a name for himself, as the story winds on, covering all the investigations and the subsequent crashes. Miri’s friends all speculate as to the causes of the crashes–aliens, sabotage, Commies–it’s a freaky time to be a young person. Historically, WWII has barely ended and thousands of soldiers are still dying in Korea. Public awareness and political leanings of are fixated on McCarthy hearings and the Red Scare is very real. In Miri’s day-to-day, people she knows are killed in the crashes, as the planes sometimes strike homes and apartments in the closely-packed suburban area, and nobody can explain why.The strain of identifying dead bodies by the dental records drives Natalie’s father a bit round the bend, and Natalie’s sure she can hear voices of the dead and dying. I was struck by the deft interleaving of narrative arcs. Miri’s falling for a young man, Mason McKittrick, an Irish boy who is not a suitor of whom her Jewish grandmother would approve, then Mason becomes a hero in one of the crashes–and he’s seen on his own merit. The affair between them them is intense for both, but it’ s not enough–for reasons only Mason can explain.Meanwhile, Natalie’s family is falling apart, and Miri’s family is so deeply entrenched in that debacle that their friendship suffers greatly. Looming overhead is the constant prospect of another plane falling from the sky. The public backlash is fierce, even causing the closure of Newark Airport for a time, while the runways and airline patterns are rebuilt/rerouted.It’s an engrossing read that kept me up well past a reasonable bedtime. The story spans thirty-five years–from late 1951 to early 1987, so we get to see how many of the players fared in the wake of such tragedy. The actual events of the crashes were meticulously researched by Ms. Blume, and the detail of the story is so rich–down to the “archaic” practices of 50s fashion (putting angora sweaters in the fridge!) I was captivated.I will always love the YA fiction of Ms. Blume and my childhood, but this all-grown-up story was fascinating and uplifting, even at it’s lowest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUR2YYFQMX788/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101875046#wasThisHelpful","RUR2YYFQMX788","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in a series, but is fully enjoyable as a standalone.4.5 Stars.Micah Burke is 19 going on 62. He is the guardian for his 14 y/o sister and caregiver to his paraplegic mother. Two years ago his alcoholic parents were responsible for a car wreck that killed his father, paralyzed his mother, and killed three others. Since then he has had to take on two jobs and the role of parent. He barely makes ends meet and only goes out one night a month--one night of dancing--where he meets Sebastian Carlisle.Sebastian Carlisle is as rich as they come. He's a sophomore at Northwestern and an entitled prick with a sad history--his twin died of leukemia four years ago. His parents have pretty much moved to Europe and his only remaining family is his wealthy, but strict, grandfather--who absolutely does not approve of Sebastian's risky life choices. Since then, Bas has lived his life on the edge, never showing his tenderness or vulnerability to anyone. Something about staid and sober Micah calls to Bas, reminds him of his conscientious and caring brother. The closer Sebastian gets to Micah, the more Micah tries to push him away--at first.Micah has no time for a flighty boyfriend, but he can see that Sebastian isn't a relationship guy. This is (at first) a problem--Micah doesn't do casual, but then again Micah doesn't do...anything. The close contact Micah and Sebastian have while working at the Carlisle Gardens Nursing Home (Micah as a CNA and Sebastian as a volunteer) keeps tempting Micah to take Sebastian up in his offers of fun. And casual sex...This is a definite hurt/comfort story of two lonely young men looking for a partner who can be a support, not a burden. Micah is the first guy Sebastian has met in a long while who wants nothing from him--not money or contacts or anything, except a bit of fun now and then. Micah is sure being with Sebastian is a mistake--that he will let Micah down, just as everyone else in his life has. He's so sure that he continually pushes Sebastian away, even when he truly needs his help.I did like when Micah opened up, and asked Sebastian for help. And Sebastian's response was way past stellar. I loved how Sebastian just meshed with the most difficult people--cantankerous old men and wild teens. He saw pieces of himself reflected in others and decided that he didn't need to live up to his brother's memory--rather he could behave like someone his brother would have been proud to know, and love. It was a very touching coming-of-age. These guys are young for all the tragedy in their lives, but the end speaks of happier days and a brighter future together. Expect a bit of angst and a decent amount of sexytimes.I received a review copy of this book via NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HFT8B071YUJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ91ZNS#wasThisHelpful","R1HFT8B071YUJO","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coletrane is a new member of the Retribution MC. He's a level-headed college grad, working as a tattoo artist, and trying to keep his past at bay.Then he meets Sinclair Chatham, sexy socialite he should steer quite clear of--but he can't and it's bringing him a world o' hurt.Sin, as he calls her, is a good girl who likes it bad. She's headstrong and heartstrong and sure she can tame Cole's inner beast, but Cole's brand of lovin'--BDSM of a fashion--is as intoxicating as his sultry voice.Cole's past isn't pretty. He ran around with the wrong folks, and had little direction from his mom who was always looking for the next big take. He barely survived when his sister OD'ed. His mom had a mental breakdown, and he's been shouldering a lot of blame over the past several years. Between Cole and Sin the heat is intense. He's falling hard and fast for this strong woman, but her dad isn't best pleased--and his former friends see Sin as a gravy train they'd like to skim.As with all the other Retribution books, we get the men of Retribution MC coming together for a tense showdown, the hero being a real hero, and so much sexytimes it's a guaranteed HEA. I liked how Cole took Hunter's advice and put his degree to real use, and made amends over his past at the same time. It was also cool that everything didn't work out perfectly for Cole, keeping it real for us readers. Sin is the sexiest and most forward of all the gals bound to Retribution men, so far. Her daring was fun to experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A084609Z8J7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ADPC26#wasThisHelpful","R2A084609Z8J7R","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 4th book in the Bend or Break series, but can be read as a standalone.Rafi Castro is a man raised in Chicago, though his parents are from the Dominican Republic. He is Afro-Latino and has lived a hardscrabble life, mostly raised by his four elder sisters, once his mother returned to her home country. He met Denny two years before when Denny ran away from home and stayed with his cousin, and Rafi's boss, Cash--who is in books one and three of the series. Denny was only 17 then but he had a fierce crush on 19 y/o out and proud Rafi, and they spent a lot of sexually-ripe but platonic time together, excepting one kiss the final day of Denny's stay, and once he'd turned 18.Now, Rafi is headed to Carlisle College on a diversity-based rowing scholarship. And Denny is awaiting him. Both men are sophomores now, and on the rowing team together. Rafi is determined to be his own man--fearing that everyone will look at him like a charity case, and sure that both Cash and Denny pulled strings to get his scholarship. He's not wrong--some of his teammates do think that. And, it's likely true that Cash's connections assisted in Rafi's acceptance, but Rafi's behavior demonstrates a level of closing in that borders paranoia. He doesn't want to accept any of Denny's plentiful offers at touring the campus, or helping him adjust to college life.Rafi is, quite plainly, unable to deal. His assignments are coming back with poor grades, one of his teammates seems continually ready to put him down, and Denny is just too perfect, too rich, too beautiful to understand all the (imaginary) demons that plague Rafi--if Rafi would once bother to talk to Denny about his fears.On the other hand, Rafi is totally gone for Denny, and can't bear to push him away too long. I wanted, seriously, to punch Rafi in the throat for a large part of the book. I have been the scholarship kid, living on financial aid and work-study jobs. I get pride, I really do, but Rafi is beyond prideful. He's so proud he comes off as ashamed, and honestly, I think that he was ashamed. He fought all through high school to be this out-proud guy, but the second he steps onto Carlisle's campus he clams up. He has friends on the team who are out, but he can't bear to even look at Denny in a way that might could indicate interest. He doesn't want to be ""Denny's boy"" and yet his denial speaks volumes.For his part, Denny is often too patient. He wants Rafi to be his serious boyfriend, but makes it clear that he won't wait forever. Their dynamic is so fraught. I wanted Rafi to come around, but he was SO obstinant--again causing my fist to curl in readiness. Every time it looked as if they got into synch, there was a catastrophe. And Rafi's temper is a real issue. I was glad that his friend, Austin, was honest about it and that Rafi finally began to ask for the help he absolutely needed.The end is an HEA that is hard fought and harder won. Expect Rafi to be a confused prick for 90% of his love story. There is no convenience in this story. There is Rafi learning how to be a boyfriend through error after error, and finally being a big enough person to speak his truth, and make amends for his bad behavior. Denny is a calm breeze in the hot/cold hurricane of Rafi's regard. Still, he has issues. I really thought the discussion of PrEP and the stigma of its use was refreshing. I got all Rafi's protectiveness, and was glad to see he turned all that mental energy into something productive--figuring out a career path that works to his strengths.There are a few steamy scenes, but mostly there is a lot of fits and starts with an angsty Afro-Latino making more trouble than he needs. When they finally DO work together there is a beautiful connection. I received a copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MODKWXRG9A2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012A2W0OO#wasThisHelpful","R1MODKWXRG9A2V","A2GE4E4CWEQNT2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GE4E4CWEQNT2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like these boots. I can wear them all day without pinching, and they have better arch support than I would have guessed when I first tried them on. The heel and sole are also good and stable, and the heel is low enough not to put too much pressure on the front of the foot. These are actually the first boots I've found in years that were comfortable right out of the box and required no break-in period. The style is also nice: good for fitted or bootcut jeans, and they could even be worn with a skirt and tights and look cute.Based on all the reviews stating that they run small, I ordered half a size wider and longer than usual (so a 10E instead of my usual 9.5D), and they fit just about perfectly.

"This is a cute banner. The colors are vibrant in person, the designs are funky, and it adds a vintage touch to Halloween decor. However, the product description is a bit misleading. It describes the banner as 12 feet long, but that only describes the length of the *string* that comes with the banner. Each individual panel is only 3.75"" across by 7.5"" tall, so the total width of the eight banner pieces is only 30 inches -- less than 3 feet. You can space the pieces out however you like, but if you want them spaced similarly to how they are shown in the product photo, they are better suited to a doorway than across an entire room.One other note: the banner pieces come loose in the package, and you have to string them yourself. Threading them was fine, though it was a bit of a pain then they kept on getting tangled up after I had strung them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN6WSANTRXT7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C69J61W#wasThisHelpful","RN6WSANTRXT7R","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are awesome heels. I have bought Rose Petals before and have always taken a 10WW, even though in other brands I am usually a 9.5W. I bought a 10WW in these too and they fit great: they are some of the only heels I have that don't pinch across the ball of my foot whatsoever, and they have a really soft padding on the interior. (If anything they are a little loose in the ball of my foot, but I think a 9.5 would have been a hair too short, and that small problem is easily solved with some adhesive foot pads.) The platform makes them very comfortable to walk in, and they have pretty good arch support. And on a more superficial note, I admittedly avoid certain heels because they often make my feet look super-long (again, I'm a 9.5 or a 10), but these actually make my feet look small! And the shoes themselves are gorgeous -- I got the black snakeskin, and they are the kind of thing that could go with virtually anything in my wardrobe.Especially given that I found these on sale, they were a great purchase, but with how comfy and pretty they are, I would have gladly paid more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14OJHMQDS2KTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7960H0#wasThisHelpful","R14OJHMQDS2KTJ","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Okay, let me start with the good: These are very comfortable pants. When you find the right size they do not dig in, and the fabric is very soft and stretchy.Now for the not-so-good: There is MASSIVE variation in sizing among colors. I bought these in aqua, yellow, and charcoal, all in the same size (which is my usual size for bottoms). The aqua ones are lovely and fit perfectly. The yellows fit but were not as stretchy in the waist (plus they were basically see-through). And the charcoal ones were so tight that I could not even get them over my hips. So I wound up one for three.I also have a note on laundering. When I washed the aqua pair that I kept in cold water on a gentle cycle, they came out of the machine looking two sizes larger -- seriously, the waist had stretched out a good three inches. I wound up putting them in the dryer on low to try and shrink them back, which they did... and then some! I'd say they wound up about an inch or two shorter on bottom after being dried. That is fine for me since they were quite long to begin with (and otherwise the fabric felt nice coming out of the dryer), but it's definitely something to consider.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15BV2RMB18XN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YVF1202#wasThisHelpful","R15BV2RMB18XN1","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, Footstar. Where have you been all my life, you little blue slice of heaven, you?I do high-impact exercise five or six days a week, and despite wearing shoes with proper support, my muscles often spasm both on the tops and the bottoms of my feet. I actually discovered these Footstar balls after a friend had recommended another brand of foot massager to me, but these were less expensive, so I decided to give them a try -- and I'm SO glad I did.The points on these Footstar balls break up tension quickly and effectively. For the bottoms of my feet, I use them standing up one foot at a time so I can control the amount of pressure -- and my god, they are amazing. Just a minute or two of deep pressure totally breaks up tension, even in my hard-to-massage heels and in the balls of my feet. I've found that since I started using these, I've regained some sensation in parts of my feet that had begun to get a little tingly and numb, so it seems like the Footstars really help circulation.For the tops of my feet, I roll the footstars back and forth by hand, which also provides an effective massage on a part of the foot that has little padding. (Speaking of padding, I use the Footstar with socks on -- it irritates my skin less to have that extra layer.)If your feet give you trouble, I'd highly recommend giving these Footstars a try. They are inexpensive, easy to use, and wonderfully effective!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNKN6SWQL7M16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4EUH88#wasThisHelpful","RNKN6SWQL7M16","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I use them with Pure Silk shaving cream and find that they leave me with a smooth, close shave (and I always moisturize after I shave, so dry skin is a non-issue). After six or seven uses they do start to get dull and begin knicking me around the knees and ankles, but I've found that to be true of *all* razors, whether you pay $3 or $30 for them. My one complaint of these is that I find my hair starts to grow back relatively quickly, at least compared to razors with five or six blades (for a while Noxema made six-blade women's razors, which I LOVED, but I have not been able to find them anywhere lately).

"This is a gorgeous fragrance. Over the years I have tried many coconut and vanilla scents (recent ones include BBW Exotic Coconut, Sud Pacifique Vanile Extreme, The Body Shop Coconut, and Island Bath and Body Coconut Vanilla), but I'm always trying out different brands. I first bought this Lavanila in a sample size to try it out, and as soon as I smelled it I was hooked and bought a whole bottle. This is, hands-down, the best-smelling vanilla coconut scent I have ever tried. Some scents -- even ones I have liked -- have irritated my eyes and/or nose when I first applied them, but that does not happen whatsoever with Lavanila, perhaps due to its all natural ingredients. It goes on smooth, smells creamy and dreamy, and lasts all day. I have received so many compliments on this, even from people who usually do not like vanilla or coconut smells.

"I bought these Bella Vitas because I needed a classic black pump for my wardrobe, and these were marked way down at the time. The shoes are very elegant in person, and the heel is a nice height: tall enough to look classy but low enough that it's easy to walk in. The footbed feels pretty well-padded, too. Especially since these were a terrific price when I bought them, I'm very happy with them (happy enough that I also bought them in pewter!).As for sizing, I am usually a 9.5W but often need to order wider in Bella Vitas, and based on other reviewers' advice I ordered these in both 9.5WW and 10WW to see which fit better. I wound up keeping the 10; the 9.5 technically fit (it was actually the more accurate length of the two), but it was extremely tight across my toes. The 10 feels a little looser lengthwise but still stays on fine, and it mercifully has enough room in the toe box that it does not cramp my feet the way the 9.5 did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISBFB88RMTJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BAYTJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ISBFB88RMTJI","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for a professional-looking everyday purse (my usual tastes go toward bright colors and big patterns), and this bag is perfect for that. The pattern on the material looks even nicer in person than online, and the goldtone hardware looks really sharp. The purse is spacious enough to hold quite a bit but looks nice and compact, especially when it's folded over. I wasn't sure whether the top handle would have enough of a drop for me to wear it over my shoulder, but it fits under there nice and snugly. And while the cross-body strap is on the short side (the bag sits above my hip when I wear it cross-body), it also works as a longer shoulder strap. A great buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HAVVBZEZISF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IAMNTW6#wasThisHelpful","R21HAVVBZEZISF","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love 3M hooks and have used nearly all the varieties over the years to avoid putting holes in my walls; this was my first purchase of the nail kind. I used two of the 8-lb. hooks to hang a 6-pound bulletin board with two mounting holes, one to hang a 6-pound mirror, and another to hang a 3-pound (but very large) poster frame. I mounted them with the nail at the top so the metal back would not show, and they have all been up for a week now and are holding steady. These are a really nice alternative to nails for larger items and are sturdier than 3M's Sawtooth Picture-Hanging Hooks, which are best to use with smaller items with sawtooth hangers.As with any 3M hooks, you need to follow the prep directions and clean any surface with rubbing alcohol (not household cleaners) ahead of time then wait at least an hour before you hang anything on them. Additionally, I'd advise waiting at least a month to mount any of these on freshly painted walls; I made the mistake of trying to use them on walls I had just painted earlier this fall, and they pulled down even after I prepped them properly. However, after letting a month pass, they adhere just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR8ES9065S1GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00405525E#wasThisHelpful","RR8ES9065S1GO","AUBKXJYRKGOF4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AUBKXJYRKGOF4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was encouraged by all the positive reviews but still prefer Pssst.I have fine, slightly wavy hair. After some trial and error, I've learned the secret is to massage it into your scalp with your fingers after sprinkling it in, and then brush (not comb) it in. You'll still want to look at the back of your head and the top of your scalp in a mirro to make sure there are no lingering white spots. For this reason, and the slightly stale smell, I'm going to give it 3 stars.On the plus side, you are getting a lot of product for the money.

The faux fur side flaps are wide and provide really great, full coverage. It's like your face is being hugged by a friendly bear-Well-constructed. If it's Made in China it definitely doesn't feel like it. The seams are solid and the hardware is well-sewn-Ample sizing - I'm a female with a big head. I ordered the size Large and it fits me. It's actually a little big but I'm OK with that.CON's-The only improvement I'd make is I wish there was a way to button the sides up to the top of the hat when not in use.

"I'm a Clinique Black Honey devotee who's always on the hunt for something cheaper that doesn't always break on me. (Why Black Honey doesn't just come in a regular tube I'll never know).Although not perfect, this is a great substitute.Here's why:-The color is very similar to Black Honey but with a bit more red. It reminds me of Revlon's Goldpearl Plum, if you're familiar with that.-The texture is dry. Not stay-on lipstick dry, but it's definitely not gummy or greasy, which I hate.-The format is convenient and easy to apply. Just rub on the stick and you're good to go. It doesn't bleed much. You could even get away with applying it without a mirror.Things to be aware of:-It has a bit of a pepperminty taste and smell to it. It's pretty mild but it's there.-I said this above, but it's worth saying again - this is a dry formula. If you have chronically chapped or dry lips it's definitely not for you. You could probably put a balm over it if you want but I've never tried that.-It's called a stain but the only thing that's stain-ish about it is its staying power. It doesn't have the watery texture of most lipstains.

Mud masks are never pretty but this was seriously frightening.The mask itself didn't irritate my skin (note: my skin is not sensitive) and left it feeling soft and smooth.I don't feel like I looked any younger but I don't feel like it was a complete waste of time, either.I'd recommend this for people with normal skin who are looking for a limited ingredient facial.If you're OK with a few more ingredients in your products I'd definitely go with something by Queen Helene. It's less messy and smells better (this didn't have much of a scent).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PGMI9W5MIE89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014P8L9W#wasThisHelpful","R2PGMI9W5MIE89","A3GS6P9UW2CJF9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GS6P9UW2CJF9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first skincare product where I've actually noticed a physical difference right away. I'm in my mid-30's and while I don't have problems with blemishes, blotchiness, etc. I have never had the kind of skin that ""glows."" I want to glow, damnit! :) I've been using this twice a day - morning and night - for about half of the recommended 60 seconds on the low setting (I've heard that it can be too abrasive if you use it daily so I thought I'd play it safe) and my skin is now super smooth, even, and fresh looking.

"There are cheaper harnesses out there but Puppia is the best.I ordered the size medium for my 15 lb. mixed breed (he looks kind of like a Chihuahua and a husky got together, as ridiculous as that sounds) and it fits perfectly.I ordered the same item in a size small for my 10 lb. mixed breed (Chihuahua and Pomeranian) and it's also a great fit.Some notes/caveats:Both of these dogs have longer heads/snouts so getting the dog's head through the opening wasn't an issue. If you're deciding between sizes and your dog has a skinnier head shape you may want to go with the smaller size. Puppias tend to stretch a bit over time, much like a sneaker would and the smaller size ensures that the chest portion won't become too stretched out, even if the neck portion feels snug for the first few walks.If you have a super frisky/unmanageable dog then a Puppia might not be right for you.

"I can never have enough hangers (too many clothes I guess) and tired of my shirts falling off in the closet so I wanted to try these. First off, I want to mention that the box says to dip in water but I'm not totally sure why. I did not do that as there were no directions as to why and I figured I'd try them without it and see if they worked and if not, then I would do a few and go from there.They are a plastic hanger with a soft velvet coating on them and a wire hanging hook which rotates all the way around. Nice thing with this is my husband does a lot of the laundry and likes to hang my shirts on ""backwards"" so with these, I don't have to take my shirt off the hanger and rehang. I can just turn the hook instead. I have a lot of tops that have wider or lacy type shoulders that slide off my hangers all the time. Even the grooves in the plastic hangers don't make them stay on. The velvet coating on these grips to your clothes and helps them stay on the hanger. Plus they have a slight dip in them too where you can hang skinnier straps like with camisoles.Because the hangers are thinner too than the rounded plastic ones you typically buy in the store, they take up less room in the closet so I can hang and fit more. These are a really nice set of hangers and they are nice and sturdy for even hanging heavier coats or jackets on them. I definitely am pleased with these and would recommend them.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

"This set of knives is so nice! You get 6 different sized knives and each one comes with a protective sheath.

The knives are such pretty colors too. I like this set because I basically have a knife for everything and with them being colored, they are easy to see and grab. The bread knife cut through bread so nice and didn't chew up the crust like some do. I have used the others to so far cut potatoes, fat off meat and other fruits and vegetables.

"This secret compartment book is quite a nice thing to have in your home for valuables or anything you are trying to hide. This comes with 2 book sleeves, one stating it's the safe and when you remove that one, it looks like a normal book cover. The first 1/4 of the book (approx.) are normal book pages with text on them to make this look like a real book. Then you have the section where your safe is. It's built into the book so the rest of the book is not pages. The safe compartment has a removable cover and then you store your belongings in there and replace the cover. Set it on your bookshelf and there you have it. I actually put some money in ours which is our emergency funds which I never had a good place to keep before.

I chose the London View for her and the page has a gray outline of everything. You then use the scratch pen and go over all the gray lines to expose the gold. Brush away the residue with the small brush. You can also add anything additional to the picture by scratching in the black areas on your chosen night view (like stars).The paper is a nice thickness and not real thin.

We're old school and have a bunch of 45's, 33's and cassettes. This even plays 78's too which we have some of as well. We are not iTunes users (as far as buying and paying to download music) so to be able to use this to convert our favorite songs off of our albums and cassettes to mp3's to put on our iPods is awesome.This system also has a AM/FM radio and you can also connect an external CD player to it and listen to CD's. It does not have a built in CD player. I was quite impressed with the sound quality on this. It has 2 small speakers (one on each side of the unit) and the sound is crisp and clear. The volume level is really good too and goes up quite loud. I barely had it turned up and it was a nice level.I'm not going to bore you explaining everything it does since it's all in the description but I do want to say that everything worked on it when I tried it all. I'm contemplating just keeping it out and not giving it to him for Christmas and just using it now. The only downside I personally came across on this and didn't care for is that when you have a 33 RPM on it, you cannot close the lid. I wished this was designed a little different where the lid could close. It will close fine with a 45 and 78 but just not the 33. That is not a huge deal but wanted to mention it because I couldn't tell that before purchasing. Otherwise, I think it's a great system that works well with good sound. Does everything I wanted it to for him (us)  and just know he will love it too.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This Triple Basket Deep Fryer is perfect for anyone who loves deep frying foods at home. I deep fry a lot and have wanted a multiple basket fryer for awhile. This one comes with 3 basket, 2 small and 1 large. You can use the 2 small together at the same time to deep fry 2 different things or else use the large for larger quantities or bigger pieces of food. You get the 3 baskets, 2 basket handles, instruction booklet and an extra filter with this.There is a minimum and a maximum fill line you can see on the inside of the liner where you put the oil. Fill with oil and then insert the heating element piece which attaches by sliding it into the grooves on the back of the frame. The cord is a 2 prong for your outlet and the part that connects to the fryer is actually magnetic insertion. Turn the power button on, select your temperature and then set your timer. The indicator light will be red while the oil is getting up to temperature and turn green when it's ready. Place your food in the basket(s) and gently set into the hot oil. The way the baskets are made is nice because you can set them over the edge of the frame and they will set there without touching the oil. This is good for when your food is done and you bring it up. You can set it there for any excess oil to drip off.I didn't find anything I didn't like about this Gourmia deep fryer other than I thought it took a little longer for the oil to get to the temperature I wanted than other ones I have owned. However, I think that may be due to the size and being a larger fryer than what I have used in the past. Obviously the bigger it is, the more oil it uses and the longer it will take to heat the oil. Otherwise, I really like the digital timer and also that it has an automatic shut off when the timer reaches zero. This way you don't forget to shut it off.The construction of this is very solid and durable. There are rubber feet on the bottom so it grips to your counter and doesn't slide. The handles are nice and tight when attached to the baskets and not loose. I am very happy with my purchase and this deep fryer and would recommend.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"These are probably some of the nicest bibs I have bought recently. For one, they are super cute and I love the pictures and the colors. They are a really soft cotton material and the thickness is nice. The polyester fleece backing is nice and soft too. They have 2 snaps to keep the bib securely on and the snaps close snugly and don't unsnap on their own. Also is good for when they are growing so you don't have to worry about them  being too tight around their neck.These are perfect for teething babies and all the drooling because of the cotton/polyester material. I personally would use them for that rather than baby food feeding time since they are material. Then you don't have to worry about them getting stained up and having to spray them and hope they come clean. These basically cover their whole front to keep their shirt nice and dry. I love these and would recommend them for sure.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

"I got these for our Bowling Leagues 50/50 drawing we have every week. I received 4 different colored rolls and all have different numbers. They are a decent thickness of tickets and they rip apart easily and along the perforated lines. Nothing worse than when you go to rip tickets and they don't rip where they are suppose to. Have no had that issue with these ones at all.

"This Genuine Leather Clutch/Wristlet by Yahoho has so much room in it. More than I would have thought being the size it is. It measures approx. 7 3/4"" x 3 3/4"". It comes with a wristlet strap, gold shoulder chain, a Yahoho dangling charm you can attach to either the zipper pull or else a hook for the shoulder chain and small Rose Sachet packet that was inside of it. It's boxed in a nice gift box which is perfect for gift giving.The Cowhide Leather is nice and soft and has a waxy/shiny appearance to it. It did not have an overpowering smell of leather like some leather does. There is a very durable metal zipper for the main opening compartment. I had no issues opening and closing and it has not stuck. The outer white sticking is all done very well with no flaws.So this wallet is a little different than any others I own but I really like it. On the side, there is a small snap you can undo which really makes the wallet expand quite a bit more than if you just leave it snapped. If you're anything like me, I keep a bunch of stuff in my wallet so the more I can put in it, the happier I am. There is a snap keeping the wallet closed to then expose the main zipper. There are 2 adjustments on the snap. There is also an outer zipper pocket which is great for change which is also metal.Once you open the main zipper you have a few different compartments/pockets. On both of the outer sides, there is a nice large compartment and both have card holders in them (6 on each side) for your bank/credit cards, gift cards and loyalty cards. There is also a small zipper pocket inside on of the compartments and yet even 1 more zipper compartment as well. Like I said, there's lots of room and compartments in this which is what really makes me like it. I like keeping a lot of receipts and things in my wallet and there room in here for all of that plus coupons and more. Definitely a nice wallet that I would recommend without hesitation. The shoulder and wrist strap both attach easily and securely too. This has become one of my favorite wallets/clutch.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"I wear a size 10 shoe normally and ordered 2 sizes up because of reviews saying they ran small and people had issues getting their foot into them or getting their foot out. I figured I could just wear a heavier sock in them. Well, I couldn't even get them on to try!! At the bottom where your foot goes in, it is not made right or something and I even had 2 other people try to put them on and all 3 of us struck out.The boot itself is gorgeous and a nice material. It seems well made and the style is super cute. The zippers went up and down easily. There's not much else I can say about them since no one has been able to wear them though.

"This set of Earbuds by Miclech are quite nice. My husband doesn't have a bluetooth enabled device and uses (and loses/misplaces) his earbuds all the time so I got these for him. The wire is a thicker plastic covering and he has found that it doesn't get tangled as easily as the thinner black ones. They fit comfortable in his ears and the sound quality is nice and clear and crisp. The earbuds have a magnet on them so they will attract and ""stick"" to one another when not being used which basically helps them store easier and not get all tangled up. Also comes with extra earbuds and a small clip so if you want, you can clip the wire to your shirt or coat so it's not dangling everywhere in front of you and keeps it out of the way which is nice. Jack fits tightly into his iPod and is not loose where it would slide out.

"There's nothing better than a cup of freshly ground coffee in the morning. This Black Bear Dark Roast Coffee smelled so good upon opening the bag. I had a little issue opening the bag to be resealable but I planned on grinding it up right away anyways and it still closed. The opening area just didn't pull apart as easily as it should have.The coffee beans are very rich smelling and ground up easily. I had a few cups for breakfast yesterday and today and the taste was awesome. Not too strong and no weird aftertaste like with some coffees. My husband even liked it and he's not a dark roast drinker. I made this is our Auto-drip Bunn and it brewed nicely.

" 5:52 MinsI purchased the Christmas Nail Decals since it's right around the corner and love decorating my nails up and polishing them. You get 1 large sheets with over 150 decals on it. There are dogs, kittens, snowmen, santa, trees, stars and more! So with these you paint your nails and then apply the decal and then top with your top coat to help them adhere longer. In my video, I did a quick tutorial and did 1 nail.I am rating these 4 stars for a few reasons. My main reason is I would have liked the colors to be bolder/brighter. They almost look faded to me even though I know they're not. If wearing a darker colored polish, many of them aren't going to show up well. I did a medium pink and I don't think they showed up good so I would suggest a light or pastel color polish or even white would be awesome. The other reason is the instructions. You can read them and know what they say but there are many misspelled words (such as patter instead of pattern, stiick rather than stick) and just a few other things but like I said, you can definitely make out what it's suppose to be.I feel they were fairly easy to apply. You pull the film back, cut your design, place in water for around 10-15 seconds to moisten it, apply it and then blow dry. Just by doing that, it is stuck on but you should then apply a top coat to cover it and protect it from possibly coming off when you have your hands in water or wash your hands. Overall, I think they are fun and cute and will be doing all my nails with them. If you like having cute nails and don't like the salon prices, I recommend getting these to have fun in doing your own.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"These socks are so cute! The colors and the reindeer pattern is perfect for the holiday season. They are a little thicker than a normal in my opinion and remind me a lot of slipper socks without the gripping bottoms which is great. They are warm and comfortable to wear. I wear a size 10 shoe and they fit my feet good even though they say up to size 9 shoe size. Everything on them is sewn well and they did not have any loose threads or flaws. The top of the socks don't cut into my calf either at all like some other ones I have bought before. These really are comfortable.

"This set of Collapsible Silicone Pet Bowls is so handy to have for when we travel with our dog or even just go to someone else's house for a visit. These came individually packaged in a ziploc bag so if you didn't need all 4, it would make a nice gift for another pet owner. Each bowl comes with a carabiner clip so you can clip it onto a backpack or bag/purse for carrying.These expand and collapse and if you didn't want to, you could just partially expand it for a shallower dish. I personally like that I got 4 because I can use them for different things. We like letting our Pom out on the porch when the weather is nice and always have to take her food and water dish out there and then carry it back in the house when she's done. Well now I have these so I can keep a set on the porch. Also, great for when we visit friends and take her. Now we don't have to worry about her eating and drinking out of their pets dishes, we can take her own and they are convenient for us.

"This Teamson Dual Theme Doll House is so much nicer than the plastic ones I have bought in the past. The downside is it's not as portable as others but much more durable. It took about 45 minutes to put it all together but the directions were nicely detailed and easy to follow. Comes with all the screws for assembling and pre-drilled holes. All you need is a phillips head screwdriver  for assembly. Comes with 7 pieces of furniture/accessories too but you can add your own to it as well.The colors and the paint and lamination are done well and I don't foresee any issues with them coming off. This dollhouse is perfect for the Frozen dolls and any standard size Barbie dolls work well in it too. It really is so much prettier and nicer in person than the photos can even do justice for it. It's very sturdy once all put together and no parts were missing. Unfortunately, I have purchased things like this before and sometimes you're missing a screw or something but this was complete. The kids are very happy with it and so am I. If you're going to spend a lot on a doll house, this is the one I would recommend without a doubt.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"My Pom sometimes destroys stuffed toys because she loves the squeakers so much so we like to go with rubber ones a lot. The thickness of the rubber on this one is pretty good though I was hoping it would be a little bit thicker considering dogs are chewing on it with their teeth and can poke holes in it. She's a smaller dog (about 14 pounds) so luckily I have not had an issue yet with her doing that. I'm not sure how well this would fair for medium dogs. I think it really all depends how aggressive of a chewer they are. My Pom has whipped this duck around a lot in the past week and it's still all in tact. The duck measures around 9"" in length so it's a good size for smaller dogs so they can handle it well. Squeaker works good and is pretty loud.

"I get so tired of the plastic Turkey Basters not working good that when I saw this one, I just had to try it. The plastic ones never hold up for me with the heat but this stainless steel one is nice. I like that it comes with a cleaning brush too to get down inside the baster tube when washing. The rubber ball at the top where you squeeze is a nice thickness and quality and squeezes and retracts just fine. The hole size on the baster is impressive. A lot of times you get ""stuff"" floating in your juices and in the past, they will clog in the hole and make the juice stop. I have not had the issue with this one because it's larger. They also give you a stainless steel injecting needle too which I think is great. It definitely helps tenderize your turkey and other meats when you can inject the juices back in to finish cooking.

"These socks are so fun to wear with all the colors. I was afraid they were going to be a little thin but they weren't at all. They are a nice thickness and very well made. There were no threads or anything loose on them and all the seams are great. The top band doesn't have any loose threads either where sometimes socks will start to unravel. I don't see that happening with these. The colors are pretty and nice and bold. I wear a size 10 shoe and they fit my feet just fine even though it says up to a size 9 shoe. They weren't tight on my feet at all. They washed up nicely in the washer too. Definitely would recommend these.**I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This is a great package of Tissue Paper. The sheets are large (20"" x 20"") and you get 150 sheets total of red, green and white. Prefect for gift boxes and gift bags this Christmas. I don't like having to buy a bunch of packages with only 20 sheets in them so this one is nice especially with the mixed colors. Quality and weight of the paper is nice too, it's not real thin where it tears right away.

"These are perfect for anyone who does large cookouts/parties or for a restaurant owner. You get 160 total markers in the package. They are pre-printed with Rare, Medium, Med. Rare and Well (40 each) on them so you won't mix the steaks up. I personally am using these to mark my flower and vegetable seeds I start in the house because really they can be multi-purpose. Just write with a marker down the side whatever it is you want to mark. They are 3 1/2"" long so just a nice size for sticking into a steak. They are sanded well and there were not any loose splinters or anything on them you have to worry about getting into your steak.

"This Hopper Ball is so much for for adults and teenagers as well. The quality and thickness is really good on this and it's very durable. We got 2 different Waliki hopper balls and my 26 year old daughter and 19 year old son had some races on them and so much fun. This ball has good bounce to it and the color is pretty too. It comes with a plug in it already which you remove to blow it up and then it also came with 2 extra plugs. It did not lose any air after using it for quite awhile. Can be stored blown up or else deflate and roll it up. Easy to fill with air, we used a small air compressor and it only took a couple minutes. Definitely an awesome ball of fun for the whole family.**I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

"I got these for my son to use in his truck. They are nice and thick and heavy, much heavier and nicer than I expected them to be. They can be trimmed to size for your vehicle and so they will fit which is nice. They have grooves in them to catch the water from melting snow (yes, it's that time of year) and rain. Also great for trapping the dirt getting in and out of your car. His rugs were getting messed up in his truck so these are perfect since they are rubber and waterproof. I like that they can be taken out of the vehicle and I can hose them off and then let them dry. I expect these will hold out and last for quite a long time.

"This is one of the best Salt Water Taffy's I have ever tried. I normally get the fair taffy over the summer because our county fair has the best around here. Well, Shriver's Taffy is just as good (if not a bit better) and I'll be honest, I have never found one that even came close to the fair. I like that this comes in individually wrapped rolls rather than chunks. It's much easier to bite a piece off than to have the whole chunk you can't bite and have to throw the whole thing in your mouth.This comes in a nice gift box all ready for giving. All pieces were well wrapped and fresh. It's nice and soft and bites off easily. Doesn't get all gummed up and stuck in your teeth. There is a nice variety of flavors and they have really good flavor and not fake tasting. The banana, chocolate and peppermint were my favorites but they all were good. Definitely would recommend these if you or someone you know is a taffy lover.

"I am really impressed with these LED Solar Outdoor String Lights. They are perfect for dressing up my flower beds and landscaping in the spring and summer months. The warm white color is so pretty and is quite bright. They almost have a yellow appearance to them when lit in the dark. They are waterproof so they will withstand the rain. One of the things I really like and was impressed with is that the flower petals are like a rubber material and not hard plastic. I've had the hard plastic ones before and the petals break off. I won't have that issue with these. The grade of the wiring they are on is really good.This comes with a 2 piece stake and your light string with attached solar charging box. There are 2 buttons on the box. One to turn them on and the other is to adjust if you want the lights solid or flashing. They will charge in the sunlight for 6-8 hours and then give you 8-10 hours of light at night. I like the solar lights so much better than electric because you don't need to worry about plugging them in and out every night and having a cord extended across the yard to an outlet.

"This Wooden Kitchen by Teamson is suck an amazing kitchen for the kids. The quality and weight of this is very nice. This outdoes the plastic kitchens any day. It comes all nicely labeled in the box. The wooden pieces have stickers on the back to coincide with the directions for putting it together. The screws come in their own packages and are numbered as well. It took around a half hour to assemble and everything went together easily without issues. All you need for tools is a phillips head screwdriver. All pieces with included down to the last screw. We've purchase things before that had to be assembled and nothing worse than missing a piece or a screw but not in this case.The colors and painting on all the pieces is done nicely and the detail is great and is done with a lead free paint. There are many movable parts and things on the kitchen which makes it so much fun for the kids. They can pretend they are in their kitchen cooking with you. The knobs on the stove turn and make clicking sounds, hands on the clock move, oven door opens and closes, microwave opens and closes and cabinets open and close. Kitchen comes with a spatula and 3 jars as far as accessories. There is a small hook on the side which holds a cell phone that they can have fun with and pretend they're taking food orders.This kitchen is nice and sturdy once all built and the doors attached good too and aren't sloppy and loose. Overall quality of this is exceptional. I don't think there is a child that wouldn't love to have this kitchen. I really can't say enough good about this. I am very pleased with my purchase and would absolutely recommend this. The kids will get a lot of use out of this and even the older kids are having fun with it.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"These magnetic sheets can be used for so many different things. The kids can use them in school to design and dress up their lockers. You can write on them with dry erase markers.

The magnetic backing sticks well to any metal surface. You get 3 large sheets in the package and each sheet measures 8"" x 15"".

Each bowl expands/opens to a good sized dish (1 1/2 cups) for a small/medium size dog. You can just partially expand them too if you want a shallower dish. I have a Pomeranian and they are perfect for her.The silicone is a nice grade and each bowl also comes with a carabiner hook and a whistle attached and 3 stickers. These can be tossed in your bag or car or else you can clip them on a bag or backpack with the hook.

"This Picnic Bowl is amazing! It is much larger than I ever expected it to be and it will hold a lot in it.

There are also handles that fold down too.The bowl measures around 9 1/2 in diameter and 6"" deep. I would compare the quality of the bowl to Tupperware honestly. It's nice and durable and a really nice plastic and at a much better price. You can put so many different foods in this for your parties and picnics.

" 2:52 MinsThis Bump and Go School Bus by Top Race is a fun toy that can keep the kids busy having fun for awhile. The bus itself is all plastic and has seats showing inside. There are no people/passengers inside, nor can you put any in but it makes it look a little realistic having the seats in my opinion. There is an on/off switch on the bottom that when you turn on, the bus starts playing music and the lights start flashing.There is a plastic ""safety"" cap on the bottom covering the mechanism that makes this drive and have the bump and go action. The bus requires 3 AA batteries which are not included. The battery compartment has the hole for the safety screw but there is no screw included. Luckily, not an issue for me because my husband is one of those people who saves everything so in his container of screws, he had one that fit. I imagine you could get one at any hardware store though.The lights flash through the clear windows in the top of the school bus and are nice and bright and look awesome in the dark. The music isn't real loud but if you think it is, the speaker is on the bottom of the bus and you can always put a piece of black tape over it to muffle it. Bus measures 12"" and comes in nice color box ready for gift giving. School Bus is recommended for ages 3 years and older.

"I really like these AMIRA Twisted Boots. I normally wear a 10 and ordered a size 11 and they just fit. A little more snug than I like and I won't be able to wear a heavier sock in them but they at least fit to the point where I can wear them. I love the style of these and the quality I think is really nice. They are nice and soft and feel like leather even thought hey are faux leather.They have a rubber sole so they have good grip when walking and you don't slide on water or anything wet. They are easy to get on and off. The only other downside I see other than the sizing is they are tall. I don't have short legs or calves but when I sit, the backs of them are a little past my knee so I feel them in the crease of the back of my knee when I sit. It's just a little annoying, not like it's very uncomfortable and I'm use to by now. The width is good and the expended calf is good too. Overall, these are nice boots and I love wearing them.

The material is nice and soft and all the stitching is done well and there were no loose threads. The sizing was good and it's a nice loose fitting shirt. Doesn't cling to your body. Normally clothes I purchase online for me or my daughter run small and I bought this for my daughter who wears a large and ordered an XL. It fits her nicely.

"I own a few pair of Twisted boots now and normally they run a little small and I have to order a size up. However, on these ones they ran a little big in my opinion but I'd rather too big than too small. I got these for my daughter because I didn't think they would zip up my calf because I usually need the extended calf and these were not. I tried them on and they almost zipped up all the way but my calves swell so they may work for you.My daughter wears a 13 women's and I got her the 12 and they fit her perfectly and she loves them. The brown is a very nice tone and the style is so cute. The double zipper down the sides work but they are just for show and don't unzip all the way through the boot or aid in helping you get them on. The full length zipper on the other side works good and didn't stick at all. These were very comfortable to wear all day she said. Even though they aren't real leather, they have the look and feel of real leather.The rubber sole is nice and had good grip on a wet floor so you don't slide.  Overall, these are a nice quality boot and are very stylish. She's worn them now 4 different times and has had people compliment her on them every time she wears them.**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

There is a large snowman on the bottom of the liner and then around the sides, there is a snowman, penguin and santa alternating. The blue color is lighter than the stock photo shows but they are still super cute. These are standard size and will pit in your standard muffin pans. No need for any sprays when using these and the paper liner doesn't stick to your baked goods. They come apart easily and are sure to dress up your holiday treats. I am very happy with them.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

"This necklace is so cute for that special little girl in your life. I do have to say, it was much nicer than I ever expected it to be. This is not some cheap necklace you'll buy somewhere and it will be broken in a day. The gold chain is a bit thicker of one so it will not break easily if child tugs at it or pulls on it. The hand painted enamel hearts are pretty colors and done nicely. Each of the 6 hearts has a crystal accent in the center of them. I really like how the 2 center hearts dangle at the bottom also. Very nice length for a child also measuring at 16"" in length with a 2"" extender. Comes in a nice black jewelry box all set for gift giving. All around, just a beautiful necklace.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

" 4:01 MinsThis Inchworm Toy by WolVol is super cute. I just love the little face on this guy and the colors are nice and colorful and bright. The inchworm is recommended for ages 6 months and older. This is a great toy for the little ones when they are learning to crawl. It does require 3 small watch type batteries but they are included. The battery compartment door attaches with a screw for safety so the little ones cannot get the door open.The head of the inchworm turn a complete 360 degrees and just makes a ""cranking"" noise when it turns. On the ear is a button to press for the music to play. The other side is the speaker. The face lights up/glows and flashes when the music is playing. Plays a variety of songs and they aren't too loud where the toy will drive you crazy. The back wheels are filled with little beads and are clear and act as rattles and make sound when the wheels turn.When your child pushes down on the center on the inchworm's body, it has like a spring action inside and it will then ride across the room and ""unwind"". To make it move again, push the center down and do it again. Easy enough for a child to push and they will have lots of fun with this while the music is playing. This is a great sensory toy for the little ones and I would highly recommend this. Very cute and durable.

"This Album Frame is quite the neat gift idea for someone. I actually got it to give to my son for Christmas with one of his favorite Kiss album covers to hang in his man cave. It's lightweight but the perfect size for the album cover. Tabs on the back are easy to open and insert the album and also comes with the hardware to hang it on the wall. Quality of it is good and the album looks so awesome in it. These frames are nice for preserving your favorite albums/covers in so they don't get worn and ruined.

"These Scooby-Doo Window Clings are so cute for decorating the windows up for the holidays. I have over 20 windows in my home and I go all out for Christmas and decorating and use/need a lot of different clings for my windows. My husband has always liked Scooby-Doo so these will be perfect for our bedroom windows I figured. You get 2 packages with 9 clings in each package. These are easily reusable year after year if stored properly. Best way I have found to store them is in a shirt sized gift box and lay in a single layer and then place a piece of waxed paper down and put down another layer and repeat until all your clings are put away. Mark the box and store away until next year. Super cute clings and the vinyl is a thickness too with these.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This is such a nice canvas tote bag. I was very impressed with the size and the quality of it. The carry handles are nice and durable and attached well. There is a snap along with a zipper that keeps it closed for you. Under the snap is also a pocket for keys, cell phone or any smaller items. I really like the tan and the way it offsets the beige color. The thickness of the material is quite nice and this can definitely hold a lot and also a decent amount of weight in it.The bottom is flat so it stands up nicely on its own with just a few things in it and doesn't fall over. There is one large compartment inside and then 2 smaller pockets on the side. The stitching is all done very well on this and the corners are all reinforced. I love this bag and the quality of it is very good.

"I seriously could not believe how heavy this pan was when I received it. I know glass weighs a lot and have other glass 9"" x 13"" pans, but this one was so much thicker and heavier. This is made from a Borosilicate glass which basically mean that this pan will never shatter on you from thermal shock and that it can stand sudden changes in temperature. This is perfect for preparing your meal ahead of time, placing it in the refrigerator and then when ready to cook take from fridge right into the oven. No need to wait and have it reach room temperature before putting into the oven.This glass pan is perfect for making dinners such as casseroles, lasagna and side dishes or else bake your favorite cakes, coffee cake or brownies in it. This is dishwasher safe as well. Has a nice pattern to the carry handles on this and would be a nice pan to use when you have to bring a dish to pass at a party.

"I have never had a first aid kit so I thought it was about time to get one. I was amazed at everything that was in this one. It included things I would never even thought to keep in one. You get the following:  Antiseptic Cleansing Wipes, Alcohol Prep Pads, Butterfly Closure Strips, Extra Large Adhesive Bandages, Adhesive Bandages, Antibacterial Ointment, Knuckle Adhesive Bandages, Fingertip Adhesive Bandages, Gauze Swabs, Disposable Cold Compress, First Aid Tape, Q-Tips, Abdominal Pad, Disposable Vinyl Gloves, Slim Rescue Howler Whistle, Compass, Moleskin Blister Relief, Triangular Bandages, Emergency Blanket, 1 Glow Stick, Disposable Raincoat, Scissors, PBT Conforming Bandage, CPR Facemask, Metal Tweezers, Razor Blade, Sewing Kit, Safety Pins and Sting Relief Pads. Now that is a ton of stuff! I don't think there is a supply you would need that isn't here. The nice thing too is most everything is individually wrapped for convenience and so they can stay sterile.This is perfect to keep in the car, take on vacation, camping or even in your house. It comes in a nice nylon bag and everything is sorted inside nicely. This will even fit in the glove box of your car. Definitely a great first aid kit to have and being my first one I have ever owned, I am very impressed with it and would recommend it.I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"Rest in peace Maureen. Since my earliest days, I have been a fan of O'haras, she is simply the best. I grew up watching this and many other Haley mills and Maureen O'hara's movies. I particularly love this line up of actors as it has good performances from both women. It's a really nice multigenerational crossover film for the era and today. I have many wonderful images burned into memory of this film. So many classic moments. This film was a first with the special effects it employed and presented a progressive family dynamic.I am so glad I own this film now. It's in my top 50 all time and my top 10 family movies, up there with Disney's Swiss family Robinson and meet me in st.

"After sounding like a crazy person every time I swept with my old, poor quality broken down broom, I finally ordered its replacement. I won't go into all the issues I had with that awful broom...it makes my eyes twitch just remembering.This broom is fairly stiff. Not much sticks to the fibers, the top part of the stick doesn't come loose while sweeping, the angles are really nice and intuitive to use.I absolutely do not like the dust pan. I use my old dustpan that has a nice rubber edge that conforms to the ground and also makes for a minimal edge...this white dustpan has a tall and abrupt edge by comparison that is hard and Non conforming.That's my only dislike for the broom combo.

He likes his look alike daddy underwear and all the colors. We got all different colors in our bag.

"I received this bag as a gift from my wishlist. I haven't had a brown leather bag in ages. I needed something large, but not huge, it needed to fit a lot of kids stuff, water bottle long wallet and mini first aid kit. Etc... I love this bag. It has a wide enough mouth, it never falls over and spills everything out even when it's unzipped, I would have liked some extra pockets inside on the sides, it only has one zipper compartment. The strap on the shoulder should be a little wider...it can get uncomfortable if the purse gets heavy. The movement and shrugging structure of the purse makes it easy to move around with, it won't get caught or jab you, it just absorbs shapes and molds to you or wherever it sits. It's so nice and practical. I love the color-it's timeless. I would have likes to see the finishes in silver, but this light gold is ok.It's well made, I feel I got a quality purse. It reeks of leather...it's a potent aroma...my coach leather purse didn't smell so much like leather like this.

"Wow! What a nice setup! Unlike most conventional Americans, my family believes in colon irrigation as a key to overall health and toxin removal. We needed another reusable enema system and had used this brand bag before. I have the 2 qt or 1.8qt version of the purenema bag already, I bought it individually and then bought silicon tubing that came with plastic tips. This kit was not available at the time. Seeking a second kit I found this and ordered the larger 4 qt bag. I really like the silicon tips, they are superior to plastic in both comfort and materials. The quality of the kit is very apparent. I sterilized everything immediately, and aside from the accelerated speed of the fluid, the bag, tubing and tips worked beautifully.I did not like how kinked all the tubes were, they were folded multiple times like when you buy an extension cord. They could have been looped instead. I did not really like the rolling clamp, other clamps I have used had a better feel and had fewer recesses to clean. The clamp is a much nicer manufacturing quality though...it probably comes down to preference.  I like that there were two tubes included, and I liked the length of the tubes.Overall, I would highly recommend this kit, it's a wonderful health resource in which one can invest and use for a long time.I also highly suggest using filtered water if your water is on the hard side for sterilization to avoid chalky build up that will eventually be carried into your body with whatever type of fluid you use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36BHV4UJ5CZ4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0606UW#wasThisHelpful","R36BHV4UJ5CZ4Q","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rated this book five stars because I found it well placed, well informed, interesting and unusual.As a breastfeeding mother, I truly enjoyed the level of detail incorporated in an often overlooked but very formative and clearly important relationship of breastfeeding an infant.I don't recall another book I've seen that chronicles a man my and her charge. I really liked feeling that the two women would eventually meet again once they were separated. I liked the level of prayer and faith conveyed.I think the issues of slavery and abolition were dealt with well without being too pc. I loath the broad bandaid of political correctness. History is still history, it's often offensive, ugly and wrong, but new perspectives don't alter the past and shouldn't contrive or manipulate it to be less offensive. It is what it was.Anyway I enjoyed the writing style and I was not needing to skip over grandiose descriptions of fantasy women's novel sex scenes. I really don't like novels that ritualistically form the plot and circumstances around steamy sex scenes and use flowery descriptions for such things. I'm probably alone in my abhorrence for that stuff... but I digress...I really enjoyed the yellow crocus reference throughout... it could be a metaphor, I don't know, but that element seems very nice to knit things together neatly.I recommend this book, it's fairly short, so it will be a nice afternoon diversion for most.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDNLXIENVE7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUA8IN8#wasThisHelpful","R3CDNLXIENVE7T","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not bright by any means and one bulb out of two I installed burnt out in three days of casual use. Five bucks a pop is hardly worth it when they burn out so quickly. I don't find them to be as bright as my other 60 watt bulbs. Otherwise, they were well packaged and look cool when they work.Updated 9/28/15I was contacted by the seller concerning my defective bulbs. They sent me another six bulb pack to make up for the problems I experienced. I really appreciate the seller's initiative in replacing the defective bulbs, that is worth a lot to me. I bought these for my hallway, and while it is still too dim for my taste, the light bulbs were a hit with visiting family members and the home inspector who did our refinancing appraisal. He asked where we got them and remarked in his notes to the bank that we had upgraded lighting fixtures.

"Silky and thin. My sheets had a blemish about a millimeter wide and tall where some foreign substance had interrupted the threads and when I tried to remove it, left a hole...right beneath the folded top of the flat sheet, where it would be clearly visible always. I wouldn't have kept the sheets anyway because in no way do they feel thick enough to hold up to several years of use. I purchased 800 thread count sheets from tj max years ago and they were much sturdier and just as smooth. They lasted 5 years as our only and then primary sheet set.

"This side view is really not what you see...what is visible is the interior under the hood of the light, it is thin metal that is not pattenated (is that a word?) or distressed like the top, so really, what you see is rather plain and ugly, especially since so much of the white ceramic light bulb port thing shows. If you put any other type of bulb in these, it looks atrocious...so be prepared to pay 5$ a pop for vintage looking edison bulbs. Also, the whole thing looks like an exterior light for a porch...it's actually why I bought these, other than they were inexpensive and I needed more updated fixtures that were oil rubbed bronze in my hallway....they match my exterior lighting style, the pattenation and the industrial commercial vintage almost nautical feel...I am disappointed now that I realize the light fixture doesn't show well since you almost never see a fixture directly from the side...you see the underside which has a hideous sticker that when removed may leave residue and a slight color difference on the inside hood....and then you won't remember the 60 watt limit on the bulbs... or the next person who lives in your house won't have a clue.These edison bulbs-I purchased dimmable-at 60 watts- are dim. I was hoping to brighten my hall and these made it worse, any other bulb type will look ugly but definitely awful if it's a cfl.Also, the glass is quite thin, probably not a great idea for lower ceilings, people who have kids who throw stuff in the house, or in passageways or traffic areas where tall or long items are moved.... I've had two handymen hit light fixtures and break them in the past....ladders both times. These fixtures for me are a temporary fix. I had to replace broken (by the handyman) and mismatched (thanks to the previous handyman) hall lights before a walk through appraisal and I'm on a budget.condAppraisal went well. We were rated the highest a house can be that hasn't been remodeled completely to like new condition or is a new build. The appraiser noted many newer upgrades such as fixtures and different renovations we have done. Since we have a lot of hallway, I know he  noticed and had to photograph the fixtures which are the only thing in the hallway besides doors and a light switch. That said, these are an awful pain! The glass has to be cleaned monthly! I use microfiber to make sure no residues are left behind, these cloths are terrific for all my other glass in the house...but these lights are weirdly dirty/cloud almost instantly, show all the dust and are a real pain to clean.I am definitely changing out my hallway lights again. These will be sold at a future garage sale.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNSWIF9LJTV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5ITX54#wasThisHelpful","R3RNSWIF9LJTV","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, I'm a little biased because my previous kitchen light fixtures were the $20.00 cheap flush mount half dome specials you buy from home depot. I was severely deprived of adequate lighting my kitchen. Sometimes in the evenings I would think the main kitchen light wasn't even on and try to turn it on again finding it already was lit...so any improvement in luminosity greatly impresses me. Anyways I will say that this light fixture in particular and by comparison truly excells.Firstly, it is able to illuminate the shiny white ceiling above and around it because of its design....so I get reflected and direct light. Great!Secondly, I am able to use normal light bulbs as compared to strange, long  halogen lights which cost quite a lot to replace and require extra effort to find, purchase and install. So bonus points for uniform light bulb style.Thirdly, it's an attractive, timeless shape and style that appeals to those of us who like vintage, antique, character pieces, or even country.Fourthly, it is a vast improvement over builder or low quality ceiling fixtures such as are found inexpensively, or even more expensively at the local home depot...thank you Amazon and world imports...affordable, durable and timeless.Fifthly, I found it extremely easy to install...I have a cordless drill that made it a breeze. Takes about 5-10 minutes including removal of the old light to turning on the new light...and I took my time and cleaned the ceiling around the bases too.Now for the cons....Glass is thin so I will have to be very careful when I carry tall things like ladders or any of the unusual stuff I generally pass through my galley kitchen on the way outside, I will need to make sure my son doesn't throw in the kitchen...he is three, that's what he Likes to do...throw. it will clearly break easily.The glass has some imperfections...I have several glass bubbles which make it look dirty and I have a black dot on the other shade, Like fly poop.Other than that, I highly recommend this fixture to glam up boring ceilings...I would say these are best on 8-10' ceiling heights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LMSCS4I1C2GX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PTLCOM#wasThisHelpful","R1LMSCS4I1C2GX","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A safe for my toddler and 8month old ball! My almost 3 year old is ball obsessed...really, to a numeric power of 10. It's all he does, well, he does move other toys and likes balloons and drawing...but balls are the main toy all day, every kind. Now as a expert on balls now, I can say with great appreciation that this ball is very nice for indoor play, in a child friendly room of course, and for play around infants. My toddler beamed my 8 month old in the head and it hardly phased him...most other balls would have upset or hurt my infant. We all really like how bouncy, colorful,soft and different this ball is. It's a stand out in our collection. We do however dislike the strong neoprene odor and hope it wears off.

"I ordered a size up for arm room, this is my second one of these. I love wearing these flaky, flattering cardigans. I wanted to say that the green is totally teal, nowhere near the green shown. It's teal. I like teal, but I wanted green for a specific combination. The teal is a really ""cool"" tone and may conflict with your skin tone if you are not a ""winter"". That said, these cardigans are either your thing, or not your thing. I like the weight-or lack thereof, the gentle fragility, which it doesn't rip or tear too easily...and I don't mind hand washing every several times I wear these. These are very comfortable and relaxing to wear, I love the flowy tapered ends in front, subtly elongating the figure instead of abruptly breaking it up like horizontal lines do.

"Bought this for my mom when she was complaining about severe hip pain from all the moving boxes she was carrying up her stairs...she is 63 and pretty tough, use to having to do things herself unfortunately. She went in for an adjustment but was still in pain. Rather than watch her take horrible pain meds, I ordered dmso. I'm a natural remedy kind of person, I loathe pharmaceuticals. I figured a cream was going to be most appealing for her since it could be easily measured and familiar to the average person who is used to allopathic cures.She started using this dmso cream, putting it on in the evenings before bed, then again in the mornings. She noticed less and less pain, she said it reduced her pain from severe-keeping her from moving-to a slight ache. She doesn't always remember to apply 2x a day because the pain is so minor she forgets.She really loves the cream, she has recommended it to her friends and coworkers and they have all ordered some too.

"Very good fit! I'm impressed with how well these fit. I did order a half size down because I like snug sandals, to fill up all the space on the sole and this measure generally works quite well. It seems like they were custom made for me! My feet are average width and I can see how easily a wide foot could overlap the narrow sole, also not great if you have a high arch or larger ankles. These sandals are also quite sexy and are convincingly leather looking. I do wish the elastic on the buckle was longer so I could slip these on without buckling and unbuckling.

"I'm very satisfied with this inexpensive umbrella. I have a very nice base that it screws into and that keeps it very secure. I don't leave it open in the wind so I am not expecting the umbrella to fly off and break like other reviewers have had happen. I think the crank motion is very nice for this price range, I think the color is beautiful. I have this on a front yard patio furniture set so it needs to look nice as anyone driving by can see it. I have had it for a few months and it gets full son and it still looks new.Ok, more than a year later this umbrella is very faded, it still works well and hasn't had any problems. I think the fading is acceptable if it were not in my front yard. I will be buying another soon to freshen up the appearance of the yard. I figure $5 a month isn't bad for a focal piece I use often if I buy a new one every year and a half. I can probably sell the old one at a garage sale.

"Like a glove...that rubs on my wheel. Almost got a blister. I wanted to wear them so badly, I went without socks....don't make that mistake, I won't again. Other than that, I did listen. To reviews and ordered a half size down. I am a 9&1/2 normally. These in a 9 are perfect width and length, so they really fit well. I am getting my peds tomorrow! I can't wait to wear these often! So cuteUpdate: it's been a whole week of wearing them and I feel like they have broken in and formed a little better to my foot.

"Jellycat animals in corduroy are the best night time animals for little kids. My son loves his crocodile by Jellycat and it's my favorite of their line. It's soooooo simple and squishy. I was disappointed by the tail of this Fox it has nearly no stuffing or mass as you would expect and the toy had a heavy odor...possibly due to the bag it was shipped inside. I intend to wash it like I do Groppo, my son's crocodile, once a month and starting right away... I know they say not to machine wash, just spot clean...but the crocodile holds up very well in a delicate cycle in a lingerie bag with mild soap and hanging dry on my covered back porch. It only takes a day to dry.This is intended for my 3month old second son so he can have a sweet favorite animal pal to sleep with when he transitions to sleeping in his room one day.Jelly cat cordy animals are a great value, they look perfect after many delicate washes...such is the nature of corduroy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYY4BRPUYF3TR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZ21AJG#wasThisHelpful","RYY4BRPUYF3TR","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I got it for my toddler to draw on since he is into drawing now. This is still the same product I grew up drawing on in art classes, figure drawing, sketching, etc. It's good stuff, just not ideal for saving long term...as far as I know, newsprint is an unstable paper meant for building drawing skill or making a quick record of a subject to be translated into a more permanent medium at a later time.

"Not pretty but it brushes as expected. I bought this as a grooming brush for my husband's beard for after he combs it to be used with a beard oil so his hairs align and the ends brush into the beard. I am giving it as a stocking stuffer in a week on Christmas.Already, I have used it on my toddlers very soft thick hair after combing and it really seems to weave the hair together to maintain its shape much better than a brush or comb does. I noticed the bristles have some longer pieces sticking out, bent over and into the brush and askew but it's a inexpensive brush....i think the overall appearance is unsightly, but I'm not too concerned as it's going to go through the ringer when my husband abuses it. It's clearly made as cheaply as possible with a pathetic paint stamped on script on top of the varnish that is hazy and soon to rub off. The varnish is ugly and scratched from shipping, getting rubbed against paper! I just hope the finish doesn't gum up with beard oil residue or water of hair product sitting on the surface. If it does, I'll order a $10 brush. Boar bristle brushes are ideal for grooming as they redistribute the natural hair oils and stimulate the scalp, they are gentle on hair and are eco friendly. So get one.The comb was a bonus, a good size and width for beards and short hair.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LE3K8YOTRON1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A1JPS6#wasThisHelpful","R2LE3K8YOTRON1","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is not about product function, but about...smell...and a quality issue...I purchased this to put into my husband's stocking, and man does it all reek of cigar smoke I was so overwhelmed by the odor upon sniffing and opening the shipping package I had to put it and the products outside. I thought maybe the soap was a rank cigar smoke smelling scent, but no, it smells strong and strange, but not like cigars. It's really gross, the door and isn't supposed to be associated with the products. I have since wiped the bottles, comb and soap box down with scented wipes and they still stink. I have to find somewhere outside to let these air out where they'll be hidden from my husband until Christmas eve, otherwise, they'll stink up whatever area they're in...like my gift closet...which they did...I hope the stink goes away by Christmas or else it won't be going in his stocking but in a zip lock bag in a gift bag with a long explanation.The switch blade comb has a secondary button that rattles around loose and serves no purpose or is broken....the whole thing is really cheap and disappointing.

"So to date we have installed 6 of these 40 foot lengths in our front yard, park strip, side of driveway and driveway park strip divider. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers to let it warm in the sun before installing...great tip. I used the stakes sold for these, not easy to use in hard ground...the bend and no matter what soil they go into, need to be tilted forward in order to get the final angle of the board at 90degrees.

In other areas, I left an inch and a half above ground to do die mulch from the DG... it looks very nice and our yard looks better than anyone else's on the block thanks largely to how professional and tidy these bender boards appear in landscaping.

The shoe is cute, it's of decent construction and would have been great if it wasn't totally tiny.The bottom of the shoe says 26 which translates to 8.5, so it's the same size I ordered.

"Wow, I love how silky smooth and shiny my hair is! I don't dye or treat my hair really...this summer I lightened my dark blond with a mix of calendula and chamomile tea with lemon...makes a great hairspray! So with all my golden highlights, growing out, I wasn't thrilled looking forward to a winter of  dark hair and grown out highlights so I wanted to try something different. I've always wanted red hair, I thought I would start with this and work my way more red if it looked good.I felt the process was fine, it would have been nice if somebody could have done the top and back of my head though. I didn't find the scent unpleasant, but I've become accustomed to natural scents and herbal fragrances and have come to appreciate them. I actually l like the way my hair smells after rinsing it out. It is messy to apply, I used rubber kitchen gloves. I have long hair-it reaches my lower back but I only dyed the crown of my head/hair. My hair is very fine and limp but its healthy...no damage or dryness...one packet worked for my half head application and for my eyebrows. I left it in for 1 hour 45 minutes. I used saran wrap under the cap to keep it moist.I will say the near two hours spent with henna on my eyebrows and my hair piled into a conical shape tha resembled a cow pie under plastic wrap was the most unattractive I have felt in a long time. I am glad I made sure nobody saw me do this. Once I rinsed out and conditioned using coconut conditioner, I lightly dried my hair and it was immediately apparent the color had taken beautifully to my highlights...but the best part was my roots that had grown out were blended into the highlights much nicer than what was going on before. My hair feels great, I think it smells great and the color makes me look so much better...the dark blond is really unappealing without highlights....this color is a really nice contrast with my skin and warms up the sad color I had. Seems like I'll be hooked on color treatments all winter.I had dark blond hair with highlights, this warmed up my hair color overall (which almost had a green tinge to it at it's darkest) and really made my highlights even prettier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XC83HLAH4117/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L82ZDW#wasThisHelpful","R1XC83HLAH4117","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where DO I start? I have read mother food once through and many times partially. I find it to be  a wealth of pertinent dietary/supplement knowledge in general and specifically for reproduction and lactation. I have never found any other single source or even large group of sources that provide as much information about lactenogenic foods, beverages and plants as Mother Food. Its an outstanding body of research in itself, sourcing every major continent for information and tradition based practices. I am highly impressed by the level of research, the lengths to which the author went to appropriate the most specific and detailed food profiles. She provides sources and cites them throughout her work. I mean- its almost overkill, I can honestly state that this book is my lactenogenic food bible- its better than any other publication on the topic. I think this was the author’s goal- to put forth the most, the best and even the obscure data on the subject. She touches on all sorts of possibilities that can sabotage production and health, I never found such an elaborate compilation of possible low supply culprits anywhere.I love how thorough the subject matter is, the general flow makes me very happy- its not merely a list of foods and diet suggestions. She provides diet implementation examples and great recipes/how tos. I am a major fan of the book and her other work. The Author brings a very unique view (having done much research in Europe and being able to read other languages/access a greater body of research) to this subject mater-she doesn’t solely rely upon what little information is available in the English speaking United states. Her inclusion of Eastern medicine is a bonus for those of us who are more interested in the mind body effect of plants. I strongly urge EVERYONE TO GET THIS BOOK if you are remotely interested in better lactation success, have struggled or need dietary advice for pregnancy and lactation.I am going to write even more thoroughly when I get the opportunity, but I will just say that this book and “Making more milk, a breastfeeding mothers guide” are the best two books on lactation support where supply and quality of milk is addressed…I live by them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36L10WJR19IDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979599504#wasThisHelpful","R36L10WJR19IDN","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of course they're made in China, but if you don't want to pay what domestic labor, materials, running a business domestically costs, then it's your best option. I bought these for my new baby, knowing he won't really be wearing them to walk in and not wanting anything with too much structure (I believe feet were designed to be barefoot, and I don't like chunky, tall, heeled shoes for any stage of life). I also wanted more pliable, natural materials (though I am not kidding myself that many chemicals were used to treat this leather and will not be allowing my baby to put them in his mouth)...I was scanning Amazon and saw these, very basic little shoes. When I received them I was a little doubtful they would fit well for the stage of life that they were intended for. They will be loose width and possibly length wise...but as they are more for me than for the baby...as babies that age rarely walk and shoes are more for looks...I wasn't upset by the large size. They are altogether except for a little elastic and the underside of the top. They dont have a functional strap as you may assume from the picture, but the shoe has elastic around the ankle/tongue and functions well enough. The shoes are true to color and design, they arrived within 2 weeks of ordering and I am very satisfied with them. Know they are very roomy so possibly order a smaller size if you need to have a truer fit, or get thick baby socks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6WZZTD6LFM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWX7K92#wasThisHelpful","RC6WZZTD6LFM2","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't want to write negAtive things about books which seek to be helpful and address important issues like proper health during these reproductive stages. But I can't give it 5 stars just for trying.Other books I have read deal with these topics much better, give you better readability and construction, more resources and information on just about all this book does. I will include the titles in this review.My impression of this book: this book seems to try to include varied information about 3 very lengthy topics but falls short of being thorough or practical and feels very choppy. It's like it was compiled as a response to answering a list of questions that we can't see-like it's half a conversation or a check list. It doesn't flow, it doesn't engage the reader and discuss how to make this info applicable or seek to provide an example of a daily diet which can incorporate the authors fact profiles. This book feels like a compilation of facts and anecdotal info, it's very cut and dry. I also don't like how nothing is said of preparation for labor...things like exercise, mental preparedness, avoiding intervention or the usefulness of foods and herbs to promote successful labor would be easy enough to mention and a few suggestions for further reading would be sufficient. May I suggest to readers the book ""pushed"" by Jennifer block or looking into labor prep on the wellnessmama.com site as well as researching methods like hypnobabies... A large section of this book is devoted to herb profiles which are sadly way too basic and often not targeting specific reproductive or lactation support. It does not include many galactagogues (lactation promoting food or herb) i have heard of and includes other plants that seem interrelated to the subject matter. I know it misses quite a few important herbs and doesn't discuss some enough. The herb profiles are not really explained in a constructive manner that would render the reader more capable of using them than before they read the book. No dosage recommendation or type (such as capsule, tea, tincture) is provided. The pictograph rating system is silly and words would suffice and be much less redundant. Also, No sources are cited in most of the claims in the herbal profile dealing with safety...so you have to take the authors word. This is especially frustrating when other books with better information and more thorough explanations contradict the provided herb information...you are left no source to read further or substantiate the claim. It seems that instead of providing many herb profiles that should be entirely or mostly avoided and seem utterly useless to the book, the author could have compiled a list of herbs to avoid and saved some of their and the reader's time. you don't need a picture and general information of something you can entirely avoid. A focus upon the most effective plants/herbs would have been helpful instead of including many obscure herbs that are only allowable during only one of the 3 reproductive stages this book discusses. the inclusion of plants that have no specific constituents pertaining to conception, pregnancy or lactation as outlined or specified by the author (though in other more thorough books like ""mother food"" or ""a breastfeeding mother's guide to making more milk"", many of these same plants are included and pertinent information provided as to why and how to use them) is confusing...like artichoke... little reason is given to support its necessity to be discussed.I would have been satisfied with this book if it offered something like a herbal blend recipe for conception or some methods of using the herbs that are abstractly listed...that would have been useful. Overall, I feel this author's offerings would have been better suited to a blog format, and structured as based upon her experiences as, without enough sources, the information the book discusses suffers the unverified status of anecdotal. research exists that would greatly substantiate much in the book-its just not included.good information is provided concerning General health that I feel is already understood by the reader who has reached the intermediate level of such research. It's available everywhere and honestly, the kind of person who is seeking to improve their health for these three phases in life is already going to know or have come across it before. That said, I agree with most of it. It has been discussed by many other similar books though. However...if you want to get something basic for a friend who is ttc, who has a cruddy diet and isn't considering diet in their limited, pharmaceutical friendly minds...this could be a good book. I'm passing it along to someone I know who has never thought to alter their diet or take herbs to improve chances for conception. However...that said, proper diet as suggested by the book and understood by me is expensive, time consuming and hard work...and most people just don't want to do it...or stop eating crud out of a bag. But that's no reflection on the book. I guess what I'm getting at, is that the usefulness of this book is dependent upon the reader being very unaware of general nutrition, having not ventured to research anything before and who a r e willing to do much more reading to figure out how they can apply the type of diet involved in achieving proper nutrition.Anyway, I like that the book tries, but I think other books succeeded with a profundity of information which I have found more useful, practical, source heavy, easier to implement and overall, more accessible. These two books I find most helpful were ""Mother food"" by Hilary Jacobson and ""The breastfeeding mother's guide to making more milk"" by Diana West and Lisa Marasco (sp?) If you want general information for nutrition, look into ""Nourishing traditions"" by Sally Fallon and Weston a Price followers (no it's not a religiousthing, well, maybe it is if you actually change your diet like you should)...","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQ53IJYBKJDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=086571780X#wasThisHelpful","RRQ53IJYBKJDS","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fit the bill, and so much nicer than what I used growing up and even have used recently. Finally, a quality construction paper for projects and games! And so cheaply priced on amazon...get some with every order!I have a two year old who likes paper projects, I generally need construction paper for him to play with or to use to make greeting cards or labels with. I hated the soft, fade prone, horrible colored junk I had and remember having used all my life with few exception. Now I have a nice quality paper in better colors for all my project needs.

"It's difficult to access the product as it was likely fresh and overall, was in good condition and generally was as described...Fenugreek just didn't work for me... I took it as a galactagogue, and it made my son colicky, gassy, and turned him into an insomniac. He is 7 weeks old. His sleep schedule was totally thrown off...he didn't take any nap three out of five days and awoke many times during the night...his normal behavior had been fairly consistent before and has returned to normal since stopping fenugreek. He also would scream and cry at the breast in the evenings where as before, and again since stopping the supplement, he had no such problem. In my body, I noticed a slight increase in gas, but nothing extreme. My dosages 6-8 pills per day and I tried it for a week, I did not notice any increase in milk supply when measured through p pumping output using procedure for measurement as indicated by Kellymom.com. So basically, this product was fine in that it was as described and likely fresh...but it's claims to calm the stomach in me or my baby were totally false in my situation.It may cause a very different result for others which is why I am giving it 4 stars. I am truly rating the information provided on the label in juxtaposition to my experience and the quality of the supplement/co existence with description online. I can't blame the substance's effects on myself and my child on this brand of product, but it's importAnt to communicate it's effects as they are fairly common as side effects, or so I have read in lactation literature.Hope this helps","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EIXYDSXI3DA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009ETA6W#wasThisHelpful","R3EIXYDSXI3DA5","A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OQ4I8U6TYCVE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed making recipes from this Cooking Light Collection. There is something for every type of craving and every diet type.  These recipes  aimed to reduce calories and fat, but while keeping the flavor.Pros:- Kamut Apple Cake- uses Kamut flour, appealing those those who seek to use different grains-Coconut flour easily- found in most supermarkets and big box warehouse stores is used in a Coconut cake,=- Sometimes the enemy is a full size cake.The recipes have a smaller yield so you don't have too much dessert sitting around calling your name.-Several easy recipes in the book include things like Peach Crisp- Quick and satisfying-p.176's Ration Cake gives you valuable side notes on how to make  moist  cakes with a simple mixing technique-beautiful pictures of all the recipes- Recipes include cups and ounces for flour - making it easy for those who use a scale and those who don't.-Book includes a fair number of frozen desserts and puddingsSo far my favorites recipes are  Raspberry and Almond Linzer Muffins because it uses almond paste. Almond paste adds sucha beautiful flavor to  a cake. I also loved making the Maple Cupcakes. Deliciously moist and satisfying.Cons:-The only con I noticed was in my copy a fair number of  pages didn't have numbers,  I found this annoying.-The book generally goes in the direction of healthier alternatives for desserts. However a few recipes call for Cool Whip, such as TripleChocolate Cheesecake.  The author uses the term ""frozen reduced calorie whipped topping- such as Cool Whip)  This allowsthe user to choose whatever whip topping they like. Currently many stores are carrying ""So Delicious Dairy Free CocoWhip Coconut Whipped Topping- Regular and Lite Versions"" in their freezer case. Lite versions are two tablespoons are 25 calories and the regular is 30 calories. Cool Whip Lite is 20 calories. There is one other brand out there as well similar to So Delicious.  These are great options for a healthier version of a whipped topping if Cool Whip is a turn off due to his heavily laden chemical composition.The book has  something for everyone. Even if you don't want to use the lighter dairy options, you can substitute with a full fatversion without compromising the recipes.  I really love this book and have several more recipes tagged to make.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJ471CLEL798/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848744519#wasThisHelpful","R3RJ471CLEL798","A3OW12V8O7G5LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OW12V8O7G5LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product tries to deliver a lot.  It wants to address, lactose intolerance, digestion discomforts via herbs, probotics for immune support, and vegetable and meat intolerances.

"Tortilla Chips have been branching out for a long time with bold flavors, different shapes. Old El Paso is taking the lead with these changes by producing a shell that already has the cheese built in to it and that can stand up. One of the most irritating things with taco making and eatting isthat traditional shell can't stay still without spilling out the ingredients. Stand and stuff delivers on making it easier to load your toco.  The cheese flavor is not to powerful, but just enough to elevate the taste of the taco and give it an edge.Pros:  Easy to load toppings  Really Great TastingCons: Product arrived with many of the shells broken at the base making them unusable as tacos, so not a great product to ship.  Too many chemicals. No other major taco company uses as many chemicals as OEP.  Everything does not need to be ultra healthy, but since a  taco is topped with salad it can go in a healthy direction  rather than in the candy  coloring chemical direction of including ingredients like yellow 5, & 6, and red 40 lake, when something natural would suffice. One major cheese company  announced in April that they are removing ""fake coloring from mac and cheese"" and using paprika, turmeric and annatto instead because families wanted ""improved nutrition and simpler ingredients"".

"As a big fan of coconut water I feel sad to turn in a negative review but being honest, perhaps will get the company to re-sourcetheir product.  This is probably the worst coconut water I have ever tried. Organic, non organic, bottles glass or plastic,  tetra pack andfresh coconut water right out of the coconut. Just like an orange or an apple sweetness can vary from crop to crop, tree to tree and soon.  When something is tasteless and bitter, I wouldn't drink it again.I tested this water in 3 different applications.1. just as it is- unusually bitter and tasteless for a coconut water2. with a few drops of sweetener added- perfect3. as part of a smoothie- perfectWhen I ended up adding a few drops of liquid stevia (natural sweetener)  to take the bitter edge off.  In fairness, perhaps trying it in 3 months, with a different cropwould bring a better taste, but for right now I can't recommend this brand of coconut water based on taste, if it is to be drank as is.

"First off, I like Downy's line and I do use Downy Unstopables scented laundry products and I like that product as well as Downy fabric softener and dryer sheets and thought this neutralization product would be excellent as well. I rushed to pick it up at my local Publix.The purpose of the product according to the bottle and protect site says: in wash odor shield for your clothes goes directly into the washer to NEUTRALIZE fabric odors all day long. So whatever basic odors you have, such as moderate sweat from brisk walking, should be neutralized. AND protected from odors coming on to the clothing for the next 24 hours because it's also ""deodorant for your clothing"" activated by movement and is supposed to be perfect for ""active wear"". Obviously, putting active wear into the wash will have some sweat odor already in it.Per the instructions I placed the product into the washer along with 4 shirts and 2 pants, that had a lite sweat odor. However the clothes came out smelling awful- worse then when I added them. After taking them out the clothes smelled horribly musty .  For the same clothes I normally use either a cap of the Downy Unstoppables Blue bottle and have wonderful results or the Lavender scent with ok results or Gain scent with super excellent results. I use the same amount of this product and found that it was an epic fail. It did not neutralize the odors in a medium load of clothes. If this product can not handle basic sweat and neutralize it what odors will it naturalize?Pros: Easy to UseCons: DID NOT WORK for basic sweat.It seems Downy is good at perfuming clothing with Downy's unstopables, dryer sheets and fabric softener and their Frebreez fabric sprays, but has not mastered odor neutralization. I'll go back to the scented unstopables and leave this product out of my laundry room.  Perhaps it will work for for  very MILD odors like food odors. In which casebasic detergent will take care of that.Update: Gave the product another shot, because I really like the Downy brand: Tried the product again,with the same items but this time I DOUBLED the amount I used. Same results- did not naturalize odor of mild sweat in a medium load of clothes. Nor did it protect additional odors from coming on to the clothing. Wash still came out smelling worse then when I added the clothes.  I will got back to using the Unstopables- that works, this neutralization product did not. Perhaps it will work for others, but it didn't work for me for basic sweat odor.Update 2: Went back to using the  Downy Unstopables and the wash came out PERFECT.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F67QENOBHU9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QEMWNWG#wasThisHelpful","R1F67QENOBHU9A","A3OW12V8O7G5LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OW12V8O7G5LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been drinking coconut water for almost 10 years. I've tried most of the brands out there as well as fresh out of the coconut.  I saw this at my local Whole Foods for over 4.00. I was horrified, at the size and the price. However, I decided to give it a go, because it was in a glass bottle, whichmeans you avoid the negative side effects of an aluminum can and the plastic that most the other coconut waters are package in.I chilled it in my refrigerator and when I was ready to drink I noticed a sluggish sediment at the bottom. NO worries, juices sometimes do that. I drank it up but was so disappointed. The flavor just wasn't there.  The product is from the Philippines but packaged in China. I guess between all of that shipping and the use of the heavy glass bottle the price point shoots far past what is a reasonable price for a coconut water.  I prefer just about any of the other coconut waters out there. My local whole foods carries a RAW coconut water, although in a plastic bottle. I will stick with that.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEJH88OBYE3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWNHILW#wasThisHelpful","R2VEJH88OBYE3R","A3OW12V8O7G5LD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3OW12V8O7G5LD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a must have. These days so many parking deck, elevator, burglaries  and assaults in every area are happening that you need to have this out and on the ready with your hand in your pocket- finger on the trigger.  Too often people buy this, stick it on the key chain and when they need it, they are too disoriented by the situation to grab  it and correctly point it at an attacker.  It's small and fits in your hand easily. I test sprayed it outdoors and its has a nice strong spray. Also don't be affraid to keep one by your home's door. Many people knock on doors saying they are utility workers and security services with phoney attire. So having this as a protectant when letting strangers into your home is a good idea. I once had a legitimate utility worker try to enter my home, when he thought no one was home- as I was slow getting to the door. I saw him turning the knob back and forth. I had to let him in to fix the utility, but I kept my finger on the button, which he could see, but I didn't care!

"I have very thin frames. So this item is far to large for a wire frame. However, I stapled the ear grip hole so that it would stay on the glasses.

Unfortunately, I think you are better off going with the Maxi, rather than the ultra thin if you really need true overnight or heavy protection.

"I drink coconut water on a regular basis. I have tried just about every brand out there including coconut water right out of the coconut.  That's the best way, fresh and raw. Traveling to the Caribbean is where I had my first raw coconut water. However, I have to say that the intense labor of cracking open those coconuts wore me down to using a prepackage product. Wielding and sharp and sturdy cutting tool, even ones made for coconut cutting, just has a risk to you and your countertops that I could do without. I have to say that this canned product actually tastes better than most fresh coconuts.  It's a little sweeter and tastes more coconuty- which is rather unexpected. I would say this brand beats out all the other brands I've tried taste wise.That said, overall nice sweet taste but not super sweet at all. I do wish the can was about half the size.

"Over the years, I have lost count of how many times I've heard that fish oil pills are one of the single most important vitamins you can take. I've added it on and off in my diet for a few reasons: brain function, heart health, joint support, and as an aid in weight loss and inflammation. As with most supplements, I personally can't tell if they are doing what they are supposedly doing.That said, PCNL's offering is at least as good as any other fish oil pills I have ever taken. Having tasted some horrible fish oil burps in the past with other pills, I was a little skeptical with the fact that these do not have an enteric coating. But according to the PCNL's product description, you do not want this coating, and with THESE pills, you no longer need it. They claim that the enteric coating prevents the fish oil from dissolving in your stomach, where it does the most good. Most importantly, they claim that their capsules are highly purified and burpless. A portion of the reviewers from here, say that they disagree with that second claim, but I have only noticed a slightly unpleasant aftertaste just once. So long as I take it in the middle of a meal, I never think about the pill again. Personally, I do not see a reason to get the enteric coated pills ever again, so long as there are no side effects.However I did have two concerns. This product's suggested serving size is two capsules. I wouldn't mind if it were just one, like in other brands. My second concern is about fish oil in general, rather than with this brand. I seem to break out with acne on my face, scalp and the back of my neck a week or so after starting a fish oil or flaxseed oil regimen. As much as I would love to enjoy all the advertised benefits of these pills, I always find myself stopping to see if my acne goes away, and it usually does. Perhaps my genetics make me more susceptible to this, but I want to try it out some more. What do you think?Anyway, thank you for reading! I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product for free, in exchange for an honest review.

"I'm fairly up on nutrition and supplements, but I try to stick to just a few each day. After a multivitamin, magnesium is one of the most highly recommended pills you can add to your diet. A short amount of Googling will turn up plenty of experts who will explain why. One supposed benefit, is that it helps you enjoy a more restful sleep at night. I do sleep pretty restfully, but I couldn't tell you if it was because of these pills.The main reason I have been taking it for the last few years, was to supplement my low-sugar lifestyle, for which it is supposed to be particularly helpful. It is said to reduce levels of sugar in your blood, help keep your fasting blood insulin levels down, and it also helps you regulate your energy levels much better. So I was happy to try a bottle of these pills from PCNL, when they offered a bottle free for review.Do I notice any difference after taking these pills? I don't know haha! As I said, I do sleep well, but I don't know what my energy levels would be like if I weren't taking them. It supposedly helps fight off sugar cravings, and I think I have been doing very well along those lines.Other than that, the packaging was fine, and the pills were of satisfactory quality, but I have the same main complaint that most of the other reviewers here did: I have never taken any vitamin that required 4 horse pills like this! It seems a tad excessive. You DO get 500mg of the magnesium, plus 1000 mg of calcium, which never hurts. But by comparison, Nature Made for example, offers a ONE-a-day soft-gel that grants you 400mg. Granted, that one does not contain calcium, but this is why the 4-pill serving size annoys me.All this said, PCNL delivers a quality product!Thank you for reading- I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product for free, in exchange for an honest review.

"I could not recommend Apple Cider Vinegar any higher!! It has changed my life like nothing else. Re-reading my previous apple cider reviews today, it makes me want to get back to taking the stuff regularly, every day. In truth, I haven't been doing that. However, it has been displayed on my kitchen counter, next to the coffee pot, for five years without exception. I take it about half as often as I would like to, but I still take it several times a week. I ALWAYS remember it, first thing, when my allergies start to creep up, or if there is a nasty virus making the rounds at work.At the first sign of a sore throat, I begin to gargle with ACV (2 teaspoons in a 1/2 cup of water), and it goes away, within hours. It stops any further symptoms, right in their tracks! The key is to hit this bottle right away.Secondly, If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, with plenty of water, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time. If I could remember to do it every single day, I don't think I'd ever get that sniffle to begin with! So for immunity and allergies... this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I've heard about from so many other people.Yes, it still tastes and smells pretty bad, but you are done with all of that in less than 20 seconds. Are you really such a wimp that you can't handle something uncomfortable for as little as 20 seconds, when the results are so obvious?!Thirdly, I love how ACV was able to get rid of the warts I've had on the back of my hands and fingers for years, permanently, in no time at all. All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip) in the ACV, place that on top of the wart, and secure it snugly with a band-aid. Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours. But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure. From my experience, and from a few others whom I've convinced to try this, it works every time. Sometimes a second go is necessary, and I just scratch a little deeper with the pin this time, and that does the trick. This doesn't hurt at all! You are simply scratching the wart's thick outer layer so that the ACV can seep down into the root. Then it dies- good riddance!So, yes, I love and swear by the ACV still. A little research online will turn up dozens and dozens of other useful tricks to try apple cider vinegar on. But just for the three uses I listed alone, I will always keep a bottle on hand. One tip is that everyone says to only buy it if it includes the “mother.” This just means it is unfiltered. In comparison, ACV with the mother will look cloudier, and will need to be shaken before use. Supposedly, this means it is chock full of more nutrients and potency. I don't know if that is true or not, but I've always opted for it just to be safe.In one of my old apple cider vinegar reviews, a commenter accused me of saying all this just to sell bottles of Apple Cider Vinegar, but I am certainly not! This stuff is cheap! There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have that “mother"" in it. I have used 5 different brands over the past 2 years and have noticed no difference one way or the other.So what do you have to lose? My attendance at work has never been better in my entire life.

All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip) in the ACV, place that on top of the wart, and secure it snugly with a band-aid. Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours. But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure. From my experience, and from a few others whom I've convinced to try this, it works every time. Sometimes a second go is necessary, and I just scratch a little deeper with the pin this time, and that does the trick. This doesn't hurt at all! You are simply scratching the wart's thick outer layer so that the ACV can seep down into the root. Then it dies- good riddance!So, yes, I love and swear by the ACV still.

"I'm in love with this balm! I'm a thirty-nine year old man, who has just recently taken to wearing a beard in the past year. I keep it somewhat short, using a 9 to 11 length on my electric razor. Most wizards or kung-fu masters would simply laugh at my short beard, but I feel more mature with it gracing my chin. That said, my somewhat short facial hair is a bit scraggly. Its pretty soft to begin with, but some of the hairs tend to jut out at random intervals, no matter how often I trim it. For a while, I have kept an eye out for some kind of beard wax to smooth it out, or condition it.Enter Mr Rugged Beard Balm. I received an offer to review it, as if they could read my mind! Readily I said YES! I found myself VERY excited when it finally appeared in my mailbox. I tried it right away, and was blown away by the pleasant, manly aroma. It was just as pleasing as the other reviewers had led me to believe! Having read the list of ingredients, I was impressed. Argan Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Olive Oil, Soybean Oil, Beeswax, Wheat Germ Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Cedar Wood Essential Oils... Nothing unnatural at all. I tip my hat to the reviewer that called it “Beard Food.” Hilarious, but that is exactly what it feels like, as you spread it on your hairy face. This ointment is positively refreshing!I've recently began to engage in online dating, and when I go to meet the ladies that catch my interest, I wouldn't dream of leaving the house without a little dab of my new Rugged Beard Balm. I love that fragrance, so much so, that I skip the cologne. All my disobedient cheek hairs fall immediately inline, with softness, and an impressive shine. One concern was that each time you apply it, it almost sparkles like those silly pretty boy vampires in the corny teenager movies. But like chap-stick, that gloss fades after two or three minutes, and looks simply natural.When I first opened the bottle, my first thought was, “This seems great, but once it runs out, I don't know if I would be willing to pay full price for such a tiny bottle.” But having now firmly fallen in love with this product, and having seen how little of it you need per use, I will certainly re-up as soon as this jar is empty! I estimate I can get four or five months of use from each jar.I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product, for free, in exchange for an honest review.

"I think I can honestly say this is the best nose hair trimmer I've ever owned. The previous ones I have owned were typically part of a total grooming shaver kit. But this little guy outperforms them, I think. It only uses one battery, which hasn't died yet, so I can't testify to how often it needs changing. The blades spin quickly, which helps trim the hairs fast on the first pass, every time. It tickles a little bit, but there is no discomfort at all. I haven't needed it on ear hairs yet, so I've only used it for my nose, and for that, it gets the job done quickly and smoothly!There aren't really any cons to this product. Someone mentioned that it came without any instructions, but I can't see what you would need that for. Not everything needs instructions. They put them on Pop-tarts anyway: Remove wrapper, toast them in a toaster, enjoy. If you need a nose hair trimmer, you are an adult, and will be able to operate this device with no difficulty at all. For durability, this trimmer seems fairly sturdy, but as with any trimmer I've ever owned, you probably want to take care not to drop it.I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product, for free, in exchange for an honest review.

"Well, I took this supplement, routinely for a month. I had never taken BCAA's before, nor did I take too many body building supplements in general. I am not an athlete, but I am no stranger to the gym or paying attention to a healthy diet. Usually, I'll have a few protein shakes in my routine, as well as a multivitamin, and some fish oil- That's about it. The product description says, you are unlikely to notice a difference while taking BCAA's, and after my one month trial, I can testify to that.Some reviewers swear that they notice a significant improvement in workout recovery, and a reduction in fatigue. I do a 50/50 weights to cardio workout three times a week, and never really noticed any irregular improvement, but again, the product description says this is normal. Perhaps the effects and benefits are more noticeable for individuals with a more intense exercise regimen, so I'll leave it at that.As far as packaging and presentation, the product seems like it is first rate, and I appreciated that there were no fillers or additives. All in all, for someone with my needs, I don't know if I would recommend  adding BCAA's to your diet. They are a little pricey, and you only have their word to go by, that these pills are at work in your body. I'd rather put the money towards some snazzy sneakers or something like that.I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product, for free, in exchange for an honest review.

"Hey- I'm an avid Amazon reviewer who was offered these bluetooth headphones for free, in exchange for an honest review- so here goes!First off, I love bluetooth headphones for music at the gym. A chord can be such a pain in the butt. I am tall, and sometimes it just isn't long enough, or the wire gets caught in the arms of the elliptical machine and yanks the phone right out of my pocket. Now, these headphones connect wirelessly to the phone, and all those troubles- are a thing of the past! My one remaining problem with chorded headphones, would be the loud rubbing sound that travels up to your ears when the cable scrapes against your neck or clothing. That is still a concern here, mostly when you turn your head. It can still be annoying when you are on a run, but it is a bit improved over traditional headphones.The sound is very nice and crisp. The bluetooth connected to my Samsung Note 4 very easily. I usually don't prefer earbuds to the over-ear style headphones, but these are fairly comfortable. The bright yellow color is a little sportier than my usual style, but I think I am pulling it off! So far, these are performing very well, even though I've only had them for two weeks. I do wish it was a little easier to tell if I turned the headphones off correctly. I'm afraid I'm going to go use them, and they will have run out of juice because I didn't do it right.My only qualm now, is to figure out an ideal fit for my ears. I'm impressed with how many attachments came with these buds, but honestly, I am not sure which ones to use. I've tried a few, and have consistently doubted the way I was putting them in. I think I've got it now, but with so many possible parts, I have yet to feel convinced that I've chosen the right combination.I will update this review if I see any concerns, from durability, to how well they hold a charge, or whatever else may come up. But I've owned Soundpeats before, and they've never given me cause to question their quality.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XVF5T6JMARJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CFEC#wasThisHelpful","R1XVF5T6JMARJS","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This will keep my young male cat busy for a good while. I keep it in a drawer, and when he sees me reach towards that drawer to take it out, he squeals with excitement, and starts jumping up and down. Wet food is the only other thing that gets him this excited. I think he enjoyed it more, back when he was under 10 months, but he still enjoys chasing it around a bit, and will jump up to swing at it when I hold it over him. Every time he catches it, he tries to do an ""alligator death roll,"" which gets him all tangled, like with yarn. After three or four mins, he tends to get tired of chasing it, so I just let him play with it, and then I'll grab it again a few minutes later and we repeat the game.I do wish it was a *little* bit shorter, for when I get him to jump for it, but that is a minor quip. Some people have complained that the fleece string will break eventually, but I've had it for nearly a year and it is still holding up perfectly. Of course, I don't leave it lying around for him to play with all day long. I put it away, so he's always happy every time I break it out. Another reviewer mentioned that this toy could be a choking hazard. I could certainly see that, which is also why I put it away. I try not to leave him unattended with it for too long. When I do leave him alone with it for a few minutes, I'll see him walk by, totally twisted up in the string, with the stick dragging behind. This has never seemed to stress him out, and I simply unwind him, and we play with it again!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R362AAXYXS856X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002DHV16#wasThisHelpful","R362AAXYXS856X","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was totally worth the price! I did a lot of research on litter boxes when I was getting my cat. I have a smaller, one-bedroom apartment, and was determined to get a box that would cut down on the amount of litter all over the carpet. The Clevercat top entry box was EXACTLY what I was looking for. My cat is an 18-month old male, with somewhat long hair. He took to the box right away. He seems to fit in there nicely, and most of the litter stays in the box or on the top tray, when he climbs out. The carpet stays very clean. I still need to vacuum there every now and then, but its WAY better than my experience with previous boxes, including a few automatic types.I use scoopable litter filled about 4 or 5 inches high, and I don't bother with any liners. After every 40 lb bag of litter, I clean the whole box in the tub, and start a fresh bag. I scoop the poop every two or three days as needed. I also recommend using a decent-sized, sturdy, metal scooper in whatever box you purchase. I researched those as well. Everyone said metal was the way to go, and I am thrilled with that choice as well. The plastic scoops break, or worse, they bend and fling the litter and clumps all over. Its worth the few extra bucks.My cat isn't overweight at all, but I worried that the box might be a little too small for him as he got bigger, but I'm not concerned about it at all anymore. He gets in and out like a champ, and never has any problems. I'd only worry about that if your cat had a weight problem. A few people also stated that they could easily make their own littler box like this one, with a rubbermade tub, by cutting a hole in the top. That might work, and you might save a few bucks, but this is really just perfect and easy exactly as it is, and I love the groves on the lid that help the cat shake the extra litter off his paws. I absolutely see myself buying another Clevercat if I ever need another litter box!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4BUCV351NFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002ZS20I#wasThisHelpful","RL4BUCV351NFT","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey- I'm an avid Amazon reviewer who was offered these two cat tunnels for free in exchange for an honest review, so here goes!I had a cat tunnel for my two cats,  years ago, and they LOVED ambushing each other in it. Now I just have one cat, and I wasn't sure he would dig it as much. He's a playful one-year-old boy, and although I'm sure he would prefer to enjoy this tunnel with another cat, he seems to really enjoy it with me. He only really uses the big one. He hides in it, or at least thinks he does. His tail will stick out the end, and when he sees something to ambush, his butt will wiggle and he'll zip on through- What a mighty hunter! Its cute.On the other hand, as I said, he doesn't really bother with the smaller one. His body is longer than it is. If you have some kittens, I could imagine them getting a bigger kick out of that one. He loves the “crinkle” sound as other reviewers have mentioned, but he doesn't really bother with the little toys that hang on the openings. This is because the tunnel tends to roll over, which leaves the toy lying on the ground rather than hanging, tauntingly.All in all, I'd say the tunnel was a hit. I love that it folds up really easily, and you can just slide it under a couch when you have company or need to vacuum. My only other concern would be the non-macho color of the larger tunnel. As I am a single guy, my friends do rib on me a bit for it being so pink, but since this was a generous, free offer- I love the color!Is the list price really $59.99? That certainly doesn't sound reasonable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F14HN338UI4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q2G83K0#wasThisHelpful","R3F14HN338UI4L","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, it has a kickstand. That's what I wanted. But I tossed this case in my closet after a week. One, I couldn't tell from the photo, but it says ""auto focus"" right on the back, below the camera lens. Why?! Samsung hasn't put out a non-autofocus camera phone in a decade, no? My friends all noticed it had a kickstand, so they wanted to check out this case I was ""rocking."" Immediately, they would begin to rib me about ""Auto Focus."" ""How cheesey!"" they would laugh and point.On the good side, the case was nice and thin, and looked pretty slick other than the Auto Focus part. The slick part was actually another problem. It just feels too slick in my hands. You find yourself clasping it VERY firmly to ensure it doesn't slide out of your fingers. I probably should have returned it, but oh well...

"This is probably the happiest I've been with a case, in my life, so far. It feels great, looks really sharp, and stays as thin as I could possibly hope for! The blue back simply pops, and grabs your eye. Just looking at it makes me want to play with my phone even more, if that was possible! My friends have known I've had a Note 4 since it came out, and still they keep asking me if I got a new phone. Most of my fellow Note 4 fans are jealous, which is fun! I love the texture of the back, and the grip on the sides. I love that it still says Samsung on the back.How well does it protect? I couldn't really tell you yet. I've had it for like two months now, but of everyone I know, I am probably the most careful person with his phone. I know I am tempting fate here, but I NEVER drop or crack a phone. (Fingers crossed). That said, the case has held up for these first two months flawlessly. Not a mark on it, and it isn't a lint-magnet like a lot of cases I've tossed in the trash.

(I now notice the description says it is great for hot beverages too)When I use a regular coffee cup, I have this stupid habit of draining the cup, and then absently, I keep grabbing for it, as if their might be one last sip. But there never is. With these glasses, in the same scenario- I don't get let down! I know immediately, that it is time for me to get my butt up and pour another darned cup.A few reviewers were concerned about how thin the glasses are. I have other double-walled glasses, that are also thin like this, and I've only ever broke one. Maybe a little more care might be beneficial, but I don't see any need to go through life in a state of paranoia. It's made from glass. Be careful. No big deal.I am not a huge whiskey drinker, but I do like cream liquors or a good Jack and Coke from time to time. As I grow older and more refined, I will attempt to elevate my tastes to new heights with bourbon, scotch or whiskey. For now, I find myself filling these cups up as soon as they come out of the dishwasher, with whatever I plan to drink. Cheers!I am an avid Amazon reviewer, who was offered this product, for free, in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for reading the whole thing! If you enjoyed my thoughts, or at least felt it was sincere, please give me a “helpful” vote.

"My friend and I had just finished watching Netflix's MARCO POLO season 1, which was very worth while. Last night, we were feeling lost. Where would we go to get our next fix of Asian war and martial arts. That was when we came upon this little hidden gem. It had a solid rating, and sounded funky. We said, ""why the hell not?""We were blown away! The movie seems to be influenced by many different genres, and quickly reminded us of Braveheart meets Robin Hood, but with much more depth and cunning. Many different techniques are at play here as the story unfolds, and you are taken on a rather brutal and involving ride. This movie has gangsta attitude and style without being corny or over-the-top. I can see Quentin Tarantino just drooling in awe of this movie as I was. It even felt like the groovy kind of music he would have used for this film.The fight scenes are vicious and intense. The dialogue is sharp and well-acted. The villain is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie like this. About halfway through this movie, I turned to my friend and told him I will need to see everything this director ever puts out. With hints of the familiar, Yoon Jong-bin has twisted Kundo into something totally fresh, and thrilling.PS- Kundo uses subtitles, which some people turn their noses up about, but I think it is the only way to go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31X52A47JJ9X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD0VANC#wasThisHelpful","R31X52A47JJ9X5","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm 6'4"" and I've regretted getting the S3 instead of a Note for two years now. It hadn't been available, and everyone told me the S3 could do more. It WAS a very good phone, but I have big hands, and REALLY wanted the BIG phone! Finally, I was due for an upgrade last month, and I was at last going to get the Note 4 no matter what! I am solidly in Android and Samsung's corner, so there was no possibility of getting an Apple. Fortunately, all the reviewers have been blown away, and I couldn't agree more! Right out of the box, it fit perfectly in my hand, and the screen looked up at me like a new baby's eyes, and I feel like a proud father. LOL Ok... I'm done being a freak, but this phone has certainly given me a thorough nerdgasm!Pros-Large, BEAUTIFUL screen. Tons of memory- I don't need extra storage.Have a ton of apps open? No problem! This is one strong little computer here!Everything works smooth as could possibly be hoped for!Gorgeous pictures, and stunning video- not that I am big into taking pictures...Charges so FAST! Battery seems to go on and on, no matter what I do all day!I didn't think I would really need the S-pen, but it is so useful when surfing the web and the buttons are small and close together. As a tall guy with big hands, I've quickly learned to appreciate it!Sounds amazing- I can't believe how much the speakers have improved just since the S3. I have a bit of hearing loss from when I was a kid, and this new phone has been a blessing for that as well!The whole phone just feels perfect. Sturdy. Nice weight. I simply can't seem to put it down!Concerns-1. The Samsung stock keyboard is still a bit wonky to me. Fortunately, it comes with Swype, which is all I used on my S3, despite being a huge RAM hog. I just finished trying the Samsung swiftflow keyboard for a week, and it works ok, but now I'm hoping Swype will prove even better. I tend to lean towards trace keyboards, since again, I do have big hands, and this helps me not hit three or four keys at a time.2. Shopping for cases, I was surprised to learn that the Verizon Note 4's have their microphone slightly to the side of where the Note 4's from other carriers do. Checking the comments on various cases, I saw that Verizon users frequently found their microphone hole covered by the case. Many of the descriptions of the cases said, ""For AT&T, Tmobile, and Sprint only."" I have no idea what the reason was for this design choice- perhaps so more people would buy the cases directly from Verizon instead of Amazon? Not cool.3. Speaker on the back. This just doesn't make sense. I am tired of handing my phone to someone so they can watch a video, and needing to tell them to cup their hand around the back of the phone so they can hear it. The speaker should absolutely be on the front by now, like some other phone brands have done. I can't think of one reason why its better on the back.4. I still have to deal with all the ignorant iPhone 6 plus users at work. When Apple didn't have a phablet, they scrunched up their noses and said, ""Who would want a phone that big?"" Then they rushed out to get the 6 plus, and act like it comes close to the Note 4's glory! Go get bent! Oh wait... your phone beat you to it! LOLConclusion-This phone feels like my S3 ran into a Genie and became the best phone I could have imagined. I usually wait when buying the latest new phone, so they can get the bugs and kinks out, but I was the first person I know to get it in my area, and I haven't noticed any! Go buy this with no reservations!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KDFU2LNDOT3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NKRDCFA#wasThisHelpful","R2KDFU2LNDOT3A","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My girlfriend and I are absolutely thrilled with these! First of all, they are re-usable, which is a huge step up from what we were using. Just hand wash them when you are done. The cupcakes bake perfectly in them without spray or anything, and they pop out easily. Everyone loved the colorful appearance the treats make in these liners. We didn't even think about using them on a regular cookie pan like another reviewer recommended. That sounds like the way to go, since that would be easier to clean than actual muffin trays if any batter spills on the sides. How many more reasons do ya need?

"Wow! I almost feel unworthy of this amazing press!So, I love garlic, but I've always just used the minced, jarred stuff. But this made me want to step up my game. With this well-crafted device you can't help but want to add fresh garlic to everything! And why not? It definitely tastes better than the jarred stuff I was existing on.Stainless steel, dishwasher safe, very comfortable grip. Its super easy to use and super easy to clean. I never bought a press, because the other ones I used didn't seem to work or clean easily, but now I have no excuses not to use fresh, flavorful garlic enthusiastically.I can't imagine I will ever need another, since this one is ultimate!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGXI7R8FDUY6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KM9W2PU#wasThisHelpful","RGXI7R8FDUY6M","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alright... First, here is the disclaimer. XBOOM offered me this speaker free-of-charge in exchange for an honest review, so I readily accepted. If I didn't like it, I would have contacted them privately and told them that, ""I appreciated their offer, but I didn't think THEY would appreciate my review."" I've always preferred to say nothing at all, if I can't say something nice in these situations. Fortunately for all involved- This speaker is dynamite!Immediately, I loved the design of this little guy. It looks really cool. I thought of the thermal detonator from Return of the Jedi, when I first held it in my hand. It's tiny and weighs next to nothing, but it's really sturdy, and the sound far exceeded my expectations! (So far, I've used it for 3 months, but of course, I will update this review if it fails to last the test of time.) Hooked up to my Samsung S3, the bass and clarity easily stand toe-to-toe with many of the more pricey units I've tried over the past few years. It easily fills a small room and grabs a lot of attention. I primarily use this speaker at work, but with this great price, I am ready to grab another to keep in my bedroom, for while I fold clothes or get ready for work.The rechargeable battery lasts so long, it feels like I never have to plug it in! As another reviewer mentioned, it would be way more convenient if it used Micro USB for charging instead of Mini, since nothing else I have uses a Mini plug. I love the way the little audio chord tucks under the unit when you are done with it. The length is perfect. Also, I appreciate that you can string more little speakers to your XBOOM, if you'd like to really ramp up the sound. Finally, the only unnecessary thing I found was the volume knob. Since I prefer to use my phone's volume control, I always turn this knob to max, and it can be slightly annoying when you slide the volume down by accident, when you handle the speaker for just a second. Minor critiques aside, this is an awesome little sound bomb, period. I think similar speakers for twice this price, would have a hard time keeping up with the XBOOM!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31TTVZEZ48NL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082E9K7U#wasThisHelpful","R31TTVZEZ48NL0","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alright... First, here is the disclaimer. I toyed with the idea of getting one of these for a while, but had decided I didn't really need it enough to drop some cash. But, OXA offered me this one for free in exchange for an honest review, so I readily accepted.If I didn't like it, I would have contacted them privately and told them that I appreciated the offer, but I didn't think THEY would appreciate my review. I've always preferred to say nothing at all, if I can't say something nice in these situations. Fortunately for all involved- I love it! Even with outlets all over my home and office, I found this portable charger terribly handy!I can relax with my device charging, wherever I want, without being tethered to a wall or the USB port on a computer. In the past, when a group of my friends came over and we hung out in my living room, somebody always wanted to borrow my charger, because their phone was dead. If I or someone else also needed it, this was a pain. Now, I place the OXA charger on my coffee table with two chords and we can still look things up and check our messages while two phones charge pretty quickly! Then, when we all go out for the evening, one of the girls might borrow it in her purse, and any of us can take turns if our battery get dangerously low. The unit is capable of charging at least three phone batteries, before needing to be charged itself. A lot of my friends said they also passed on getting one of these chargers in the past, but now we are all pretty impressed. I predict some of them will purchase one soon.This unit has a great price, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy or recommend one, now that I know how useful and convenient it is! The indicator lights work well, and its nice to have the built-in flashlight. The charger is nicely compact and seems very durable, however, I won't hesitate to update this review should it not last the test of time. One thing I wasn't impressed with was the free USB chord and its interchangeable plug adapters. By the second use, the plug that fits my S3 bent, and would fall out of the phone unless you held it up in place. Fortunately, this didn't really affect me since I have extra chords around the house. Also, if they were serious about that feature, I would provide a little storage compartment on the unit itself, so people wouldn't lose the four little attachments. Just a thought. As I said though, this feature didn't really affect my uses for this charger, so I am still very happy.

"Ah- The adventures of Chad Stone! I guess I'm not quite middle-aged yet, but I did just go through a devastating divorce, and Chad gave me a great overview of the challenges and excitement available for me once I got back into the dating scene. Some times he was a putz, and sometimes he could pull off a brave success. The most important message was to put yourself out there, dust yourself off, and try again. And again.The author hits the bar scene and delves into online dating, and this book is his journal. He tries, he fails, he shares. He tries again, and learns how to succeed, and you learn with him, while enjoying his very amusing experiences. I loved his writing style, during which, he would frequently pause to share one of his 92 ""Babe Magnet"" rules, and then share how he learned it. Frankly, it all makes what could be the outline of a great sit-com!I wouldn't say it turned me into a babe magnet, but I love online dating now, and I don't worry so much about my disasters and set backs. There are a lot of women out there, and it may take time to find the best one for you. Think about what you could have done better last time, and how to make yourself magnetic to the type of girl you want to attract. Edit your the list of things you want in a girl, then, keep getting back on the horse. Not all of Chad's story struck a chord with me perfectly, but most of it did, and his tale kept me turning pages. I was rooting for him, hoping he'd find the girl of his dreams.

The action is smooth. There are a ton of characters, with too many moves to memorize. Some are old favorites that were a blast to rediscover. We printed up a few copies of all their moves from the internet, and we all ended up being able to hold our own, using various styles.

"This is a gripping documentary with no words. Just stunning cinematography. See our planet like never before. Samsara weaves between many different topics and gorgeous locations to paint a picture like no other! It will leave you in awe. It will horrify you as well. Either way, I don't see how you can leave this experience unchanged.A few of my friends kept asking me, ""Where is this?"" when the camera turned to a new location, and never tells you where we are. ""On the Planet Earth,"" seems to be the only answer. Its fun to guess, but I like that you can say that the world has these wonderful places, rather than that a specific country or continent does. On the flip-side, when the film shows you disasters from around the globe, it doesn't let you simply dismiss it as, ""That country's problem."" Instead, Samsara paints some universal problems for us all to work on.If you enjoy the beauty and uniqueness of our planet as shown in this film, you will realize we need to address the absurdity of neglect. Some of my friends felt sadness or despair, because they didn't know how to fix the problems themselves. At times, the enormity of a problem can seem daunting to an individual, but I find tremendous hope with the fact that more people are learning about these concerns. I especially feel that children need to see Samsara. Perhaps a few of them will grasp a way to fix one of those concerns in the future. Perhaps someone will rise to a position where they can address some of those concerns, and the viewers of this film will recognize the need to support that effort. Then we can all go back to playing video games, I suppose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJ26IPBSMHAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008N9AAQ4#wasThisHelpful","R3HJ26IPBSMHAR","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Think America has ""the best health care in the world?"" This film would be my first answer to that claim! This was recorded during the heat of the American healthcare debate, back in 2009, and it shows how the insurance and medical industries have some major flaws that need MAJOR repair. I had this debate with many right-wingers, and bought this film to loan out to anyone who needed a bigger picture. This film doesn't take sides. It just shows a lot of problems, which every concerned American should be aware of. Sadly, even though it didn't have Michael Moore's name attached to it in any way, and it wasn't too long, most warily viewed this documentary as lefty propaganda and didn't want to sit still for its urgent message. (Perhaps they needed more flashy special effects?)How can you have an intelligent healthcare discussion, when you only bring Fox News' points to the table?I also purchased, FRONTLINE: Sick Around The World, which I consider the sequel of this. It shows what OTHER countries are doing wrong and right. I thought that dvd was even better, and would have loved to pick out dozens of practices used in other nations that would beautifully solve some of the gaping flaws in our own system. Between the two shows, I am convinced we need ""single-payer"" or ""universal"" healthcare for all Americans. Even if you don't agree, I think everyone should understand these complaints and proposals before opening their mouths. Instead, most will call it ""Social"" medicine and run away in terror. Be brave. Get the WHOLE picture. THEN run away, if you must.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EBXYIHXX87A1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UW59L2#wasThisHelpful","R1EBXYIHXX87A1","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Planet Earth, and consider it one of the best films for nature/wildlife. This three-part series did the same for me with nature/geography. I had no problem with the narrator at all, but I can see where geography wouldn't keep some people awake as easily as exotic animals might. Amazing Planet is an amazing investigation of lava, magma, seas, and the power of wind, water and ice. I learned about our planet on many levels I wasn't aware of before, and I think its important for others to grasp it as well- especially in the wake of the Ken Ham and Bill Nye Creationist debate a few weeks ago. When you take in this whole picture, you will likely understand the world and science's ability to decipher it much more clearly than you did before.Perhaps it boils down to a matter of taste. I have not seen other documentaries focused on geography, that are this beautifully crafted. The three episodes covered the array of forces that continue to systematically mold our planet, with beautiful footage that kept me glued from beginning to end, with no critiques.

"I could not recommend Apple Cider Vinegar any higher!! It has changed my life like nothing else! Re-reading my previous review today, makes me want to get back to taking the stuff regularly every day again, but in truth I haven't been doing that. However, it has been displayed on my kitchen counter without exception now, for the whole time, right next to my coffee pot! I take it about half as often as I would like to, but I still take it several times a week, and I always remember it first thing, when my allergies start to creep up, or there are colds going around at work or in the family.At the first sign of a sore throat, I begin to gargle with ACV (2 teaspoons in a 1/2 cup of water), and it goes away, very quickly, with no hint of further symptoms. If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time. If I could remember to do it every single day, I don't think I'd ever get that sniffle to begin with! So for immunity and allergies... this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I've heard about from so many others. Yes, it still tastes and smells pretty bad, but you are done with all of that in less than 20 seconds. Are you really such a wimp that you can't handle something minorly uncomfortable for as little as 20 seconds, when the results are so undeniable?!Thirdly, I love how ACV can get rid of the warts I've had on the backs of my hands and fingers for years, permanently, in no time at all. All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip), place that on top of the wart, and secure it snuggly with a band-aid. Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours. But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure. From my experience, and from a few others whom I've convinced to try this, it works at least 90% of the time, or 100% of the time if they need to do it again a second time with a little bit of deeper scratching from the pin. This doesn't hurt! All you are doing is scratching the wart's thick outer layer so that the ACV can seep down into the root.So, yes, I love and swear by the ACV very strongly still, even if just for those three uses, at the least. Others have worried that I am just saying all this to sell bottles of Apple Cider Vinegar, but I am certainly not! I'll happily repeat... this stuff is cheap! There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have ""the mother"" in it. I've used 5 different brands over the past 2 years and have noticed no difference other than if one brand was cheaper than the other! So what do you have to lose? My attendance at work has been better than ever in my entire life, and I am now using my sick days for personal days off instead, or else I get a check at the end of the year because I didn't need to use them- I couldn't be happier!Meanwhile, for weight-loss, and cholesterol, please read this review I've written:http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview#R27BJFRZFPX2XXI've given up sugar a month and a half ago, and lost 31 pounds (I still would like to lose another 30). The author calls it a diet, but it has changed my life already in so many ways in addition to the weight loss! I've learned that I have a dreadful addiction to sugar, and some people may not have as big a problem with it as I do, but sugar has zero benefit, and giving it up, while increasing fiber, has been nothing less than an exceptional experience! I think my ACV use has complimented my results as well! I'm not saying that you need to buy this book, but if you've think you might be addicted to sugar and cheap carbs too, I highly recommend you research what giving up sugar can do for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZG7VVA6O0IPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSBHOBY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZG7VVA6O0IPL","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

One tip is that everyone says to only buy it if it includes the “mother.” This just means it is unfiltered. In comparison, ACV with the mother will look cloudier, and will need to be shaken before use. Supposedly, this means it is chock full of more nutrients and potency. I don't know if that is true or not, but I've always opted for it just to be safe.In one of my old apple cider vinegar reviews, a commenter accused me of saying all this just to sell bottles of Apple Cider Vinegar, but I am certainly not! This stuff is cheap! There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have that “mother"" in it. I have used 5 different brands over the past 2 years and have noticed no difference one way or the other.So what do you have to lose? My attendance at work has never been better in my entire life. I am now using my sick days for “personal” days off instead, or else I get a check at the end of the year because I simply didn't need to use them. I couldn't be happier!

"I could not recommend Apple Cider Vinegar any higher!! It has changed my life like nothing else! Re-reading my previous review today, makes me want to get back to taking the stuff regularly every day again, but in truth I haven't been doing that. However, it has been displayed on my kitchen counter without exception now, for the whole time, right next to my coffee pot! I take it about half as often as I would like to, but I still take it several times a week, and I always remember it first thing, when my allergies start to creep up, or there are colds going around at work or in the family.At the first sign of a sore throat, I begin to gargle with ACV (2 teaspoons in a 1/2 cup of water), and it goes away, very quickly, with no hint of further symptoms. If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time. If I could remember to do it every single day, I don't think I'd ever get that sniffle to begin with! So for immunity and allergies... this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I've heard about from so many others. Yes, it still tastes and smells pretty bad, but you are done with all of that in less than 20 seconds. Are you really such a wimp that you can't handle something minorly uncomfortable for as little as 20 seconds, when the results are so undeniable?!Thirdly, I love how ACV can get rid of the warts I've had on the backs of my hands and fingers for years, permanently, in no time at all. All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip), place that on top of the wart, and secure it snuggly with a band-aid. Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours. But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure. From my experience, and from a few others whom I've convinced to try this, it works at least 90% of the time, or 100% of the time if they need to do it again a second time with a little bit of deeper scratching from the pin. This doesn't hurt! All you are doing is scratching the wart's thick outer layer so that the ACV can seep down into the root.So, yes, I love and swear by the ACV very strongly still, even if just for those three uses, at the least.

I don't know if that is true or not, but I've always opted for it just to be safe.In one of my old apple cider vinegar reviews, a commenter accused me of saying all this just to sell bottles of Apple Cider Vinegar, but I am certainly not! This stuff is cheap! There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have that “mother"" in it. I have used 5 different brands over the past 2 years and have noticed no difference one way or the other.So what do you have to lose? My attendance at work has never been better in my entire life. I am now using my sick days for “personal” days off instead, or else I get a check at the end of the year because I simply didn't need to use them. I couldn't be happier! Cheers!Please use my comment section to let me know what you think or ask any questions. I've read plenty about ACV, and would be happy to discuss with ya!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWSSDJ8KG5OW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00117YTBC#wasThisHelpful","R2IWSSDJ8KG5OW","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here's my story. When reading a review of any health book, I like to know where the reviewer is coming from, and where they are trying to go. I am 38 years old, 6'4"", and weigh 296 lbs. I'm what you might call a ""big feller."" I am no stranger to the gym. While I have no problem quickly putting on muscle, I'd really like to get down to 240. However, whether I am focusing on weights, cardio, or both, my gut stays pretty much right where it is. I've tried Atkins, Forks Over Knives, South Beach, and cutting calories over the years, but found those diets too restrictive for me to commit to for long stretches. I did learn quite a bit though.""When digested, sugar is stored as body fat."" That sentence finished the first paragraph of this book's introduction. Some people might say, ""Well, duh!"" but for me, a HUGE light turned on when I started reading the SOS Diet. I was able to quickly zero-in on what my true problem was. Sugar addiction. Cookies, candy bars, donuts or cakes- I've NEVER been able to say no! Not to mention how sugar is hidden in just about every packaged product you buy. The author cuts right to the chase, keeping his message and suggestions very simple. I know diabetics cannot have sugar, and I've known a few people who have tried to eliminate all carbs with the Atkins Diet only to give up after weeks or a month. But I've never known anyone else to focus on giving sugar up. After reading this book, I can see how sugar has been controlling my life, and how gratifying it will feel to cut it out. The first chapter is full of success stories from people that sound just like me! By the end of page 47, the doctor's simple method had taught me enough to start, and I was psyched enough to begin that next morning. The rest of the book cemented the importance of this life change, and gave great suggestions to help make it happen.Chapter 7 is titled, ""Sugar Substitutes... Are They Safe? Yes, Yes and More Yes!"" I'm not going to lie. I am not totally sold on this one. I used to love Crystal Light, for example, but I gave it up after reading and hearing a lot of negative accusations aimed at aspartame. A few other reviewers have similar misgivings, but the author is surely correct when he says that sugar substitutes are much better for you than refined sugar. I don't drink soda or diet soda, and sugar substitutes usually taste too sweet for me. But perhaps I can try Crystal Light again, or a peanut butter sandwich with sugar-free jelly as an occasional treat when I need a little something.Dr. Sorrell also devoted 15 pages of this short book, to convincing us to never do a ""colon cleanse,"" and to avoid all tobacco. These two chapters initially annoyed me. I felt they detracted from the lean-and-mean core message of this simple diet book, and I've never been likely to try either one. But he IS a doctor who is concerned about health issues, and colons ARE his specialty, so I can see why ANY doctor would use an opportunity like his first book to give out ALL of his favorite advice to the world at once. It just shows me that everything he says in his book, is exactly what he believes can improve his readers' lives.One thing I loved, was that he didn't condemn things such as pizza or fast food, like I had anticipated. He just showed how to make improvements to what you would normally eat. He admits that he will even cheat now and then, himself. Occasionally, he'll eat real ice cream in the summer if sugar-free isn't available. He sometimes enjoys french fries with some fried fish. (He didn't want the reader to tell anyone this little secret, but here I am. Sorry Jim!) The point is, each person can make smarter choices, wherever they go, by picking items with lower sugar and higher fiber. It is up to you to decide if a little cheating is worth it. Some reviewers here said that cheating once, a holiday for example, led them to a total downward spiral back into their old sugar addiction. For me, that sounds like the real threat.I also understood the author's focus on fiber. He says to avoid things like white rice, potatoes, white bread and white flour. I visited my doctor yesterday and decided to mention this plan. He absolutely agreed with eliminating sugar, but believed ALL carbs were the enemy- especially wheat, whole or otherwise. I am aware there is concern over gluten, and I've seen the book, Wheat Belly. But I went shopping last night, only to find that it is extremely difficult to find carbs without wheat flour, here at my store in South Carolina. The author mentions that whole grain is better than whole wheat, but it is clear he is a fan of many whole wheat products. He recommends them repeatedly. Being allowed to have whole wheat does make things easier, since you are left with more food options, but it is obvious that many people take issue with that. I would have appreciated if Sorrell had devoted a few pages to this controversial topic, but for now, I will eat wheat sparingly. I'd still enjoy some bread or pasta once in a while, and I can switch to the occasional light beer, instead of my regular, wheat beer.Another topic I wished the doctor had delved into, was ""sugar addiction,"" and what it feels like to suddenly give up the granules- cold turkey. I have since read several articles about this, in order to get more perspective. One author posed this question: ""What would you do if you came home, and discovered a plate of homemade chocolate chip cookies sitting on the table?"" Could you ignore them if you weren't hungry? Could you stop at one or two, or would those cookies become the primary focus of your attention? Personally, I wouldn't even be able to get to the milk first, without eating 2 or 3, and then once I did have my milk... Armageddon! Don't even get me started on ""Girl Scout cookie season."" I'm convinced that this is a total addiction for someone like myself, complete with the shame. Many people have written about sugar withdrawal symptoms on sugar-cutting message boards. (Yes, I've read forums about cutting sugar. They are actually pretty inspiring!) Many confess to overwhelming tiredness, unrelenting headaches, waves of depression, and other strong physical and psychological ailments- For a few days to several weeks. Perhaps some of them were just experiencing caffeine withdrawal, since they were simply not drinking their usual amounts of soda, tea or coffee. I know all about caffeine withdrawal, and I've been drinking just my 2 cups of coffee like always. Even so, I've had a persistent headache for the last 3 days, and I have been lethargic and irritable at times. Its going to be worth it though, and truthfully, it hasn't been too hard so far. When I am feeling discouraged, I just remind myself, ""When digested, sugar is stored as body fat.""Anyway- I hope you like long reviews! If you've made it this far, and if you are interested:Please check the comment section!!I will update my progress here in a about a month, and then again every once in a while. I like when other reviewers do that, because it shows how easy or hard a diet is to stick with. The SOS Diet is a short and simple plan in a short and simple book. So, if you now think you might be addicted to sugar, just like me, this is a very enjoyable way to educate yourself in just a night or two. I feel more inspired than I have in ages! -DD","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27BJFRZFPX2XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982560184#wasThisHelpful","R27BJFRZFPX2XX","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm kinda new to the world of UFC. Just to hang out, I've started to go with my friends from work to see the matches at a bar every few weeks. To my surprise, I've really begun to enjoy it! However, I don't really know all the fighters, or their history, or even some of how UFC works. So, I picked out this DVD, first, hoping it would give me a much better overview.I absolutely loved it! Two of my friends joined me on the couch for what we thought was going to be a an hour-and-a-half of merely cool clips, but we quickly found ourselves on the edge of our cushions. This amazing highlight reel actually lasted much longer than expected (not sure how long). It felt like 3 hours, but we never wanted it to end. The three of us, with beer and pizza in hand, just sat there oooooing, ahhhhhhing and groaning with sympathy for every crunch and splat. By the end, we all had new respect for the UFC. We knew the key fighters much better and had a list of personal favorites, yet we were still hungry for more highlights!Disk two had a bunch of ""best fights of the year,"" but we didn't necessarily enjoy them as much as the highlight reel. They were definitely some of the best fights I've seen, but these were all combatants who were perfectly matched, so they almost all went the distance. As a result, you get some of the most uncomfortably bloody matches of 2012, which was a little more gruesome than expected. (Don't worry- I'll be okay!) I was surprised at how many fights from the highlight reel got stopped after a few key shots, but with most of these *full* matches, the fighters just battered each others' faces into hamburger meat and the ref never ended the fight. When you watch nothing but matches like these, it can feel way more brutal than the UFC norm, so as a result, we all preferred the highlights way more than the complete fights.Having watched this set, I already feel like I can talk more intelligently about the sport with my friends, and I've even started to win more free glasses of beer when we all bet on the big matches! I plan to pick up a few more of these ""Best of"" sets for my collection, so I can lend them out or pop them on the TV when we are just chillin' at my place. The three of us have been raving about Best of 2012 to our other friends and coworkers, so I'm sure we'll fill my couch when I pick up the Best of 2011!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J5U1Q60GWDUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATP24W8#wasThisHelpful","R1J5U1Q60GWDUO","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was shocked at some of the low scores this film was getting here, so I felt compelled to voice my opinion and debate some of the complaints I'd read:Some people felt this film was too depressing or that the science was too basic, but Planet Ocean was crafted to define and showcase the severity of our marine situation. If you viewed the bonus, making-of features, the director explained that he is trying to boost awareness, and educate people from around the world. Many of whom, haven't heard the concerns of climate control or pollution before, like we have. Many people around just don't realize what is at stake. The footage is beautiful and sometimes terrifying, but that keeps even the least scientific-minded among us from changing the channel. This wasn't meant to be ""Blue Planet II.""A few complained about that jab on religion, spoken in the film's closing. It is not meant to be offensive or to convert you to a different spiritual view, except to point out that the damage we have been doing to the oceans cannot be averted by prayer. We have to take drastic effort as a species, to keep our world running smoothly. It's the only way we will be able to enjoy the world we love for generations to come. One scary issue is that much of the world's population believes our world is going to end anyway, so why should we concern ourselves? Because WE caused the situation- not the Devil. WE have to become the stewards of nature, because God is NOT going to do it for us, like some mother who still folds her children's laundry even though they are grown-up enough to do it themselves.I love documentaries like this and HOME, which I also consider 5 stars. I don't find these films depressing, ultimately. The point is that we are getting the word out finally. By all means, ask questions- have an argument! Just don't ignore it, or stick your head in the sand!Some people found the film to be too political, but let me ask you this... Do you think it is wrong that Japan still harpoons whales? Do you think it was brilliant that America and other countries agreed to outlaw the practice of whaling? We had almost wiped out every species of whale on the planet, from all oceans, permanently. But we recognized that we'd gone too far, and so we took action. This was despite the fact that many people counted whaling as their livelihood.Now we've gone too far once again- with pollution and over-fishing! Whales weren't saved by God or by Americans joining in some kind of group hug. We educated ourselves, we debated with each other, and we made hard choices. I believe in progress, and we can CERTAINLY take better care of our Oceans than we have been.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZDMY85HNDLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBAGF0W#wasThisHelpful","R1KZDMY85HNDLK","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a serious PC Gamer and an avid Web Surfer. That being said, I can only compare this mouse to the last few I've had.First of all, the new tilt wheel...I love and highly promote *wheel* mice, but this new *tilt* wheel is awful. The ability to tilt/scroll left and right is something I haven't found myself needing anywhere as much as scrolling up and down, but it is a feature I don't mind on my mouse either way. However... THIS new Microsoft tilt wheel suffers from a major flaw. The wheel shifts up and down ON ITS OWN from time to time. Only a little bit, but enough to really tick me off- I'll go to click on something, and the wheel, with its weird 'rubberiness' will shift a little and move the page a smidge. It drives me insane.While surfing, it can be annoying. While playing a first-person shooter game, where it will randomly switch you to your next weapon, it can make your blood boil! I even exchanged it for a new one at the store, to see if I just had a defective one, but the replacement had the same problem. It looks like it needs more work.Optical-wise, it's decent. It is not my FIRST optical mouse, and I can't tell if it is better then my LAST Microsoft optical mouse.Wireless-wise, it is my first. I can really get used to the chord's absence, but I have the unshakeable impression that it isn't as reliable as I need it to be during my online frag-fests.Ergonomically, I haven't had a much more comfortable mouse.In short, if they fix the tilt wheel it would be a decent everyday mouse. But as a serious gamer, I intend to return it for a 4-button, non-tilting, optical, wheel mouse with a chord.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SSOZCVTE01SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AOWW9#wasThisHelpful","R3SSOZCVTE01SA","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those series that are far from perfect, but are really fun and quick to read. Brust has become a favorite author of mine because of his entertaining plot style, and Vlad has become a favorite character because of his entertaining methods.What really helped in drawing me into this series is the way that Brust jumps around in the timeline of Vlad's life... The second book takes place before the first book, and third book takes place after books one, two and four etc... Much in the style of Pulp Fiction, Brust jumps back and forth in time, fleshing out these interesting stories that were only hinted at previously, leaving us with plenty of mysteries, and no clue where we will be taken to next. If he had told the whole story in chronological order, it probably would have been much less interesting.My one problem with Vlad's character is that he is too much like a human-Swiss-army-knife. He is an assassin. He is a detective. He is a thief. He is a mob captain. He knows witchcraft. He knows sorcery. He is a master knife-thrower. He is an ace with a rapier. Perhaps its just my nit-picking nature showing through, but its a bit much to swallow even for a fantasy novel. Still, you'll probably find that Brust holds all this mud together quite well!Taltos, is book four in the Vlad Taltos Series, and it was thankfully much better than the third book, which was a bit of a dud. I recommend reading Jhereg, then Yendi, and then this book. Its a good ride!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOIWJHNIURCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441182003#wasThisHelpful","R2OOIWJHNIURCM","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very intriguing book. For a long time now, I've had a feeling that caffeine was not so good for you. I've been reading Men's Health magazine, regularly, and every issue seems to have two or three blurbs about why coffee is either bad or good for you. It seems like every study comes up with new evidence for one case or the another. Contradiction after contradiction.So, I was dying for a good book to give me some facts. I saw this one in the library, and scooped it up. I tried to be open-minded and skeptical at the same time, as I usually do when I read one-sided books like this, but I really became alarmed as I turned more pages. What Cherniske has to say really rings true, so I followed his advice and gave up the bean, and as he promised, I felt MUCH better once my withdrawal pains eased off. The biggest improvements were in my energy level, and the quality of sleep. I felt fully alert and ready to go as soon as I woke up every morning- without a single cup!The most compelling statement he makes is that it will take about eight weeks of no caffeine to truly feel the benefits of its absence. Then he asks, ""What do you have to lose?"" If after two months of no coffee you don't feel a lot better, go back to drinking it for all we care. However, you'll be amazed at how hard it is to quit caffeine for two months. After two or three days, you will get some really hairy headaches unless you wean yourself off it slowly. And just try to walk by a coffee shop or the flavored coffee display in the grocery store without getting the shakes as soon as that old familiar aroma hits you.Anyway, if you try to quit, you'll have no doubt that this is one powerful drug, and when you get those headaches, you can feel how bad it must be for your body.-The only problem I have with this book, is that it was published in 1998, and there is no updated version, or newer books on the subject, and even Cherniske's website hasn't been updated in ages. Meanwhile, I still see plenty of new pro-coffee research articles in health magazines and such, and I *still* get the cravings every now and then, and I have to wonder how bad could one cup be now and then, or every two days or so? My will power is beginning to buckle here, and I could use some positive reinforcement despite the benefits I've felt. The pressure is pretty strong!How about it Steve? We need you to refute these new claims!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVU351W1NURNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446673919#wasThisHelpful","RVU351W1NURNU","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Martin is my favorite author, but Fevre Dream wasn't really up my alley. I figured that since I loved Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, a similar novel by George would have to be at least as good. Maybe I just had my hopes up too high for this one. It was still decent, but I couldn't help but feel that Interview just had it outclassed on so many levels.My main problem with this book, was the same problem I had with Dying of the Light... the pacing. It was just very slow. Maybe I'm just a shallow reader who needs more action in his literature. The Song of Ice and Fire novels, Tuf Voyaging, Armageddon Rag, and almost all of his short stories were simply outstanding, so I'm having a little trouble putting my finger on any other reasons why I didn't like this book.However, as you can tell by its rating, it certainly has it's fans here, so I'll end off just by saying that if you didn't care for Dying of the Light, you probably won't care for this one either, and visa versa. Its out of print in the US, so just get it from the library if you must read it, then buy it only if you liked it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2004","http://www.amazon.com/review/R276QPVSGJ2THR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671431854#wasThisHelpful","R276QPVSGJ2THR","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***One of the TWO best books I read in 2003***My favorite author, George R. R. Martin, recommended this book on his website, so I grabbed the audiobook off the shelf at the library. It, in turn, grabbed my attention right away. It was excellent! I've never found myself making up so many excuses to go driving!I can tell that Martin was inspired by this book. Tyrion, one of his most famous characters from A GAME OF THRONES (an amazing fantasy novel), most certainly was based in part on Claudius, for they are rather similar.Of course, it also helped that I am a huge fan of the Roman Empire: Historical fiction novels, History Channel, Roman History classes in college, or whatever I can get my eyes and ears on. So I guess this book was simply up my alley, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone with similar interests.-Next in the series is Claudius the God, and I plan on reading it soon.-Also, if you consider yourself a true fan of this book, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on a copy of the 1975 Masterpiece Theater Miniseries of I CLAUDIUS, produced by the BBC. You might think its a little corny or outdated, but you should definitely give it a try. I found it at the library, and tore through all 7 tapes recklessly, and ended up quite entertained.

Wintrow was shaping up to be my favorite character in this big door-stopper of a novel, but as time goes on, the poor kid just gets his face rubbed in the doo-doo over and over again.

He needs an adult!As I write this, I can't help but recall how she did the same thing to poor Fitz-Chivalry in Farseer.

"This fifth book in the series, was probably my least favorite, but it was still well worth the read as far as I'm concerned. (I haven't read the two prequels yet, however) The Foundation Series' setting and Asimov's style just seems to be right up my alley. I've thoroughly enjoyed every Asimov story I've read so far!One of my favorite aspects of the original trilogy, was how Asimov told us a tale from one generation, and then he skipped ahead to tell us another tale from the next generation. Its a complete novella or short story for each Psycho-historical crisis, and then on to the next. Now in Foundation and Earth, as in Foundation's Edge, we are presented with a straight forward novel-styled book. This didn't quite grab me as much as the original trilogy did, but as I've said, I simply enjoy the Foundation setting. It was still enough to keep me turning pages anxious to see what happened next.I have no clue why this book is out-of-print. Did the publishers dislike it? Did they just not like the direction it took the series? Did they want F&E's ending out of the way to make room for the new direction in the newer Foundation books written by the ""Killer B's,"" which were written after Asimov's death? I didn't read those books yet either, and since they didn't get such hot reviews, I may not read them ever. Oh well.If the low average rating here on Amazon has you wary, you can always try to get it from a library. No need to waste your money on a potentially bad book.

"A year ago, I read Sharon Kay Penman's Here Be Dragons, and thought it was outstanding, and said as much in my review. I was anticipating that Falls The Shadow would be the next of her books I would read, but then I got an email from her publisher, thanking me for the great review- Would I consider reviewing this, her new book, if they sent me a free reviewing copy? Given how much I loved the last book, I was MORE than happy to accept.So there you have it... this review may be a little biased. However, had I not liked the book, I'd not have ended up reviewing it. And while I don't quite feel that this is a five-star book, I cannot deny that it was a very enjoyable read!All the other reviews describe what the book is about, so I will just speak my mind instead...It was mentioned that this novel might be more enjoyable if you had read the two previous ""Queen's Man"" novels first. While I can see how that could certainly be true, in my opinion, it stood on its own quite well. A few exceptions might be the Claudine/Justin relationship, and the few cameo appearances from characters who must have been friends/helpers of Justin in the first two tales. These threads served little purpose here, and held no meaning for the readers just joining, but were little more than a few speed bumps on an otherwise smooth road.As far as other mystery novels go, I don't recall having read any, but I feel that it was Penman's wonderfully detailed historical setting which really drew me in. I've never been to Wales, but having read Here Be Dragons, this was a more than welcome return to this rich, beautiful land. Prince Llewelyn of Wales, and Prince John of England, I now hold as two of my favorite ""literary"" characters, thanks to that book, and here we are given a very enjoyable glimpse of what their first brush with one another might have been like. -A speculative foundation for what would become one of history's most fascinating rivalries!But what impressed me most about Dragon's Lair, was the pacing, which was perhaps not as smooth in Here Be Dragons. While there wasn't nearly as much action as in my usual reading fare, the plot involves you quickly and thickens at a nice steady gait, until we are given a very satisfying conclusion- which often makes or breaks a mystery. However, as another reviewer mentioned, the main culprit's identity might be obvious to anyone who's read her previous Welsh tales, or was familiar with this story's background, but alas, is that not a major obstacle of any historical fiction?All in all, this was a very solid book, which would have left me with great satisfaction even if I'd had to actually buy it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2003","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IHHASF7F9P8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399150773#wasThisHelpful","R1IHHASF7F9P8Q","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book of short stories nice and cheap. Its author line-up boasted such names as: Alfred Bester, Theodore Sturgeon, Damon Knight, Daniel Keyes, Walter M. Miller Jr., James Tiptree Jr., Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Isaac Asimov, Phillip K. Dick, Thomas M. Disch and a few I'd never heard of. Other than Asimov, I hadn't read any of these authors before, but had heard much about them. I decided this sounded like a solid intro to their writings- not to mention a ""cream of the crop"" selection from one of the most respected magazines in Fantasy & Sci-Fi.Among the contents were listed three short stories I'd heard of:1. Daniel Keyes' FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON. In this story, we read the journal of a mentally challenged man named Charley, as he takes part in a monumental scientific experiment that will not only make his brain function normally, but advance him far into the realms of super-intelligence. But perhaps this gift is not as glamorous as it sounds...  I'd read the full novel-version of this story in high school, and it didn't really leave an impression on me back then. So I didn't really care that the shorter version was here. Thankfully I read it- for it was easily the best contribution in the book, and the only one I would rate 5 stars. I even want to reread the full novel sometime soon.2. Walter M. Miller's A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ is revered as a classic in the genre. I own the novel on my ""to be read"" shelf, and figured it would be nice to read this, the original short story version, first. It is our future after a nuclear holocaust. The world has been plunged into ignorance, but religion still exists and tries to make understanding of life and what was ""before"". This story was not to my taste at all, due mostly to the heavy religion I suppose. I fear I won't enjoy the full novel any better. 2 Stars.3. WE CAN REMEMBER IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE, by Phillip K. Dick, is of course, the short story that became TOTAL RECALL- One of my favorite movies when I was younger! It was interesting to compare it to the film, since they are quite different, and I think others would enjoy doing the same thing. I'll leave the details for your own discovery, but I will say that you probably wouldn't picture Arnold as the protagonist in THIS story! 4 Stars.There were four other notable tales in this collection:1. NOT WITH A BANG, by Damon Knight, tells a short post-apocalyptic tale of the last man and woman on Earth. He realizes that they are humankind's last hope, but she is a Catholic woman who refuses to have premarital sex with him, and there is no one alive who can perform the ceremony. -This was a clever idea, which I would have preferred as the basis for a longer story instead of an abrupt, short one. 4 Stars, none-the-less.2. Shirley Jackson gives us ONE ORDINARY DAY, WITH PEANUTS. Here is a day in the life, of an odd man, in an over-crowded city. What makes him odd? He is unbelievably nice! There has to be a catch right? -This was an enjoyable little story, with a nice ending. 4 Stars.3. Richard Matheson contributes the three-page story, BORN OF MAN AND WOMAN, which is told by a child... whose parents keep him locked up in the basement for some reason. -Very short, but very powerful. 4 Stars.4. My final pick is PROBLEMS OF CREATIVENESS, by Thomas M. Disch. This story tells of a future where the government controls the population by only letting it's most gifted citizens marry or have children. Birdie Ludd didn't make the cut, and now he is willing to try anything to change that verdict. -This story was rather fascinating, and really made this future seem possible and frightening. 4 Stars.Otherwise, I was fairly let down by the other ""big name"" authors in this book. One particular problem I had with this ""retrospective"" was in the editor's intro to some of the stories. He would tell us that the author wrote this and that, and was famous for short story `X,' which, appeared in our magazine in 19XX... but here's story `Y' instead. Maybe they had printed the `famous' stories in other collections or something, but I would have preferred to read them instead of the alternate selections. In all of these cases (5 or 6, I believe) the story they gave was rather unimpressive, and served little purpose, except to make me wonder what I could have been reading instead.Anyway... This collection is out-of-print, but I would certainly recommend the six decent stories I mentioned above, if you are able to find them in a copy of this book or in another collection, which is probably your best bet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2003","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31G6RTR5SRRBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385153570#wasThisHelpful","R31G6RTR5SRRBF","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...Where the main character dies in the first chapter! Jeff Winston dies at age 43, and wakes up to find himself in 1963, in his own body as it was at age 18 -with all his memories in tact! This is of course, an idea we have all dreamed of... getting to relive your life with complete knowledge of what is going to happen. I heard the summary of this story and knew I had to read it.First there is the obvious- you know who will win the World Series, or what stocks are going to fly, so you take advantage of that and live large. You're 18, but you aren't as foolish as you were then, so relationships are a piece of cake. In short, you can do anything you ever dreamed of. Grimwood's character does just that, and your imagination gets a fantastic ride in the process! But why was he given this fantastic opportunity?I highly recommend REPLAY to anyone who has ever dreamed of a second chance like this. It won the 1988 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel for a very good reason, however, I've only seen it for sale here at Amazon. It was certainly worth every penny- What a great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2003","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLGPKISZRG1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=068816112X#wasThisHelpful","RWLGPKISZRG1Z","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On his official website, George RR Martin said that Sharon Kay Penman was dynamite. I haven't read much Historical Fiction so far, but I've been wanting to for quite a while. I was interested in medieval England primarily, and I found the first book really cheap, so I dove in.Taking place in the 13th century, we are given the tale of the ruthless King John of England, and his greatest rival, Prince Llewelyn of Wales. To gain a hold over Wales, John marries his favorite daughter, Joanna, to the influential Welsh Prince. Joanna wants nothing less, but as she slowly begins to love her father's greatest enemy, she finds herself torn between the two powerful men. The romantic tale is merely a tiny aspect of this engrossing novel. You will also witness the warfare, politics and what life was like during this brutal period of English and Welsh history. I can think of nothing to compare it too except Braveheart, which is high praise from me. This book has everything in it. It's amazing how some of the best stories in the world actually happened.From what I've heard, and from the little I've witnessed, historical fiction usually means there will be a compromise in writing and story. Well, from page one, Penman grabbed me and wouldn't let go. After just this one book, she easily earns her place among my favorite authors. Here Be Dragons was simply captivating from beginning to end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2003","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q5WNAL40YRCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345382846#wasThisHelpful","R2Q5WNAL40YRCS","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has received quite a few 4 and 5 star reviews, and it probably deserves every one of them. Were I to review this book solely upon the quality of Wilson's writing, I would have also given it a higher score. But unfortunately, I must also take into account that this was simply not my cup of tea. It was very original, but as I read on, I found myself less interested in the story and more interested in picking out my next book.The year is 2020, and a massive world war is coming. Nobody knows this until one morning, when a 200-foot tall monument shows up in Thailand- Announcing that someone named ""Kuin"" has conquered the country-Twenty years in the future. As more and more of these Chronoliths (victory monuments from the future) arrive in other countries and cities- the world erupts into panic.There's not much more to the plot than this, but Wilson does a fine job choreographing the world's reaction to this bizarre attack from our future. With an expert understanding of sociology, Wilson depicts the way people might react to this kind of chaos, from the viewpoint of the government, the military, the economy, different generations and more. The book's atmosphere feels like the Cold War, or Vietnam as they were viewed from home. You can imagine yourself in that future world, glued to the TV- stunned and fearful of the news.I love Sci-Fi, but I guess I needed something a little more fantastic or attention grabbing than this. Maybe I need more action or suspense. My main problem was that Wilson gives us many questions early in this book, but never really delivers any answers. The idea of the Chronoliths was neat. The setting was realistic and engaging. But the characters were merely decent, and the story itself... left me unsatisfied.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CVRRB13DC3UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812545249#wasThisHelpful","R2CVRRB13DC3UY","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...Not compelled to grab the next book in the series. I enjoyed many aspects of this book, but wasn't really hooked.This is a 15th century historical fiction novel with only a hint of SF/F in it. I'd say there is only about 5% of the fantasy that you would find in your typical fantasy book- though I hear it becomes much more in the later books of the series. However, if you don't mind historical fiction, don't let this stop you.The story is about Ash, a female commander of a mercenary company who does more than anyone thought a woman could in the 15th century. But here is where it really twists off from historical fiction: A great, unknown nation from Northern Africa invades Europe, bringing with it a large assortment of technological machines, featuring large brass golems. Ash and her army-for-hire end up in the middle of this nation-crushing conflict!I loved the setting she chose for her story- a point in history where guns and canons have been incorporated into European combat, but archers, lances, and armor are still the main scene. And a mercenary band is ALWAYS great to read about in any book as far as I'm concerned. It was fun seeing how they operated autonomously- separate of any of the nations or religions of the time. They choose their contracts among themselves as a council. No matter what their political interests are, they pretty much want to make sure they are on the winning side!The book started off very well, and drew me in, but by the end- I'm not really in any hurry to continue the series. In fact, it can't really be considered a series... From what I hear, you have to read all four books end-on-end to get the whole effect- and from the ending in this one book- that certainly seems the case.One feeling I got was that Gentle seemed desperate to write women into history, or even this fictional history. I was quite fascinated with Ash's character at the start- ""She's like Joan of Arc,"" I thought. I'm interested. But then it starts to feel like Gentle is trying to show us that every time a woman is in charge- things get done right. But men are portrayed as completely incompetent or are good soldiers at best. Of course, one would have to admit that there are WAY MORE fantasy novels that cater to the opposite extreme, so one can't complain too loudly about the ladies getting the spotlight! :)All in all, I didn't have any major gripes here- Just that Gentle's style didn't really keep me enthralled. So instead of grabbing book 2, I'm off to try my luck elsewhere!-Lysander","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ZDPQPSOT0YI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380788691#wasThisHelpful","R30ZDPQPSOT0YI","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best ""First Person Shooter"" I've purchased in quite a while. Singleplayer was rather enjoyable. Sound was nice and eerie. Graphics were rather good- even if they did reuse the scenery way too much. But what really makes this game shine is its actors. Whether you are playing as a Marine, a Predator, or an Alien- you really become that character!As a Marine, you are sent to investigate a colony that has been ravaged by aliens. Then you get separated from your squad and things start to go really bad. Its dark and scary, and as your little motion sensor beeps away you find yourself jumping at every turn. It feels exactly like the movies!They nailed the Predator too! All his famous abilities and weapons are at your disposal, which pretty much makes you one unstoppable killer. Turn yourself invisible. Switch to infravision. Jump from tree-limb to tree-limb. Then decimate your prey in any number of ways. You are a Predator, and the game captures that feeling perfectly! Finally, it is the Aliens that truly make this game for me. They can walk on walls. They have acidic blood. A sharp sense of smell. Fierce claws and a whip-like tail. Sickest of all- They eat their victims to regain health! The aliens can be rather disorienting to control at first, but once you get the hang of it- you are sure to fall in love with the little critters! It really makes you think and play in a totally alien manner- very original!Singleplayer was a lot of fun, but Multiplayer really makes AVP II shine. Take the three species and throw them in an unforgiving arena, and see which is the fittest. It really is hectic, and quite a ride.However, there  is one aspect of multiplayer that really needs improvement. The ""game launcher"". When you go to find  an internet game to join, it lists all the servers along with the number of players, the ping, and the game types. You can then sort the game by any of these aspects to find just the game you want to play. It provides filters to make this even easier- but unfortunately, there is no way to save your filter preferences. Instead, you have to put them in every time you want to find a new game. This is really a nuisance! There is also no way to remove all the servers that require a password (would be nice), or download the map from the server if you don't have it (instead of getting kicked out). Maybe I'm asking too much, but other games (like Half-Life) have been able to solve these little inconveniences for years now! Maybe after a few more patches...?Either way, once you finally get into a good server, you are in for a real good time. Death Match doesn't get much more fun than this!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X671QXMJKO7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005QX4F#wasThisHelpful","R1X671QXMJKO7C","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years now, I have been kicking myself for not having grabbed the Special Edition when it was available. So now I read the description for this new Bootleg Director's Cut, and figure my prayers have been answered... What a joke.The description says that there are 15 minutes of additional footage including the original ending, and 4 never-before-seen deleted scenes- Yet nowhere is it mentioned that the *real* version is not included. In short, there's no more ""Hail to the king, baby!"" or ""Good... Bad... I'm the guy with the gun.""Still, the additional footage and original ending were pretty cool, but you could always tell when you were watching the previously deleted material, because the picture quality takes a horrendous dive. Sound quality was also a huge let down. You can't even hear certain lines such as, ""Maybe we can pull this off... And maybe I'm a Chinese Jet Pilot!""One redeeming quality of this version was Sam & Bruce's hilarious commentary, wherein they rip on each other constantly, and give you lots of great background info. Then, in one or two parts, Sam actually mentions that he prefers the way something was done in the regular (non-included) version. How then is this the ""Director's Cut""?In short, you'll still need to buy the regular version of this movie, or else you'll be missing all the best stuff.

"Someone else said that this is, ""An excellent book for people who don't like to nitpick."" That is probably a perfect summary, but unfortunately, I'm the sort of reader who likes to pick nits.The premise of Island is fantastic. Its back cover grabbed me right away. Who wouldn't want to go back in time with the Nantucketers and rewrite history? And so, the book starts off wonderfully: This guy is over here doing this, and this lady is over there doing that, and here comes a storm... BAM- Everyone is in 1250 B.C.! So, what do we do now?Well, the characters react very believably to the crisis, and Stirling is very thorough in covering almost any type of concern that could have possibly come up. But then, it begins to feel like the Islanders were a bit *too* lucky. Turns out they have almost everything they could have wished for, including a professor of ancient cultures, and an expert sword-smith, both of whom just happened to be visiting the island. Then there's the Coast Guard sailing ship (rare), captained by a black, lesbian, master swordswoman... Followed by many more little things that make you wonder, ""Now what are the odds of that?""And this feeling grows worse... for me, it eventually became a case of, ""Oh- Gimme a Break!"" In fact, I think that their biggest dilemma with being thrown back 3250 years into the past- was that they ran out of coffee. Everything seems to work out overly perfect, and it gives you many little things to nitpick.Even so, I found the book to be somewhat digestible until about it's midpoint. It was then that the islanders' main concern was no longer just survival. Now they have to react to a betrayal by some of their own. I found it kind of boring from this point on. The Islanders decide what they are going to do, and the next three hundred pages or so, play out exactly as they had planned, in a very predictable and insipid manner. Trudge. Trudge.This book does have some terrific aspects and it can really get you thinking. But I found the characterizations to be flat, and the story was slow, predictable, and rather unrealistic at times. It wasn't horrible, but although I'd love to find out what happens next- I'm not compelled to trudge any further through this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2002","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F8IZ8JS460CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451456750#wasThisHelpful","R1F8IZ8JS460CX","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the run of lackluster sci-fi flicks that came out one-after-another that year (Red Planet, Wing Commander, Super Nova, Battlefield Earth, Mission to Mars) -PITCH BLACK was bliss! Not that you are certain to agree... In fact, there's been a division of opinion on this movie. From what I've witnessed, you love it or hate it. I personally find that it rather easily takes it's place among my top-ten sci-fi favorites. And when you take into account its miniscule budget and unknown cast... this is quite a feat.The plot could have used some tweaking, but the acting was quite solid, and I really enjoyed the characters, whose conflicts with each other (and within themselves) were engrossing. -Not to mention Vin Diesel, who makes a fine definition for the term ""bad-..."". Thanks to him, I found myself saying ""whoa!"" many times during this movie. He has quite a future ahead of him, I think, but his growl-of-a-voice (while very cool) needs captions -because you can't make out what he is saying at times.The special effects were tasteful and in no way overdone -one of my biggest complaints in most sci-fi flicks. And although some found it too distracting, I thought the grainy camera filtering gave Pitch Black a nice gritty feel. It worked so well- I felt like I was trapped on the desert planet with them.In short, this flick hit my buttons quite nicely!

"I didn't plan on great acting, plot, or dialogue- and on all three counts I got what I expected. But Tim Burton is a solid director, and the whole thing came together pretty well, even if he couldn't say ""no"" to some of his usual corniness.There was plenty of action. But what really made Planet of the Apes worth seeing was (as I'm sure you guessed), the setting, costumes and special effects- Tim's trademark, and some of his best. My only gripe about the apes would be the jumping... a tad too much. It almost looked like ""Monkey Matrix"".As far as acting goes, the general opinion has been that the apes were better than the humans. I thought they were all merely decent, with the exception of Tim Roth who was excellent as usual, and Mark Wahlberg who looked perfect for his part... but shouldn't be allowed to talk. They really could have cast a more believable lead than Mark.Speaking of leads, it was nice to see Charlton Heston make an appearance, but they should have left out his ""Damn them all to hell"" line. I hate when cameos go silly like that. Also silly, was the ""surprise"" ending. I'm not going to give it away, but you'll see it coming for miles. Pretty dumb, but I guess it gives them their sequel.All in all, this movie makes a decent legacy for the 1968 original. I'd say I liked them both about the same. Sure the humans can now talk, and the original message has been altered, but they needed to spice up the series for a new generation.

"Hyperion, artistically, is one of the craftiest novels I've ever read. Fall Of Hyperion was different in style, but I think I found it more entertaining.In Hyperion, Simmons' format was the short story, where we were given each of the pilgrim's different tales, one at a time. By the end of each story you are intensely caught up in that pilgrim, and can't wait to see what happens to him (or her) next. But then Simmons is pretty much done with that character for the rest of the book, and moves on to the next with similar result. The waiting was agony- a true credit to his masterful ability.In Fall of Hyperion (which is more like a normal novel), we finally find out what is in store for our pilgrims, and it was well worth the wait! Now he switches back and forth between each of the main characters on a regular basis, revealing a little more each time. Normally, when you have this many main characters, you find yourself bored by some, and can't wait to get back to others- In Fall Of Hyperion, I enjoyed each of them, almost equally, for one very smooth-paced, entertaining read.The two books, together, make an amazing duology, with everything solved rather nicely by the end...

"While yes, I found ENDER'S SHADOW to be enjoyable, Ill be trying hard to forget this story when I fondly remember ENDER'S GAME. It was not the writing, or the fact that it followed Ender's Game closely. It was just overdone. Bean's ""street urchin"" background was excellent, and Card did a wonderful job distinguishing his personality from Ender's. But I was disappointed, however, with the way Card added meaning to many of the events we were familiar with from Game.*SPOILERS*Now, BEAN made Ender's army -A well thought-out master plan, instead of being just another way the teachers had stacked the game against Ender. Now, BEAN was responsible for Ender's last (and greatest) victory at battle school. Even the deadline cord was now a result of some great victory BEAN won against the teachers, instead of just something he tried out in practice. In fact, Bean was able to figure out almost all of the things Ender couldn't... it's just that he decided to keep his thoughts to himself. Was *everything* the result of Bean's handy work?*END of SPOILERS*Card should have left the original story ""lean and mean"" -the message just isn't the same any more. Too much credit was taken away from Ender, and handed to Bean. Of course, he had to bring Bean up to the lead role for this book, but Ender's tale was too much changed in the process. Everyone knows it was ENDER who could do what nobody else could. Now, we are told that Ender wasn't all that great... That he would have failed miserably had it not been for Bean.Other minor annoyances:Ender's Game had little religion in it, (unlike the sequels), and that was something I felt should have been left out of Shadow as well. It just doesn't fit with the story's flow. Same with the constant use of Spanish... There was little of that in Ender's Game, and now, suddenly, it has been worked into nearly every character's dialogue. It breaks the smooth flow of the reading when you can't figure out what a character is saying. Maybe Card has some sort of agenda involving these two aspects in his books, but I found them simply annoying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5LP2WU9H6ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812575717#wasThisHelpful","R1R5LP2WU9H6ML","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems quite appropriate that praise from Stephen King can be found on the back of this book.  Like many of King's better novels, the ""Rag"", doesn't seem like a horror novel at the start. Instead, we are given an engaging mystery set in a real-life setting. But as you continue to turn the pages, you begin to get the sense that something is definitely not right, and eventually, we encounter the supernatural.I highly recommend this book, but as I write this review, the question I ask myself is, ""Exactly *whom* would I recommend it to?"" When I first picked up the Rag, I was dubious. Of course I loved Song of Ice and Fire, and I found myself quite impressed with most of Martin's horror and sci-fi works as well... But I didn't have much confidence in an out-of-print horror book with a hippie/seventies/classic rock setting.Fortunately, I read it anyway, or I would have missed out on one fabulous book. But will YOU like it? -If you occasionally find yourself enjoying episodes of VH1's Behind The Music, or the movie Almost Famous, you will appreciate Martin's meticulous attention to the music industry. -If you are a fan of Stephen King, The Rag will make you feel right at home. -And, if you've enjoyed any of Martin's other writings, you're sure to approve of his style here as well.The bottom-line is, this is one book that truly doesn't deserve to be out-of-print, and thanks to Martin's rocketing popularity- it soon won't be. As soon as you can, give it a try!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5YSGQV0K60J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0893661503#wasThisHelpful","R3L5YSGQV0K60J","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...and it kinda shows. On one hand, George has delivered one of the most creative settings I've ever seen in Sci-Fi, complete with fascinating alien cultures. On the other hand, I felt quite dissatisfied with his main characters, and there was little action. However, it was still fun to see the master honing his skills.The planet of Worlorn is a rogue, simply meandering through space on its own. Recently, it has come to drift near `The Wheel of Fire' -a constellation, which has brought it to life for a few decades. The wandering planet became a wonderful tourist attraction for a while... a festival, with fantastic cities built by each of the known races. Now, Worlorn is pulling away into cold darkness again, and its becoming uninhabitable once more. The Festival of Worlds has come to a close, yet a few people can still be found living among it's deserted cities as the planet slowly dies. Dirk travels here in answer to a call from his old lover, Gwen, and ends up the pawn of an intercultural conflict.As I said before, this is a fantastic place I'd love to see with my own eyes, but the characters were too dry and unrealistic. There really wasn't any motivation to keep turning the pages here. Since reading A Song Of Ice And Fire, I've been hunting down all of George RR Martin's earlier out-of-print works, and have enjoyed the ones I've found quite a bit.

"There aren't any characters who are pure good or evil, like you normally see in this genre. Instead, what we have are varying shades of gray. (In that way only, would I compare it to George RR Martin's Song of Ice and Fire) The Black Company is a mercenary army...  and they've fallen on desperate times.Some of its members honestly seem like they want to do the right thing. Some simply try to survive. And others will pillage, rape, or murder on occasion. This reminded me of some of the better Vietnam War films I've seen. Such harsh circumstances can lead to diminished morals in some men, and I enjoyed that element of realism.Each chapter of this book reads like a separate mission, with its own conflict and resolution. This approach worked well here in  my opinion. Right from chapter one, we are introduced to the Black Company and plunged into action, through the writings of the army's annalist, Croaker. Unfortunately, you may feel like you've missed some important details, as Cook bombards you with names, events, and his advanced vocabulary. He doesn't explain everything very well at first, and it can be quite confusing.After finishing the second chapter, I went and reread the first chapter to iron out some details, and that helped out quite a bit. From then on, it was smooth sailing and well worth my patience. With plenty of action, and a few laughs- this was a pretty entertaining read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPHSG19TNQAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812521390#wasThisHelpful","RVPHSG19TNQAL","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since reading A GAME OF THRONES, I have been trying to hunt down all of G R R Martin's earlier out-of-print works -I haven't heard one bad word about any of them yet. NIGHTFLYERS is one of the few I have found thus far, and it was well worth my effort. It contains six excellent short stories of horror and science fiction.The title-novelette, ""Nightflyers"" is by far the best... A team of nine specialists takes flight on the Nightflyer in pursuit of a legendary alien spacecraft, eons old. But things on the Nightflyer aren't exactly as they seem, and it's captain isn't sharing all he knows. ""Override"" and ""A Song For Lya"" are two more great pieces, but they can also be found in another of his collections, A SONG FOR LYA. A fourth great story, ""Weekend In A War Zone"" takes a look at one of our future forms of entertainment- recreational warfare! I wouldn't have minded if that story were a lot longer.The last two stories are just ok, but all in all, this collection is well worth your time. Because of his recent popularity, Martin's older works should be hitting shelves again soon, but if you can't take the wait- check the libraries and used bookstores like I did","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6N8CFVIEVQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312943326#wasThisHelpful","R3O6N8CFVIEVQV","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was twenty-years old, and had an ugly cover, so I figured A SONG FOR LYA was out-of-print for a good reason. But since being blown away by A GAME OF THRONES, I have yet to find anything of Martin's less than superb. This short, but fabulous book turned out to be no exception.Sci-Fi and Horror are blended to excellent result in this collection of 10 short stories, featuring telepaths, ghosts, strange life forms, and very imaginative worlds. The standouts were ""With Morning Comes Mistfall"", ""Override"", and the Hugo Award-Winning title-story, ""A Song For Lya"", but in truth- there wasn't a bad apple in the bunch.My personal favorite was, ""Dark, Dark Were The Tunnels"" where Nuclear Armageddon has destroyed the face of the Earth long ago, and only two groups of people have survived. It took me a few pages to realize just what I was reading, but then it really pulled me in!Several of these stories have also appeared in Martin's later collections, but unfortunately, they too are all out-of-print at the moment. However, the popularity of A Song Of Ice And Fire means that many of these collections and stories will soon be republished in the near future.

"...and I bought it for just that reason. I hadn't watched Outer Limits before, and this episode was rather well made, featuring Beau Bridges, and his father Lloyd -A Twilight Zone type of show.But as I said, the sole reason I bought this video was because it was based on the 1979 Hugo AND Nebula award-winning novelette, ""Sandkings"" by George RR Martin- My favorite author to date. DO NOT expect as I did, for this to be a movie version of that amazing story.While it was well scripted and decently made, it had VERY little in common with Martin's 25-page short story. Outer Limits used a different plot, setting AND cast of characters all together, and the only similarity was the Sandkings themselves... but even *they* were vastly different!Bottom line- Many Outer Limits fans consider Sandkings to be one of the best episodes, so if you like the show, give it a shot. But if you are a fan of Martin, you should find the short story ANY way you can.

"My friends and I used Roger Wilco all the time, so this looked like a good idea, and as I'd hoped -the headphones are topnotch.Also well made is the ""puck,"" as it is commonly called, due to its distinct shape. The puck connects between your computer and the headphones, giving you a volume control and a mute button, as well as several other buttons that allow you to chose specific people to communicate with during the game. This is excellent for when you and your friends aren't all on the same team.The puck's best feature, however, is that you plug your speakers into it, as well as the headphones. Then, there is a switch that lets you toggle between the two. This saves you from the hassle of reaching around to the back of your computer to change plugs- Something any headphone-user can tell you is a huge pain in the @ss!Now let's take a look at the software. It consists of two aspects: Voice Command and Communications.The voice command software allows you to replace certain game-keys with one-word voice commands. So instead of hitting the ""reload"" or ""inventory"" button, you can simply say, ""reload"" or ""inventory"" to the same effect. I couldn't care less about this feature.The communications software works similar to RogerWilco or BattleChat, allowing you to speak with your friends and teammates while playing `online' games. In addition, it uses those puck buttons (mentioned earlier) to good effect. Unfortunately, despite those cool features... we had problems with it:1-It's beefy price means many of your friends won't want to purchase GameVoice. They can get the *free* version of the software and use a regular headset to talk with you, but from what we discovered, there were a LOT of bugs in this version.  2-GameVoice forces you to use Microsoft Instant Messenger in order to connect with each other. NOBODY uses that program. AIM and ICQ are *way* more popular.3-The voice communication quality was under par (but not because of the headphones).So in short- we ended up using RogerWilco instead of Microsoft's program, but still kept these headphones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2001","http://www.amazon.com/review/RICT40A3HZB2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z474#wasThisHelpful","RICT40A3HZB2D","AMDWL7KIPD5G2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMDWL7KIPD5G2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nothing I have read since has been able to ease the pain!Who will survive the Storm of Swords? Don't bother trying to guess, because Martin's tale of too-many-kings NEVER leads where you expect it to, and his pen may kill even main characters at any moment. Time and time again he builds up the suspense until you want to scream.

"Maria di Rohan was Donizetti's third to the last operas; it is full of dramatic situations and possesses an excellent score. There are two CD recordings of the work: one is so-so from Opera Rara; the second is quite good from Nightingale Classics, with Edita Gruberova.It needed a better DVD than this one, but since it is rarely performed, this is likely to be the only DVD for some time.There are some strengths, though. Majella Cullagh does quite well in the title role, and baritone Marco di Felice does well with the part of Maria's husband, Enrico. Tenor Salvatore Cordella is barely marginal as the old boyfriend re-emerging in Maria's time of need, with a voice that is reedy, and occasionally strained in the top notes.Staging is traditional and tenor-turned-conductor Grgory Kunde does quite a nice job from the pit.Technically, the disc is a mixed bag. Why in the age of Blu ray and HD MA audio Bongiovanni continues to issue straight DVDs with stereo only sound is beyond me, especially since they are issuing rare Donizetti works that are unlikely to see another edition. Here, the picture varies in crispness and color, with noticeable blurring and some color washout. One will play with the volume control to get even sound, because levels fluctuate.Nonetheless, it IS essential Donizetti for lovers of the composer and/or Bel Canto, so it gets the extra star for that reason.I just wish that Bongiovanni had given more attention to the technical aspects of this recording, and cast a better tenor.Oh, well ...","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWSBYF3A4I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ULQ0PZI#wasThisHelpful","RAWSBYF3A4I5","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is  a nearly perfect recording of one of Broadway's most loved and most revolutionary (for the times) productions. My parents (RIP) saw it on stage back in the late 1920's when it premiered, and I can remember them discussing it many years later. It is a show that openly deals with racial issues at a time when public awareness of them was, sadly, lacking. It is also, when done right, a simply splendid theatrical experience.And, gentle reader, the SFO does it proud!Showboat posses a marvelously melodic score, some of it romantic and some energetic, making use of emerging jazz rhythms, much as Porgy and Bess does. Dance numbers abound, well done without exception. In fact, Bill Irwin, as Captain Andy dances with a suppleness that makes it appear that he has no leg bones.Vocal excellence abounds. Betsy Stober is a perfect Magnolia, and her lover, Gaylord Ravenal, played by Michael Simpson are just wonderful in their respective roles. Patricia Racette as Julie LaVerne is great, a lesson in ""torch song"" singing for  generation without experience in this musical form.Staging is excellent, with a largely traditional approach. Certain offensive epithets found in original book have been appropriately modified, otherwise it is what folks would have experienced back in the late 1920's.Disc quality is exceptional, even in our Blu ray world. Ditto the sound. It runs about 144 minutes, with an added 30 minutes or so of extra features.I got mine from the San Francisco Opera Gift Store, because the price was about $10 cheaper than anyone else, here or abroad, and it released earlier.This one is a hands down winner, folks!

"I have already reviewed the DVD release of Zelmira, and took advantage of an amazon seller's really low price to upgrade to Blu ray.My opinion of the performance remains the same: fabulous singing well worth the purchase, and horrible staging that while diminishing the overall effect, does nothing to diminish some outstanding vocal work from all singers. Florez and Aldrich are jaw droppingly outstanding! I can write endlessly about coloratura, range, timbre, etc., and not come close to finding enough superlatives to describe the effect. The rest of the cast do similarly outstanding work.If you get past the staging, the mirrors, the changing of the time of the story, etc., you are in for an exceptional operatic experience.Picture and sound have to be experienced to be appreciated.WOW!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IB4RTNOPJEM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H29Z18#wasThisHelpful","R2IB4RTNOPJEM9","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a boxed set of three of Rossini's lesser known operas, as well as a fourth, Le Comte Ory, which is frequently performed. The remaining three (Demetrio e Polibio [ Rossini's first, written at age 14 ], Sigismondo and Adelaide di Borgogna) have all been reviewed under their individual names and enjoy 4 star ratings. This is because of their status as less than Rossini's best. Nonetheless, as with Verdi's earlier works, there is much to enjoy in these recordings: they are well cast, with singers who are capable of meeting the ""Rossini challenge"" of extended vocal range and complex and mind boggling coloratura.They were all performed at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro and filmed with care and commitment, with the result being, in Blu ray, technically perfect discs, Not everyone reacts well to some of the ROF's staging, with your humble reviewer being one who tends more to the traditional. That aside, this is a chance to explore Rossini's less well known and performed operas as well done as one can expect for the foreseeable future, which fans of the Bel Canto genre should not pass up. Singers like Olga Peretyatko, Daniella Barcelona, Laura Polverelli, Yijie Shi, Jessica Pratt and Maria Jose Mareno all know how to perform this stuff at a very high level, and do.Amazon sellers have brought the pricing of this set, originally priced at over $100 to around $80. That's a decent price for Blu ray discs and represents a sharp difference from the price of the individual release, one reason that I got the set. The main reason, of course, was to experience some of Rossini's operas with which I was unfamiliar. For those who are younger than I (99.9% of the population!) be aware that until fairly recently, only The Barber of Seville was performed at all!

"I received this disc (purchased in Europe, where releases a frequently earlier than here in the US) and watched the first two acts of this nearly five hour production. Musically, vocally, visually and sonically it is close to perfection. Staging nearly ruins it, since stage director Graham Vick uses Tell to make a political statement, much as he did with the ROF's Mose in Egitto, released a couple of years ago. When the curtain shows a clenched fist against a red backdrop, one does not need a doctorate in history to sense what Vick is up to this time.But, gentle reader, the music trumps, as it does in Mose in Egitto. Conductor Michele Mariotti wrings more from the old warhorse overture than I have heard before, and his reading of the score maintains a very high level of excellence.Nicola Alaimo is a very satisfying Tell, both musically and dramatically, even though he casts a large shadow. Marina Rebeka (Matilde) does about the best ""Sombre foret"" as these old ears have heard, and continues to sing and act brilliantly. JDF ""hits it out of the park"" as Arnold; I have never heard him perform as well, and I have listened to him a LOT!  Amanda Forsythe in the en travesti role of Tells son Jemmy has a lovely lyric soprano with ample power to sing over ensembles when required to do so.Tell is blessed with some of the most memorable choruses in opera and the choral work here shows them off superbly.The Act I ""ballet"" is performed, but horribly. The ""dancing"" seems to mimic severely neurologically compromised folks having seizures, rather than young couples getting married.I have gotten past the nearly sacriligeous treatment of the Moses story by director Vick, because, as with Tell, the musical performance is of a uniformly high quality. Tell is too good to languish unplayed on a shelf, and another version is unlikely. Rossini's last opera is a joy to hear, even as a Graham Vick tribute to Communism.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNWM85VZ6A3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQE9SHC#wasThisHelpful","R1XNWM85VZ6A3Z","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"La Favorite has been long overdue in the DVD/Blu ray recordings. There is a much older version, made in Japan, if memory serves, but the disc quality is poor. Recordings on CD in both the French and Italian versions have been my go to discs when the need to experience this marvelous score occurred. But now it is here and what an exceptional performance and recording it is! In the HD MA sound, the orchestral detail and vocal intensity come across splendidly. Starting  with the overture, there is virtually no letup in the quality of the recording.Kate Aldrich's first DVD was as Amneris is an intimate setting of Aida in the tiny Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto where the vocal and dramatic talents Aldrich has were immediately obvious. The same is true of the ROF's Zelmira, where her ability to handle fiendish coloratura was a hugely pleasant surprise. Leonor, the mistress of the king referenced in the title is a more dramatic role, yet one with extreme vocal  demands. The main mezzo aria, O mon Fernand is a most demanding piece, which Aldrich excecutes flawlessly, including the cabaletta repeat, which is frequently omitted.My enthusiasm for Yijie Shi started with the ROF Mose in Egitto and reached manic proportions with the more recent L'Italiana in Algerie, also from the ROF. It is a lyric voice, but one with power and intensity. His first act aria contains a high C which he hits squarely, but does not hold, wisely managing his resources. His fourth act aria also has a high C which he extends a bit, But deapite the demands of a score which has him onstage singing a lot, he exhibits no signs of fatigue. His is a very exciting performance.Ludovic Tessier as Alphonse XI, while not my favorite baritone, does extremely well, both vocally and dramatically, and his reactions to being told by the Church to mend his ways, is very convincing.Parts of this performance constitute riveting drama, something that does not always occur in opera. The finale to the second act is one such, as is all of the last act, which Toscanini referred to as ""perfect"".Disc quality, as noted, is flawless, especially as to the sound in the HD MA mode.For lovers of Bel Canto in general or Donizetti, is particular, this disc is an essential buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R216EKGZ8BPE2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVBVS6K#wasThisHelpful","R216EKGZ8BPE2L","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To understand this opera as Verdi wanted it to be staged, one must understand what Italy was going through in 1849 and why Verdi wrote a highly patriotic opera. This was the time of risorgimento, the unification of Italy. Verdi was a staunch patriot, and the opera was intended to be a ""shamelessly patriotic opera"" (Berger, ""Verdi With A Vengeance""). With that in mind, gentle reader, one can see from the outset, that the stage director was totally disconnected from Verdi; he wanted to use Verdi's opera in some allegorical sense to support the defense of art, as reviewer Eitan notes in his insightful analysis.Well it may be allegorical, but it ain't Verdi, so once again, we, the viewers and, especially, the fans of Verdi are left with less than we might have experienced had Mr. Cappuccio left Verdi's opera to speak for itself, even though the maestro was speaking to a time that is past. Be that as it may, there are some very positive things about the performance that make this disc worth having.First strength here lies in the male singers: they are all good, with special ""Bravi!!"" to tenor Andrew Richards whom I had not heard before, but of whom I would like to hear more. The same is true of baritone Leonardo Lopez Linares who does a dandy job with the role of Rolando. Even bass Enrico Giuseppe Lori as Frederic Barbarossa has a rich, sonorous voice, and some stage presence.Dimitra Theodossiu is not loved by all, which must be a burden that all sopranos must endure, judging by my past experiences. I have heard her in very good form and in less than such, and while she starts well, it seems to me that she is really fatigued by the end, which is not surprising, considering the nature of this role.Chorus and orchestra do a very fine reading of the score, even though the latter, in various modern dress, have been left to line up without adding anything to the drama.Another quality that I found positive was that of the disc. Picture is great and the DTS sound is awesome. When I first started it, the overture sounded like I was in the middle of the orchestra pit, and as the opera progressed, sound quality allowed precise location of singers and some lovely instrumental detailing.I share Berger's thought that the opera itself is a ""splendid work"": Verdi had a story about which he was passionate and responded to it with an ""excellent score"". In fact, the opening night was the most rowdy Verdi ever experienced. Because of the historical nature of the story (as written!), the opera has always been more popular in Italy than elsewhere. I hope that you, gentle reader, will not be discouraged by the abysmal staging and will ""take the plunge"" and enjoy this (musically, and in some cases dramatically) ""splendid work"". It may well be the only version forthcoming this bicentennial year.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M284B3NPDEF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094AH3PC#wasThisHelpful","R3M284B3NPDEF6","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, gentle reader, what can one say about Il Corsaro? That it, along with Alzira are considered the bottom of the Verdi barrel? That, as Wiliam Berger (""Verdi With a Vengeance"") notes, ""If one could assemble the proper cast to perform Corsaro properly, one wouldn't. One would produce Trovatore instead""? Perhaps, but Verdi at his least best is still mighty fine music, and this performance is convincing evidence that Corsaro is worth experiencing.This disc presents four principal singers with whom I am totally unfamiliar, but I hope to hear more from them. (If the opera gods are just, we should, but experience shows them to be as capricious as were their Greek anticedents, else why no more Met HD DVDs? But I am off topic ...)The tenor role of Corrado has been described (Berger) as written for a ""heroic voice"". To me, Bruno Ribeiro is more of a spinto, but he executes the role, with all its fiendish tessatura, flawlessly. He would be an ideal Alfredo or Duke of Mantua. Bravo!Irina Lungu (Medora) is a gifted soprano. Her role requires her to sing a bit low in the soprano range but when it's time to hit the high notes, she delivers perfectly. What acting is required in this romantic role (aside from fainting and dying) is well done. Brava!!Silvia Dalla Benetta (as I noted in my review of the Tutto Verdi sampler) is the real deal. Her role requires the ""blood and guts"" approach, especially as to her Act II cabaletta, which Budden refers to as ordinary, as I recall, but Osborne calls it ""absolutely glorious"" (go figure). I think it rocks because Mme Dalla Benetta nails it! Brava!!!Baritone Luca Salsi (Seid) is the almost bad guy. His singing in a performance where everyone is spot on, nealy steals the show. What a voice! And a kind of passionate intensity in the dramatic aspects as well. Whew!Chorus and orchestra do a first rate job, too. Staging is traditional and surprisingly effective, considering the small stage.Disc quality is nearly perfect, my only reservation being that the women's chorus seemed under miked in the second act. But that aside, the surround experience of C Major's DTS is dramatic.A word about the venue: this opera was performed in the Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in Busetto. The theatre is tiny, having a stage about the size of a two car garage and seating for 300. The audience was enthusiastic, but remember, gentle reader, that Busetto was Verdi's home town, and it, along with nearby Parma have a serious history of doing bad things to performers who disappoint. Caruso was reported to have been booed in a performance of L'Elisir and subsequently refused service by a cab driver who didn't want to dirty his cab with a bad singer. Othe disappointees have been refused service in restaurants and hotels. So an enthusiatic audience, which this one was, really says something about the performance.I share that reaction. Buy with confidence, and forget all about that German guy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNCV4U4SUOWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094AH348#wasThisHelpful","R2NNCV4U4SUOWD","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Back in the day, Verdi scholars like Charles Osborne (The Complete Operas of Verdi) and Julian Budden (The Operas of Verdi) regarded Luisa Miller as a transitional opera, with the last act showing Verdi's ""mature"" style while the first two were regarded as more of that ""oom-pah-pah"" Bel Canto stuff. Fortunately for opera fans in general, and Verdi fans in particular, that old school attitude is going, going, but not quite gone (Budden's three volume work was copyrighted in 1973, Osborne's in 1969). With the bicentennial of the Maestro's birth being celebrated this year, the issuence of DVDs of all his works enable us to formulate opinions independant of the academic set.Luisa Miller is, of course, loosely based on Shiller's Kabale und Liebe (Intrigue and Love). In it, Verdi is seen moving from the more histionic works toward a more studied treatment of the human condition. The drama is far more focused than in earlier works while the music is rich and melodic. This near perfect performance is a real winner!Leo Nucci continues to amaze! He is close to 65 but his voice is in fantastic shape. In the cabaletta, ""Ah! Fu giusto il mio sospetto!"" following his Act I aria (Which Osborne calls ""ordinary"", but which is anything but!),  he ends with a high A, which even Cornell MacNeil eschewed in his CD recording with Moffo and Bergonzi. Nucci is the featured baritone in several of the C major ""Tutto Verdi"" series and I have yet to find him in anything but top form to date. His acting, by the by, is in keeping with the high quality of the singing.Marcello Alvarez is also in top form in this recording. He has a lot of singing to do, much of it right in the passagio, but there is no sign of strain or fatigue. His ""Quando le sere al placido"" is definitive: I have heard many tenors sing this aria over the years, but none better than this. Dramatically he is spot on, as well, which is not always the case with him.Much the same can be said of Giorgio Surian (Count Walter) and Rafal Siwek (Wurm). The former is vocally secure and dramatically involved, while the latter, singing to the same high level as his compatriots, is a marvellous villain, including the required leers and sneers.Fiorenza Cedolins is a better Norma than a Luisa. She is not lyric enough to realize this role as well as some of her sisters do, but she still does a magnificent job, and my nit picks on the vocal side do not in any way diminish my enthusiasm for this performance. She executes this role with all the trills, pianissimi, bells & whistles and is splendid in the dramatics.Staging here is quite good; it is a more traditional approach, done with apparent respect for the libretto. One of the highlights, for me at least is the Act II duet (""Pallida, mesta sei!"") between Miller and Luisa. It is the first of the father daughter duets which, in Verdi, is so well known. It is perfectly realized, as is the case with most of what is performed here.Chorus and orchestra under Donato Renzetti are also splendid. In my reviews of other C Major releases, I have noted the particular nature of regional Italian opera, especially that of Parma, in the heart of Verdi country. ""Idiomatic"" is the word that comes to mind, but that may be imprecise. Whatever it is, it adds a quality that is frequently missing in performances in the big houses, and it extends to the audience, as well as the performers (in reading a review of the performance of Il Trovatore that C Major will release later this month, the anger of the audience at cuts and a lackluster soprano reflected an attitude that is rare in New York or London).Disc quality is superb: The picture is crisp and the DTS sound is something that continues to amaze me by providing a near equivalent to the live performance.Buying this one is a no brainer; you simply cannot go wrong  .... unless you're into the German guy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10O5N223RVV6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094AH3RA#wasThisHelpful","R10O5N223RVV6R","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have lived with this book for a little over a year; it rests on a table next to my chair so that I can access it frequently, as I do. I have referred to it in several reviews of Verdi on DVD and thought that in justice to this fine work, I should comment briefly on why it is so important to my enjoyment of Verdi's operas.First, there is an adequate biography. I have and consult the definitive biography by Ms. Phillips-Matz, but for the quick reference, Mr. Berger works very well: there is enough detail to answer most any question I have had.Second, all of the operas are outlined as to plot and discussed. No, this is not Budden's three volume tome of the 1970's (if memory serves), but again, unless one can sight read an orchestral score, Budden takes some effort to get through. Berger is much more easy on the attention span, but still with plenty of detail. When I came to opera, there were only four or five of Verdi's operas that had been recorded, and those were cut substantially ( all those vulgar cabalettas!) It is gratifying to see all theearly Verdi"" treated with affectionate respect.Third, there is a short, succinct guide to audio recordings with some absolutely delicious editorial remarks ( he mentions Canadian tenor Richard Margison sounding like he was chanelling Ethel Merman and notes that a well known soprano's high notes could kill goldfish in a bowl!) Sad to say, the book was written before the surge of DVDs.Fourth is the quality of writing: Berger has a crisp, grammatic style that maintains interest. Part of this, I am sure, reflects his obvious love of Verdi's output.So in sum, gentle reader, I recomend this book without reservation. It's a winner!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MT3YI5FLJFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=037570518X#wasThisHelpful","R1MT3YI5FLJFK","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is a lot of ""Good"" in this performance of Verdi's 11th opera. Particularly of note is the singing of the lead singers, the chorus, and the orchestral work of the Teatro di San Carlo Orchestra under Maestro Niccola Luisotti. As to the particulars ...Tenor Aquiles Machado does a fine job with the frequently demanding role of Carlo. While I prefer the vocal performance of Carlo Bergonzi on the Philips CD set (I think that Bergonzi was the top Verdi tenor of his time),I have enjoyed Machado's performance in a deleted TDK Rigoletto, and enjoyed this one  enough to look forward to the C Major release of Forza, with Machado as Alvaro. His spinto voice is nearly perfect for the tenor roles that Verdi wrote during the galley years.Soprano Lucrezi Garcia is a promising vocal talent who carries off the coloratura runs, trills and pianissimi quite well, although her physical size and near total lack of acting ability, are off putting. Her voice is evenly produced through her extended range with no signs of forcing, although there are some glottal attacks that her coach should address before they get too set in her technique.Baritone Artur Rucinski was very effective as the evil Francesco, with dramatic skills that were quite effective (think ""leer and sneer"") His mid voice reminded me of someone who sang in the mid late 20th century, and I will have to play some CDs to get a more precise fix on that, but Piero Cappuccilli comes to mind.Now for the ""Bad"": staging. I simply cannot figure out why modern stage directors do what they do. What possible value is there in mutilating a work that has been performed since 1847? Admittedly, Schiller's Die Rauber, which I have not read nor intend to, was a creation of the Romanticism of the 19th century, and given that Verdi created what Berger (""Verdi With A Vengeance"") terms a ""very disjointed work"". But if the work is to be staged, rather than presented in concert, why not defer to the traditional, rather than produce an approach that intensifies the disjointed aspects of the opera as written?In this disc, the robbers run around in costumes that are from several historical periods, brandishing firearms dating from WW I to the present ( with an appalling lack of safe handling practices: I'd hit the deck if someone pointed an automatic weapon at me with his finger on the trigger!!). Then, when Francesco kills himself, he uses a knife rather than a more effective pistol. So does Carlo when he offs Amalia! Go Figure!Someone needs to get Ms. Garcia into a weight loss program. I know that I'm being ""insensitive"" (I am frequently) and non-PC (ditto!), but the dramatic ""connection"" between Carlo and Amalia suffers from the girth issue. It reminded me of a simpler time where operatic performances involved large people who stood in one place and did the park and bark thing. Good opera today has gotten past that stage (pun intended).Finally, the ""Ugly""; the set. A bunch of stage lights on poles, a backstage that had a skull (reminiscent of the ""Punisher"" T shirt my older son got for me to upgrade my wardrobe), an upholstered chair sitting by itself in the middle of the stage. The set said nothing and was a huge, ugly distraction!Having noted all of the above, gentle reader, being the Verdiholic that I am, I would not want to be without this opera. I am one of those who believes that lesser Verdi trumps most anything else. The music and the singing here all are very, very good, and while I do like to listen to CDs (and do so a lot) I enjoy the visual experience more, even when it is less than what I might prefer. BTW, picture and sound are excellent, and the personal microphones, while evident, do not distract me much at all.In sum, this is a less than perfect opera whose lack of perfection is intensified by set and staging. But it is Verdi, so what more can I say?","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FF2OT0H56JN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094AH3MU#wasThisHelpful","R2FF2OT0H56JN1","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""Verdi With A Vengeance"" (required reading!), author William Berger notes that second rate Verdi is better than most anything else and I agree. I have been a Verdiholic since late high school, which was a LONG time ago; it was a time when just a handful of the maestro's works were performed, and those were substantially cut (all those trashy cabalettas, don't ya know!).Now, all of Verdi's works are available on CD, and C Major is making sure that all are availble on DVD as well, in this bicentennial of Verdi's birth year.Alzira is widely regarded as Verdi's worst opera, not because of the music, which is full of melody and vitality, but because of the story, which Verdi never seemed to care much about (""Quella e proprio brutta"" was his later comment).But the music is a never ending cascade of melody, much of it very energetic, and a concert performance may well be its best venue, to avoid the negativity of faulty dramatics.All of the singers do well, with special ""Braavi!!"" to soprano Junko Saito (Alzira),tenor Ferdinand Von Bothmer (Zamoro) and baritone Thomas Gazheli (Gusmano). Von Bothmer was particularly noteworthy with a vibrant tone and extended range. The orchestra and chorus under the baton of Gustav Kuhn did fine work wth the score, which appears to be uncut.Picture and sound are first rate. When folks ask why I buy DVDs of operas we own on CD, I just fire up the system and let them hear the DTS version as opposed to the straight stereo one. Conversion follows.So, gentle reader, buy this with confidence, especially if you like Verdi's music, because there is a lot to like in Alzira whether or not Verdi's ""proprio brutta"" comment is valid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KHQ5Z85WD5I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094AH38E#wasThisHelpful","R3KHQ5Z85WD5I6","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that the prior reviewers have captured the quality of the singing and orchestral aspects of this performance. If it had been released as a CD album, I would have given it a five star rating. But as a performed opera, with all the visual impact of acting and staging coming into play, I cannot agree that the staging is ""... a meaningful modern way to bring its themes to life while at the same time, injecting its ancient Biblical story with a heavy dose of reality.""Mose in Egitto IS that ""ancient Biblical story"" and for Graham Vick to alter it to allow him to use the opera as a kind of political diatribe on conditions in the Middle East ends up being internally inconsistant, illogical and just plain silly. There are so many instances where the libretto and the stage actions are at dramatic odds with one another. One example shows the Jews ostensibly rigging the stage for demolition, with lots of concertina wire in evidence, while the libretto has them trying to cross the Red Sea to escape the Egyptian Army. Say what???Similarly, in the famous prayer scene in Act III, Moses appears to be worshipping his AK 47, which is as or more obscene that the breast feeding incident in last year's ROF DVD of Zelmira, which drew a lot of criticism, if I remember correctly. In essence, what Vick has done is to use Rossini's opera to tell a story that is light years from what Rossini wrote.If Vick is upset with the violence in the Middle East (and who is not?), perhaps he might go on talk radio or write a book, rather than to do intellectual violence to an opera that is going on 200 years old.For devotees of the Bible (of whom I am not one) this would have to be a troublesome and insensitive appraoch to the opera. For me, Vick's treatment of one of Rossini's best opera seria shows profound disrespect for both the composer and the operatic genre. I really wonder if he even read the libretto. For me, I'll stay with the French version, Moise et Paharaon from La Scala, now on Arthaus Musik. There the story is respected and the cast is better.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195PA11QKBISH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009F7YU8W#wasThisHelpful","R195PA11QKBISH","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"But the staging costs this otherwise superb Atilla one star. That's because it is done in the tiny (300 seats; 30 m stage) Teatro Giuseppe Verdi in the maestro's home town of Busetto. I have seen DVDs of performances there that worked, but this one, despite valiant efforts, does not quite make it. The stage director, to make up for the lack of spaces, projects computer graphics on a screen at the rear of the stage to create the sense of more space, as well as other effects. In the second scene in the Prologue, the Adriatic Lagoons, work very well when projected, but in other cases, the effect is less than effective.Vocally and dramatically, though, this is one ""kick butt"" performance!Bass Giovanni Battista Parodi is a very effective Attila, but he is no Sam Ramey, who owned this role for years (his La Scala performance with Cheryl Studer is available on DVD and is worth owning despite a so-so tenor). But after a bit of warming up, Parodi delivers the goods. (The helmet he wears in the first scene looks like the headgear of the alien in ""Predator"", though, which is a distraction)So does Susanna Branchini, who is new to me, as Odabella. There is a visceral intensity to her portrayal, which suits the role to a ""T"". She is vocally secure from top to bottom and pulls of some very nice emotion in her duets with her squeeze, Foresto.Roberto De Biasio is a hugely effective Foresto. Musically and dramatically he is the real deal, and has been such in every performance of his I have seen.Sebastian Catana is a very good baritone who does a solid job bringinging Ezio to life. His aria in the prologue in which he tries to ally with Attila is especially well executed, with one of Verdi's best baritone phrases (Take the whole world, but leave Italy for me)being particularly effective.Conductor Andrea Battistoni does an excellent job, fully realizing the score, in my opinion.Of course, this is ""early Verdi"", which to me means tuneful and highly driven music which is very enjoyable, as far as I am concerned. And it is regional Italian opera upon which some frown ( but not I!) with less of a budget than the major opera houses have, with attendant quality differences in staging, costumes, etc.I have no idea what goodies will pour forth from the DVD folks in 2013, the bicentennial of Verdi's birth, so there well may be an Atilla with a bigger budget. But there is something about the intensity of regional opera in Italy, particularly in Parma, which is in the heart of ""Verdi Country"" that does not translate to the urbane big city houses to which I relate. The audience here is not just happy with the performance, it is ecstatic, with all the screams, etc. that make this evident.I really like this Atilla and wish that I could have given it that fifth star. But in fairness to you, gentle reader, full disclosure of good and bad is required.Disc quality, both visual and sound (DTS) is first rate; subtitles abound.I suspect that some Amazon sellers will get the price down in a bit; when that happens, I urge you to snap it up and post your reaction(s) as comments here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HNV477TTI8HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094AH3K2#wasThisHelpful","R1HNV477TTI8HW","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And I liked it a lot! But it is a somewhat uneven performance, when viewed objectively.Giovanna d'Arco is Verdi's seventh opera; it is a melodic, fast paced, musically intense work that enjoys some sustained popularity in Italy, but less so elsewhere. And with Parma being in the heart of ""Verdi Country"", the reaction of the audience gives a new definition to the word enthusiastic. Personally, I was first introduced to the work in a recording with Caballe, Milnes and Domingo, and ""bonded"" with it at first hearing.At the outset, I feel it necesssary to note that this is a regional Italian opera company; it is not the Met. The stage is small, and I suspect that the Parma budget for staging opera is a bit less than the Met's. Staging, costumes, sets, etc. reflect this.That said, there is some wonderful singing in this performance, and some that is a bit less so. Svetla Vassileva is an intense Giovanna. Berger (""Verdi With a Vengeance"") notes that the role is the first of the Verdi soprano roles ""...to encapsulate an archetype"" Vocally, Vassileva is secure throughout the range, exciting to hear and dramatically the best of the three leads. ""Incandescent"" is the word that came to my mind when seeing her.Evan Bowers is new to me; vocally I actually prefer him to the CD Domingo. There is a sweetness in the voice that resonates with me, and he is secure from top to bottom. Dramatically however, he needs a LOT of help. It is almost like he is thinking his blocking instructions: two steps left, sing, three steps forward, sing. It is near painfully obvious in the first act; later on, it is less so. There are explanations other than lack of acting skills, such as a small stage, but I think that lack of acting skills is it. Vocally, though, Bowers is the real deal!When I reviewed the Tutto Verdi sampler disc, I noted my reservations of having Renato Bruson sing Giacomo, Giovanna's father, and having now experienced the performance, I have mixed feelings. The man is nearly 80 ( born 1934) and it shows; the top wobbles a lot and there is some spread to the vowel focus, and yet ... I just have huge admiration for an old guy who is a bit older than I that can really pull this role off! And he does, wobbly top and all. Any time Verdi gets a baritone dad and a soprano daughter together in the same scene, music and dramatic peaks are scaled. That happens here in deeply moving style.Bruno Bartoletti has, I think, been conducting for as long as Bruson has been singing. Yet despite a noticible hand tremor, he does a splendid job in fully realizing the score. Orchestra and chorus do very well with some choruses that have been subject to some critical jibes over the years. Chorus costumes for the demonic folk are just plain odd.The audience was hugely enthusiastic about this performance. Bruson probably got the most applause; I suspect that he is a bit of an icon in Parma. I saw some reviews to the effect that he sang opening night only and Bowers not much more. I, too am very enthusiastic about having this disc and expect to view it often. Picture quality is excellent and sound in the DTS mode gave my viewing room a real sense of presence.

"Much has been written about the plot of I Due Foscari: ""Nothing actually happens. There is no moment of decision, no moral dilemma ... When we first see the main characters, they are sad. Then they are sadder. Then they're dead. Slow curtain. The end."" (Berger, Verdi With A Vengeance) But the same writers note that the music is fantastic: the baritone part (Francesco Foscari, the Doge of Venice) is ""...a tour de force for a great baritone""; the tenor role of Jacopo is ""  easily one of the most lyrical and least strident Verdi ever wrote"".(id)What I experienced, gentle reader, was one of the most electrifying performance of ANY opera I have ever seen. The intensity of the performers was maintained in chorus and orchestra from start to finish. As far as the individual singers are concerned ...I think that I will buy any recording in which Roberto De Biasio sings; he was absolutely ""on"" from his first note to his last. Comments I have heard about how well he did at the Met last season in Ernani were proven to be spot on in this opera. Bravo.I had never heard Tatania Serjan before, and when she started to sing, I was concerned that she would not be able to maintain her intensity, both vocally and dramatically, until the end. She did. She will sing Luisa Miller in this C major series and it has just become a ""must buy"" Brava!I was a bit concerned about how Leo Nucci would do, considering his age. He hit it right out of the park!! He never let up, and the voice sounded as good at the end as it did when he first sang. Bravo!!Maestro Renzetti was superb in the pit. I can't praise his pacing enough. Wow and Bravo!!Disc quality was good, but the house was not well miked, so the applause, of which there was a lot, was muted. I got a sense of imbalance from the orchestra once or twice, but that may be my aging hearing.If you like Verdi, you must experience this disc; it's as simple as that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUPSRQAOJ28M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00925TAOQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XUPSRQAOJ28M","A2GOTY2STOMEAU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GOTY2STOMEAU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These stickers are great for putting on your house, fence, or other areas that accept a sticker to alert that you have pro-active security measures in place.

"I'm normally more of an aviator-style sunglass guy but I decided to give this more retro style a chance.  I was surprised at how they made me look like a movie star... or lets face it, in my case I look like a creepy but yet still stylish middle-aged film producer lounging by the pool checking out the eye candy and drinking martinis.  At first I thought the polycarbonate lenses would be a turn off, but when I put the glasses on I realized the benefit of wearing something so feather-light.  I really like the amount of sun and glare protection these glasses give me.  Style AND function.What I was not expecting was the high quality free included case.  Eventually, all glasses get stolen, sat on, or accidentally left at some Hollywood poolside.  And by Hollywood poolside...  I mean more like a green water outdoor pool at a rundown ex-Travelodge.

"I've had this product for about a year and a half.  I set it to alarm if the temperature got to 10 degrees.  To test it I took it out of the freezer and after a few minutes an alarm went off because it realized it was warmer than that.  Great!Fast forward to today.  This product was reading 27 degrees.  Turns out the circuit breaker the freezer was on must have tripped a few days ago. No alarm.  I don't mean that the alarm was too quiet to hear, I mean it was saying nothing was wrong.  I checked the programmed alarm setting it and still said 10 degrees.  So while the alarm worked about a year and a half ago, now the unit does nothing but read what the temp is.

"I'm no wine connoisseur, but then again most people who claim that title are probably good about being wine snobs and have very little experience making it.

"I live in rural Hawaii and being without grid power frequently is a fact of life, so let me tell you about my experience with power inverters.  If you want to skip directly to my review of this product, skip to the next paragraph.  I have one 2500 watt (5000 peak) power inverter hooked up to a 12 volt deep cycle marine battery charged by two 100-watt solar panels.  I can run my freezer and refrigerator with it.  I have another inverter of the same model wired up to high gauge 12v clips to run appliances, TV, etc using my car battery as the power source.  I have a backup 1000 watt inverter wired similarly in case one of those dies (I got a good deal on it).  I also have a 150 watt ""pure sine wave"" (expensive name brand) power inverter which boasts a 300 watt peak which is the only inverter I have that competes with this AutoGeneral model because its the only one designed to be plugged into the cigarette lighter of a car.  (p.s. my ""300 watt peak"" name brand inverter cuts out at 150 watts)I bought this inverter so that I can plug in my 120v laptop cord into my car.  It is a newer Dell model which has a higher wattage requirement of the transformer and charger than previous versions.  I hooked up my Dell laptop cord to this unit's single 120v plug and hooked my iPhone to one of the USB ports.  This inverter ran and charged my laptop, and my phone with no problems, no sounds, and no warming of the inverter unit.  Basically, I'm really impressed with the performance of this inexpensive inverter compared to my (sad to say) over $100 name brand inverter which doesn't even have the USB ports.This inverter has a 12v plug which rotates around to make it fit into almost any configuration.  It worked great for me.  I found a coupon code on the internet that gave me a modest discount on the price and the website asked (but did not require) that I leave a product review whether it was good or bad.  This product is about 20% of the cost of my previous inverter that plugged into the 12v cigarette socket, about 1/8 the size, and has the additional functionality of the two USB chargers.

"Somebody posted that they did not like these as much as the reusable K-cups with the dolphins on them and I both agree and disagree.  These K-cups are superior in that it has a truly hinged lid whereas the dolphin variety uses a plastic flap that wears out, I have several where its clear the lid is going to separate from the cup.  which is OK because they will still be usable but it also means there is a piece that can get lost.  The dolphin type takes a LONG time to brew because most of the cup isn't mesh.  It also makes less coffee than its supposed to.  I guess that makes it stronger but it also seems like the Keurig is straining to push the water through.The reason this isn't a 5-star review is because if you load it fully with coffee some of the water bypasses the reusable K-cup which is a problem with ALL reusable cups but this cup seems slightly more prone to it.

"I've been wanting to try silver supplementation for years but navigating the research has been difficult.

Not wanting to have to break out a measuring spoon every day I measured and the cap on the bottle holds EXACTLY two teaspoons when filled all the way to the brim.

"The ferry ride between the islands of Maui and Molokai, or as I call it, the barf boat, put this product to the test.  The ride over in the morning isn't bad because the seas are calm.  But the ride back in the afternoon is a different story.  Dramamine works, but it makes me tired.  The best part about this supplement is that it works QUICKLY.  I made the mistake of putting off taking this because the seas looked calm.  As soon as we got out in the water a ways I realized I made a huge mistake.  I wanted to get up and go to the back of the boat where I could puke my guts up (we call it ""feeding the fish"") but the the boat was thrashing around so much I didn't think I could make it.  I fumbled through my bag looking for the ginger and the barf boat was moving around so much I could barely accomplish the simple task of getting the pills into my mouth.  The capsules smell like fresh ginger and even taste like it.  I had to swallow the capsules dry and they went right down because my mouth was salivating that pre-hurl-gonna-puke thing.  My nausea increased for a few minutes and then like a switch was turned off I suddenly felt better.  The boat's motion hadn't changed- it was the ginger.

"We live in Hawaii without air conditioning and without some type of insulation on a cold beverage can, not only does the drink get warm very quickly, but the punishing high humidity causes the cans to sweat a huge puddle of water that collects on whatever horizontal surface it is sitting on.  I've owned the foam-type can insulators in the past and I never liked them.  Besides looking trashy, they are extremely difficult to remove from the beverage can once it is empty.  In fact last time we moved I didn't even take the foam beverage insulators with me, we just put them in the pile of stuff we were donating to charity.  Since we have stainless steel appliances I thought that these mini-keg stainless steel insulators would look nice on the kitchen counter or breakfast bar, and they do.  Besides looking great, the beverage can is extremely easy to insert and remove from the mini-keg.  Another benefit I had not considered before purchase that I appreciate is that I don't need to use coasters anymore, and a cold beverage does not leave rings everywhere.  While I have only been using these for a few days, the stainless steel seems to be a very high quality.  Stainless steel actually rusts in the tropics unless its very high quality and so far these coolers do not exhibit the pitting that precedes the rust.  We have to apply a special polish to our appliances to prevent them from rusting and so far it looks like I might not have to do that with these brushed stainless steel coolers.  This product is a clear winner.

"Kids can grow up with this block mat! One side has larger dots for larger blocks, the other side has small dots for smaller blocks like legos, or whatever the hydrox brand name is.

"We live in Hawaii, grow coffee trees, grind our own beans, and like to brew coffee the island way.  This french press looks great with our decor and it's something that can be left out on the counter rather than hidden in a cabinet.  It makes fantastic coffee and it comes with extra filters.  The filter on the press unit looks like it will last forever so with the included filters this french press will be making coffee until the year INFINITY.  Because the carafe has elegant metal components this is not a type of press where you heat the water in the carafe in the microwave.

"My wife gets migraines from febreeze style products.  I tolerate them fine but their overpowering chemical smell leaves the room smelling anything but clean.  We got this product because we wanted something more natural that didn't make my wife get migraine pukes (yeah, like that helps a smelly house eh?) or reek like the Dow and Monsanto chemical companies both exploded on our dog bed.At first I sprayed some of the mist into the air in front of my face and took a whiff.  Nothing.  I wasn't initially impressed.  Then I sprayed it on the dog bed.  After a few minutes I took a pessimistic whiff of the bed and the dog smell was completely gone and replaced with a the scent of a mythical tangerine forest where keebler elves milk the trees and make delicious cookies, and also huge vats of a delicious mildly intoxicating punch for adults only, and the worst smelling thing in the fragrant forest reminds you of your last Cinnabon.  Okay, maybe that aromatic description was a little on the fanciful side but SERIOUSLY the scent is clean, light, and smells nothing like a chemical explosion or a perfume overload.

"Our German Shepherd just rolled in something unholy.  We live on a farm and have no idea what she rolled in but the oppressive stink... it was like a sumo wrestler had died, became a zombie, and then took a dump onto a burning tire.  Fortunately we got this neem and tea tree shampoo in the mail yesterday.  Talk about putting a product to the test!  Normally we wash her 2 or 3 times (she is an inside dog) but it was getting late so she only got one wash and a rinse.  My wife is a professional groomer and knows how important it is to wash and rinse a dog many times to get a stink out but that was not an option this time.  This shampoo rose to the challenge!  The uber stink is completely gone from our dog.  She also looks fantastic and being an elderly dog it's great to see her fur looking so healthy.  Take a look at the picture.

"I've been taking Ginseng on and off for 25 years.  Ginseng really does help for energy and health but normally one needs to take it for awhile before noticing the effects.  Not so with this supplement.  Today is my first day on it and I noticed an energy boost right away.  My guess is that its partly due to the crazy high vitamin B-12 levels in each dosage.  Maybe it's a synergistic reaction with the ginseng.  This is really a 4.5 star review, but Amazon doesn't offer that option so I mark it as a 5.  I can't take any other product that contains B-12 when I take this (that means the daily multi-vitamin is out for me).  So this is a great, 4.5 star product that would be a solid 5 if they toned down the 4,167% of your recommended daily allowance of B-12 to something less conflicting with other supplements that may contain B-12.

"I bought one of these over 3 years ago.  It was a different brand name but the unit is EXACTLY the same so I'm guessing it came from the same factory.  This model is a bit of an upgrade however with the LEDs being brighter and the battery a little more robust.The light this puts out is good for a solar light.  And when it does not detect motion, the always-on night glow is at least a bright as your typical ""stake in the ground"" solar light.  Unlike other solar lights this one works through the entire night- it has more than enough juice to work past morning and then it is recharged by the sun.I read a few reviews that said the product was DOA and I believe they failed to follow instructions.  To prevent the battery discharging during shipping the unit has to be turned on to work and this is accomplished by inserting an included pin though a hole to depress an internal switch.  If you lose the pin you can use a paper clip.  I also saw some reviews that complained that the motion detector is not sensitive enough.  This unit turns to full brightness when somebody approaches within about 8-10 feet.  That is really all you need because 100 lumens isn't going to saturate an area of light past that distance anyway.  We use ours to illuminate our gate.  The always-on-at-night dim setting is perfect for illuminating our address on the gate, and then when our car pulls up it goes to full brightness so that we can work the lock and gate mechanism with plenty of light.I paid full price for my original purchase and on this second purchase I used a coupon code and got a discount.

"Previous to this device I was using a Foscam camera I bought a few years ago.  I would have had an easier time solving a Rubik's Cube than the hell I went through setting that up.  It took hours to get it barely functional to the point where I could actually use it for anything, the camera sucked, and any time I tried to monitor the video remotely it had less than a 10% chance of working.I was prepared for similar difficulties with this camera and had no idea technology had leapt forward so much so quickly.  Basically the installation procedure is 1)  Download an app to your android or iPhone (PC instructions also available but I didn't try it).  2)  Use the app to scan a code on the product box.  3)  Use the supplied cord to hook unit to router.  THAT'S IT.  There is a 4th optional step that takes 30 seconds to use this on Wi-Fi that I also completed.The video quality is great, it automatically adjusts per light levels, the night vision looks awesome, and the two-way audio is a lot of fun.  My wife uses it to talk to her parrots when we are out of the house.  And yes they talk back through the camera.If you are looking for an interactive internet camera that lets you pan, tilt, digitally zoon, listen, and talk through, this is the best camera I have found.  It is incredibly easy to use.  I already ordered a 32 micro SD card so that I can store 60 hours of video on the device (saves having to run a separate computer to record when you are gone).

"I like to be close to my coffee, and this coffee maker brings me closer.  I have owned French Press coffee makers before but I've never had one this large.  With it I can make either one cup or the equivalent of a whole ""pot"" of coffee.  If you've never had French Press coffee let me tell you it makes the BEST tasting coffee.  Plus its easy.  I just put some rain water in the carafe (we're on catchment so that's the water that we have), nuke it until its hot, put in some fresh coffee grounds from my hand grinder ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZQSMVF8 ) let it sit, press, and enjoy.

"I originally bought this because cleaning a shower / tub is so much easier when you can use a shower head on a hose to blast all the cleansers etc off the walls and far reaches of the tub.  I didn't think I'd actually use all the massaging and different spray settings but I do and I really like them.  Another benefit I wasn't expecting is that the configuration of the handle going into the wall spigot in this manner does two things.  One, it raises the shower considerably meaning I no longer have to stoop down to get my head wet.  Secondly, the water comes down from above (like rain) instead of more sideways out of the wall.  I had a cheaper less elegant hand shower in our old house and the hose portion was made out of some cheap plastic.  I like that this one uses metal which makes me believe it will last a long time.

"I live in eastern Hawaii and we get over 150 inches of rain per year.  And when we get rain, IT DUMPS CRAZY RAIN, much more than you can get standing in your shower.  I have owned dozens of umbrellas and this one is by far the best umbrella I've ever used.  When it first arrived I was especially impressed by the heft- no cheap flimsy product here.By coincidence I also got this umbrella the same day we have unusually humid storms passing through and we are currently under a flash flood warning, so this umbrella got an immediate test in tropical downpours.  The umbrella's large size means that two people can squeeze under it's protection but where it really shines is the auto open AND AUTO CLOSE feature.Until you've dealt with the insane downpour of a monsoon you will never realize how wet you can get in the brief seconds it takes for you to get from under your umbrella and into your car.  With this umbrella you press a button and it collapses immediately so that you can get in your car while dodging all the rain.  Using only the hand that is already holding the umbrella.  THIS THING IS AMAZING.  The auto-open feature is the quickest I've ever seen.  It's almost like it pops up a magic rain barrier the very instant you push the button.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26BCFY3WN9Y3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WL80464#wasThisHelpful","R26BCFY3WN9Y3V","AM9HWE7DE791U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9HWE7DE791U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Previously in my life I worked many years as a professional cook.  I have worked every position in restaurant kitchens and have logged thousands of hours of knife use.  When you are a professional cook your knives are your most essential tools.  A professional knows the quality of a knife is not limited to it's ability to cut things.  A knife that is sharp but has bad grain can bruise soft produce.  A dull knife in a professional kitchen isn't a problem because we sharpen our own knives every day.  But a knife that is good quality steel that stays sharp a long time, with steel not so hard that it's brittle and time consuming to sharpen, yet has the right amount of weight and balance is a precision instrument.This knife arrived sharp, but not professional sharp.  I used it on a good steel for about 20 seconds and now its sharp. Nearly razor sharp.I read some reviews that said that this knife had dull or damage/pitted sections on the blade.  That has not been my experience.  Although the country of origin of this knife is missing (no ""Made in China"" or made anywhere stickers) I'm guessing it's not North American or German steel like most professional kitchen knives... but this is a fantastic value so far.  If the knife craps out... I'll update this review.  I did get a coupon code when I bought this that got me a small discount and they asked (but did not require) that I leave a review whether it was good or bad. So far this is a 5-star knife, so it gets a 5-star review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PRLSG1UNSHP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0110RSSEG#wasThisHelpful","R3PRLSG1UNSHP2","AM9HWE7DE791U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9HWE7DE791U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've owned at least a dozen machetes.  (My favorite is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WMFNX6 ) Like any tool you use the right tool for the job.  While I have my favorite machetes one thing is constant- you need to keep them sharp.  A good sharp machete that gets dulled from use will be sharpened back into shape with this sharpener with only three pulls.  I frequently use this in the field and have never put a machete into a vise to sharpen it. I just hold it steady and run this sharpener across the length of the blade.The best machetes I have found are high carbon steel (not stainless).  They take an edge easily and are damn near impossible to break.  I have also used this sharpener on stainless blades and it takes much longer to get a sharp edge.  This sharpener works best if your blade had an edge to begin with.  It's not really designed to turn a dull flat surface into a working cutting edge.  You'll likely get pitting and other problems if you try that.This sharpener is pretty big but it does fit into a pocket.  It is lightweight and easy to use.  It has an included wire brush that is held within the handle.I didn't buy this on Amazon. I take my kitchen knives once every few years to the local gourmet store and a professional knife sharpener restores them for me.  I asked if he sharpened machetes and he said no, but he recommended this product.  I haven't been disappointed with it and use it before every time I go outside with a machete.I read some unflattering reviews of this product and the only thing that I can guess is that either they got a bad sharpener or that they were trying to use it on a cheap crappy machete.  You need good tools to get good results.  Don't expect a miracle sharp edge to magically appear on a machete that never had one and probably never will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FEDZDM8V8G65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y15LDE#wasThisHelpful","R1FEDZDM8V8G65","AM9HWE7DE791U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9HWE7DE791U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We live on a farm in Hawaii and my wife uses notebook paper for her 3-ring binders of farm stuff.  We got this product at a discount by using a a coupon code we found on the internet.  The web site requested that after we receive the paper we leave a review whether it was good or bad.  This paper does what paper is supposed to do.  It sits between the desk or counter top and when you press on it with an ink pen or a pencil, your thoughts and drawings are recorded on the paper.  The paper is thick enough that you can write, erase, and rewrite without any problems.  That's of course assuming you are writing with a pencil.  Although I do remember back in the day they would sell ball point ink pens with an abrasive white ""eraser"" on the end that didn't actually erase anything, it just sanded off the top layer of paper.  I bet this paper would work well with one of those as well but I'd probably have to go to an antique store to find a pen like that because everybody these days use computers.  Remember the ""Erasermate"" pen?  It was a pen with a regular eraser and you could erase it just like a pencil.  I think it came out in the 1980's.  It seemed like a really good idea unless you were writing a whole page and then your hand would smear the erasable ink.  Also it was not a substitute for the good old #2 pencil required for taking tests.  Oh the memories.  Anyways, I've digressed.

They are all just chemical gels with aloe vera as one of the last ingredients in insignificant amounts that do no good.  In fact most of these products contain mostly alcohol which feels good during application because gives a cooling effect as it evaporates, but alcohol actually dries the skin and makes the burn worse in the long run.This product is awesome because it is 100% aloe vera gel with just a few natural additives to help keep it fresh and improve the texture.  It has a natural consistency, it SMELLS exactly like the aloe vera I squeeze from our plants (I hate fake fragrances added to aloe vera) and most importantly it soothes the burn and speeds the healing exactly like our plants do.Put this in the refrigerator and next time you or your loved one gets a nasty sunburn, rub some of this onto the burn.  It will feel great immediately and the natural healing powers of aloe vera will keep the skin from peeling and help the burn heal faster.  I got a small discount on the price of this item by using a coupon code I found online and they asked but not required that if I use the code I would leave a review whether it was good or bad.  This is the best aloe vera product I have found yet and because of its large size it will last a long time, but when I run out I will buy more at full price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB11FOZ8J8R4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0105T6QXK#wasThisHelpful","RB11FOZ8J8R4D","AM9HWE7DE791U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM9HWE7DE791U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an inexpensive way to protect your trees and plants from the birds without harming the birds.  At first you are probably thinking its not big enough, but trust me if it was any bigger it would be impossible to manage. This is best for trees or plants in rows, although you could use several of them to cover something like a large cherry tree.  The netting is a small enough size that birds aren't going to get stuck in it but large enough that it doesn't snag on everything.

"I'd like to write in this review that I'm creeping along the shadows and using my ninja skills and this balaclava to do some serious 007 stuff.But the truth is that I live in rural Hawaii and we have this nasty pest called LFA (little fire ant) that likes to rain down on me by the dozens when I'm trimming trees and sting the crap out of me.  I've had a few close encounters getting stung on the face, neck, and near the eyes and decided I needed some help before I got stung near by the eyes and went blind.Enter this balaclava.  It covers my head, face, and neck and I can use some safety goggles to cover the rest.  Now when working outside trimming the tree canopy the fire ants can't sting me.

I use eucalyptus for my congestion and it had helped clear it up. I use lavender on my feet and in my diffuser to help me relax at night. I've also used it as a furniture freshener and sprayed it on my bed to help also. My favorite out of these is peppermint. Peppermint can be used for so many things. I used it for my headaches mostly but have also used it for an upset stomach.  I also have used it to make other things. Tea tree is another one I use daily. I put tea tree in my shampoo because I have an extremely dry scalp and it helps tremendously. It helps make my scalp fresh and keeps my hair from looking oily by the ends of the day. My hair is very touchy and only so much works with it. I have also made cleaners with lemongrass. Not only does it clean, ur also leaves everything smelling great.

"I am in love with this selfie stick. I have always thought that selfie sticks were rediculous until I actually had one. I love it. I am a mother of 6 kids and when I would try to take a picture with one of the kids the others would try to photo bomb it. Well now with the selfie stick they all fit in the picture. The stick has a button on it to take the picture which is great. It's easy to extend the stick to the length you want.

"This cup is great for those that who are gamers. It is also great for anyone who likes it. The outside of the cup and inside of the cup is double walked so the outside doesn't get hot while using it. The inside chamber holds about 4-6 oz of fluid.  The inside of the cup is 3 inches deep. The cup is very sturdy plastic. It does not break from a fall and holds together well. I know the outside of the cup is a square however the inside is circular. The lid does not stay on and it's not connected. It moves easily do you have to be cautious while walking with it.

"I used this muddler and fell in love. I do not drink alcohol but know others who do. I bought this for me to use on mint leaves, lemon peels, etc to put the oils into my water and to use it on drinks for others. This muddler is a very sturdy stainless steel made of great material. The rubber part does not come off the stainless steel which means its made of high grade material that will not break off in your drink. I have also used this for other uses to see how well it worked. I have a granddaughter that loves to eat our food versus baby food so I used the muddler to mash up fruit for her to eat. The muddler works great and it barely takes anytime at all. I would recommend washing it by hand as it does have the little grooves at the bottom that need you to clean thoroughly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26P8N66FRN4YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XYT5RHK#wasThisHelpful","R26P8N66FRN4YC","A1USHKXM7D5N65","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1USHKXM7D5N65?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Expensive, but a nice looking and sturdy trash can for your building.-This is the type of trash can you see out and about in parks, near businesses, etc.  Not something you'd use in your home, but it does look nice when outside - or sitting in your garage like mine is.  It's nice looking as far as commercial trash cans can look.  The best feature are the screw-adjustable feet to make it level.  If you're having a party out back and want a nice trash can (instead of that big plastic jug you've been using!) this will class up the joint.  I wouldn't leave this outside overnight with food waste in it; you'll get raccoons!  But as long as you clean up after the party - you'll be fine.

"* UPDATE: 4.9 STARS ** OK I am addicted.  I really like this thing.  You have to take into account the low, low price of this device.  Given that, I'm willing to let slide the little quirks I see.  What this is, is a motivational tool.  Get up - get active - move - drink some water - check up on your sleep.  All that for fifteen bucks??  Awesome.  I've updated my original review below:*-For the shockingly low price of $15 (???) you get a little black band to wear around your wrist, just like everyone else is doing these days.  What's it for?  Well, supposedly it tracks your activity - steps taken, sleep taken, etc.  For it's price point, it does really well.-I would call this a basic activity bracelet.  More on that in a minute.-I've never had one of these things before, so I had no expectations.  After wearing it now and getting used to it, I have some comments.-1) I like the display on the band.  It's really nice for such a low price.  Unbelievable even.  It shows text, little icons with the figures next to them.  Now, I don't normally USE the display; I read what's in the app on my phone.  But you may like it.2) It's super light and you barely notice it.  I've had it on my wrist and you don't even know it's there.  It has a nice metal clasp (Another surprise for it's price point) so it fits snug and feels great.  The button, there's only one, is on the top so it's dead-easy to tap as you use it throughout the day.  I don't even glance at the band; I just tap that button and sync it to my phone's app to get the details.3) You don't always have to leave your bluetooth activated on your phone.  The band stores data, and you can update the app whenever you choose.4) It tracks stuff, but not everything.  You have to manually enter in your weight, along with how many ounces of water you just drank.  That's to be expected - manual entry.  And while it tracks steps taken, there's no accounting for stationary bike usage.  I use the stationary bike at the gym, but get no credit on the band. The band thinks I'm a lazy bum when really I'm a sweaty mess.  One thing I've noticed about what it tracks or doesn't track; you get addicted to the information.  You don't realize how little water you drink until you wear this thing all day and realize all you drank that day was a coffee and a diet coke.  And it's pretty accurate tracking steps; while that's not ALL your activity, it's a great motivational tool!!  And here's one side effect that I bet the makers didn't take into consideration; I don't just try to hit the goal of 10,000 steps a day, I have to be careful not to go OVER that.  Here's why; I have a bad hip. I can't take a lot of high-impact stuff; walking, jogging, lifting stuff.  I noticed on days when I use the treadmill at the gym, I go way over 10,000 steps for the day, and my hip aches.  So, now I know to LIMIT my steps so I don't hurt my hip!  What a great thing!  Now I have some metrics to help me manage the pain!!!  ALSO; I recently read in Men's Fitness that 10,000 steps is a good goal; 8,000 steps isn't enough to get the full benefit of exercise, and there isn't much difference between the benefit of taking 10,000 or 12,000 steps - so really, I need to limit my steps to 10,000 (to save time and save wear and tear on my hip!).5) The app is user friendly, kinda.  I had to google how to enter in the ounces of water I've drank.  And thankfully they uploaded some videos to youtube, so you can learn quickly.  It's a little tricky updating my weight; it uses the same slider-style thing to update, and for whatever reason I can never get it to show 182 pounds.  It's either 183 or 181.  But hey that's close enough.6) The band is a little quirky at times.  This morning I followed instructions to ""wake up"" my band, but somehow ended up in a stopwatch feature.  No idea it was even there.  I don't even know how I got out of that but I did manage to sync my band after that.  I also looked this morning, and when I updated the app, it didn't track my sleep from the night before.  I know I set it to sleep mode before I went to bed.  Maybe I hit the button by accident or something?  That was disappointing, because as I said, it gets addicting getting this data.  But hey I know I slept fine.  It's fun to see how many times I got up at night.7) The sleep graph on the app is neat.  The band tracks how long it stays still, as well as the amount of movement.  So, if you toss and turn, you'll see dips in your graph.  If you get up to hit the bathroom, you'll see a spike.  The thing thinks I slept for over 7 hours last night.  If I did that, I wouldn't need so many damn doctors.  I can lie still better than most people - so I think it's a bit off in that department.  There's a chance I went sleepwalking; I know I got up ONCE that night, but the graph showed TWO big dips...  weird!  Are you a sleepwalker?  This thing will tell you if you are!!!!!-For the price, it's GREAT.  It's a basic activity band / good motivational tool. The app is nice enough, and the band is cool too.  If you want something to get you off the couch and make sure you drink enough water, start here!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSV32NL7RPM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015121DP2#wasThisHelpful","R2NSV32NL7RPM6","A34UVV757IKPVB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34UVV757IKPVB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have a kid with a sense of humor, who enjoys goofy things and active games, then this is for you.-My 2 year old niece (soon to be 3) got a kick out of this game.  We don't really play by the rules (maybe when she's 4?) - we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the ""fishbowl"" on your head, etc.-I should back up a minute.  This game involves you (or your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points for doing it.  There are some ""props"" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps or hop 4 times or walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points or whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.  It IS Cat in the Hat, after all.-My 4 year old nephew wanted nothing to do with it.  I think my niece has a better sense of humor than he does.

"My 2 year old niece loves the Paw Patrol show.  But she likes most anything on a screen.  Kids these days, I tell ya, please limit their screen time huh?  Otherwise this generation is going to have a 2-foot vision span and thumbs that don't stop moving.-Anyway - she's 2 going on 3, and this ride-on toy is similar to many others out there with 2 exceptions:1) No noise.  Which is a good thing I think.  But there's no horn, or buttons, or anything.  For me, that's fine.  For a kid, well, something more woulda been nice.2) No steering.  This thing goes in a straight line.  You can't steer it.  For a 2 year old who likes to steer her trike, this was frustrating.  It's like kids today are too advanced for simple toys like this.  That's not to say she didn't like it; her house has hardwood floors over most of the 1st floor so she can scoot around just fine.  It's a lot harder to do on carpet!-So other than the stickers, there's not much ""Paw Patrol"" about it.

I had the car ""detailed"" which I'd never done before.  I had them shampoo all the carpeting and fabric throughout the entire car.  That was nice.  Until it wasn't.  The car didn't air out properly, and over time, it developed a musty odor.  I took matters into my own hand and re-shampooed the carpets and fabric and used a shop-vac to soak it all up.  I threw a big fan in there overnight and let it air out like crazy.  That helped some, but we aren't all the way there.  While no one has complained about the smell in my car (I'm probably the only one who can detect it at this point) it's had me worried.-So, I got this.  And I threw it in the backseat, on the floor.  It seems to be helping. My car doesn't have a musty smell anymore.  I think I can smell this thing, which is equivalent to having a wool sweater lying in your back seat.  Maybe I am overly sensitive.  My nose is, I mean, not me.  Although maybe I AM a sensitive guy!!!  Anyhow this works well for small spaces.

"I use a lot of surge protectors.  Here's what I look for:- Ease of use- Protection- Price---Ease of use: This surge protector comes with a 90-degree angled plug.  That's nice, and it can save space, but if you need to use this on a top plug in a room, you'll block the lower outlet.  This happens a lot in rooms where a light switch controls only one of the plugs in an outlet.  If the bottom outlet controls a lamp used via the wall switch, you can't use this surge protector there, as it can only plug into the top outlet, blocking the lower one.The ability to plug in multiple devices to a power strip such as this is also a challenge.  Many devices today come with chunky plugs; plugging them in next to each other can be a challenge.  A power strip arranged in a singular line like this one makes that difficult, as many plugs will block other ones.  I often resort to using ""mini"" extenstion cords such as the Coleman Cable 6991 Power Strip Liberator.  They are 8-Inch Extension Cords, and come in a 3-Pack.  Search for them here - they're handy to keep around the house.The safety feature of the sliding outlet covers is a nice touch, but not one I need or look for in a surge protector.-Protection;  This outlet claims to protect up to 1,000 Joules.  I've never experienced a lightning bolt hitting my home, but I doubt this would be able to protect my devices from that.-The price - is OK.  I would expect to pay a few bucks less for a strip like this.  $12 seems a little high.-This is an ""industrial"" looking power strip.

She said i thought you had one of those good screen protectors on it. I told her i did. Sadly it still cracked. She said well..did the phone crack or did the screen protector crack? I had never thought maybe my phone was ok. I nervously removed the screen protector to find a brand new looking uncracked phone screen. I was so happy. The protector did it's job with flying colors.

I definitely do not want to look like an old potato when im 50.

"I am so blessed to have had this amazing top of the line screen protector on my LG G4. I literally just bought this phone.

She said i thought you had one of those good screen protectors on it. I told her i did. Sadly it still cracked. She said well..did the phone crack or did the screen protector crack? I had never thought maybe my phone was ok. I nervously removed the screen protector to find a brand new looking uncracked phone screen. I was so happy. The protector did it's job with flying colors.

I was pretty skeptical.I am in my early thirties and honestly always thought people who use skin care were vain and ridiculous. Until..I noticed my skin becoming very dry and spotting fine lines. My husband says I am being ridiculous but I can see them.I was leery at first because other face creams I have tested have left my face broken out and I have very sensitive skin as well. Some of the creams I have tested have left my face red like a had a peel. This cream did not irritate my skin at all.

He was so upset and nervous. I had previously cracked my own phone so i could not be mad but i had only cracked the protector not the screen.

This is to protect it from stuff falling on it. It is hard and tough and actually does it's job. Plus as an added bonus there is a belt or pocket clip.I have kids who play games on my phone alot and they drop my phone alot.

Which was very easy to do. I let it run for a few minutes in my hand. I went through all the speeds and let them run. I did not feel any heat or smell any smoke. My arm was numb though becausw this thing is powerful. The top speed is insane and definitely not for the faint at heart.After deciding it was a safe toy and free from defect my husband and i tried the toy. It is amazing. Very powerful and gets you there very fast. It is says it is water proof and had no issues after washing it. I would recommend this toy. It is great on low speed. The dual stimulation is amazing.

"I am totally on board with this supplement. I am over weight and have high blood pressure so alot of diet pills make me feel hot inside and jittery and make my heart feel like it is going a mile a minute.

There is no crash or instant tired feeling later in the day.As far as boosting metabolism i think this pill definitely helps you feel full faster and stay full for longer. I would take with a full glass of water and then in about an hour or so eat. I would barely be hungry and in the 4 days I have taken this pill i have lost 1.5 pounds.

"My husband and I are so thankful for the introduction of this supplement into our lives. My husband is getting older and more out of shape. He is losing his urge and desire and getting tired so fast. He used to be able to work from sun up to sun down and now after a few hours he is sweaty and exhausted. He will take a shower and pass out. If i try to get him in the mood he will say he is too tired. After only a few days I can notice a slight difference in him. He actually gets up early and stays up all day and evening. He is not as tired as before. We had a long day of work and cleaning this weekend and he he usually leaves me half way because he is tired and this time he stuck it out. It is amazing.

"This elixer is great. I spend alot of time at the beach during the summer or poolside with my kids. I burn. No matter how much sunscreen I use I always burn. The hard part of summer is having a burnt scalp. It hurts to wash or brush my hair and do not even think about wearing my hair up. Ouch. I like this elixir because i can put it on my scalp for I go out for a swim day and i know that I have added protection from the sun's uv rays. I have used it twice  the first time i burned lightly and the second time i was more generous and did not hardly burn at all. I was so pleased. I also use it on my kids hair when they go out.

"This is the cutest most functional stylus I have ever owned. I actually gave it to my dad because he has an ipad and his fingers get sore from all the swipping and touching. The stylus looks like a pencil and has a wood grain exterior. The tip is nice and round and very soft. This will not damage your screen or smudge it. Plus if you click the top it is also a ball point pen. 2 for 1. Very cool and definitely very useful. My dad loves it and says it works great on his ipad but for some reason does not work on iphone 6 plus.

"Infuser bottles are great and come in all kinds of different varities. This bottle by far is my favorite. I can easily fit lemon, lime, or orange slices in the inner section for some great citrus infused water. If i need something sweeter I have plenty of room for watermelon or pineapple chunks. Plus i can add some mint leaves and not get any chunks or leaf pieces in my drinking water. Just delicious infused water. If i am in the mood for just plain iced water i can fill the center tube with ice or even remove the center tube altogether.

"These plastic champagne classes are awesome! The bases detach to make them easy to clean and travel and store. I initially thought these were gonna be cheap disposable glasses. I was wrong.

Plus no worries about breaking a glass if you get a little tipsy. I use them to make pudding parfaits for the kids. They love it because they feel fancy.

I have used alot of store brand lotions. They are thick but leave my skin feeling greasy and i have to reapply constantly. This is not functional for me. I decided to give this hand repair cream a shot because well frankly nothing else does the trick. This cream is thick and luxurious. The smell is faint and quite pleasant.

"I absolutely love green tea. I could live off of it. The organic matcha that Kenko Tea offers is one of the finest quality teas I have had.There are two types of green tea if you are not aware. Tea leaves which you can get in a tea bag or loose leaf. You steep these in water.Then there is matcha green tea which is a powder. You just mix with water or milk similar to hot chocolate. This makes a yummy cup of matcha.This Kenko brand is super smooth and mixes really well in hot or cold liquid. No clumps at all. Some other brands you will have a few clumps floating or when you get to the bottom of the cup there is alot left over. No this matcha. Blends smoothly and perfectly.What I love most about matcha powder is you can bake and blend it unlike leaf green tea. If you have ever spent $8.00 at starbucks on a matcha Frapacinno you will be saving loads of money. This is literally the same stuff. Just blend with ice, milk, and sweetner of your choice. I prefer to use sweetened almond milk.Enjoy to bake? I definitely do. Almost as much as my kids love to eat. I have made lots of chocolate matcha cupcakes with matcha icing. Also for my son matcha pancakes.

"I have really bad knees and hips. I dunno if it is me getting old or being over weight or all the sports I played when I was young but man. Some days they just ache and ache. I started taking this Triple Threat Joint Supplement daily and have been taking for almost a week no and can tell there is a difference. My knees do not ache as bad..and it is later in they day that they start aching. Not early in the morning like before. Also my hips sometimes feel like they need to pop but they cannot pop so they just ache. They still ache but its not as bad. I defiantly think that with continued use that I can live a comfortable life without being in pain most days. My husband also has extreme back pain that sometimes is too much to handle. The doctors have him on tons of pain meds and muscle relaxers but he still hurts. I had him start taking them with me and he says he feels a bit looser and in a little bit less pain.

They have to build a shelter, find water, make fire, and find food and not die for 21 days. Trust me they do not put you in the woods near a city.

The show is about detectives solving murder cases, in particular during the first 48 hours of the crime. It shows them talking to people and bringing them in for questioning and going to the crime scene and going through evidence. It is quite a good show. You get to see all sides of the crime. The family..their pain. The police investigation. And learn about the suspects. Some times they solve it in the first 48 hours...sometimes they do not. Either way, this show is a must watch.

"The kids are sold on the fact that I'm magic - they have yet to catch me tossing one of these into the fire.  If you want to make your home or camping fires a bit more fun, then you should pick up a brick of these.  Just throw it in, and it starts within seconds.  You fire changes from an orange and yellow to a wicked looking deep blue and green.  I wouldn't really call it a ""rainbow"" as it really just changes it to a blue/green color.  Now if you had a large enough fire and threw it into the side, then 1 side would be blue and green and the other would be orange and yellow.I usually do an all-out Halloween setup and this year I'm planning on having 2 fire pits - one normal and one blue and green.  The neighbor kids should get a kick out of it.How long it lasts depends upon if you have a small or raging fire - ours lasted about 15 minutes or so before I felt I had to sneak another one in.I bought a brick of 25, and will order the 50 count next.BUY THESE - you won't be disappointed - they are fun.  4 1/2 stars, so I opted for 5.PROS:  Fun, cheap way to add some additional spice to family firesCONS:  Not the ""rainbow"" I was thinking (no red, purple), but it's still *really* cool.NEUTRALS:  Not the same display packaging as pictured just so you know - what you get is a bunch of the small packets (as pictured) wrapped up in some stretch wrap as a brick.  I'm happy with that as it's less packaging, but some might be disappointed if they wanted the display package.I'll add some pictures soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6ZWDR3KSR3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V59DO08#wasThisHelpful","R1S6ZWDR3KSR3S","A363SKUFPFHIAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A363SKUFPFHIAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm still not sold, as I'm not sure if I have a defective unit or this is how they just are, but it seems that I get dropped more than when directly connected to the router.  It seems like it puts out a VERY loud signal because my laptop prefers connecting to it over the router, even when I'm closer to the router sometimes.  They were a cinch to setup and looks good on the wall.  Hopefully this item won't let me down.  I'll raise my score once I get the problems figured out.##### Updated 13 Sept 2015 #####I'm going to leave this as a 3, but I might not use these anymore.  I'm almost sold on the fact that these are causing some of my network problems.  Once I turned off the SSID matching and renamed the network to something else, most of our issues (networks drops) went away.  It seems like it's happening more on our Macs than our PCs.  Pulling them out of the plug for a few seconds and then back in sometimes temporarily fixed it, but I'm not sure if it was helping or just allowing my Mac to connect to a different device with the same network name.If I could still return these, I would swap them for another pair of the same model and see if the problem persists.

"Love it - this is our 2nd DrinkWell.  If you don't have one yet, why not?  Cat appears much happier and healthier from drinking more water.  My cat, like many others, would never drink out of a dish again after taking a sip from the magic kitchen faucet.  I got tired of waiting around while he slowly quenched his thirst.  How slow can a stinking cat actually drink?  After getting this, he can drink and play in the water all he wants. The ONLY thing I don't like about it, is that the floor is sometimes wet around it because he plays in the waterfall stream, and that there are always little bits of kitty litter in the bottom of the water that come from his paws while he's playing.  Apparently he must always drink after taking care of business.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVP937BJHAFTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000L3XYZ4#wasThisHelpful","RVP937BJHAFTS","A363SKUFPFHIAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A363SKUFPFHIAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these originally to cut off the iron-holder off the end of my wife's ironing board.  The cutters that came with my Dremmel blew into pieces when I tried to use them on this heavier metal.  So I decided to buy a real cutting wheel.I quickly got it installed onto my Dremmel and started it up - it made quick work of the metal brackets in question.  I also used it to smooth down the sharp edges left so that my wife would not cut her fingers opening/closing the ironing board.  When it was all said and done, it took my about 5 minutes of grinding time, and when I compared the used wheel to a new wheel, I had utilized about 10-15% of the wheel.  I didn't think I would use that much, and I'm not sure how far you can go down before the wheel is useless, but in total original size, it used about that much.What was also interesting is that the metal did not seem as hot to the touch as it was when I was trying the other cutting wheels.  Most likely because the cut was quicker and didn't have enough time to build up more heat.Pros:  Cut like a pro, easy to install.Cons:  I felt that the price was quite high for as much cutting as I think they will do.  If it included 1 or 2 more, it would be more inline.  Hence, -1 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPNTIDOVDQ9ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FBLRVA#wasThisHelpful","RPNTIDOVDQ9ZR","A363SKUFPFHIAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A363SKUFPFHIAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really worried to order a ""cheaper"" product, but another review here talked me into it, so I took the chance.I was extremely happy when my order came and I pulled this item out of the box of everything else I ordered.  It feels like it is built very solid, and felt good in my hand (important).  This hammer was actually for my 10 year old, so I was worried about getting him something too cheap and ruining his experience.  We took it up into the mountains this last weekend, and we both took turns with it.  I'm a big guy, and it took the punishment like a man.  While it's not the Cadillac of rock hammers, I couldn't be more happy with this item - especially regarding price.Pros:  Great product for the money.  Seems solid.Cons:  Maybe a slightly better material for the grip would be nice.I will update this review if it ever breaks or has other issues.UPDATED ON 16-JAN-2014=================Well we've been beating the heck out of this hammer now since August, and I'm happy to report back that it's still as good as the day we bought it (minus the visual wear and tear).  It's stood up to every rock and hard soil we've thrown at it.  Still very happy with it and recommend it.

I was a little ticked off because I ordered it specifically because it said it WAS in stock.  I was in urgent need of blank ink.I had asked if they could just exchange it for any other compatible SKU they had - I didn't care as long as it had black ink.  But they didn't really have any other options for me over email, because they are apparently not allowed to change the order after it's been placed.  Not sure why they couldn't ship out something similar and then just tell Amazon the order was fulfilled, but who knows the rules.... They also had no idea of when their order would arrive.Anyway, I decided to not cancel the order and just waited (mainly because I was too busy/lazy to research another brand at the moment).  Days later, I got an email saying it had shipped.  Woohoo!  In a few more days, I received the package.It was VERY well packaged and protected, and the quality of the shipped product was way better than I had expected.  It snapped right into the printer, but took 2 tries to get the computer to not complain about it not being aligned properly.  No big deal, it was probably my fault.  Once it was aligned, it worked like a charm.  After a deep cleaning, the printout looked identical to the one I made with the last OEM cartridge.The only negative about the product itself is that there is a plastic protective clip on each cartridge.  When I removed it, a bit of black ink splattered out onto my shirt.  Not sure if I was squeezing the cartridge too tight or not when I was was removing the clip, but it almost looked like it had already leaked out and was sitting in the clip before I removed it.  No big deal - nothing lost.Pros:  Excellent protective packaging.  Once it shipped, it got here quick.  Cartridge seems solid - not flimsy.  Seems like a quality product so far.Cons:  Don't tell me something is in stock when it's not - that makes angry customers.  Slight ink spillage when removing protective clip.Suggestion to seller:  Work with your supplier to create eco-friendly packaging.  I don't need the nice display packaging/boxes around each cartridge.  It increases costs, kills trees, increases shipping costs, etc.  The cartridge itself in inside a thick and protective plastic sleeve - I would think that would suffice.  Just my opinion.Overall, I am very happy with the product.  I gave it a 5 star because of the product.  If I included in the backorder BS, I would have dropped a star or 2.I will also try to report back when the ink runs out, and I'll tell you how many ""real world"" pages I got from it.

"I shopped around quite a bit for a new after-market charging cable, worried because so many people were complaining about ends breaking off, or being too loose, too long, etc.  I took the chance on this product and I am very happy with it.  The cable adapter fit perfectly, had no issues, and even withstood the wrath of a 10 year old yanking it out, tripping over it etc, and after all this time it's still rock solid for me.  I will definitely be buying another one of these if it's ever needed.Another pro is that is really long, unlike the barbie-sized-cable that came with the device originally.  This allows me to charge it and actually use it without sitting on the floor next to the outlet.When we use it on the road, it plugs into our car converter in the front of the car, and our 10 year old can use the tablet in the back seat very comfortably.I would recommend this product - I think it's a good replacement, especially for the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11KYJKPBV13LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JWUP52#wasThisHelpful","R11KYJKPBV13LE","A363SKUFPFHIAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A363SKUFPFHIAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had VERY high hopes for this product, and I'll say that I am enjoying it.  However, a few things I want to state since I'm doing a quick review. - I didn't realize how BIG this thing is - I knew it could do a turkey and I knew its measurements, but it just feels bigger than that. - It takes a LOT of oil just to get going.  I've burnt through a lot of oil so far. - The knob and outside features seem a bit cheap, but its survived being moved around quite a bit, so it doesn't seem like it will fall apart by any means. - It heats pretty quick and is able to hold onto it's temperature even when I put frozen items in. - I have not tried a turkey yet, but I have done a chicken and it was wonderful. - I love the magnetic plug so you don't have to worry about tripping over the power cord and burning yourself.Overall, I think it was a good deal for the money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7XLTZ1HYJ2A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JM1ZMY#wasThisHelpful","R3D7XLTZ1HYJ2A","A363SKUFPFHIAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A363SKUFPFHIAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love the phone in general - just what I expected.  The biggest issue so far is that the volume doesn't go high enough.  I'm still in my 30's so no old fart jokes.  The speaker phone volume could also use a boost.  The only other annoying thing is that it strips the area code off on the call log, so hitting redial to call them back gets that nice lady on the phone that tells you that you mis-dialed the number.  So you end up writing them all down an adding the area code back in to make each call.  I'm sure there is a setting to change that, I just have not found it yet - but it should not be the default.  That just tells me that the firmware running this phone is before the forced area code rule.Range is great, battery life hasn't been a problem yet, and I'm on long conference calls.  Speaker phone sound quality is crystal clear.  Using the handset to listen to voice mail is a snap and very clear and easy.I wish the number buttons were a bit more ""rubbery"" because when I hold the phone and dial with one hand I find my fingers slipping off the keys a bit.For the price, this is a great phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS9EZQK9VWW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001S2PKNG#wasThisHelpful","R1XS9EZQK9VWW6","A363SKUFPFHIAK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A363SKUFPFHIAK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No crazy permissions, great controls, and a decent sound track.  Had to learn a bit by trial and error but that was my fault for not going through the well done tutorials.  I really like how the site shadow shows you which ball it will hit first with a dark circle.  The game also features the rules of each game type which was great because I learned a few rules I never knew when I played back in the day. And now that I know I don't have to touch the ball to shoot, my bumper shots can actually get a bit of power behind them. :)  Enjoyed the game on my S3, can't wait to try it on my Acer tablet.

I've seen custom business apps that cost 10k that define ugly.  I would suggest to the developer that the timer doesn't run down as fast or gives at least 1/2 a second for the answer to be put in, or you can never get real high scores.

"I've taken this twice and both times I got heart palpitations, a feeling like I have a lump in my throat and stomach pain. I get heart palpitations when I'm allergic to something or can't digest it. I can't risk taking this anymore as I could have a more severe reaction, so I'm done testing it. This product obviously agrees with some people, but I'm personally disturbed by the lack of information on the label or website. What bugs me most is this product doesn't list the source of the inulin or identify what strains of bacteria are in the ""multi strain"" probiotic. By contrast, I've taken another product that clearly states the inulin is chicory root extract and the probiotic is Lactobacillus GG, so at least I know what's in it (and it doesn't make me sick).I don't understand why Zenwise Labs isn't transparent about the prebiotic source or the probiotic strains. Probiotics are bacteria after all, and I would like to know what kind of bacteria I'm introducing into my body as not all bacteria strains have been studied equally. It makes me wonder if Zenwise even knows what bacteria strains are in this product. If so, I don't understand why the information isn't readily available.

"I've bought plenty of Cetaphil and have been using a very effective dry skin lotion in the Excipial line  Excipial Urea Hydrating Healing Lotion, 6.7 Ounce, both made by the same company that makes this Urea Intensive Healing Cream. I really like their products. Plus, my hands get really dry and my heels on my feet are cracked from a long hot summer in sandals, so I looked forward to trying this new Excipial cream.  Unfortunately, I really dislike this cream...a lot. This Excipial cream has no scent, it's not greasy and it softens my skin, so it's not all bad. But the softening effect is paradoxical because it also makes my feet and hands feel oddly dry and icky- like my skin is coated with some invisible dry or chalky substance. I really can't stand the feeling- it's uncomfortable to me.Even washing Excipial off my hands and feet repeatedly doesn't get rid of that coated dry feeling- it stays like that around an hour for me. I'm not a scientist so I don't know what it is, but it feels like a residue or barrier that remains even after washing and it even keeps my skin from absorbing other moisturizers applied to try to counteract the dry strange residue I feel even after washing. This Excipial cream in no way feels soothing to my skin, nor does it feel like it adds moisture. My skin does feels slightly softer to the touch after using Excipial, but the weird dry sensation (especially on my fingertips) that's like my skin needs moisture desperately is not a good feeling. Excipial also contains controversial parabens as preservatives. I don't know the science behind it and can't even see it, but the way my skin feels after using this Excipial cream is too unpleasant for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BO8GGWGYMARD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVWM4A#wasThisHelpful","R1BO8GGWGYMARD","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are average quality kitchen towels. All four towels I received in the package arrived fresh looking and a nice bright white. The stitching seems adequate, though not as tough as some thin, but absorbent, kitchen towels I bought at Costco a couple years ago that are still going strong. These towels showed up with stray excess threads, but removing the threads didn't cause any unraveling. These towels are kind of nubby and nothing fancy, but I like that they are basic white, 100% cotton and absorbent without being bulky. I wet these with liquid soap and wipe down the kitchen counters after doing the dishes. They're also useful for drying dishes and could be hung as kitchen hand towels, though there's nothing decorative about them.The washing instructions say to wash in cold water, tumble dry low and iron (lol), but I don't like washing kitchen towels on a cold setting due to kitchen germs so I've been washing them on a warm cotton setting and using a low setting to tumble dry, and they come out fine. I don't even iron my clothes, so there's not a chance that I'm ironing these kitchen towels. Plus, the nubby, textured material seems like ironing wouldn't really suit these towels, but everyone has their own preferences. Anyway, these are nice enough average quality towels for daily use in the kitchen. Nothing special or fancy about them, but they are handy to have on hand and get the job done.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F9R4Z35F34SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTUEG6#wasThisHelpful","R2F9R4Z35F34SD","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I sampled the beef and turkey sausage sticks. If you buy those Slim Jim things at the convenience store, you will probably like these sausage sticks. But I personally find the smell, taste and texture unappealing. They are the epitome of processed food and have icky collagen casing, and are loaded with salt and preserved with nitrites. I do find the sweet taste of the turkey and honey more palatable than the strong beef with its smokey taste. But beyond eating a few bites to test them, I really can't eat these as they don't taste good to me. My teen also thinks they taste horrible, and he could care less about health concerns. I might eat these if I was stranded somewhere without any food, and it was necessary to my survival. But otherwise I would never eat them. We do eat beef and turkey jerky, so it's not like we only eat health food (though I look for jerky that's free of nitrites). These sausage sticks are high in protein (12 grams) and low in calories (90), so for that I give them two stars.

"This KitchenAid can opener is really attractive and has a high-end designer look. It looks great with our red pots, pans and kitchen gadgets. The stainless steel blade does an excellent job opening cans, and the magnet is a cool feature that functions really well for removing lids. This can opener has a large rectangular crank that's steel with a rubbery feeling coating that provides a nice grip, although the rectangular shape crank is somewhat awkward as the steel on the ends presses against my hand when I'm turning the crank. Luckily, the can opener cuts effortlessly, so it's not a big deal. The handles feel hard and have no rubbery coating. They're heavy feeling and less comfortable than some others to grip. Hopefully, the heft of this can opener equates to sturdiness and it will last a long time.The KitchenAid can opener requires hand washing rather than putting it in the dishwasher- a minor inconvenience. I'm not sure if hand washing is required to prevent rust, or to prevent the plastic from cracking (or both).  It concerns me only because I had a steel OXO can opener that required hand washing, and it rusted badly even though I followed the hand washing directions. I can't say how this KitchenAid will hold up over time, but it does come with a one-year replacement warranty for defects after normal use and care, and also a lifetime limited warranty. Overall, while not perfect, I'm really pleased with this KitchenAid can opener as it looks great and performs very well so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TV94M3FIWVKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PWXEQG#wasThisHelpful","R2TV94M3FIWVKR","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the concept of this men's wrap with a pocket for after the shower, but the guys in the house weren't too excited to try it out. My open-minded husband did willingly give it a try, but the quality and fit fall short. My husband is slim and this has an elastic back and Velcro front, yet this is still cut too small for his slim hips and inches of Velcro are left exposed in front that look tacky. It should be proportioned in a way where the Velcro strip is covered and you can pull it over like in the picture- I don't know who this would fit given that my husband is slim with a size 32""-33"" waist. This could only fit someone really small or willing to be miserably uncomfortable by pulling the Velcro over so it's super tight.Also, the material is a icky feeling synthetic polyester. Some polyester can be nice, but this is cheap and clingy feeling. It does feels soft, but it isn't absorbent like cotton. My teen son is smaller than my husband, but he won't even give the wrap a try. This man wrap is a tough sell to get the guys in my house to use it to begin with, though my husband would use it if the fit wasn't so poor, and the material wasn't so cheap. I just can't recommend this wrap. It gets two stars because I like the concept- but to work well it needs to be sized differently and made of decent material similar to a cotton towel in order to look okay and be comfy and absorbent so that it's a practical item.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW4A3RY0QUZ8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EBNB40#wasThisHelpful","RW4A3RY0QUZ8E","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been wanting a high quality clear case since I bought my gold iPhone 6, but the selection has been dismal and every clear case I bought has been a waste of money. By the time this SYMMETRY clear case came out, I had grown content with a few excellent cases I have with nice features and style- but all hide the good looks of the iPhone 6 and some also add weight and bulk. So I couldn't resist getting this SYMMETRY case to see if an awesome clear case might possibly exist. I have to say that, if this case holds up over time, I do think Otterbox has finally come up with THE perfect clear iPhone 6 case.I admit this SYMMETRY case had to grow on me, and I don't know exactly why. When it first arrived, I was underwhelmed. It looked so simple, so bubble gum pink and so shiny and plastic- like plastic used to make a Lego toy. I took it on and off my iPhone six times before I could commit to using it (btw, it's easy to take off and put back on). But now that I've used it daily for about two weeks, I don't feel ambivalent at all. Instead, I absolutely love this SYMMETRY case. I finally have a clear case that feels good and looks great. It's also so lightweight yet offers excellent protection. The hard plastic body seems resilient and scratch resistant- I don't have a mark on my case after a couple weeks despite regular daily use, accidentally knocking my iPhone off my desk to the floor and tossing it into the abyss (my purse).Even the bubble gum pink color combined with my gold iPhone has totally grown on me, despite being an odd color combo. The pink beveled rim provides me a good grip, and because it's raised it helps protect the face of my iPhone. I just can't find anything wrong with this case. The only downside of a clear case (and this applies to them all) is that it doesn't cover my Qi receiver patch, so I'm back to a regular charger for awhile. But I absolutely love the look, feel and protection of this SYMMETRY clear case.

"This eb5 ""Intense Moisture Anti-Aging"" cream is a very good moisturizer, but it's not my favorite eb5 cream. I prefer the eb5 ""Anti-Aging"" 4 ounce cream eb5 Facial Cream, 4 Ounce. Both list the identical ingredients in the identical order, and eb5 Customer Service told me the two creams are identical. Both contain vitamins A and E, as well as colloidal oatmeal. Neither has any added fragrance, though both have a slight scent. Both feel non-irritating to my sensitive skin. And, although the regular ""Anti-Aging"" cream is heavier feeling, neither feels greasy on my skin. What's odd to me is that, while the creams have definite similarities, they also seem to have differences despite having the same ingredients.The eb5 ""Anti-Aging"" cream is much thicker- I can turn it upside down and give it a shake and nothing spills out, unlike the ""Intense Moisture"" cream which pours out if upside down. Being thicker, the ""Anti-Aging"" cream seems more concentrated and better for my dry, aging skin. It feels more soothing and firming to my skin, in addition to making my skin smooth and providing much needed moisture. I've been using it almost 4 months daily and see visible results- my skin is smoother, more firm and less blotchy. My wrinkles haven't gone away (nothing will accomplish that), but eb5 seems to add moisture that minimizes the appearance of my wrinkles. I love that ""Anti-Aging"" eb5 cream, and it's replaced my Origins cream I used to apply nightly.The eb5 ""Intense Moisture Anti-Aging"" cream also makes my skin smooth and is a good moisturizer, but my skin doesn't feel or look as hydrated as when I use the other eb5 cream. I haven't used this one as long, but it feels lighter than I prefer and lacks the firming feel of the other eb5 cream. This one seems better suited for those who prefer lighter creams and who may not suffer from really dry skin. I do like that the ""Intense Moisture"" cream absorbs quickly and works well under my makeup. I like it's consistency as a daytime moisturizer a lot, except it lacks sunscreen so it's only good certain times of the year since I live in a climate that's sunny a lot of the year. As a night cream, it's just not concentrated or rich enough for my taste. I've tried using it as a night cream instead of the other eb5 ""Anti-Aging"" cream, but it just doesn't feel as soothing or seem as effective. I think the ""Intense Moisture"" cream is a very good cream that others who like lighter creams may even prefer, but the regular ""Anti-Aging"" eb5 cream just seems more concentrated, richer and effective for my dry, sensitive skin.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJRF4J18MM68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHZDOB4#wasThisHelpful","R2IJRF4J18MM68","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*REVIEW OF FREE PRODUCT*Wow, this Ecomoist screen cleaner seriously works better than any screen cleaner I've ever tried for my iPads, iPhones and computers over the years. The screens look so incredibly spotless and lint free after cleaning with Ecomoist, and it leaves no tacky or sticky residue. Plus, Ecomoist has no odor, and it contains no harsh chemicals to get on my fingers or add to the environment. It's biodegradable, hypoallergenic and natural, and contains a short list of ingredients: water, a cleaning agent derived from palm kernel or coconut, a natural water softener and food grade citric acid. I also like that this small size of Ecomoist (with the included microfiber cloth) is nice and light to tote in my purse. I was buying pricey disposable lens/screen cleaning wipes that don't perform anywhere close to Ecomoist and left a tacky residue that bugged me. Plus, they smelled of alcohol and left my fingers feeling so dry. I won't be purchasing them anymore, and in the future I will definitely buy Ecomoist because it's natural and outperforms all screen cleaners I've tried in the past. This is truly an awesome product that won't disappoint, and I highly recommend it!

"My son just took the PSAT and will be taking the SAT next school year. This Kaplan guide is comprehensive and really excellent. It answers my own questions about various topics (such as the optional essay on the new SAT), and I'm recommending it to my son because, if he reads this Kaplan guide and does the practice tests, I believe he'll be in good shape for the new SAT. If he still needs more practice, my understanding is free tests are available at the Khan Academy website, or we can always search for additional resources. But I see no reason why this Kaplan guide isn't, at a minimum, an excellent place to begin serious test preparation.This Kaplan guide covers a large volume of information (it's over 700 pages), but it manages to make the material digestible and not so overwhelming. It provides general information about the SAT, and covers other topics like the new SAT format, strategies for test-taking (and provides concrete examples) and substantive information on subject areas to be tested. Three practice tests (one in the book and two online) are included with this guide. Explanatory answers are provided for multiple choice questions that are insightful. The guide provides helpful tips and notes throughout that provide important guidance. A student who has worked through this guide will walk into the test with a strategy, and I believe the time pressure is unlikely to be as daunting.The Kaplan guide has a visual appeal that makes it more engaging to read. It's long (over 700 pages), but part of the reason is the type font is large, and the pages aren't crammed too full, and I think it's more inviting and easier to read as a result. I like things like the calculator pictures used to idenify math questions where a calculator is allowed. The visual layout of the chapters also makes it easier to focus- for example, chapters begin with a clear statement of objectives. Rather than just describe how to write an essay, a template is provided to nail down an approach in advance for the optional SAT essay.The guide successfully combines visual elements with the written word to break the content down so the student won't get too bored, frustrated or overwhelmed. This Kaplan guide is an excellent tool to help a student succeed on the SAT, and it's the resource I'm recommending to my own son to use for his SAT preparation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JPXZCG84EDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231547#wasThisHelpful","R12JPXZCG84EDD","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Amazon really got it right with the design of this hanging toiletry bag. This bag is incredibly lightweight and compact, but at the same time it provides ample room. The black is neutral and this could be used by a man or a woman. My husband easily fits his toiletries into this bag and has room to spare, so he can even use the outside pockets for a phone charger and other odds and ends. I can fit everything I need for travel, except a few oddball things (like my big round brush) that need to pack separately. I'd describe this as a compact medium bag that should be sized right for most people.This toiletry bag is made of strong polyester with sturdy zippers, and it feels durable. When closed, the bag has a convenient grab handle at the top for carrying it. The bag unzips to reveal a small lightweight hanger for a door hook, shower rod or door knob. This bag makes packing easy, it takes no counter space (often limited in a hotel especially if you're not alone) and when it's hanging open it's so easy to view the contents and find needed items. It's so much better than digging through a bag looking for items- that drives me nuts. This bag is also really great if you're on the move a lot during your travels and don't have time to unpack and repack.I love all the compartments for staying organized. The main interior compartment is about the size of a dopp bag and has two mesh and two regular pockets that are open at the top. A long deep pocket runs down the inside back of the bag, and the bag has two zippered see-through mesh pockets inside. The outside has two zippered compartments (one on each side) perfect for items that could leak, or they good be used for anything from charging cables to toothbrush and toothpaste, an electric or disposable razor, comb, small hairbrush, etc.This AmazonBasics bag is nothing fancy, but it has everything a hanging toiletry bag needs to make travel easier. Aside from travel, this hanging toiletry bag can be used at home for organization, keeping items within reach (rather than in lower sink cabinets) and keeping items off the counter. This would also be great for dorm use too. I'm super impressed with the quality and design of this AmazonBasics hanging toiletry bag and definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28E899RFS9QJY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTHIVHQ#wasThisHelpful","R28E899RFS9QJY","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a combination micro/lightening pin cable free and am providing my honest opinion. This is a totally cool cable. I love having one cable capable of charging devices that use a micro cable and my Apple devices that need a lightening pin cable. It's a perfect cable to tote in my purse since it's versatile, and I only need to carry the one cable. Also, this cable is thick and sturdy and seems durable like it will last. The fact that it's coiled is unique- I don't have another like it. It reminds me of an old-fashioned telephone cord both in looks and sturdiness and because it's coiled it never tangles-another reason I like toting this one in my purse.The cable functions perfectly in that it charges my Apple and other devices well, and I have not received any messages that it's an unsupported accessory. Because it's coiled, the cable seems shorter than it is and my accessories aren't heavy enough to keep the cable extended. But if I need the extra length it's just a matter of pulling on the cable to extend it and when I'm done it simply coils up again. I like it because it's sufficiently long for my needs, and being coiled makes it seem less cluttered on my desk. Overall, I'm impressed with the fact this cable has the dual ability to charge micro and lightening pin devices, it reduces clutter, the coiled cord is tangle-free and expandable, the cable is sturdy and it performs well. This is a premium cable that I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCCF82EW5UF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR25HP4#wasThisHelpful","ROCCF82EW5UF","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This TP-LINK Bluetooth Music Receiver (Receiver) is not a speaker. Instead, it's a gadget that allows me to stream audio from my Bluetooth enabled devices (like my iPad) through another speaker device that lacks the capability to connect directly to my iPad via Bluetooth. I've used the Receiver with my car stereo and also a Philips speaker system, and setup is fast for both, the Receiver works well for enabling streaming audio from my iPad over the sound devices, and the sound quality is very good.The Receiver needs a power source, and how it will connect will vary depending on your equipment. In my Jeep, I can choose between two power sources. I can plug the USB cable (included) into the power plug (also included) and plug that right into a regular power outlet I have behind my middle console. Or, I can skip the power plug and just plug the USB cable directly into a USB charger I have in my cigarette lighter socket. Either way, the opposite end of the USB cable just plugs into the Receiver. The next step is to plug the AUX cable into both the Receiver and the AUX jack on my car stereo. The last step is pairing my iPad with the Receiver via Bluetooth-which takes only a few seconds. Once connected, I can wirelessly stream music and other audio my iPad to my car stereo, and it sounds really great.I've also used the Receiver with a Philips speaker system that lacks any Bluetooth. In that case, the Receiver gets its power by plugging the small end of the USB cable into the Receiver and the large end into a USB port on the Philips. Only the Philips plugs into the wall socket. Next, one end of the AUX cable plugs into the Philips and the other end plugs into the Receiver. Then I just pair my iPad to the Receiver, and I can stream audio from my iPad over the Philips speaker system- which sounds better and more powerful than listening to music or movies straight from my iPad.Overall, the TP-LINK Receiver is very good. It's an easy fix in order to stream music and other audio from your iPad (or other Bluetooth devices) to speaker systems that lack the capability to connect by Bluetooth, it comes with everything you need in the box (including an RCA cable I haven't needed to use), and it fully lives up to my expectations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EUXC9I2ZQUF9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPATOEE#wasThisHelpful","R3EUXC9I2ZQUF9","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very constructed travel umbrella, though it has a few potential issues. I'm impressed with the design of the canopy- the polyester material is strong, it has a wide over hang and about a 36"" wide span to keep you dry. The double canopy has vents in each panel to let air pass through so it won't invert in the wind, and the material overlaps enough so rain should not get through the vents. That's a great  feature that really grabbed my attention as I've had umbrellas that invert in the wind and become useless and also break. The steel frame feels very strong and should also help keep the canopy in tact. The small downside of the strong frame is the umbrella feels a little heavy compared to other travel umbrellas. But the extra weight is minor and a trade off for the quality construction.This umbrella has a nicely sewn velcro closure, and the umbrella wraps tight enough to fit back into the sleeve. I appreciate the sleeve because when it rains I often need to put my damp umbrella back into my tote bag during my commute. The umbrella also looks nice and professional in dark black. Opening the umbrella is a cinch as it automatically opens with the press of a button. But closing it isn't quite so easy. There's a down arrow button you push to close the canopy portion, but you have to manually push the canopy and pole down until it snaps closed. I do find it more difficult to close than my other umbrellas, though it's just a slight annoyance. But it could be too hard to close for some, like perhaps someone with arthritis.As to the height of the pole, it seems average to me as compared to my other travel umbrellas, and it suits me fine. If you're used to a full size umbrella, however, it may be too short. When open, the height of the umbrella from the top down to the handle bottom is roughly 20"". The only thing about the design that bothers me is the handle size. The handle itself is solid snd feels like a nonslippery rubbery material (which I like), but it's too short, stubby and awkward in my hand. There's a loop I can also slip my hand through which helps me hang onto the umbrella (and allows me to carry it hands free or hang up when not in use), but the slightly sloped handle measures only about 2-1/2"" and is just too short and fat for me to get a really comfortable grip. I can still use the umbrella, but the handle annoys me.Overall, this umbrella is very nice and has excellent features-especially its durable construction, winds vents, nice size canopy for a travel umbrella and professional look. As mentioned, it feels a bit on the heavy side for a commuter and closing it takes some effort. But it's really only the short and stubby handle that bothers me enough to take off one star and give this otherwise well-made umbrella 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZYISD656JP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WTHJ5SU#wasThisHelpful","R38ZYISD656JP6","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenox has really designed a beautiful little porcelain holiday dish. The holly and berries design with gold trim make this dish elegant and classic, but at the same time the square shape gives it an updated modern look. It's a perfect dish for entertaining at the holidays- a single dish could be used for candy, appetizers, condiments or even just to display. A set of these would be perfect to use as individual dessert dishes or side dishes for a holiday meal. This dish is dishwasher safe- so it's beautiful and practical. I really love this dish and highly recommend it- whether you buy just one or multiple dishes to add to your dinnerware place settings.

"We have two bathrooms in our house with no windows. It's the absolute worst poo design as there's no escaping the stench after someone does their business. Poo Pourri has really improved our situation because it actually works! The spray bottle says it contains natural essential oils (though it's unclear to me if anything else is added). The directions call for more, but two sprays in the bowl before someone takes a poo works perfect. I can see the oil floating on top of the toilet bowl water and once that poo drops in the bowl it's below the oil and its odor is trapped. Poo Pourri really does create an effective barrier that keeps the smell from escaping.I've tried Juniper Woods and Rose Geranium and both smell pleasant and certainly better than poo. Citrus dominates both in my opinion, though Juniper also has woodsy notes and Rose also has floral notes. I have a slight preference for Juniper Woods only because it doesn't smell quite as strong to me yet it's strong enough to work. The sprayers on both bottles I received work well, with no problem getting the oil into the bowl (rather than on the seat), and no dribble running down the outside of the container. I honestly thought Poo Pourri was going to be a gimmick- but it really works, and this is an excellent product I will buy in the future because I really don't like the smell of poo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NH870T93511L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW6S75K#wasThisHelpful","R3NH870T93511L","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The college team logos on these Hefty cups are cool, and the cups hold a generous 18oz. (more than 2 cups). They're a decent choice for beer or soda at a college party. Even when fully filled, however, these cups tend to collapse in while holding them as the plastic is thin and flexible. The upside is they use less plastic and none have cracked because they are flexible. I don't find these cups to be the most comfortable to hold because they squeeze in when I'm holding them, and I also think they could lead to spills.

"This is a dry powder cleanser that you apply to your wet hands and rub until it creates a lather to massage on your face. It lathers unexpectedly well given that it's a dry powder. The first ingredient is talc followed by other ingredients, such as exotic sounding wildflower extracts, ginkgo biloba, flaxseed and other interesting ingredients. The container says it's made for sensitive skin, and it does seems gentle in that I've had no adverse reaction. This cleanser gets my face clean, but it feels drying to my aging skin. It may be better for women who have oily skin or acne- I'm speculating but perhaps the talc and other powders absorb oil. As a daily cleanser, this doesn't suit me because my skin feels tight and dry afterwards. At most, I will use this occasionally hoping to exfoliate dry skin.The other issue for me is the cleanser is such a fine light powder that it's airborne- like baby powder. I try to pour it carefully so it doesn't escape into the environment, but I still see powder escape into the air that I don't want to breathe and really don't want my asthmatic child who shares the bathroom to inhale. An airborne powdery cleanser just isn't ideal for my household. The container is so attractive, but the lid isn't good as powder leaks out of the hole even when closed, and it also ends up on the rim under the lid. This cleanser has some really nice attributes and may be good for some people. But I find it drying, and I don't like that the fine powder escapes into the air.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5FS2FM4XQ7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZK6C8WM#wasThisHelpful","R2M5FS2FM4XQ7H","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Xen-Tan weekly ultra dark self tanner is a high end product that produces visible quick results and has a really pleasant light vanilla scent. This tanner turns my pale skin really dark- I haven't had any sun in so long I was slightly shocked as to how dark it turned my skin. Although I'm pale, I have an olive skin tone and this tanner produces a good olive tone when applied to my skin. I don't get any hint of orange, and the color is a really rich and dark brown color. I also use a medium color Xen-Tan tanner that I really love and prefer to this one as it's a more natural look for me, and I get a more even application when I use it. This darker color shows more imperfections (though people who use tanner a lot won't have the same issue). This Xen-Tan lotion promises a dark tan, and it definitely delivers and turns my skin very dark, it lasts all week and it smells great too. It's pricey, but the tube is large and will last me months as I use it for my arms, legs and feet mostly rather than my whole body.

"This Colgate mouthwash should be swished around a full minute to really cover your teeth before spitting it out, and you're supposed to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything. I can't say if Colgate's claim that this mouthwash results in stronger tooth enamel is true or not, nor can I evaluate the laundry list of artificial ingredients listed on the bottle (also typical of other mouthwash brands). But I really like the mint taste- it's not too intense yet it's strong enough to leave my mouth feeling clean and I hope it gets rid of any bad breath. I also appreciate that this is alcohol-free mouthwash, especially given the possibility that alcohol in mouthwash may increase the risk of oral cancer. Despite no alcohol, I do still get mild a burning sensation after rinsing about 30 seconds, but it's not strong like other brands and is very tolerable.

"For men, the Bodygroom 1100 is an excellent compliment to one of the bigger models like the Bodygroom 3100 (which my husband uses regularly) or 7100 (which we bought for our teen). The trimming head on the 1100 is smaller like a disposable razor, and it fits and glides more easily in smaller contoured areas, such as under the arms and in the private parts area. The 1100 has a protective guard that prevent cuts and it can be swapped with a little comb attachment to trim hair to 1/8"".  My husband and I have been using the 1100 a couple weeks and neither of us have been nicked or cut. All models, including the 1100, can be used wet or dry, but my husband and I agree they all work best on dry skin pulled taut. Unlike other models, the 1100 doesn't have a rechargeable battery and instead runs on one AA battery (included).I don't recommend the 1100 as a substitute for the 3100 or 7100 because it has less power and such a small trimming head, so it would take too much time and effort for whole body grooming (unless you hardly have any body hair). The 3100 and 7100 are far more powerful and have bigger trimming heads to shave or trim larger and hairier areas better and faster. But the 1100 is perfect for smaller areas that are delicate or contoured (like arm pits and private parts), and my husband finds it more comfortable and efficient to use the 1100 in those areas as the 3100 is larger and harder to maneuver due to its overall size and trimming head size (though it does work). It's easier to trim underarm hair to a more even length with the 1100.I've tested the 1100 and 3100 myself even though I'm a woman. I love the smaller 1100 used on dry skin for a quick shave of my legs or underarms, and it also works great for bikini area trimming and shaving. I really notice the benefits when I shave my shins and knees because I'm prone to get cuts and nicks there with a regular razor. The shave doesn't feel as close as a regular razor, but my legs look clean-shaven, I can shave quickly without cutting myself and it's just less effort as I can sit and relax to shave rather than deal with it in the shower where I have to perch on one leg (which is hard with a bad back). I have more hair on my forearms than I prefer, and I really like using the comb attachment there as it takes just a minute, and the results looks natural.The 1100 is so easy to clean. Just take the guard off and rinse or use the included brush to cleans the hairs out. There's no charger to store, and it can just hang from a shower caddy (whether being used in the shower or not). I'm a big fan of the 1100 as it's an excellent compliment to a larger body groomer for men, and as a woman I like it better than the larger body groomers for shaving my legs and underarms, trimming my arm hair and bikini area grooming. I think it's a great product and give it 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39NS2M3NYER3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010XIGBUQ#wasThisHelpful","R39NS2M3NYER3S","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Izze flavored sparkling water is light, refreshing and fruity. Izze comes in glass bottles, which I prefer over plastic bottles or cans when it comes to taste. This Izze water is similar to flavored Perrier sparkling water, except Izze has a hint of sugar and comes in a unique flavor assortment.  Each bottle has 2 grams of organic sugar and only 10 calories. Izze isn't sweet tasting to me- the sugar just seems to bring out the fruity taste a little more. These taste best cold, especially because they have a lot of carbonation. I enjoy all three flavors, though raspberry watermelon is a stand out to me and blackberry pear is just so-so. My husband and son also like Izze and also preferred the raspberry watermelon flavor. I love grapefruit Perrier, and I can't say that Izze beats the taste for me. But I really enjoy the variety of flavors Izze offers and like adding Izze to the mix. I like Izze enough to purchase it in the future, although  at the time of this review the price seems high at $2 a bottle. I enjoy Izze flavored sparkling water and recommend it because it's tasty, light and refreshing and low in calories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF881E4AN9DXZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSW3AQW#wasThisHelpful","RF881E4AN9DXZ","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Whoozit Learn and Play Cube is super portable, stores easily and is loaded with discovery and learning activities. It's an awesome toy because some activities can be independently explored by babies 9 months and older, but mostly I view the cube as a fun way for an older sibling or adult to teach new concepts to a developing child from 9 months to about 3 years old. It seems doubtful a 9-month old will play with this toy alone for long periods, but this toy will grow with baby and be more interesting with interactive explanations -there are a lot of activities and concepts wrapped up in this colorful and busy toy and many concepts (e.g., names of colors, counting with numbers, etc.) won't resonate with such a young child unless explained by an older sibling or adult.Most babies under a year old like my nephew will have fun exploring some things alone, such as pressing the colorful notes to play music and light up the clouds (which teaches cause and effect), exploring the crinkly material, playing with the abacus beads, finding one's own reflection in the mirror and maybe even trying to stack the pieces. But the size of the unfolded cube with so many activities may overwhelm a 9-month old trying to maneuver it alone, though others that age may find it really stimulating- it really depends on the child. But especially as baby grows, parents can use this cube to teach colors, numbers, the concept of a clock and telling time and many other things. Thankfully, this cube toy is so compact and stores easily, so it's not a hassle to keep around for a couple years in order to fully explore what is has to offer as your baby grows. It may not engross your little one as much as something simple like pushing a car around the house, but it teaches more and is a bright stimulating toy that I recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0L2F2IYGWAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HH52TA#wasThisHelpful","RE0L2F2IYGWAQ","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"10/18/2015: I'm upgrading to 5 stars. I've used this case daily for over a month, and it looks as good as the day I received it. The gold isn't rubbing off, the case is so slim and comfortable to hold, and I haven't grown tired of the design. Love it!------------------This is an awesome case if you want a fun case that maintains the slim profile and size of your iPhone 6 yet still provides moderate protection. This Belkin one piece case matches my gold iPhone so well and fits perfectly. It covers the back and sides of my iPhone, including the volume controls and the on/off switch. The cut outs are perfect for the camera lens, earphone jack and speaker. The case wraps so it makes a lip over the edge of the iPhone face that's thick enough that the face shouldn't hit the ground in a drop, and it also won't get scratched if it's turned face down on a rough surface or table. The case is also raised to protect the camera lens. The fit is nice and snug, but the case isn't frustrating to take on and off.  The case is made of a flexible rather than hard plastic and has a super high gloss that looks sleek and attractive- I really love the shiny black contrast against the white face of my iPhone.This case feels comfortable to hold and doesn't feel slippery- the best grip is at the perimeter of the case where it feels more rubbery. I personally love the XOXO design- it appeals to my juvenile side (yes, I'm a grownup who loved Gossip Girl) but the regal gold and black color combo with pretty floral detail also gives this fun case a sophisticated look. If you want military grade drop protection, I wouldn't recommend this case, but it provides ample protection for my needs on an ordinary day. (I do like to switch cases around depending on my activities and also just for fun.)  This case is perfect for Qi charging because it fits over my Bezalel Qi adapter BEZALEL Qi Wireless Charger Charging Receiver Patch Module for iPhone 6/6 Plus | Ultra Slim 0.5 mm New Improved Wireless Receiver Module Chip without creating a bulge, and my iPhone can charge while in this case on my Belkin Qi charger. Belkin Qi Wireless Charging Pad, Compatible with any Qi-enabled smartphone including Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 edge and Nexus 7- Retail Packaging - Black This is a cool case that's fun and makes me happy! XOXO!*I'm attaching photos of my iPhone 6 with the Bezalel Qi adapter inside the Belkin case. Also, you may wonder why I haven't given this case 5 stars. I want to use it longer to see how the gold design holds up, and will upgrade to 5 stars if it doesn't shows signs of wear after awhile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VK6TNFBFII5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R521LZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1VK6TNFBFII5Z","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This AHAVA cream makes my hands feel super soft and silky without making my hands greasy. This cream is thick and white, and I find it so soothing to my dry hands. I was curious about the difference between the original AHAVA ""mineral hand cream"" and this ""witch hazel cream"" where ""minerals meet botanicals.""  Having used both and looked at both labels, I think the fragrance is the primary difference. Both hand creams moisturize very well and both contain almost the same ingredients-including witch hazel and flower water- though some ingredients are listed in a slightly different order and the mineral cream has Dead Sea water whereas the witch hazel cream has Dead Sea salt.  Both have moderately strong fragrance, but the witch hazel cream has a stronger scent that's sweeter and seems floral, and I prefer the scent of the mineral hand cream. I find the scent on the witch hazel cream dissipates a lot after an hour, but still remains noticeable. This witch hazel AHAVA cream is a very good hand cream, though I don't recommend it to anyone who is allergic to (or doesn't like) fragrance as this cream has a strong scent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38JRJY3X5GOCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPO4T7U#wasThisHelpful","R38JRJY3X5GOCN","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Genuine Joe plastic cold beverage cups are crystal clear and generously sized to hold two full cups (16 ounces). These are comfortable to hold and have a nice grip due to a ridge on the cups about an inch from the bottom and a few ridges closer to the top just below the lip. The lip of the cup feels comfortable to drink from. These cups are just the right thickness- they're thick and sturdy so they don't collapse from the pressure of your hand holding the cup, but at the same time they're flexible and are not prone to crack. These are just right (and safer than glass) for outdoor use at the beach, park or pool, and are also good cups for parties and others situations where you don't have enough cups or it's too difficult to deal with cleanup (like after surgery or during illness, etc.). These cups are sturdy enough to hand wash and reuse if you're so inclined, or they can go in the recycle bin. The cups came in a sealed bag, which I like for hygienic reasons. The bag does not indicate the cups are BPA-free (so I assume they are not). Overall, these are very good plastic cups that are handy for occasional use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXE1J6A0RQM5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UZO5II0#wasThisHelpful","RXE1J6A0RQM5E","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kitchen mitt and potholder set is pretty and feminine in the bright pink and white damask design. The fit is nice too- the mitt is roomy but not as bulky or cumbersome like other mitts I've owned. The set is sewn nicely and 100% cotton, and the mitt and potholder are thick and well-padded. These are really decorative and have loops so they can hang to be displayed. In testing them, I like using this set best for grabbing pan handles that heat up on top of the stove. I also like to set hot items down on top of them.When it comes to using this set to remove hot items from the oven, this set performs as well as any other cotton sets I've owned. But my experience with all cotton mitts and potholders is it's easy to get burned removing heavy or really hot items from the oven. I use this set for removing items like warm plates or lightweight cookie sheets that I only need to grab a few seconds out of my oven heated under 350 degrees. For higher temperatures or when in doubt, I always rely on silicone mitts as they can withstand much higher heat.All in all, I love how pretty this kitchen set is in bright pink and white, and it's well-made, functional and also reasonably priced. I think this set would be a nice housewarming gift for a young woman moving out for the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8W9PQKC2KYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRI8B2#wasThisHelpful","R3F8W9PQKC2KYG","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this Viva Labs Organic Cacao Powder because I started making smoothies out of an organic plant-based protein powder that was resulting in tasteless smoothies no matter what I threw in the blender.  I wanted to add chocolate to make the smoothies taste better, but at the same time I wanted chocolate that would add nutritional value rather than sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or other additives. So I started adding a tablespoon of this Organic Cacao Powder to my smoothies. Not only do my smoothies taste delicious now, they are getting added antioxidants and nutrients like potassium, magnesium and chromium, and added fiber too. And I'm finding other uses for this cacao powder, such as sprinkling it on top of my cappuccinos and making vegan hot chocolate drinks for family members with allergies by adding this to soy or almond milk. This cacao powder tastes mild yet flavorful and delicious, it smells wonderful and it's not acidic like some other cacao powder I've bought. It has no sugar, so I can decide how much and what kind of sweetener to add (if any). This is a huge 32 oz. bag of 100% certified organic cacao powder (no additives) sourced from Criollo beans rather than Forastero beans that I've read are largely cultivated for mass production. I'm really happy to have found this delicious organic cacao powder and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTB0MGPCGT1GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6TUO5G#wasThisHelpful","RTB0MGPCGT1GS","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LeapFrog toy tool set is adorable and a perfect learning toy for my 2 year old nephew. But it does get one star off for being so loud. The switch was left on during transit, and when the USPS driver came up our walkway I could hear music playing from the toy loud and clear even though packed in a box. So you can imagine how loud it is once out of the box! I'm sure the USPS driver was more than happy get this package dropped off. But other than being so loud, this toy tool set is an awesome little learning toy for toddlers around 2-3 years old like my nephew.Luckily, the volume switch can be turned off. But there's fun stuff to do when the volume is on- your child can press the door with a picture of Scout the puppy, which triggers different learning activities and songs about counting, colors, basic measuring and what different tools do. Scout asks about the number of walls- which requires counting to 4. Press again, and Scout tells your child to get the ruler and teaches the basic concept of measuring. Scout likes to sing songs, like a silly counting song that teaches counting to 10.It's a great set for teaching primary colors as the tools are different colors and match objects. So, the red wrench tightens a red bolt, and a blue screwdriver turns a blue triangle (that makes noise to sound like your child is actually building). The orange hammer matches the orange nails to hammer to build Scout's house. The green saw is used to saw wood to build the house. Of course, there's no building to be done as the house is all attached by hinges, but that's where a kid's imagination comes in so handy. It's a good toy for my nephew to tinker around with and learn numbers, colors and tools in a fun way. It's fun, durable and has learning value, so I give it 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3SXYLVNWHTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJ1O6P8#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3SXYLVNWHTQ","A2L6BT1PVV9YN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2L6BT1PVV9YN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There's also a really strong shoulder strap.

"This is seriously one of the best storage caddies I've ever used. It's got everything going for it: it's well made (you're not destroying this baby anytime soon!), it's easy to see what's inside, it has more exterior storage pockets of a good size that hold almost anything you're going to need for a bath or shower. The handle is padded, too, and the interior, while not huge, really does have enough room for you to carry almost everything, except maybe a towel.I love the rubberized material it's made of. It's pleasant to touch, which isn't always the case with these kind of items.

If you have nothing in this carrier, it just folds up (which is a good thing, though, since you can store it easily.) The other detail is I wish it was a bit bigger.

"This is gonna be one of those products you aren't going to think is any good - until you get it. My Noontec headphones (which I use for my iphone) were getting 'stretchy' and falling off my head, so I was thinking it was time for a replacement. I was contacted to review these headphones. When I first saw the picture I was like, well, they're ugly enough. But I was looking for something that would work long enough for me to justify a new expensive headphone set.I got them, and I almost laughed. They came in a sealed ziploc bag, the kind of thing you get small quantities of dog kibble in. I cut the bag open (why would you want to reseal headphones?), and I saw a very nice PVC case, about 8 inches around, with a high quality zipper. I wouldn't swear this case would protect the headphones from a truck driving over them, but it's easily the nicest case I've ever had headphones arrive in, and that includes headphones topping $100.I didn't have a choice as to the color of headphones I got, the set being the one with the blue ear pads. I wasn't expecting nice. I was surprised! First, ignore the picture. These are ATTRACTIVE headphones. The blue part isn't powder blue like the picture; it's almost a metallic, rubberized deeper blue. The silver accents on the headphones are very nice, attractive, not flashy.Second surprise: these are comfortable! The headphones part that goes over the head is padded, as are the earphones. It's got a snug, but not tight fit (they are adjustable, but they fit me perfectly right out of the zippered box.) So now it was time to try the sound. I played a few songs through my laptop, and it was good. Not great, but much, much better than any $20 headphone set has a right to be.Next, I tried to see how I would sound to someone else. I called several people; no one said a thing (like asking me if I was talking underwater, the comment I got from one pair of headphones I tried.) So I asked outright, how do I sound? These are new headphones. Everyone said fine, they couldn't tell the difference between this and the Noontec, which are three times more pricey. One friend said she thought I sounded a little tinny, but she said that went away as I adjusted the microphone.I can't find anything bad to say about these earphones...well, maybe one thing. The microphone cord is not detachable, so when that dies, these earphones are gone. The other thing, which is really odd, is that the cord has a fabric feel to it, like an old fashioned iron that you plug into the wall (think your grandmother's house.) I've never SEEN a cord like this on a headphone set! It's functional, but just odd.But for $20? Believe me, if you like over the head earphones like I do, you could not get a better deal! They will surely last more than enough time for me to get a new headphone set - but who knows? I may not need that for a long, long time!(I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1QL26FE3M64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMQKWE#wasThisHelpful","R2I1QL26FE3M64","A2JCJJNY43QQIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JCJJNY43QQIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first product I've used from this manufacturer.

I do like that the ingredients seem to be of a high quality, and the price for the bottle is reasonable. Others have brought up questions on the formulation, which are legit; there seems to be a proprietary blend in this, and the manufacturer is loathe to reveal the details.Fair enough.

"I am so leery of cosmetic claims that this potion or that elixir reduces cellulite. It's just an anatomical impossibly to put something on  your skin and make cellulite go away.That's why I'm so cautious about this Vichy cream. It is, generally speaking, an excellent company, but excellent companies on occasion make claims that just aren't so. I have to say, after using this on my problem thigh areas, that yes, the cellulite I have does not appear to be as noticeable.I was so convinced this was my imagination I let my best friend and my husband both look. My husband was kind of like, 'What's cellulite?', but said my legs looked good. My BF said the skin appeared smooth, not so dimpled.This isn't a cure-all, and it's not a miracle thing. I just notice that there appears to be less of the annoying cellulite in that irksome area.Please take this FWIW; your mileage may definitely vary.

"I have a fair complexion, and I'm generally fine with it. Occasionally, though, a slight tan would be nice. My problem is that if I go in the sun, no matter what I do, I burn. So I slather on the sunscreen and realize I'm never going to be a golden girl.Xen-Tan is an interesting product. It goes on easily, and it really does create the illusion of a tan. But from the few times I have gotten any kind of tan (usually from when my burned skin gave up the ghost and resigned itself to tanning), I don't recall there ever being any orange cast to it. Let me be clear: I don't look like a popsicle with Xen-Tan. The orangey thing is light, but it is noticeable.If you're OK with that, this may be the way to go for a good faux tan.

"This travel pillow is extremely sift, but very firm as well, which I like because it helps give support. The outside cover is so deliciously soft that there is no discomfort. It cradles the neck so you can catch a few winks during travel.Speaking of the cover, it completely removes for easy washing. And it's not impossible to put back on, either, like I was afraid it would be. My advice would be to put the legs of the pillow in first, and shimmy them up like a stocking. The cover also comes with an elastic strap, so it can be attached to the headset of your chair, or be strapped to your luggage while walking. It's not extremely durable, so I wouldn't recommend playing tug o war with it, but it gets the job done nicely.There is no smell, which is nice.

"i have several essential oils that i use that i distribute directly to an item, and a glass spray bottle is the perfect way to do it. take lavender, for instance. using a dropper (which comes with most essential oils) would only apply the oil to a very small spot on the pillow, which is one of the places i like to apply it. with a spray bottle, i can put it over a larger area, at just the right amount of concentration. i put lavender on pillows, on sleeping masks, on cotton dryer balls. i use lemon oil to make my bathroom smell fresh and clean. i use peppermint in the kitchen, to ward off ants, spiders, and other vermin.glass of a dark color is the best way to store essential oils. light and heat can break the oils down, making them less effective or spoiled. and the package even comes with labels, so you don't get your bottles mixed up.a diffuser dispenses the scents throughout the room, but if you want your oils to have exact application and find that a dropper just isn't doing it for you, i recommend these pretty blue bottles.sample was provided at at discount for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJOY5B2ZI2MS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01695MZ9S#wasThisHelpful","R1FJOY5B2ZI2MS","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"as detailed in the description, it's not a total blackout screen, but provides plenty of privacy. it's perfect for someone with a pool in the backyard, or a house with large windows or doors made mostly of windows, like sliding glass. it works up to six feet tall, and can wrap around fifty feet. plenty of air can get through the fence, so the backyard can feel as pleasant as it usually does, instead of stifling hot from lack of fresh air. it comes in a few different colors.i took a star off for user compatibility. not all fences are the same, and it's hard to work. and there are no breaks in the screen. if you want a door or gate, you are out of luck. this screen would work better if it came in panels, or if it could be sectioned up in some way. overlapping is not an issue, but unless you have one continuous line of fence for fifty feet, you're not going to be able to use it very effectively. another review suggested burning the cut edge so it won't fray, so i will probably do something similar for my fence.otherwise a great product. fifty feet is a very generous amount, and it wrapped around nearly my entire yard. as expected in a product like this, it holds up through just about any weather condition.sample was provided for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N0YI63GBA3LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCPM8D6#wasThisHelpful","R3N0YI63GBA3LN","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"i have this same case in a couple of different sizes, because i recommend them to others. it's a great case for someone that wants to preserve that thin, sleek look that their phone has, but still give plenty of protection.the geometrical design of the back allows the fingers to properly grip the phone while in the hand, and feels smooth and looks great. the kickstand can be used for both landscape and portrait positions, and slides back into the case completely flat and streamlined.it has the cut outs for all the ports, and does not come with a screen protector. it comes in a belt clip, but i don't often use it, because i can't flip the phone around to fit into the clip. so for women that don't attach their phone to their belt, they might find that they are accidentally leaving the clip in random places, like i do, because it's awkward to hold the clip and operate the phone. so i often just leave it at home and just opt to have the back of the case on my phone. i have a glass screen protector on it, so it feels more secure. the clip rotates for added convenience.i really like this case because it's so thin. it adds hardly any bulk to the phone at all. it's hard (first world problems, i know) to have a large phone, and even harder when a big thick case makes it so it won't even fit into a pocket. with this case, anything that my naked phone can fit into, it can continue to fit into. i recommend this case to others.sample was provided for free for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZ46YKG01A0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OVG98XY#wasThisHelpful","RTZ46YKG01A0K","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"the concept and design of these glasses, while not perfect, is pretty revolutionary. there are five lenses that are interchangeable, according to your needs, and there's even a space for prescription lenses (also removable), so just about everyone could use these glasses.once i got used to changing the lenses, there's a quick and simple trick to them, so changing them is as quick and pulling them off and putting them back on. and they come in a convenient, hard case, with slots for each lens, as well as the glasses themselves.the only issue is the prescription lens holder. it's specifically designed for one shape only. i pried the lenses from an old pair of glasses and fit them in, but the shape was off, so i feel cross eyed when wearing them. perhaps they could be taken to your eye doctor, to be fitted with a set that work better. that's my next step.even with my (very, VERY thick) lenses, the glasses are extremely comfortable to wear. the nose guard is padded so well you can barely feel it, and the arms fit the sides of my head very well. even with some sweating, they don't slip very much. i was pleasantly surprised at this feature. i recommend them to others.sample was provided at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIYA59F775VX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NVPTR4#wasThisHelpful","RIYA59F775VX9","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"now that winter is upon us, we've found mice in the house. we set a few traps and caught them, but we still had more. then the rats moved in, and took care of our mouse problem! while it was a sweet gesture, they've decided they like our home too much and have appeared in our kitchen every night since.i love animals, but a pest is a pest, and rats can be aggressive, and carry diseases. so i do prefer to repel them, but i will do anything to get rid of the infestation before it gets out of hand. since i don't like messing with rat carcasses, i figured i'd give this mace a try.the smell coming from this mace is what holds the key to its repellent properties. it's quite a strong smell, but it has a peppermint scent, so it almost reminds me of christmas. if you have an aversion to peppermint, the smell might be too much.the mace can be put in a paper bag, with some holes in it, to help keep it fresh. however, i didn't find that to be as efficient as i was hoping. it worked for maybe a day or two, but that was it.instead, i simply applied it liberally wherever i thought it would be most useful. the smallest size is 2.2 lbs, which is the size i got, i still have almost a full canister, plenty left for later. my house smelled heavenly for several days, and the rats have shied away from those areas. i applied it most heavily in the kitchen, so they've left that room alone, but i still hear them in the basement. i'm going to have to dump a ton down there, too.i would recommend the largest canister, to last through the winter, if you have an infestation such as mine. it seems as though i will be going through this before i would like. it's a decent size, but i personally prefer to have a lot extra on hand, just in case.in conclusion, the mace works, but you have to use a lot of it. good thing there's a lot in the canister!sample was provided at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K2K2D1TL6F3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GKWBB0#wasThisHelpful","R3K2K2D1TL6F3I","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are familiar with the otter box, you will appreciate this case, as they are similar in design, but this case doesn't come with the giant price tag. Just like the otter box, this comes with an inner, hard case, and an outer, soft case, and the belt clip is included. Prying the inner case open can be a bit tricky, so be patient with it, but once it's on, it's very secure.It does add a bit of bulk to it, which is a shame because the iphone 6+ is so slim and appealing, but the protection given cannot be beat.The belt clip swivels for convenience, and the phone can face the clip, for added screen protection, or flip and face out, for screen access.

"Even though this set looks like it came straight from the seventies, when you open the package and feel how soft it is, you'll definitely pause and say, oh my! Your guests will do the same.I normally don't go for browns in the bathroom, and I certainly didn't think dolphins and brown go together, but it works. My bathroom is undecorated and theme less, but I did pick up a shower curt a in on clearance, and it was brown, so I decided to give this set a chance. I'm very glad I did, because they compliment each other very nicely, and it's inspired me to do more with the little dpace. Because the dolphins are brown, I went with more muted tones with the decor, instead of a cartoony appearance I would have been tempted to do if I had a brighter color to work with. There's enough lighter color to ensure the room isn't dim, but I've really enjoyed the outcome of it, and I hate my tiny ugly bathroom a little less. Dolphin decor is extremely easy to find, so I can add to it as I wish.The set itself is made of memory foam, which makes you feel like you're walking on a cloud. It is great for stepping out of the shower, too, if you're like my husband, who walks out almost before he turns the water off. He always soaked previous mats, and left wet footprints across the house. Memory foam soaks that right up.

"This is such a cute piece of jewelry. It's unique, eye catching, and very pretty. I love to see it sparkle as I move my hand.It didn't fit me very well, as it seems to have been made for someone with smaller hands, which is weird because I have small hands. So this would probably be best for a child. It's not the most practical piece. You cannot bend your forefinger while wearing it, so I wouldn't recommend it for day to day activities. It seems to be designed for the left hand only, since the chain is attached in such a fashion, and I'm left handed. I would have preferred something ambidextrous, so I could at least write with it on. It's for decoration only.The rhinestones fall out pretty easily, so I would suggest going through it and ensuring that they are all secure. The tiniest amount of super glue would do the trick, and I'd add a layer of clear nail polish over it, to make sure they stay put.I'm going to include a video to better show what I'm describing.I would say that this would be an excellent gift for a child, perhaps an older child or a teenager, someone who has shown a love for pretty things, and has proven to be responsible.

"I've reviewed tons of silicone rings at this point, and I always find something impressive about each one. This one is buttery smooth, and feels great on the hand. It has the infinity sumbol carved into it, which can be worn on the top, like a stone, or just left to pop up wherever it stopped spinning. It doesn't bother the hand to have it touching other fingers.It's also very thick. Some rings are too thin, so the sought estate tear can eventually make them fall apart. This one is going to last a very long time.Perfect for construction workers, military personnel, or anyone that works with their hands, silicone rings are waterproof, flexible, and comfortable. For anyone that doesn't want to risk losing a finger from catching their metal band on something, someone that doesn't want to risk damaging or losing their more expensive band, or anyone that just wants to make a fashion statement, silicone rings are the way to go. I get several compliments from mine. It's thick enough to cover the horrible ring tattoo I have on my finger, in case I go some place where tattoos are not allowed, but it's comfortable to wear just because.Order your ring size, just like normal.

"an extremely heavy duty piece, this car trunk organizer has been a life saver. i actually haven't put it in my car yet - because of the recent cold weather, i've had a rat infestation that i'm battling, and so i've put some food in the organizer, and put it out of their reach. its holding capacity is quite large, and i have peace of mind knowing that my food is safe.it's designed with collapsible sides, so you can use one side or both, and has outer pockets that can be stretched out, or tightened according to your needs. if you want, you can collapse the entire thing, and clips hold it together so it doesn't flop apart. it is the size of a binder once collapsed, so you can continue to keep it in your trunk, out of the way, not taking up much room, in case you have to put something large in there.the handles are very sturdy. i sometimes have to move it out of the way, and never have an issue with it. it even has holes towards the top, where those mesh holders could be placed, and hooked around, so the contents can be securely placed.because it is so heavy duty, it can put up with a lot of abuse. it's not just for groceries, but tools and sports equipment can be tossed in there as well, and they won't get jostled about in your trunk. it would make a great catch-all for inside the car as well, and could be kicked underfoot if needed. i highly recommend this product.sample was provided for free for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31WYKUYAEH7L9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDAB0DK#wasThisHelpful","R31WYKUYAEH7L9","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"my husband joked that this looked like a mexican wrestling mask, but i think he was just jealous that i didn't share one of them with him.ten masks come in this package, and you can know it's got actual 24k gold in it because it's HEAVY. when i got the package, it was in a box with an electronic item, and i thought the electronic item was what was so heavy. nope, it was my gold masks.application is a bit tricky at first. without support, the mask will slip and slide, and goop together like putty. it doesn't stick to itself, though, so if you do find it slips out of the package, just pick it up and slap it on your face.it pulls a bit on the face if you're standing upright, so make sure you're going to do your spa day right, and make sure the kids are in bed, the lights are dimmed, and you're able to lay on your back and relax for a good while. i think i fell asleep the first night i did one of these masks.it's not actually the amount of moisture in the skin that gives it that youthful look. while proper moisture levels are important, it's the collagen in the skin that gives you your youthful glow. gold is also good for the skin, so the combination is an incredible product that works almost instantaneously. you will be amazed at the results.for me, it took a couple of masks to really see the difference, so definitely try a couple before tossing the package out. it also gives off a lovely smell that wasn't over powering at all. i highly recommend!sample provided at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RXSNA2OQTQPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQUBXX2#wasThisHelpful","R2RXSNA2OQTQPE","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 2:04 Mins i was highly impressed with this set of brushes. while not my best medium, i do love to paint, and prefer taklon or royal taklon bristles. these are synthetic taklon, and just as soft and smooth as expected. i work with acrylic paint, which is water based, so i cannot comment on the performance of oil based paints, but it is my understanding that most brushes do the job well with both bases. as far as acrylic paint is concerned, the performance is flawless. it holds paint well, and application is very smooth.my favorite part is the handles. they're much longer than most brushes i've used before, and usually length = more wood = more weight. this is not the case. they are extremely light, without feeling cheap. the outer paint of the handles have not come off, worn thin, or chipped at all. i always update my reviews, so i will let you know if it ever does.i'm thrilled with these brushes. i made a video, but i don't think it quite captured just how nice they are. you really have to hold them in your hands to experience them, and i can say that you won't be disappointed with this purchase.my only question is where can i find a larger variety? i need round brushes, i need fan brushes, i need a chip brush! let me know, colorbliss!sample was provided at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R308TRDW1H9O5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JOA26E#wasThisHelpful","R308TRDW1H9O5E","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"not only does this product have selfie stick qualities, but it has monopod capabilities as well. this means you can attach it to your tripod, and because it's bluetooth compatible, you can do remote shots. the remote fits onto the handle nicely.the attachment that holds onto the phone itself could be improved. it doesn't hold my note 4, which isn't a huge surprise, because it's such a large phone, so i have one i took from a different stick that i can use. not a huge deal. just something to be prepared for.my favorite part is the telescoping pole. normal selfie sticks just pull straight out to extend, but this one has clips. not only does this give added stability (especially when using it as a monopod), but it ensures you can place it exactly where you want it, and not fear that it's going to move while setting up for the shot.if you are just going to use it as a selfie stick, it comes with a wrist strap for added security.this is a fantastic product, and makes a great gift for the photographing enthusiast in your life.sample was provided at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZHIZL3EGNCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RXPB7Q#wasThisHelpful","R38ZHIZL3EGNCR","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"i was very pleased with this ukulele. i had difficulties with it at first, so i consulted with a good friend of mine, who got her masters in music, and her insight was extremely helpful, and i will do my best to convey her points of interest in this review.the instrument itself is beautiful. the wood is cut and sanded to smoothness, the tuners give off a lovely shine (with a mirrored backing), and the logo is fancy without being ostentatious.this is a beginner's instrument. it comes with the basics needed, such as a soft case and a tuner. the tuner was a bit hard to figure out, so my friend suggested a tuner app, which worked much better. perhaps if the tuner came with more detailed instructions it would be more useful.once tuned, the sound is just beautiful. it's lightweight and easy to hold, and strumming it it heavenly.the strings are not steel. they are softer, nylon or plastic, and so easier on the fingers. the case is a soft case, with a handle, which is convenient, but a stringed instrument needs a hard case. right now i'm keeping mine in the box it came in, which fits it snugly and keeps it relatively safe.sometimes it slips out of tune. at times while playing, it needs to be retuned several times. just fine for practice, but definitely not performance worthy. a beautiful instrument.sample was provided for free for testing and reviewing purposes. no compensation was given for a review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWETQAZ81RDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y0HI37G#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWETQAZ81RDS","A1MCSXCJC7J37H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MCSXCJC7J37H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first saw these being advertised years ago, I thought they were absolutely bs, a gimmick, that there was no way they could possibly work. They're so simple in design, why haven't they been around before?Some of the earliest tools were simple, the lever, the pulley, etc. This is yet another simple yet effective tool that humans can use to make life easier.We once moved when I was five months pregnant, and it was so hard, watching my husband move everything by himself. The very few things he needed help with were so hard, terrifying, in fact.With these lifting and moving straps, moving heavy and bulky items can be moved with much greater ease. It's doesn't take the weight of the item away, but allows for better leverage, to make a surer hold.The straps themselves are well made, sturdy enough to hold a great deal of weight (they will make stretching sounds, but don't give out), and they're designed to be as comfortable as possible while loaded with weight. I thought they were going to be made of a much more abrasive material, cutting and scratching the arm once loaded. This is not the case at all.There are three arm loops, so whichever one works best for the specific item can be chosen. The outermost arm hole would work best for something tall like the fridge, or wide like a dresser, but the innermost loops could be used for things like an easy chair, a heavy box, or a smaller appliance.I wish there were more loops, but really only maybe one more. That's just me being picky. These are excellent carrying straps, conveniently in their own carrying case, and can easily be stored in a tool drawer until needed. They are a bright color, so they will easily be spotted. I would recommend these straps to others.Sample was provided for free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"THE WARLORD'S WIFE by Sandra Lake is an unique Historical Romance set in 12th Century Sweden. #1 in the ""Sons of the North"" Romance, and what a beginning! *A debut author* and one to watch out for in the upcoming months.This story is unique, has a unique setting, Sweden, it transports the readers to Viking Country, Viking Warlords, and the women who loved them. While, a bit slow to start off, it picks up nicely. Well written with vivid descriptions, interesting, and intriguing characters.

Ms. Lake brings the characters and the story to life via the pages of this unique tale.Filled with danger, life of a Viking Warlord, his wife, his clan, passion, deceit, betrayal and romance. Well blended with just the right amount of passion, danger, and romance.

But lurking in the darkness and in their castle lurks a dangerous, devious foe, one who wishes to bring down both the house of Tronscar and destroy both Lida and Magnus.

"MAXIMUS by Richard L. Black is  a inspirational historical fiction. An interesting tale, that is familiar but told in a different perception. The re-telling of the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth. Told though the eyes of Maximus, a General who commands legions of up to men, and his second-in-command, Androcles.While, an interesting and intriguing, I had a hard time connecting with some of the characters. I felt they lacked true character. We all know the story of Jesus', his crucifixion, his death, and his resurrection, but we hardly hear stories of Maximus, who begins to follow Jesus, and tells Pilate he is not a threat to Rome and others, who was present in Jesus' life.While, this is an enjoyable and satisfying read, it was missing something. I had a hard time connecting to some of the characters, but with this said it was an enjoyable read. We find faith, healing, learning to follow your heart, and opening to the unexpected circumstances of life. This is the story of Romans, Judeans, soldiers, fishermen, Jerusalem, family,  Galileans, trust, justice, injustice, a journey of life and faith. This author definitely shows his deep, and extensive research into this tragic story. I would read another story written by this author. He did a just job of this story, you can easily tell this was a labor of love. Any inspirational readers, historical fiction readers, and anyone who enjoys reading of Bible characters.

"An enjoyable and satisfying read!#2 in ""The Heart of a Duke"", but can be read as a stand alone. ""More Than a Duke"" has witty dialogue, seduction, and romance. It is fast paced with interesting, enduring and engaging characters. The storyline, while, not unique, is intriguing with it's witty banter, it's feeling of betrayal in the past by loved ones, and learning to trust again. I enjoyed the way the author brought the reader along for the ride of seduction but the true seduction was at the end of the story, between Harry and Anne. I enjoyed watching them both grow in their love, compassion and passion of each other. An enjoyable and Satisfying read from the first page to the last.

"WHAT THE LADY WANTS: A Novel of Marshall Field and the Gilded Age byRenee Rosen is an interesting Historical Fiction/Gilded Age set in 1871-1906 Chicago. It is a story based on the infamous love affair between Marshall Field, retail  tycoon and the socialite, Delia Spencer,  their spouses, adultery, high society,gossip, the Great Chicago Fire aftermath, the early days of Marshall Field & Company and everything in between.Charming, womanizer Marshall Field was a visionary,who made his fortune charming socialites of High society, but his most famous affair was with Delia Spencer. What a tangled, compelling and emotional read. Filled with devastation, the Gilded Age of Chicago, heartbreak, tragedy, suicide, scandal and gossip.It is a captivating tale to be sure. Addictive and entertaining as well. Emotional at times, filled with heartbreak, labor organizers, the Haymarket Riots, and many life changing decisions. One of the most annoying parts of this tale to me was the value the Prairie Avenue placed on their set, above all others. Not withstanding the adultery Marshall and Delia engaged in with little regard to their spouses and families. Delia was devoted to Marshall. While, I believe or hope she had a genuine love and friendship, for her own spouse, Arthur Spenser. I understand it was very difficult for women in the 1800-1900's to get a divorce, but I do not condone adultery, and infidelity. Which, I suppose is what made it such a captivating and emotional read.Well written with tack and intrigue. The characters were engaging and interesting. The storyline was intriguing, captivating and emotional. If you are looking for a HEA ending, not so much so with this read. Although, it has it's moments.

"Love Me to Death by Marissa Clarke is a wonderful start to a new series.  With a dash of urban fantasy, some high fantasy, some straight up science fiction, and a lot of romance, it twists and turns in all sorts of interesting ways.Elena is your average, everyday woman until she gets killed in a robbery. Or rather, killed but not dead because along comes Nikolai and suddenly she isn't an average, everyday woman anymore. She's more, a lot more.  And it's up to Nikolai to figure out exactly who she is and why he is supposed to kill her when that is the last thing he wants to do.Enter a crazy aunt who isn't an aunt, a secret sister, a rather interesting time warp man (who I want to read more about), a couple of very interesting vampire allies, even more interesting fey allies, and some power hungry villains, and you end up romping all over the place.Love Me to Death is quite an interesting blend with a little bit tossed in for everyone's taste and a wonderful read.

"West Winds of Wyoming by Caroline Fyffe is an intriguing Western Historical Fiction/Romance set in Cotton Ranch,a  in the small town of Logan Meadows.#3 in ""A Prairie Hearts"" Novel, while, it can be read as a stand alone, I would recommend reading the other two novels, Where the Wind Blows  and Before the Larkspur Blooms.Widower Charlie Rose, his blind daughter and ranch owner, widow, Nell Page, who is feisty, determined and on the verge of losing her ranch, are just part of the cast of characters.Fast paced tale of romance, secrets, and love. Charlie's past was intriguing to say the least, trying to figure out the who, why and what was very entertaining. Keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat. The sparks and emotions between Charlie and Nell are compelling as well as intriguing. Nell's brother, Seth, adds another layer to the story as well as the other secondary characters. Ms. Fyffe, has once again written a complex, compelling tale of faith, passion, romance blending a bit of mystery and suspense along the way. I have read many of this author's books and have loved them all so far. She is an author, to have on your auto buy list. Well done! I would recommend this story.

"Audio version: #2 in ""The MacKinnon Clan"". A 1600's Medieval Scottish Historical. A Scottish-English romance. I feel you should read or listen to #1 to have a real connection to the characters, although not really necessary. There are references to previous characters. The narrator was interesting with his Scottish brogue, he changes his pitch for the different characters. It was interesting to hear him interpret the female voices.The story is intriguing and interesting. The characters are well developed,and engaging.

"What an interesting read! An old classic brought back to life, through these pages of this new version. In this version the author has brought back to life the story of Bob, the Last Gray of Kenmuir. Bob is a sheep dog, with competition in Red  Wull, a vicious dog also know as ""The Tailless Tyke"". His owner is a lonely Scott, Adam McAdam, who is also a bit antagonistic. Troubles comes in the way of Sheep being slaughtered by a rogue dog. This is actually Red Wull's tale. A dark tale to be sure, but an entertaining one. Rather, you would agree it is fit for younger readers, is really up to the readers. While, it is labeled for readers 8-12, I would highly recommend it for this age group and not any younger. Due to the strong dark, gothic style writing. However, with this said, it is a true treasure. Many authors would not have taken on the Red Wull's story. There is much more to both the dog and the owner, than their anger,loneliness, and unhappiness. Well written! A powerful, heart-wrenching tale of a dog and his owner.

"Death by Didgeridoo by Barbara Venkataraman is a tasty little mystery that hits the spot.  With just a little over 100 pages, this quick read is full of everything a mystery lover wants in a light, little story.  The characters are well developed and the mystery will keep you guessing until the end.  Although Death by Didgeridoo is the first book in Venkataraman's Jamie Quinn series, it is not necessary to read the books in order.Jamie Quinn is a character that is quickly likable and easy to identify with.  She is still reeling from the death of her mother, when her cousin calls in desperation over the arrest of her son as a murder suspect.  It seems that Jamie is the ""go-to"" lawyer in the Quinn family, no matter what field of law is needed.  Jamie is sure her type of lawyer skills are not what cousin Adam needs, but she can't say no to family.  Proving Adam's innocence in the murder of his music teacher is a daunting task.  Adam has Asperger's Syndrome and has admitted guilt due to his skewed communication skills.Death by Didgeridoo is a light mystery.  Sometimes it's nice to break away from intense suspense of a bloody murder mystery.  I really enjoyed reading this book and will most certainly look forward to the others in the Jamie Quinn series.Rating: 4Heat Rating:  MildReviewed by: Molly Waters, courtesy of My Book Addiction and More","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWBDVMLAA0DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GVJ4WOY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWBDVMLAA0DW","AM09IO8QXEB1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM09IO8QXEB1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thrilling conclusion to Maya Banks’ Surrender Trilogy is sure to take your breath away!All Chessy wants is her husband back.  Her lover.  Her Dominant.  But for the past two years, he’s devoted more and more of his time into his business and less and less into their relationship.  Chessy just wants to have the passion, the desire, and most of all the security that comes from their marriage.  As their anniversary approaches, Chessy knows it’s now or never so she finally tells Tate how she feels.  Devastated that he’s let it get this far, Tate promises to once again make her a priority.  To show her how much he means to her, Tate showers her with love, affection, and gifts.  He even plans a night to remember at The House, a dominance club they used to visit frequently.  But when a client’s call comes in the middle of their special night, Tate foolishly takes the call and puts not only Chessy’s life in danger, but her security, her trust, and her love.  Vowing to win Chessy back once and for all, Tate decides to make some changes that are sure to show her how much she really means.  But is it too little too late or will Chessy find it in her heart to forgive Tate and allow him to once again hold the key to her heart?I loved this book, but after reading about Chessy and Tate in the previous two novels, I had no doubts that I would.  From heated arguments to passionate love scenes, this book will take you through every emotion imaginable.  The book is mostly written from Chessy’s point of view but does have some sections/chapters that are written from Tate’s.  While I did feel for Tate and his obliviousness to the situation he was creating at home, I mostly wanted to slap him for being so darn stupid!  I simply adore Chessy.  She’s radiant, beautiful, and most of all…..forgiving.  I thought every part of her story was very realistic.  The self-doubt, anger, depression, and confusion are all things that someone who was going through a really rough patch in their relationship would experience.  I also really enjoyed how much the storyline included characters from the previous novels in the series, Joss and Dash, Kylie and Jenson.  It’s always an added bonus to me when you get to read about what’s happening with those characters now, even though it’s not “their” book.  I thought that Ms. Banks did a superb job with not only Chessy and Tate’s story, but also with closing out this series in general.  A very well written, highly entertaining novel by Maya Banks.  Don’t miss this novel, I promise….You will regret it!

However, there is a prelude/Novella to this series, ""Look Again"". I would suggest reading for your pleasure as well. But it is not a necessity to enjoy and devow  ""DANGER CLOSE"", which I must say I did. Couldn't put it down, once I started reading!Meet, Navy SEAL Sam Sassevile and tycoon daughter, Madison Scott. Sam is constantly rescuing Maddy from her follies. So when she disappears, he is off once again to save her, if he can. But what he finds is so much more than even he bargained for in this rescue.Fast paced, heart-pounding tale of suspense, intrigue, danger, pride, terrorists, passion, romance and love. What more could you ask for in a riveting story? The sparks flies off the pages, as well as the danger. Ms. Melton knows how to write an awesome Suspense Thriller, using her Military expertise, her knowledge of what readers enjoy, and her awesome storytelling skills. I have not read a book yet, she has written that I was disappointed in reading. The characters are engaging, passionate, and compelling.

"When Lexi Sheridan stumbled onto an old photograph, she was hoping it would change her journalist career, little did she know, it would change her whole life.Lexi is a struggling journalist who needs a great breakout story that will launch her career.  While digging through an old photo album at the library, she discovers a hidden picture.  A picture of a famous family who has thus far, remained scandal free.  Knowing there has to be an amazing story behind the photo, Lexi sets out to Heart River Inn to find the man in the picture.  What happens next is something she’d never expect.  Not only does she locate Mr. Bernard, the man in the photo and the owner of Heart River Inn, she also meets several very unique couples who are staying at the romantic resort, and one sexy-as-hell manager, Jared Richardson.  As Lexi begins to talk with the guest staying at the resort, she realizes that it is much more than a bed and breakfast.  It seems that all the guest have a special connection with place, that this is the place that saved their relationship.  Skeptical of true love, Lexi just wants to get the big story and head out, but she can’t quite seem to be bold enough to show Mr. Bernard the photo and demand his story.  Especially when she gets to hang out with Jared.  Every time she gets close to Mr. Bernard or Jared crazy, wild events occur that keep her from getting the answers she seeks and it seems that everyone is fiercely protective of Mr. Bernard.  When she finally gets up the nerve to ask the hard hitting questions, will she get the answers she seeks or will she lose not only her job, but her new friendships as well?A funny, lighthearted, and entertaining read by Ms. McKade!  I enjoyed reading this novel and thought it was simply great!  Each chapter seems to focus on a new couple that Lexi meets and the story behind them and their connection to Mr. Bernard and the inn.  The budding relationship between Lexi and Jared is sweet and funny, as Lexi can’t seem to be anything but clumsy and accident prone around him!  I liked Lexi’s kind spirit and thought it was sweet how she couldn’t bring herself to hurt Mr. Bernard by demanding answers about the picture and printing the story.  I would have liked to see a little bit more romantic development between Jared and Lexi, as the ending seemed a bit far-fetched and rushed, but overall I enjoyed the story and would read it again.  It’s a quick read that is sure to give you a few laughs and just make you feel good.  I look forward to reading more novels from Ms. McKade!Rating: 4.5Heat Rating: SweetReviewed by: AprilPCourtesy of My Book Addiction and More","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y1PTFYEPBZ7Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICPPEYC#wasThisHelpful","R2Y1PTFYEPBZ7Q","AM09IO8QXEB1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AM09IO8QXEB1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This splendidly written tale begins with an ignorant & imperious woman firing Griffin from his California  job for the the removal of a dangerous tree. Together with a painful recent divorce,this event prompts Griffin, like Ishmael, to turn to the ocean.  Swiftly, the action moves to six men on a boat delivery job between New York and England, captained by Erin but at a rough time of the year for icebergs, fogs, and storms.  At a stop in Newfoundland, Griffin connects with an red-haired woman whose spirit resonates with his, in their love of Celtic & Arthurian tales, of the wildly beautiful scenery of Newfoundland, and of music.  The cittern, which Griffin learns to play based on a minstrel-like fluency on the guitar, was Heather' s grandfather's.Thus, one strand of this story is flung from the new world to the old as accomplished author & sailor & Arthurian scholar Stephen Cline takes us on a gripping---really really gripping---journey re-tracing voyages such as that of St Brendan in the 10th century (or earlier).  Even knowing what is to come (for example, the eruption of the volcanoes in that land of ice & fire, Iceland), the interactions of Griffin and his shipmates, the Slocum-like vividness of sailor telling, makes the adventures seem fresh & perilous.But, like the interlacing artistry of the borders in the great Book of Kells, Griffin's 2013-14 story interlaces with that of six Irish refuges narrowly escaping Saxon slavery through the courage and love of Laize for the 10th century minstrel, Grifin.  Under the courageous leadership of Gwythr, the six men retrace St. Brendan's voyage but from east to west.  They encounter all the perils Brenda and Bran describe, including the Icelandic volcanoes, the Skraelings, the icebergs, reaching Newfoundland.  There the six men live for a bitter winter, aided by Grifin's harp and meeting a friendlier tribe.  Grifin's music becomes a universal language in his developing love for the woman, Waunathoke.The taut story is told in interlacing chapters, by Griffin and Grifin, and some vision? awareness? connects the voyages, connects Grifin with Laize, connects Griffin with Heather, connects even Grifin with Griffin.  The dialog is skillfully revealing of story & person, the quotes from mostly Celtic sources richly adorning each chapter, and the writing  is of a high standard of excellence---not a flinch-worthy sentence, a skillfulness one expects from Cline.ANY ALERTS?  Me, I love a story of the sea and of sailors; tales from ancient Celtic sources; stories where people can experience frictions yet come through connected even loving.  And the echoes of Maeb's land sound in the quest for the land of the ever-young and of women, Emain, sought by ancient Irish sailors.  However, readers who do not like sailor's stories or sea voyages may not find ""Echoes Over Water"" to their liking, though it sure is to mine.  Ditto readers looking for blood, guts, and ripped bodices.  Almost all others may find this a rare treat.Oh and based on the places I've personally been such as the great Library in Trinity College in Dublin and New Grange by the Hillof Tara, Stephen Cline nails these with superb descriptions that take us there.  Applause,to the  sailor, singer, author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JN72X8Z8GRB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1453726624#wasThisHelpful","R2JN72X8Z8GRB0","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gentlemen and Ladies, step right up to an entertaining, informative, and useful guide to pleasures & treasures in the fine state of Nevada, where houses devoted to pleasuring are legal, regulated to help ensure health and safety, and where, according to author , J. R. Schwartz, ""the ladies possess all the charms necessary to please.""The Guide is organized geographically: Reno area (six entries), Fallon (two entries), Winnemucca (five locations), Battle Mountain (two) Elko (six entries), Highway 93 (three), Las Vegas area (three), and Highway 95 (five entries).  A easily readable map of the state is provided for those perhaps planning a roadtrip, and for each entry, there is a well-drawn, clear, large print map.As a researcher, I find much to admire about J. S. Schwartz's style.  True, Schwartz does not tells us (unfortunately)  how the entries were located (nominated? selected) and what percent of potentially eligible houses were omitted and why.  However. for those reported, his modus operandi was hands on, not word of mouth.  He made time to visit each pleasure palace personally, interview the owners or managers, and then interview the ladies.  How many ladies and how they were selected are unclear but his criteria are splendidly explicit:Schwarz was looking for variables such attitude (playfulness, free-spiritedness), atmosphere (style such as Western, Oriental, Versailles, sense of freshness), amenities such as the Menu of pleasures available, and practicalities (parlour including bar or mostly party-time).  We learn of size (some are over 100 party rooms), number of lovely ladies usually on duty, and their tours of duty.All the ladies met were described as stylish dressed, made-up, and luscious as well as skilled in whatever the party-goer hopes for that is acceptable to the lady (who is an independent contractor).  Some of these Menu items sound delightful and some, such as the ""Wind, Rain, and Lava"" struck me as ""yecch,"" but might be a specialized choice for my fellow citizens.  The book includes an essay on the history of pros*tit*ution, a several page glossary, and a conclusion.Any Alerts:  Businesses in almost every field go in and out of operation.  These pleasure businesses, so says the book, are not permitted to advertise in detail or with much clearness.  The visitors should call ahead or perhaps check with local knowledge to avoid disappointments.Overall, readers interested in local color may find ""The Official Guide"" educational and entertaining.  I sure did.  I found this at a library book sale, filed under ""Books for Children"" along with stories of kitties, puppies, and such.  Most enlightening 25 cents I've spent in while!

"Back up for  your back with these excellent firm wedge pillows!  I am using my bed for sleeping by night and a sofa for sitting by day.  I wanted wedges that were--firm, as firm as if there was a real sofa back--can handle some smaller & some larger backs with reliable support and no crumbling--light enough to take off at night without wrassling elephants--enough traction to hold covers in place when these are not individual zippered wedge covers--little or no chemical smells--affordableThis fit the list.  They are very affordable compared to anything I can find locally.  They are exceptionally firm and give my back plenty of support.  I've added three softer pillows for cushiness and color in front of the bolsters, which work fine.  They are light enough to handle easily.  And they have excellent traction for holding a bedspread in place.  I am sorta cheap Charlie and don't want to spend $45-$50 per bolster for a separate pillow cover.  Buyers who can sew could probably find some great material and make their own covers,  I'll applaud and envy them!Any Alerts?  They arrive at warp speed and well packaged.  Each was covered with a large plastic pillow case thingie which kept them snowy white.  At first, yes, these was a chemical odor.  I unwrapped them, aired them out on the porch for several days, and, a week or so later, no detectable chemical aroma.  Buyers who are highly sensitive should be aware of the need for airing.  Everything else was fine.  They are sized as advertised.  Two bolsters will make a sofa back for a twin size bed.

"This storage system has six sturdy containers for silver and jewels ranging from the diamond ring size to a set of sterling silver for ten people, five pieces per setting.  It holds a LOT---actually, considerably more precious goodies than I own.The material is heavy, the interiors are smooth & unlikely to (shudder) scratch or mar, and I particularly like the closure systems.  I'd polished the sterling like a Downton Abbey butler & want it to stay bright, untarnished, clean.  The closure for this piece involves double-folded Velcro, grippy not flimsy.  I felt when it was wrapped as if little or no tarnishing air would get into this Gringott's special and that it would no come undone.The closures for the other pieces involved Velcro, zips, and strong ribbons.  For each piece I used, I gave it the pull, tugs, and flip tests.  All of them passes.Buyer Alerts?  If you need more large piece holders, the one biggest holder may not be enough for many good size serving pieces plus your place settings.  For jewelery of sterling, gold, platinum or other precious metals, the assortment of holders could be plenty for most of us.  That is, it is more for anti-tarnish jewelery than flatware or bigger silver serving trays, bowls, and such.  HOWEVER, the anti-tarnish features look as if they will keep your baubles blinging and your glitter glittering.Overall, a good deal for the price and I am very pleased----and now have extras if there's any jewels being sent from the Tower of London for my use.  Could work perfectly for buyers looking for a good assortment of adaptable and attractive storage!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QF6YPGD0QRTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFNCCGA#wasThisHelpful","R2QF6YPGD0QRTT","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Report from a Satisfied BuyerThe Laundry Bag arrived at warp speed, almost before I bought it.  The material is light, a plus for me because I wanted something I could haul around, loaded, not a canvas mail sack.  The drawstring channel is functional, though not the embroidery for royalty.  The seams are sturdy, not likely to ravel.  And the color I got was a cheerful blue, which I hoped for.All this for a much lower price than I could find locally!Any Buyer Alerts:  30 x 40 inches is big enough for a sleeping bag.  Almost 3 feet wide x 4 feet tall.  This is exactly what I needed so I am pleased---no skimping on seams, fabric, or size!  Buyers should be aware this is LARGE, and not expect a medium or small size laundry bag.  This one holds two sheets, two pillowcases, two bath towels, three hand towels, and a week's laundry for me including jeans and sweats.Highly recommended for buyers wanting a big beautiful laundry friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GP73OGRR6JJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7Z2WJ0#wasThisHelpful","R3GP73OGRR6JJN","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bach's ""The Well-tempered Clavier"" offers a balanced array of musical challenges to the`novice player.  Even for the relative beginner. the results can sound good. ""Recipes from my Russian Grandmother's Kitchen"" is like that, Russian cooking-wise.As a novice, I was looking for--introductory stories of Russian cuisine, eating habits, and ingredients to help understand the context of the recipes--recipes balanced to reflect this tradition--ingredients generally available in the U.S.--step x step directions with some time-saving choices--informative illustrationsThis hard-cover book, published in 2014, delivers the goods nicely indeed--the discussion of the usual Russian dinner involving a robust soup, a main dish, and dessert is reflected in the contents which begin with nine hearty soups, go on to fish and meat dishes, and conclude with ravishing desserts. As stated on the cover, 60 recipes in all--the importance of an hospitable table of zakuski (hearty appetizers) and of religious holidays such as Easter are reflected in a mouth-watering section on appetizers and in preparation of traditional dishes such as the Paschal cake--the excellent photographs by Jon Whitaker make step-by-step preparation easy to follow and all the ingredients listed are available even in the small town where I live;  some time-saving approaches are offered including use of already prepared/purchased puff pastryA bright star in the accuracy of the title.  These ARE grandmother's cooking in recipes chosen, in preparation, and in the more subtle aspects such as using tableware and china from a granny's kitchen.  Catherine the Great's recipes, china, or squadron of cooks this is not,nor is it a ""Mastering the art of Russian cooking"" tome.  Traditional granny is what I was looking for, and that is what the book delivers.Among the recipes I particularly like are Georgian Meat Soup, Blini, Fish with Mushroom & Dill Sauce, and Sauerkraut Stew with Prunes.  There are a LOT of recipes using sauerkraut/cabbage, preserved cucumbers (who knew?) and sour cream (smetana), ingredients available without high cost and throughout the year in the Russian climate.ANY ALERTS?  A big omission (to me) was not a single recipe for the black or dark rye breads, despite the text emphasis on how this bread is essential to every meal.  If it is that important, how about a recipe or two?  Also, this is a slender book with fewer recipes than some: a sampler of general Granny cooking,not more regional or comprehensive.  Further. as a newer book, expect to pay a new book price as used copies for a few pennies aren;t yet available.Overall, however, a delight for eye and mouth and belly, that a beginner in Russian cooking can achieve!  Thank you, author and production team!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRTA8X1O5BV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0754829820#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRTA8X1O5BV1","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tried them, love them, and just ordered another set!WHAT I LIKED:-- if real estate is location, location, location, then underpants may be about fit, fit, fit.  The waist band is wide enough to stay put but leaves no garroted red marks.  The silky yet slightly elastic (5% spandex) material fit butt and hip as if these were bespoke.  The elastic leg bands give very high opens without any gaps.  There's a firming effect that is totally comfortable and no muffin tops.  A perfect fit in size 5 for me, can wear all day in blissful comfort without thinking about them.--cute: nice colors, specially the pink like an apple-blossom.  Each waist band has a contrasting color stripe.  A little pizzazz that adds to the waistband width & comfort.--durability.  I wash these by machine but without any hooks to catch or tear. They wash beautifully and can be put in the drier or hung up to air dry.  I am careful with these as I would be with any good lingerie and they are keeping their color, the lustrousness of the fabric, and their shape over several months of washings.--crotch design.  These are unique, in my experience, at having a different textured but smooth, silky crotch which is woven in through the front to the back where there is a strong double seam.  The coverage is excellent from the mons to the glutes without any tell-tale lines or bulk.  Adds to comfort and security, at no loss of well, cuteness.--price: affordability at Amazon prices was amazing, about $3 for each panty.  These would be more than twice the price locally where I live. GREAT value!ANY ALERTS?  Some buyers may want all black or all white or other, brighter colors.  The navy, black, tan, pink, ivory, white are what this set comes in.  The colors work for me but every now & then, it would be fun to have fuschia or turquoise or bright yellow.  Also the fabric while beautiful is without ribbons, lace, ruffles.  Again, every now and then, nothing wrong with a little lacy nothing and these are not fancy!OVERALL, if buyers want a WONDERFUL fit, soft & luxe material, easy care and easy price in usable colors---this set may it a good, better, best buy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZT0RJBQ8SOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSCQWYS#wasThisHelpful","RFZT0RJBQ8SOM","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun bling!  I wanted a big sparkling notice-my-ankle bracelet. Ideally, I was looking for affordable, fits large & smaller ankles, and with some pizzazz.THIS HAS IT ALL!--sparkling rhinestones all around--nicely proportioned heart, not too large for my ankle--could hardly believe the Amazon price which was less than $5--ingenious design fits 8"" ankles to 11"" ankles (as measured) by a lobster-claw & links arrangement.  Adjust it yourself to your comfortable size and either clip off the extra links or leave the remaining chain as extra dangleVery comfortable to wear thanks to the ingenious design, not at all heavy but wow-worthy.  GREAT for birthdays, engagement, wedding favors, sweet 16 to sweet 96 parties---bachelor as well as bachelorette gifties: this is a fun piece.  For me, it is sturdy enough to wear to the beach, around the house, parties.  Definitely says, ""SEXY!""ANY ALERTS?  I treat this Sexy Lady Heart ankle bracelet as I would one costing many times as much, fitting it with care initially keeping it in its own envelope to avoid tangles, and kitty can not consider the sparkles as a toy! Buyers should be aware this is made and shipped from China.  Mine arrived within two weeks with excellent packaging.  But returning would not be cost-effective, so buyers may want to be extra-sure they like a sparkly heart on their ankle before ordering.

"Presentation box fit for Her Majesty's diamonds; inside a wee wisp of alternate balls and links.YES:  There's much to make me reach for the phone to order this again, such as--10"" is a below the ankle-bone fit for this size 8 woman; no tightness here!  Comfy, not slipping off though. I measured the length & it is exactly 10"" including clasp. The smaller size, 9"",would be an above the ankle-bone fit without tightness--clasp is lobster-claw style, often considered most secure--clasp is well-designed and easy to use with little danger to finger-nails or squintingPLUS--there are two boxes.  The outer box is strongly made & covered with handsome quality black material-like paper, with a flap to glide out the velvet-like inner box.  That is, one whole long side folds neatly & elegantly down, to reveal the gorgeous inner box--the inner box is crafted of black velvet or velvet-like suede. A blue satin tab lifts up the hinged top.  I expected trumpets it was sooooo Tiffany-gorgeous. Inside two hinged tabs hold the bracelet in place.  I have seen a lot of jewelery box presentations but this one is almost worthy of the purchase price by itselfHOWEVER-- the bracelet feels light to me, feather light almost--a sparkle now & then but not really light-catchinng--rhodium may be a miracle metal that is stronger than iron and I am not asking for ankle chains still I expected Italian rhodium & rose-gold plated links would feel less gossamer. I'd recently ordered a silver & garnet stone (real) ring from Amazon  at about the same price & it has a wonderful feel of quality Irish silver. More substance in the bracelet's feel, and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars.  For a heavy gold ankle bracelet however $200 to $300 might be just the starting price, based on a well-known big box store check.Thus, some buyers may be looking for an ultra- light-weight, elegant style at a low price and this might be perfect for them.  Other buyers might prefer something like a diamond-cut twist chain for more sparkle and more substance. and be willing to pay more or go to all silver.  Both may fall in love, love, love with the presentation box which I could use for the right piece on the right gifting occasion.

"Back in the 1940s, he authored ""Do It Yourself: The Happiest How-to-Do-It Book:  make your own legally tax-free at a fraction of the cost recipes for all kinds of wine!""  When he got a windfall in 1966, he spent it on a barge towed off the Atlantic coast, half his own country (New Atlantis) and half given to the US, the idea being to raise money for oceanographic research by selling stamps.  When author and racounteur Ray Pace knew him, he was nearing his end  from Type II Diabetes. but would still greet women as ""My Lady"" and the family dog as ""Ho, Noble Hound.""He was Leicester (pronounced ""Lester"") Hemingway, the only brother among four sisters who together with 17 years older big brother 'Ernest formed the family of Dr. and Mrs Clarence Hemingway.  Pace met him in Florida, where the two tried this, that, and the other thing to put together a successful sports magazine or radio station.""Hemingway, Memories of Les"" was published in 2012 about 30 years after Les died in 1982.  It is 91 pages, large type, double-spaced, wide margins, probably about 30 pages of usual margins and type size.  It doesn't matter.  The book is like sitting down with a friendly story-teller who shares his own experiences during those ten years  and how they intersected with Les.  Pace's recollections include some stories from Les's memories and his constant encouragement to go ahead and try whatever Ray had in mind.  A more encouraging man than Les may never lived and the affection that prompted these memoirs is clear.This is Pace's effort to recognize a Hemingway forever over-shadowed by his brother Ernest's Nobel Prize, his sheer output, his life style, and his authorship of some books of heroic stature likely to be long-lived.  Pace's memoir can be thought of as fascinating reading in itself yet also as a worthy contribution toward a future full-length biography of Les.There is space for such a biography.  Apart from Pace's engaging memoir, there seems to be only one other Les-focused book, by Les's daughter, Hilary, based on tapes of Les's recollections of sports stories and adventures he later shared with Ernest. I  also found through the 'Net some fascinating summaries of the Hemingways including Les based on 43 cubic feet of family archives. His mother was an opera-level musician before her marriage and Les was a notable singer who, suggests the archive summarist,could have been successful indeed if voice had been his choice.Until that book comes along, however, readers can enjoy well-told tales of a time (1950s-1960s), a place (southern Florida) and a friendship between a fella named Hemingway and a fella named Pace.Any Reader Alerts?  None other than already mentioned that this is a  memoir, without footnotes or references,  covering about ten years of Les Hemingway's life.  Although structured conversationally rather as stories and thoughts came along, like Mark Twain's Autobiography, and self-published, Ray Pace is a skilled writer with a gift of dialog so the reading is lively, fresh, and engaging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSCOXOC5EK8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477644059#wasThisHelpful","RLSCOXOC5EK8D","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One, two, three, four----and then there are ten little girl mermaids, with glittering tails frolicking in the turquoise-blue waters of Hawai'i!Follow the 24 full-color, full page watercolor pictures by artist-writer Gill McBarnet number by number up to ten mermaids. On each bright page are the matching number of sparkling scallop shells and other sea creatures such as bright red star-fish, elegant Moorish Idol fish trailing their ballerina fins, conch shells, crabs, and turtles.  Each set of pages has a couplet, leading the reader on, such as""Two Rainbow mermaids see the fishes flee; up pops another one and then there are Three.""""The Rainbow Mermaids of Hawaii"" is fun to read, designed by a master teacher.  So many parts fit smoothly together.  There are seven easily distinguished colors of a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet that appear on every page and whose colors  shine in each mermaid's tail.  The frequent rainbows are among Hawaii's natural treasures.  The green sea turtles (honu) nest and are protected here.  Humpback whales come to play all winter, and our waters abound in bright-colored reef fish.I particularly like that these little girls are not Barbies. No coconut or sea shell bras or 16"" waists, but raindow sleeveless tank-top blouses & glittering raindow tails.  They vary in size from a darling baby-mermaid (or merman) to perhaps 10 years old or so. They are graceful, supple, adorable but only nature has brought the long, wavy hair, bright brown eyes, and sun-kissed skin.  The mermaids are Hawaiian and harmonious with their ocean and islands.McBarnet weaves these into her lovely watercolors, and on the back covers, offers accurate information on rainbows to enhance the readers' knowledge as their own little mermaids ask questions.  AND, best of all, the story ends with a Birthday Celebration, including ten bright candles on the cake!Any Reader Alerts?  Readers should be aware this story is about mermaids. I believe, however, the fish, the ocean, the colors, and the counting are likely to bring pleasure to little boys and girls alike.  This could be a perfect gift for families heading to Hawaii or as a gift from Hawaii, along with Gill Barnett's many other Hawaii related stories such as her ""Gecko Hide-and-Seek."" and the delightful ""Good Night, Gecko.""  Also, McBarnet is a self-taught artist. Her pictures have a distinctive style, particularly lovely in color and composition, rather than  an Arthur Rackham precision, that fit the Hawaiian theme nicely.This charming 7 l/2"" x 10"" hard-cover book is going to a three-year old who adores mermaids and enthusiastically is learning to count.  She can go by memory to 24 but is less successful in (1) recognizing the printed numbers and (2) applying the numbers to enumerating objects.  This Gill McBarnet book could help her and many others enjoy counting & arithmetic.

I wanted something--purple--colorful so easy to find & establish ownership if dropped--big distinctive numerals--large hands with clear differences between the hour and minute indicators--sized small enough for 3 year old but strap enough to expand to about a 7 year old wrist--plastic and environmentally friendly if lost--cheap--this is a kiddo after all--actually worksI looked through every Amazon listing for children's watches, read all the reviews, and this one stood out as a best match to what I wanted.  It arrives with warp speed, well-packaged, and was even better than I expected on all my criteria.Two aspects get special applause:1.  The strap is great, flexible not stiff, and ample room for expansion but could easily be cut to a smaller length if wanted.The material is sturdy enough that the holes are not likely to tear under use, too.  However, if a replacement band is needed, the design has the spring-loaded bars that permit this, rather than being forever attached to the watch case.2. Cuteness!  The butterflies are multi-colored yellow, red, greens, blues, pinks. Perfect size in proportion to the band, and will coordinate with the outfits of the day.ANY ALERTS?  Purchasers should be aware the days of ticking watches may be over; this one does NOT go tick-tock which was a slight disappointment to a girl who adores ""Peter Pan"" including the ticking crocodile.  Also, the watch is not sold as water-proof, shock-resistant, and will need to be take off before baths, showers, or swims.  It is a play-time watch not in any way suitable for scuba.

"Love  it!  Love it! Love it!  I usually don't wear rings. Actually I have given most of mine away to the next generation.  A year or so ago, I thought it might be nice if I could find a ring that--had a real gem, not glass--was medium size, not flashy nor too small to see--where the setting was graceful & attractive, maybe something a bit artistic and original--very extremely affordable, so I wouldn't clutch if it was ""misplaced""I looked around in jewellery sales at quality stores, at artisan markets & craft fairs, and when I travelled, but nothing said ""Buy me.""This ring came up as an Amazon Deal, and the picture suggested this was it, while the price said, ""What value for a .55 carat of real, undyed, natural red garnet.""The ring is EVERYTHING I wanted. The color is as shown, the clear red of a quality natural garnet, almost like a ruby or if was a wine, a pinor noir maybe.  The size is perfect, big enough to be noticeable but not gaudy.  And the silver setting is like a fine, a very fine, Irish silver design.  A heart is worked into the swirl on either side, subtly, and the fit is excellent. The workmanship is first-rate, everything smooth, solid, made to last.This would be a lovely gift for almost any age and any stage, and would make a special occasion even more memorable.  A plus is the attractive box, beautifully fitted blue paper with a lovely white ribbon & small ribbon rose; inside a velvet like material into which the ring slips elegantly. Awesome bonus!  Also, the garnet & silver work together well as colors, like a ring for Galadriel.ANY BUYER ALERTS?  The sizing seems to be standard so no need to get larger or smaller than usual.

"At least five recent & well-regarded translations of that traveller's tale by Messer Marco Polo & ghost writer Rusticello are now available, making accessible what the imprisoned older man remembered of his youthful adventures in the lands of Kublai Khan. Even before these tales were written down, however, their veracity was questioned, their honesty derided, and the sanity of the narrator suspected.  On one point only was agreement strong: the rubies, diamonds, pearls, sapphires and emeralds sewn in the shabby cloaks Marco, his father Niccolo,and his uncle wore on their return to Venice in 1296.So, asked John Man, what does current scholarship say about these questions?  ""Marco Polo: The Journey that Changed the World"" gives Man's answers in 15 chapters.  The chapters are organized somewhat linearly in that they include Kublai's empire from Polo's arrival to the Khan's death and  organized somewhat opportunistically in chapters such as Xanadu and Marco's relationships with  women. The overall conclusions are that some of Polo's narrative is consistent with what evidence is available, such as the likelihood Marco actually did spend many years in Kublai's China, the existence of a huge ruc-like bird, and that Xanadu probably was shaped like a stately pleasure dome. along the lines of the Mongolian ger.  Some is also certainly not true and a lot is indeterminable.  What to me makes this book worthy reading is the sorting out of the details and specifics like the number of bridges in Kublai's capitol city and claims Marco made of Kublai's innovations in legal, social, and governmental areas, including that wonder, printed money.Man's modus operandi makes this a traveller's tale about a traveller's tale.  He set out to follow Polo's path, the roads taken, Afghanistan passes threaded, cities and citadels visited, what could still be seen of what Marco said he saw..  These travels, with digressions of Man's wanderings, make up about 40% of the evidence.  The rest is extrapolation of what is possible such as the extended discussion of how to construct Xanadu the pleasure dome, pole by pole (about 30%) and what today's best scholars conclude. I particularly liked how Man handled negative evidence: instances of when Polo did NOT write about a major historical event such as Japan's defeat of Kublai's invasion and apparent lack of Polo's name in historical records such as the governorship of Yangzhou. Some scholars argue the silence indicates Polo wasn't there, but Man refutes this energetically.How believable is Man himself?  Some readers may find this approach to historical analysis vivid, convincing,and appropriate.  Others may wish Man found himself less fascinating & Polo more fascinating. In a few places, such as how literally Ghengis and Kublai Khan took a number such as 10,000, Man plumps for a ""large number"" interpretation where other recent analysis of the military organization numbers suggests 10,000 meant 10,000, an issue relevant to the size of the armies, herds of white horses, and cities.  Not a deal-breaker but a reminder that while Man has worked heroically at achieving the most believable answers, 700 years bring mists of time not easily dispelled even by many miles, many months, and many millions of words.This is a full book whose almost 400 pages include references, a useful index (thank you, thank you, author & publisher), about 20 good color pictures, and a map.of the roads between Xanadu and Beijing.  More maps would have been welcomed, however.The title?  The world is so interconnected that many events (the spice trade, Columbus reaching the Americas. the discovery of De Natura Rerum, and so on and on and on) have been claimed by various authors as the progenitor of today.  No need to hold Man's last chapter to an excruciating standard of causality; maybe think of Polo's travels as ""among the influences"" on our world.  ""Marco Polo"" is a fine read by an experienced writer and traveller..","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM21P1HT32ULQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062375075#wasThisHelpful","RM21P1HT32ULQ","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Accompanying the worthy story are colorful full-page illustrations, clever verse, and enough action to hold attention from about 3 to 6 years old chicks & dudes..A little backstory: about 30 years ago, there were not too many surfer chicks, particularly among the top competitors.  Now, go for it, gals and guys!Buyer Alert? The book is a big, glossy-paper 10"" x10"" super-size square, not a board book in the just-hatched chicks sense.  Also, Dad to me looks more like a mighty well-fed hen than a rooster (no comb,hen-like tail feathers rather than a noble cock tail) although most children probably won't notice.  Not a deal-breaker for me.  A 1 year old who has already been on the board and her ripped surfer-dude Dad are getting this for Father's Day and I feel sure they are gonna LOVE it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SV79GD8C3R5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419701886#wasThisHelpful","R12SV79GD8C3R5","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There IS a lot to like about ""The German Cookbook,"" (hard-cover, 1965 edition).  For example--Sheraton has the eye of a travel writer as well as a cookbook writer/compiler, and she excels in describing the many regions of Germany, honoring the characteristic foods of each--she presents 16 topics in separate chapters, such as appetizers, soups, soup garnishes and dumplings, egg dishes and cheese, fish, meat, game and game birds, sausages (perhaps the most informative, exciting chapter), potato, noodle, and rice dishes, and prosit!--the recipes while assuming a medium level of skills are easy to follow--and I liked, personally, that this was all text and no pictures, in the style of Irma Rombauer's glorious ""The Joy of Cooking.""--this used, older edition was wonderfully inexpensive, less than $1BUT--in no way can this be called a ""comprehensive guide to mastering authentic German cooking.""  For one horrifying example, there is NOTHING on bread.  Sheraton broke my heart when she indicates that bread is so central to German food, it needs a book of its own and she isn't going to offer any recipes (p. 411)--nor is it ""comprehensive"" even for 1965, barely touching, for instance, on the glorious varieties of red cabbage preparations and sauerkraut recipes and with only three recipes for noodles, one of which is for spaghetti--how ""authentic"" is Sheraton?  Laudably, she tells us for a year, she ate at many German restaurants in the U.S., and got their recipes.  Then she visited Germany and ate at a lot of German restaurants and got their recipes.  She states that she tried them in her kitchen which if done completely would have included some heroic efforts such as the calf head preparation.--not for beginners but for cooks who know their way around the kitchen's variety of preparation methods, have a good hand for sauces, and can address foods in their natural states---or as Sheraton indicates, are near to good delicatessens, butchers, fish-mongers, confectioners & bakersOverall, ""The German Cookbook"" may be primarily of historical interest although in chapters such as ""Sausage"" Sheraton's among the best of the wurste.  . Perhaps more recent editions are better.  In the meantime, readers seeking a more comprehensive and current German cookbook will find several available, all of which (so far as I know) include some breads.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18L4K5CWGRW6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394401387#wasThisHelpful","R18L4K5CWGRW6X","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am down-sizing to a senior living apartment.  Very nice indeed it is but I needed a flatware set that-- was very affordable but not flimsy--attractive to make me happy when I used it--wouldn't break my heart if pieces went missing--has enough pieces so I could entertain family & guests--if I dropped a piece, wouldn't cling, ring, ding, or breakThis beautiful set for six exceeds my requirements and expectations.  The design has flair in the pearlized ivory handles with the touch of shiny ""silver"".  It does not look like left-overs from a prison cutlery yard-sale, overly simple.  There's a playfulness that makes me happy!  The edges of the fork, spoons, and knife are smooth and well-polished, except where it should be sharp in the corrugations of the knife blade.  The blade has done fine with chicken, steak, and fish.  And for the low Amazon price for a service for six?  I'm totally delighted!Any buyer alerts?  First, this set is for eating, not supplementary kitchenware.  The fork and knife are plenty strong for eating but would probably not stand up for cutting a big loaf of very crusty bread, lifting a big pot roast, and carving up raw carrots.  Second, the handles are pleasingly rounded which means they do not lie flat.  They stack nicely on their sides but need a drawer at least 3 inches deep.The set comes attractively packed in a container with a handle.  For a just-starting couple, a student, campers, the Novell stainless could be attractively wrapped & presented, and would thoughtful gift.  Me, I'll be using it, hopefully for quite a few years with pride and pleasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KO4G3099AP79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4BFVLM#wasThisHelpful","R2KO4G3099AP79","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah, so THIS is how these work, and then they work wonders.  The wipes arrive rolled tightly into the container, 20 of them.  First try, I pulled one off the end, like peeling a wealthy roll of $1 bills.  Worked OK but couldn't wrap it around the serving spoon  I was cleaning or get a good grip.  Looked again & saw each wrap is folded in half.  Unfold, and voila! 5.5"" wide, 7.9' long, and I could put some sincere energy into cleaning that tarnished spoon.The wipes were tested on a 6 pieces per setting, 10 setting sterling set, medium tarnished, six shamefully tarnished silver-plate & ornate serving spoons, a fairly shiny baroque repousse dish, and several silver plate serving dishes.  I still have 1/2 of the wipes left.  A single wipe shone about 4 pieces of silver---more for a plain item, less if the item is ornate.Pros: --easy to use, no pre-preparation--smelled good to me, neutral-clean not perfumey--handled the tarnished as well as shinier piecesUser Alerts:--energy needed; a languid wipe won't do the trick so those with arthritis or wrist issues should be aware--need to buff energetically with a soft dry cloth to bring up the shine (rinse first)--not for a long time but with energyI'm really happy with results compared to a liquid polish and a pink cream polish both well known.

"So there's the shipping box.  Emme opens it.  Inside in neon pink tissue paper (added) is this neon-bright fairy ice-skater ballerina princess, who flew right to Emme's heart.  And around the table.  And with open wings then folded shut wings. And performing a leap.  And....This beautiful Barbie-friend flew into my heart too because--the flexible hinging that permits arms positioning from down to fully raised and the legs positioned in jettes, pirouettes, and Cirque du Soleil-like moves so she can be a fairy, a ballerina, an ice-skater, a princess and more--the colors are intense, much better than the pale almost washout picture on the site.  The green wings are really green, the peach wings almost orange and the purple a shimmering deeper color than shown.  So is the dress, happy-making, sun-bright, gorgeous colors.--the quality is fine.  Sturdy transparent plastic (?) wings with charming perforations such as wee hearts.  The multi-layered dress is neatly cut, well put together, and the fairy boots are stylin' orange, not your fairy godmother boots--the figure is  lissome, attractive & good, as a fairy should be but without the overly bosomy, wasp-waisted body.  The facial expression is friendly, warm, smiling & adorably sweet.  Long softer-than-usual hair.--the wing open and shut mechanism holds up to a lot of folding & unfolding by a three year old.  Easy to use.LOVE this doll & at the price, a terrific value.Any buyers alerts?  I am not sure if the boots and skirt come off.  Skirt maybe but probably not the boots so if changing costumes and dresses is big must must must have, then check before buying perhaps.  The wings, says Emme, would fly better with glitter. Glue and glitter could easily be added.OVERALL:  This fairy ice-skater ballerina princess ignites imagination, a doll for adventures and stories.  A passive person to dress & undress, not so much but it sure has opened a wide magical world of possibilities!  Highly recommended if an imaginative fairy would make your perfect person happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19V9EOYJNW9MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IVOUEFS#wasThisHelpful","R19V9EOYJNW9MA","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a guitar player, if you resonate to the music of the guitar greats, if you are fascinated by stories of what created a legendary magazine, or if you just like outstandingly good writing, then ""Guitar Player:  The Inside Story of the First Two Decades of the Most Successful Guitar Magazine Ever"" may be your book of the year.It sure is mine because-- there are 273 pages of pictures, text, and art that deliver exactly what's promised, the inside story of those 1967 to 1987 years--the story is brilliantly conceived as told by editors Jim Crockett & Dara Crockett, 26 staffers & freelancers, 42 featured artists and monthly columnists, and wonderfully, 15 advertisers.--the photographs include world-class portraits, then and now, as well as more informal shots of jam sessions--the layout and writing meet or may even exceed the spectacularly good ""Guitar Player"" standard, echoing in some ways that of the magazine.  I didn't find one spelling error, any flinch-worthy sentence, anything but a word I usually hesitate to use--but it's so true here--production perfection--it lives.  This is not dusty-musty, disengaged ""history"" but it breathes the excitement of those first decades and the impact ""Guitar Player"" made in shining the spotlight on such amazing talentAny reader alerts?  This beautifully-produced, glossy paper, extensive photographs book costs more, granted, than a Kindle or almost disposable paper-back might.  ""Guitar Player"" is a keepers book, worth every dollar, and compared with similar books, it is a terrific value.  Will some readers wish Player X, Y, or Z had been included?  Probably, but as authors Crockett (Jim) and Crockett (Dara) make clear, they cast a very wide net.  While almost all artists agreed to be interviewed, a few didn't. And those interviews---wow! In their own words and are those words as memorable as the music. Special thanks to Dara Crockett, who,  writes her Dad, ""cajoled, pleaded, begged, and virtually threatened"" until Jim Crockett got it together while this living vibrant history was possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R289JBPSJLR2V5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148039792X#wasThisHelpful","R289JBPSJLR2V5","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bring together one of America's greatest writers (DuBose Heyward, author of ""Porgy & Bess"") and one of our most loved illustrators (Marjorie Flack, ""Make Way for Ducklings"") and we get a book which has heart, brains, and beauty. In this lovely story, a small brown country bunny yearns to be one of the five Easter Bunnies; but she becomes a young lady bunny, then the mother of 21 babies.  She cleverly selects a daughter and a son pair for each of the innumerable household tasks including singing and dancing to keep them merry and has a happy productive home. Still she yearns to be one of the Easter Bunnies.  When Grandfather Bunny (old, kind, and wise) see her and the 21 well-behaved small ones, he selects her as a Fifth Bunny.  He gives her a special & supremely difficult assignment: delivering a crystal sugar egg to a sick boy who lives far far away on the top of an ice mountain.  Almost there, poor Cottontail slips, tumbling far far down the mountain just as it is almost a dawn, with an injured foot.  What happens next is pure magic, that a kind wise old Grandfather might bestow on the tired small but great hearted creature....and in so doing, bestows this on us all.Written in 1939, the year before DuBose Heyward died, this story honors the dreams of girls and those with dark skin, those who are mothers first, those who are themselves kind, wise, and clever.  Flack's watercolor paintings in  greens, coral, yellow spring colors bring the world of Cottontail to believable life.  This book is perfect for Easter and throughout the year; reading it,  I believe ,enters gently & beautifully into the hearts and minds of my own little bunnies.READER ALERT:  This is a classic.  If at all possible, get the large format edition.  Readers getting the smaller size have been disappoinmted.  This review is based on the hard-cover large format book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HV3F3GVTO495/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0395185572#wasThisHelpful","R1HV3F3GVTO495","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There could be two take-aways from this enchanting book, one warm'n'fuzzy and the other darker.  Molly Lou Mellon is Thumbelina-size, with a voice like a frog's, buck-teeth so prominent she could qualify as a beaver, and she's a klutz.  What Miss Molly has going for her is a grandma who tells her never-you-mind sayings such as, ""Walk as proudly as you can and the world will look up to you,"" """"Sing out clear and strong and the world will cry tears of joy.""  When Mollie Lou moves to a new town, the school bully, Ronald Durkin starts out on her by calling her ""Shrimpo"" in gym class.  She puts him in his place by running between his legs with the football and scoring a touch-down.  By day five, Mollie Lou is the star of the school in football, cutting out amazing snowflakes, and shouting so loudly Ronald is flattened. ""Grandma,"" she writes, ""everything you told me is exactly right.""Reading this as the celebration of a different child or of our differences is sweet, heart-warming, and easy.  However, the sub-text is that it sure helps and may be essential if one is this different to be better than everyone else in skills other children value. Mollie Lou's self-assurance may have led to her prowess in football and snowflake cutting, to her daring to do anything, but alone, the Ronald Durkins can prevail.I love this book and it is a favorite with my next generations, but we read it with awareness that Mollie Lou made herself into an exceptionally talented smaller person.  That as well as Grandmother's assurances. can turn the bullies into friends and admirers, even contributing a penny to Mollie Lou's penny-stacking feat on those front-teeth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TFJEQP6XYAC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399234160#wasThisHelpful","R2TFJEQP6XYAC7","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pure magic, the watercolor drawings of this book for 2 to  5 year-olds, bringing to life 22 new friends--24 if I  include the giant potato and the leprechaun.  Set in an Irish-like countryside of about 200 years ago, Tomie dePaola retells an old story that appears in many cultures. Jamie doesn't like to work; his wife Eileen does what's needed for them to eat.  When her back goes out, Jamie fears he'll die from lack of food, so off he goes to get ready for the sad event.  On his way to the village, he finds a fairies' shoemaker (the leprechaun) who outsmarts his captor by giving him a seed for the biggest potato on the world, rather than his treasured gold.  The blessing becomes first a bane (can't get that veggie out of the ground), then a blessing (the curious villagers help), then a bane (ooops! it blocked the road), then a blessing thanks to quick-witted and kind Eileen (every one can have all they want), then a bane (the villagers eat and eat and eat and eat until they never want to see a potato again), and then a blessing as they offer food for life if Eileen and Jamie plant no more giant potatoes...the big pratie for sure.The story has a fine lilt of words and as I mentioned, the drawings are wholly charming in DePaola's much-loved style.  Is there anything more though to reading children this story?To me, this is a classic tale of the apparently not-too-bright person--a schlemiel, a trickster, a lazy person---who by a ""fortunate misfortune"" and a certain talent for keeping on, brings fortune to her/himself and the community.  I particularly like that the heroine is the hard-working, cheerful, and very bright Eileen who invites everyone to take all the potato they want, and how the community eventually pitches in to deal with the situations. The children with whom I have read this giggled at the turns of the story and loved the gay illustrations and the rhythm of the tale.Recommended with delighted enthusiasm for the humor, imagination, and good things to be shared here.  It seems to me an opportunity for readers, if they chose, to add some history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P1IUGQROOE5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0698116038#wasThisHelpful","R3P1IUGQROOE5N","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pot-of-gold perfect and here's what's I found to love about this adorable, affordable centerpiece--big enough to make an impression: height including the rainbow is 8"", length including the shamrocks is 9', height of the green pot alone is 6"" and the diameter is 7""--small enough for talking across the table; any higher, and it would be an obstacle if placed in the middle--color is bright, a true shamrock green with intense rainbow color and gold. No washed-out rainbow here--all-around centerpiece.  The green pot unfolds and the rainbow & clover are printed so this is pretty from all sides--easy to set up.  I almost did not order because I thought ""slot-A into slot-B, then tuck slot-C""  kind of construction would be needed.  This is pre-kindergarten simple.  Just one unfold and a small paper-clip is even provided for easy clipping both sides together.  Great engineering here, Leprechauns.--refolds flat easily to store. It arrives flat too which makes it almost zero-space until set-up--stable on a flat surface, no propping up needed--where I live, I could find nothing of this size & quality for such a relatively affordable price.  Got here at warp speed too & I loved the free shippingAny buyers alert?  Buyers should be aware that the coins are printed.  I put a small piece of paper in the top of the pot and added some jelly beans which look cute & taste yummy even if not exactly Irish.  Also, pots of gold are sometimes shown as black wee kettles or golden cauldrons which may be what you want.

""Atomic Dreams at the Red Tiki Lounge"" is a wild, wonderful, no-holds-barred historical-mystery-science fiction novel by Tiki Shark (artist Brad Parker) and writer S. P. Grogan.Set in 1946, initially in Honolulu and ranging from there to Bikini Atoll where the first underwater atomic bomb was tested to the frozen summit of the Big Island's Mauna Kea, this novel has a cast of characters as numerous and richly detailed as Dickens.  Featured first are a severely wounded veteran, Hunter Hopewell, recovering at the bar of the Red Tiki Lounge, his alcohol-fueled life surreptiously funded by a woman of many names, or rather, businesses.  Tommi Chen is a survivor who is determined not only to endure, but to prevail--at any cost, although she is less likely to off the offenders than to shanghai them.A case could be made, though, that the protagonists are Pele, seen as creator and protector of earth and its life, and Ku, King Kamehameha's inspiration, and the god of War.  When atomic bombs explode, the explosions rip the barrier between the worlds, letting in Goya's ""The sleep of reason breeds monsters.""  Nasty kind of monsters & Ku is out to bring them under his control, an idea Pele opposes with all her skill and might.Or a case could be made that the novel is about the artist Tiki Shark himself, who appears throughout as the sidewalk artist and free spirit he is (and has been), whose sensibilities, actions, and asides drive the events.Whatevah...this is one glorious trip.  The hardcover book includes several full-color paintings by Tiki Shark whose works are collectors' items (see particularly page 146--five WOWs right there) as well as over ten black-and-white Tiki Shark drawings and many well-chosen photos of the underwater explosion and planes including a Lockheed Electra (hint!) and one of the big, beautiful Clippers.  Throughout, there are cameo appearances of now well-known people as they would have been seen in 1946, each convincingly interwoven with the on-going story.The book itself is a collector's item: mine is signed by Grogan and Tiki Shark, number 400 of a printing of 1,000.  Hustle to your indie bookstore or Amazon order site and get a signed, numbered copy if you are early & lucky.  If unsigned, no problem: it is still a great read.Any Negatives?  This may not be to everyone's top ten tastes.  There's romance & sex (hey, it's about Hawaii) but it is not primarily about pant-pant experiences.  The style is more Hunter Thompson and Ken Keasey with maybe a touch of Ray Bradbury, than Jane Austen, but the voice is too original to pigeon-hole. Among the pleasures of ""Atomic Dreams at the Red Tiki Lounge"" is that Grogan is so skilled a writer.  A master of dialog, with keen attention to literacy: Miss Eva Mae Brown of blessed memory and Lynn Truss and yes, Strunk & White would be appreciative.I sure am.  Thanks a lot, Tiki Shark and S.P. Grogan.

"""The Kiss,""  painted by Gustav Klimt, in golds, blacks, and greens, is a gorgeous and an intricate painting.  To see it duplicated well in sox signals a work of art, too.  These are lovely.  Bright colors, good detail in the design reproduction, an attractive conversation starter.  The fit is fine for average legs or more slender legs.  A delightful gift & fun to put on!These sox come in blue or sunflower yellow.  The Klimt original is sunflower yellow & gold, so to my eyes, the yellow is not only cheerful but also more ""authentic.""  However, other buyers might prefer the blue if it harmonizes better than the gold/yellow with their other clothes or the color choices of some lucky friend.Treated with respect, these wear well. Thus, I would suggest hand-washing in cool water and hanging to dry rather than putting in a washing machine with stuff that might snag threads and drying until crisp.

"WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT:Carolyn Burke's story of Edith Piaf shines with empathy for a woman whose life was as amazing as her voice.  The voice brought her the love of ""her public"" so intense her grave at Pere Lachaise Cemetary is among the most visited year after year.  The life brought her money, travels, friendship of men such as Cocteau yet an emptiness her large entourages and an ever-active bed seemed unable to fill.Both make for a fascinating story, vividly told in 16 chapters and 230 pages, organized chronologically and written in a highly readable style.  The table of contents begins with a puzzlement that turns out to foretell Piaf's life.  Chapter 1,1915-1925 covers ten years.  Chapter 2, 1926-1932 covers six years.  All the other chapters cover 2 or 3 years each, not corresponding particularly to what was going on in the world, be it writ relatively small (popular music, for instance) or large.This turns out to reflect how little is known of her early life other than its misery: by ten, she was making her own precarious living and that of her amorous, acrobat papa as a street singer.  During the next years, she was discovered and shaped into Edith Piaf by her mentor, man about the shadier parts of town, called by some a Pygmalion and by others a Svengali: shaped into her musical ""realistic songs"" style, her black dresses, and confidence as a lyricist.  That she survived at all, this 4'8"" waif-like woman, is astonishing.Those 14 separate two-year chapters?  They seem to be the approximate time with which she was enamoured (and vice versa) of a succession of lovers who helped ensure she did not sleep alone.  Piaf, as Burke convincingly documents, lived by and for music, exhausting herself and everyone else until each song was perfected in intonation and gesture.  However, she could not endure being alone, and to that end needed not only the lovers, many of whom she mentored, but also the loyal entourage to whom she was most generous.  She never could save a sous and had to work beyond her strength to earn the livelihoods of all.Exhaustion and auto accidents, drinking and drugs spiraled her to a difficult death, eased by the loyal friends and her 20 years younger fourth husband, Theo, whose pictures suggest an out-of-this-world hunky quotient. Piaf was gone early, and very much not forgotten.WHY READ THIS BOOKIf one loves Piaf's music, Burke's version of the fairly often told tale is well put together.  I liked the quality of writing, the page-turning pace, the focus on Piaf without numerous digressions, and particularly the skillful integration of the numerous lyrics with the developing story.For a more casual reader, the book has the human interest of popular weekly magazines, a story from which a grand opera could be written with something of the scope of Les Miserables and the fascination of Evita,and which left me interested in learning even more.  I was entertained and felt I got great value for my time & money.ANY READER ALERTS?  Readers looking for a profound analysis, examining Piaf more analytically or in the context of what else was happening in popular music or sociologically, may find less in this book than they prefer.  Such readers will however receive a useful bibliography for some of the depth & discursiveness as well as a good index.The tone is non-judgmental with regard to such matters as Piaf's enthusiasm for married men or their attraction to her.  For me this was fine recreational reading----it could make for example a gift for a friend traveling to Paris, a beach book par excellence, or a great way to spend an evening, with Piaf in the background and this book in hand.Burke doubtless worked very very hard to get the story as fully & accurately as possible and I apologize if this seems disparaging.  Far from it: writing a good read that brings to life a complex, often admirable, outrageous & courageous and enormously talented woman takes skill and will.  Thank you, author Burke, and I hope many readers enjoy this as much as I did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5PSQKT2G0WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307268012#wasThisHelpful","R3U5PSQKT2G0WH","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUTWhen a new airport was built in Mumbai, a grotty small area bordering a lake of sewage became a shanty-town in which much that is best and much that is worst in India happens daily to the several hundred people author Katherine Boo studied.  For over three years, she recorded what was happening in this micro-mini-village, following in depth three women and their families.During this time, they use almost every moment to get food to eat, to earn a few rupees, to avoid trouble, and when trouble finds them, get free of its strangling toils.  Far too often, it is their next door neighbors and corrupt institutions who wring their necks and despoil their hopes.  Yet they find friendships now and then, and almost saintly generousity at times.The stories close for this one place, because their shanties are pulled down, and they must find whatever they can, wherever they can to survive.WHY READ THIS BOOKSome readers have seen plenty of the world's suffering, either directly or more indirectly through books such as Rohinton Mistry's  ""A Delicate Balance"" or glimpses in movies such as ""Slumdog Millionaire.""  For others, reading about horrors such as the Holocaust or suffering such as ""Behind the Beautiful Forevers"" is overwhelmingly depressing.Yet others may want to know from a skilled and presumably reliable journalist what makes efforts to relieve poverty and democratize other countries so difficult and the returns to billions spent in aid seem to yield so few benefits to the intended beneficiaries.For such readers, ""Behind the Beautful Forevers"" may be among the more unforgettable books.  Like ""The Diary of Anne Frank,""  like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" Boo brings to individual life those who can otherwise be faceless statistics of birth and death.  In ""Death of a Pig,"" E. B. White's magnificent essay, White mourns the animal's death not as loss of bacon in a future hungry time, but as loss of a fellow being who also suffered in this suffering world. I do not in any way compare those who live such difficult lives to pigs whether suffering or not but believe when we see others as our fellow humans, we may come closer really to caring about them and perhaps moving outside our own comfort zones to helping, as we can, make their lives better.READER ALERTS?  The book is well written indeed, so much so that some commentators believe it is a novel.  It is not.  I've spent some time in India, including Mumbai, and know that while Boo scarcely has told the whole story of this vast, complex and determined country, she has nailed one part of the mosaic.  Thus the four stars. Faulkner said, ""I believe mankind will not only endure; it will prevail.""  India and its peoples struggle to endure, in spite of everything, hope and dreams can remain in the darkest of times, the bitterest of experiences.  Or such has been my very limited experience in India and the testimony of others, far more knowledgeable.I'd give this book five stars if (1) some space was given to the people in their own voices, (2) more assurance was given about the reliability of the translation since Boo does not communicate directly, and (3) there was much more assurance that the people she met benefitted directly from the extraordinary amount of time she demanded of them and that this is not exploitation. Sadly there are instances of ""Our stories, your royalties.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O97YS2L7NPHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=081297932X#wasThisHelpful","R2O97YS2L7NPHY","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT:The story tells what some seriously bibulous party-goers said at a celebration of a big win for the handsome Agathon, in the 416 BC contest amongst tragic playwrights.  He'd feasted his performers the night before, and wine did not run short.  The more select group he invited for a following banquet thus decided not to drink after practically every sentence, but as they pleased.  Symposium means literally, ""drinking together"" ---not for the abstemious!  Drinkers took it in turn to improvise on a topic suggested by the Master of Ceremonies, who selected in this case, the praise of Eros.  A symposium was a celebration not only of an event, but also held to honor a god or gods, bringing together the sacred and more profane.Six of the praises are reported by a narrator, Apollodurus, who is telling a companion what he heard from someone who was actually there, Aristodemus.  Aristodemus, however, had plead intoxication and the capacity to recall only what he considered the high points.  So enter into the spirit of the tipsy occasion and into the purposes of Platon who probably made up the whole of it.AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTSThe six speeches wonderfully reflect the characters, voices, and quirks of the men. Phaedrus the philosopher, he of the silver-gilt hair, most handsome himself, speaks well, imaginatively, and proposes Eros is a god who inspires the lover to the heights of devotion, even unto death, as Alcestis died for Admetus.  Young, we might think, he imagines an army of lovers, each striving to win honor for his beloved and, inspired by Eros, ready to die to defend his beloved.He's followed by Pausanias, whose speech could be a Swiftian satire of how lawyers from 2300 years ago to today, can think, a selfie of his own argumentive cleverness in differenting types of Eros and explaining the fine points of Athenian laws on pederasty. Read aloud, it is LOL funny.OK, on to Eryximachus, a physician, who advocates temperance in all things and elaborates on the dual nature of divine and profane Eros, extending Eros beyond sexual desires to the love of the Beautiful. Knowledgeable, yet no poet he, this encomium can inspire readers of today perhaps to avoid sharing a couch with an Athenian physician if you want a good time.Now at last the magnificent comedic writer Aristophanes speaks, beginning with a story on how male and female were once one body, spherical in shape, what happened and with what consequences.  Aristophanes is speaking of the human condition, with Eros as a single healing force, a speech of great beauty & power.  Agathon's in comparison is eloquent but flat----and then Socrates weaves the best from each, reveals the limitations of each, and raises us mortals to the divine in Eros as a devotion to the good, the true, the Beautiful.Socrates claims only to be sharing what he learned from Diotima, the Wise Woman, about love & Eros.  Diotima's  final spine-tingling sentence reads in full, ""In begetting true virtue and nurturing it, it is given to him to become dear to god, and if any other among men is immortal, he is too.""  Almost 2,300 years later, we know as did the first readers of Plato's ""The Symposium"" that while Diotima refered to those who contemplate the Beautiful, beholding the divine Beauty itself, single in nature, she could be speaking of Socrates himself.  Which is why, says editor Allen, Plato put the speech as Socrates telling what Diotima said, rather than speaking in his own voice, Socrates who claims not that he is wise, only that he is a lover of wisdom and beauty.Then Alcibiades lurches in, and gives a strange speech in praise of Socrates, including an erotic but more detailed report than might be expected of how Socrates ignored Alcibiades' efforts to seduce him one cold Athenian night. More revelers arrive breaking up the Symposium.  Finally only Agathon, Aristophanes and Socrates are awake, discussing tragedy and comedy, until the first two have been vanquished by Dionysus.  Socrates arises, goes as usual to debate all day long, unvanquished by Dionysus or, in debate, by any other.  The Symposium, like Woolf's ""Orlando,"" seems a gift of deepest love from Plato to the memory of Socrates.WHY THIS EDITION OF ""THE SYMPOSIUM""I agree with the scholarly reviewer who compares six editions, concluding if only one would be read, Allen's would be the choice for the quality of the translation and the value of Allen's comments Hear! Hear!I also agree with the reviewer who suggested beginning with the translation itself (76 pages including footnotes), then reading the over 110 pages of Allen's commentary.  The translation and footnotes are readable as they are.  Allen's fine commentary greatly deepens and enriches our understanding of the context----a defense of Socrates against charges of corrupting the youth of Athens.  This is valuable, but not essential to reading ""The Symposium"" in its own voice first.OVERALL:  ""Truth is beauty, beauty is truth"" may have its roots in Plato's ""Symposium"".  This is a fine edition and at used book prices, a great, almost piratical, value.There is a niggle. The arc of The Symposium is from Eros as physical sex to love of divine Beauty.  The cover drawing displays only the lustful but not exactly as this translation's notes say.  The picture of the satyr and maenad suggests she has a choke-hold on him, rather than the other way, as the Allen edition states.  Granted his hand is way beneath her gown, but one wouldn't mess against her will with a robust woman holding a spotted panther by the tail & a huge thyrsus in the arm around one's neck.  The picture is from a drinking cup of the period.  Perhaps the drawing was selected as a quiet thanks to whoever Diotima may have been and to Plato's selection or creation of her as the wise woman to whom Socrates attributes his education in matters of love.The Symposium draws us into a world of possibilities and attentive thought.  Eros, life, and love says this edition as a whole in this robust, forthright translation, are more complex, affirmative, and joyous than they may seem. Bibemus!  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HVKZ3OW7JHZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300056990#wasThisHelpful","R3HVKZ3OW7JHZH","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In February 2004, Nikki, a fellow survivalist, Micah. and a cat were dropped off at Native Anchorage on Village Island in Alaska's Queen Charlotte Strait.  Nikki was pissed off because Mom told her to work to buy an expensive jumper (horse) she wanted for her Olympic dreams---in addition to horses Mom already had given her.  She worked in a stables for two weeks, then quit, and decided to follow a childhood dream inspired by ""The Other Side of the Mountain.""""Becoming Wild"" is based on her journal of 18 months living primitively.  Perhaps unexpectedly, ""Becoming Wild"" shines with candour and humor, the stories interspersed with this young woman's growing insights into herself in relation to others, to the Alaskan island world, and to her sense of the Divine.  Her thoughts on the centrality of love, on the nature of things, and on eternal mysteries and values have great honesty in the context of the hard work, deprivation, and determination needed for survival.It seems amazing that a woman whose essential supplies included nail-polish and a teddy-bear and who was utterly lacking in any knowledge of boats (they had a small rowboat) and fishing survived at all, although she tells us about four years of formal wilderness school training. What were they thinking of when they picked an archipelago where seafood would be part of eating? They did have an extensive library, to which they probably owe great thanks.Along the way, van Schyndel tells us--her ratings of the adequacy of toilet paper au natural (hint: seek out young thimbleberry leaves)--starving on clams (hint: not enough fat calories without the butter sauce and no fat salmon around)--killing, butchering, preserving, and cooking a bear (two bears, for food, paleostyle)--far too close encounters with the cougar kind--managing the essentials---building  a shelter, finding water, getting enough food for two scanty meals a day, if they were lucky.  In later months, they ate more reliably and abundantly, having learned to preserve, preserve,preserve.  Plus care packages from home.--and living with MicahShe writes vividly and cleanly, with 27 mostly brief chapters in this 237 page book, including some recipes that I hope tasted better than they sound such as mouse en brochette.Reader Alerts?  Micah's voice isn't heard except as reported dialog & experiences.  We tend to be the heroes of our own lives and I wondered how he would tell the story, what the months meant to him.  We do get some charmng pictures of Scout, a feral cat who probably helped keep them from murder or madness, and definitely kept them fd on song birds and rodents.Overall:  A thoroughly engaging story in itself, and a journey with a woman whose wit, spunk, determination, and spirit are likely to make readers grateful, gratefuller, and gratefullest she decided to go for her wilder dreams and then share them so honestly with us.  Thank you, Nikki, and good luck with your visitors lodge and recovery from that human predator.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HXA7Y7ST9EE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1927575397#wasThisHelpful","R1HXA7Y7ST9EE6","A22IV6NFWC8A5C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A22IV6NFWC8A5C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both old age and illness have approached.  This book has been indispensable in knowing from a practical and legal perspective what the possibilities are.  It has helped with conversations with physicians, hospice staff, my friends and family, and lawyers.  This is no ""Dr. Kervorkian light,"" in that Humphry tells it straight re the self-deliverance experiences and options, most of which are pretty unattractive from my point of view for a loved one or myself.  However, he also explains how to work with health care staff to reach palliation and a passing with dignity, pain free, should one choose.The book is in some ways out of date, referring, for example, to the Hemlock Society rather than to the (2014, current & excellent) organization, Compassion & Choice.  It is also somewhat out of date in federal and some state laws, particularly laws ensuring a patient's right to comfort and palliative care, as far as I can tell.However it is straight, yet compassionate in style and covers just about everything I wanted to learn about this difficult topic.If you or a loved one needs a good general book to supplement discussions with clergy, doctors, and family, you may find this excellent. It gives a solid  foundation for these discussions and further research.

"A cold laid me low; I was sneezing, wheezing, miserable.  My son bought this from COSTCO, plugged it in, switched on the UV option and almost instant relief.  This handles a 20 x 15 ft bedroom well, and has been cooling as well as clearing the air.  It is easily moved by a convenient on-the-top handle.  Three options for the fan strength (high, middle, low); UV on or off; lights out option for night.  About 2 1/2 ft tall, 8 inches diameter column, not obtrusive at all.With regard to noise, my house is carpeted, and this is positioned about 3 ft from my bed.  It is quieter than my overhead fan on low and medium levels; about the same at high levels.  Since the hum is steady, for me it is soothing.  As an unexpected bonus, this cleans the air so thoroughly that this room is now totally dust-free.  I expected pathogens would pack their bags and leave---I am sure happy about the absence of dust.  Effectiveness might vary depending on atmospheric dustiness and allergens as well as individual needs.  For me, it has been handling volcanic vog which is pretty wicked stuff to breathe.Any alerts?  Buyers should be aware this unit needs to be about 2 to 3 feet from walls for good intake airflow.  Also, it probably would be better to put it on wood or tile than on carpet, although the carpet may help keep the fan hum so quiet.  The color is black with a silver top, which fits my bedroom,  Some buyers may want white or a more colorful case but I don't know if this is available.  Cleaning has been easy by following the clear directions step by step.  No special skills needed, as far as I can tell.Overall:  I am totally pleased and happy to report since it arrived about six months ago, no sneezes at all!

"WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUTWriter Malia Collins and ilustrator Kathleen Peterson have created one of the loveliest, most powerful embodiments of which I know of goddesses Pele and Poli'ahu.  This story is a re-telling of ancient explanations of what we in Hawaii see for ourselves every day.  Snow & ice can cover Mauna Kea (White Mountain) where the snow queen, Poli'ahu, rules while new land is being created through the fire mountains of Mauna Loa (Long & Large Mountain) and Kilauea where the fire goddress, Pele, reigns.  Pele's white hot lava creates new land; Poli'ahu's waters wear them away.Once, the story tells us, Poli'ahu was playfully racing with her friends on the white mountain on a swift, narrow sled. A strange woman appears, dressed in scarlet-orange.  Then....This large-format 23 page book should delight children of all ages.  The story-teller has the cadence and eye of a poet:  ""When it was her turn to race, she leapt on to her sled and flew down the hill, quickly passing her friends.""  And later, as the goddesses dueled, racing polished wood sleds down the slippery snow and then grass slopes, Pele loses.Enraged, Pele flings fire:  ""From down below, Pele threw spears of red-hot lava that melted snow and ice.  The edges of Poli'ahu's white cloak began to burn up.  She could feel the fire at her heels.""Each page has a fully colored illustration by masterful artist Kathleen Peterson.  The oranges, reds, and blacks of Pele's cloak are contrasted with the blues and whites of Poli'ahu's cloak, both set against a the burning lava landscapes and the purple-blue-turquoise oceans of Hawaii.  The graphics and layout are stunning; one could frame every page as a work of art.Strife between brothers, contention between sisters are stories striking deep,  almost universal roots.  Young readers who have seen the movie ""Frozen"" may immediately recognize Poli'ahu's and Pele's powers, through fiery Pele and cool Poli'ahu play different roles here. This exquisite book entertains, teaches, and may ignite wonderful questions about volcanoes, glaciers and the forces that shape our world as well as about relationships.ANY READER ALERTS?  None.  A new copy of this book is fine value.  At used book prices, ""Pele and Poli'ahu"" is a bargain in quality binding, printing, & color reproduction in addition to the story itself.Highly, very highly recommended.

"I haven't been using this long enough to say that my lashes are as thick and long as I dream they will be, but I've been using it long enough to say that they are thickening up after just a few uses.  I have thin, short eyelashes and I've always dreamed of extensions but I don't think I need to even consider that after using this product.

"These nail brushes include everything needed to do a self at home manicure using nail art.  The pouch is silver, glittery and appears to be well made with the logo on the front.  It clasps shut with 2 snap closures.  Inside the pouch, there is a thick plastic cover to keep the brushes secure and clean.  Each brush has an individual plastic cover as well which I'm keeping on them. There is a card enclosed that includes information on the brushes.The brushes appear to be well made and are easy to grasp.  The colors are eye pleasing which any teenage girl or adult would love.  I believe I got a great deal with this set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12F5ODRR6C3WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YH0REG#wasThisHelpful","R12F5ODRR6C3WK","A7BUU7K8IWKV8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7BUU7K8IWKV8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm sorry to say that I had a lot of issues with this cat bed and it broke on first use.  I did try to contact the seller on a couple of different occasions but I never heard back from them.  Issues the short version, the area to slide poles was too tight and when I finally did get them in, the material was raveled. It looked a hot mess. I thought that would be the first area it would break but it wasn't. I had to assemble the last poled in that tight area and I had to hammer one side because it wouldn't fit at all. It made the whole thing crooked. One end wouldn't even come together to fold over onto the velcro right. And lastly, when I put Chelsea on the bed, the metal holding the bed to the window snapped and she fell landing on my tripod. The metal wasn't even even, so I had to adjust the suctions to try to make it a little bit even to put my cat on it. She wasn't injured enough to take her to the vet but she was sore. I do think that with some modifications this would be a great product but as it is, I can't recommend it :(. It could just be that I got a defected cat bed.  The good news is the suctions cups are great.  Even after the bed broke, those suckers stayed put on my window.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIIAOJ8LY24E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZAL0QAS#wasThisHelpful","RIIAOJ8LY24E4","A7BUU7K8IWKV8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7BUU7K8IWKV8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is absolutely adorable, unfortunately the size runs small and my little dog can't wear this.  I managed to get it on him for photos but it took forever to get it off and at one point I thought I was going to have to cut it off of him.

I received this product at a steep discount for review purposes but I would definitely purchase this again except in a size larger next time.  Chihuahua's tend to get cold easily and this outfit is nice and thick and adorable as well.  To put it on, I had to put his feet in the front and then put his feet in the back. There aren't any snaps that I could find on it.  It does have a little hole on the top of the back in the neck area to put the collar loop through for walking my dog.

"This is a beautiful journal, and let me tell you, the photos don't give it justice.  I wanted this journal for daily use but I'll use it for traveling as well.  I love that I can purchase refillable books for this because I can continue to use it for a lifetime.  The leather is quality made as is everything about this journal.  I took some photos to show some of the details but I don't think I captured just how beautiful this journal truly is.  I love all things vintage and retro and I keep my journal on my nightstand as part of my decor and  keeping it closes by reminds me to log my daily activities.  I have an online blog but I still prefer the pen and paper way of journaling over blogging.  I thought about putting the stickers that are included with my journal on the front of it but so far I haven't.  I'm debating on it simply because I love the stickers and after handling the journal daily, I don't want to mess them up or the journal if they start to come off.  There are a lot of pro's about this journal which can be read in the description.  The one I want to point out is that the paper is acid free. One of my favorite things about this journal is the size.  It's small enough that I can put it in any of mt handbags when I'm traveling, large or small.

"Have you ever used a dog shampoo that made your dog end up smelling like a ""wet dog"" while washing him or her?  Well, this isn't one of those shampoos.  This shampoo arrived today and because Peanut has wallowed around in something smelly, I washed him with it immediately.  Now, I hadn't planned on posting my review so soon, but while I was bathing Peanut, all I could think was this is exactly the kind of shampoo I'd create for dogs if I were to create a pet wash.  Not only was it pleasantly scented, he didn't smell like a wet dog at all from start to finish.  I could tell while bathing him that the shampoo/conditioner combo would be good for his hair and skin by the shine I was seeing during bath time.  After a good rub down following his bath, Peanut looks like he just came from the dog groomers and he smells pleasant for a change. It didn't take much at all to use so I'm sure my bottle will last a good long time which is great because I'm sure Peanut will find something smelly to roll in again, before long.

"I've always loved the fresh coffee house flavor I get when I use a good french coffee press.  I drink my coffee stronger than the normal person would so I use 1/4 cup of fresh ground coffee beans and I fill it up about 3/4 of the way with hot boiling water.  I leave it to sit for about 5 minutes.  After it has sat for the allotted time, I push the plunger down slowly until I can't push it down any further and I then pour and drink. Although I've owned many french coffee press's, I can't recall one that was as well made as this one is.  My coffee and tea stays hot until gone, which is usually within a couple of hours.  I drink coffee all morning and tea all afternoon.  I use the same amount of loose tea as I do coffee but as with both coffee and tea, if you like yours milder, I'd start with a tablespoon per 8 to 10 ounces of boiling water and work your way up until you find your perfect cup.  This french coffee press is easy to keep clean.  As soon as I drink my last cup of either coffee or tea, I soak it and then wash it as usual.  I've yet to fix a nice fresh cup of coffee with this french press, that did not taste absolutely delicious.  Coffee house flavor right at home, I can't beat that.

"I've been wanting to try this shea butter after reading all of the reviews and seeing just how many wonderful ways I could use this shea butter.  I live in a dry climate and as I get older, my skin is drying out to the point that normal moisturizers do not help any more.I make a lot of my own body scrubs, lip scrubs, etc so I had planned to make my shea butter into something wonderful but after it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that the smell wasn't anything like I had expected.  I thought I'd  have to add essential oils and maybe some almond oil which I use in everything but that isn't the case.  This shea butter is amazing as is.  I add it directly to my dry skin from the block of shea butter I received.  My skin is soaking it in and I'm super pleased with the results I've been getting so far. I can't wait to see how well it does on my skin during the winter months when my skin most needs the most nourishing results.  My skin has not looked this healthy in a long time.  I received this shea butter for free or at a steep discount to review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7IVH0CO21UY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VUNFLM8#wasThisHelpful","R1N7IVH0CO21UY","A7BUU7K8IWKV8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7BUU7K8IWKV8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grand daughter wore this outfit every time I'd let her get away with it.  She was born a picky dresser and this was her favorite cute and comfy outfit.  I bought it for her after letting her pick it out, and it was one of my prized purchases because I don't think anything I've ever bought received more use than this darling outfit did. It held up even with all of the washing in between wear and I was sad to see it handed down to a relative when she no longer could wear it.  Not as sad as she was :).  The fit was a true fit, I didn't have to swap it for a smaller or larger size.  It was perfectly fitted on little  Abby.  I would definitely buy from this seller again and not think twice about it.

"I'm not sure exactly what makes the patches work but they do.  I was provided with a sample for review and I've not stopped cleaning since wearing these.  I've cleaned everything from my pantry to cupboards to my closets.  I've almost finished every area in my home.  I wasn't really expecting much from these patches as I've purchased every kind of energy product I could find because I feel drained all of the time.  I live with chronic pain and I'm lucky if I get 3 hours of sleep at night.  Some days, it's an effort just to get up and go brush my teeth.  Being able to have the energy to complete tasks that I haven't been able to since my failed back surgery, feels a little bit like I've got a new life.  Because I'm able to accomplish more during the day, I'm even sleeping better at night.  The patches are small enough that I can hide them in hairless areas while I'm wearing them and they come off really easily.  They DON'T make me jittery or keep me awake.

I have been pleased with the performance of it and I've actually been drinking more water because of this fruit infuser. I've been checking through different recipes this week and I plan to try all of them over the course of the winter.  It's a good thing this infuser is shatter proof because the grands were fighting over holding it and it got dropped.  It didn't shatter thank goodness because I hadn't used it even once at the time they were checking it out.

"I'm all about the retro!  I have been looking for some unique canisters to go in my retro/boho/industrial apartment and when I saw these, I knew I'd found what I've been looking for.  I got these canisters at a reduced price and I couldn't wait to see how they look in person vs the photos I've seen of these.  I have a very limited amount of counter space so most canisters wouldn't work all lined up together but this set is perfect for the location they now live.  They are colorful and heavier than I expected.  I guess I wasn't expecting these to be made of glass and I'm really glad they are because they will be easier to keep clean in my opinion.  They are made with heavy duty glass at that.  It'll take a lot  to break one of these. I wanted canisters to hold items that are not the norm for canisters but it's things I used all through out the day and I knew it would make it easier to keep these in the retro canisters.  Freshness matters. I use one for my unGodly amount of 800 mg Motrin I take on a daily basis for chronic pain from failed back surgery.  I use one for cat and dog treats.  Every time we go out and come back in, they get a treat.  The other one I am using is for my Scentsy wax tarts.  I go through several a day and cutting them open and putting them in the canister saves my aching hands from trying to open the packages all day long.  This product deserves a 5 star rating.

"This is a great little tea set for all tea enthusiasts like myself.  I received this tea set recently and it has become my favorite tea set because it's affordable even at full price. This tea set would make a great holiday gift idea for anyone on your shopping list.  I haven't managed to crack the bone china cups and tea post which is a miracle for this clumsy Georgia peach.  It's sturdy and practical as well as stylish and just plain fun to show off.  The carrying handles on the bamboo tray are a nice touch for someone like me who is clumsy beyond anyone I know.  The grooves in the bamboo tray keep the cups and tea pot from moving when I'm carrying the tray.  I love that the bamboo lid on the coffee pot stays in place while I'm pouring the tea because I've had lids fall off and break while pouring and have even had some hot tea come out and burn my hand while pouring.

"My front door gets opened and shut all day long.  Seriously.  I am disabled due to failed back surgery so I order from Amazon almost daily for all of my household products and anything else I need that I prefer to have delivered to my door vs. the pain of trying to push a buggy around.  So, between Fed Ex, UPS, grand kids and other family members, a mini chacha that goes out all day, my door is opened a lot every day as stated.  It's not unusual for flies and other creepy crawlies to get in when we are going out.  It happens.  I decided I wanted to try this pest repeller for that reason.  Another reason I wanted to try it because it's recyclable.I plugged it in as soon as it arrived, right at my front door behind a bookshelf.  To date I haven't had any flies get in.  I did see a spider on the day I plugged it in but haven't since so I don't know if it moved out or is staying hidden.  I'm not sure this even works on keeping spiders out but I hope so.  I have never seen any sign of rodents in my  home but with cold weather headed our way, it's possible that one or more might try to find a warm home to wait out the weather in.  After seeing how this keeps out bugs, I'm confident that it's going to deter rodents from selecting to move in to my home.I received this product at a discount for review purposes but based on it's performance to date, it's definitely worth paying full price for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG1ETU7OJFGHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T7LCBE#wasThisHelpful","RG1ETU7OJFGHW","A7BUU7K8IWKV8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7BUU7K8IWKV8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the cutest little door stoppers I've seen.  My mom always used a black cast iron antique iron to hold open her pesky door that never stayed open without it and I always wondered why she didn't get something cute to hold it open with that didn't take up so much space.  I used to trip over that iron all the time.  Now that I have a pesky door that won't stay open without a door stopper, I wanted a cute alternative to hold my door.  Something that didn't take up an unreasonable amount of space.  I came across these door stoppers and was lucky enough to get them at a reduced cost so I thought, why not.  They are cute enough to be used year round and they are SMALL enough that no one will trip over them.  For the price, I am really surprised by the quality of the door stoppers.  They truly are heavy duty and that's  what I needed.  With grand-kids in and out of my room, a cat and a dog, I'm thrilled that it's small enough that it doesn't cause any trips or falls and the added leather holder is great as well when I want to pull it out from under my door.

I have been on vacation and I knew that my back pain would increase during that time from traveling and moving around more than I normally do.  The  main area where my pain is, is in my lower back where they reconstructed it, and in my left SI joint.  The joint is the worst pain of the two areas so that's what I've been using this cream on.  I was able to keep up with everyone in ways I don't think I would have been able to before, and I continue to use it now that I'm back from vacation.  I purchased new clothes for my vacation and I was worried about it staining them but after reading that it  does not stain clothes, I tried it and am happy to say that NOTHING is stained in the line of clothes.

I don't have to scrub the floor every day now since getting buying this litter pan so I'm a happy pet owner once again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UM3P7N1T9HVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IZX1LC#wasThisHelpful","R1UM3P7N1T9HVU","A7BUU7K8IWKV8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7BUU7K8IWKV8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The kids and I have had a lot of fun trying to decide what to use this craft tape with.  I didn't expect it to be so well made and of course it works great.  I originally bought this (at a steep discount) to use on my mini blinds in my boho bedroom.  Unfortunately, I could not remove all of the dust particles on the blonds so I couldn't use it for that. I kept back two rolls for the new blinds I plan to buy.  I'm extremely clean, however, I live in an old country store turned apartment and dust falls from the ceiling daily.  My ceilings are so high that I can't reach them to clean them daily. It's such an ordeal to drag my ladder out to clean them so I only do it 4 - 6 times a year.  I hate dust :).  With my project put on hold, I handed each of the kids a roll and asked them to get creative and they did.  They are still using the tape for new projects because there is a lot on each roll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1607BP6SKHKXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010G449UG#wasThisHelpful","R1607BP6SKHKXV","A7BUU7K8IWKV8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7BUU7K8IWKV8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally a product that helps with those little feet marks I always found on the back of my seats. Found as in past tense as I now have the mats and I no longer have my car.  I was in a MVA 2 weeks ago and my car was totaled. For whatever reason I didn't put these in my car the day they arrived which happened to be the same day I was in m accident.  Just lucky I guess.  I have to say that for the price I did not expect them to be this quality made but it was a great surprise.  Not only that but they are so easy to keep clean. I keep stuff for the kids in the pockets but I don't put their tablets in them because I don't want to take a chance on them kicking the back of the seat and cracking their screens.  I don't know how well the organizer would protect breakable objects and I don't want to take that chance.  They are perfect for keeping wipes, books, toys and other items which are always needed when we are in our automobile.

" 0:55 Mins Allen wanted to try this collar with his labs because he wants to train them for hunting and obedience purposes. The video shows how well the training is going after one week of use.  In the video he is showing the use with one of the two labs that he has, the younger of the two & a little bit more stubborn than mama bear.  Everything was included in the package and after opening it, reading the instructions and putting the collar on, he adjusted the fit and then he was ready to start training.  The training is going so well that all of his hunting buddies have been equally as impressed with it.  He's had to show how it works quite a few times since receiving this (he loves showing it off) and I do believe he's made a believer out of his buds as it's made him.  There are several different methods of getting his dogs attention as you might have read in the description of the collar.  You can select beeps, vibrations or shocks although we prefer the beeps and vibrations which are enough to get the dogs attention.

"I am SO happy with this robe.  So much so I had to get one for my mother.  She got pink and I got that just gorgeous deep green color.  This is the single softest robe I have ever owned.  Even my cat loves its softness, happy to jump in my lap (mush on it for a while aka kneading dough) and snooze.  Unlike a lot of robes/material, this is just as soft on the inside as it is out.  It's shinier on the outside but that doesn't make any difference in softness.  I feel like I got got an incredible deal on both robes.  The price is just right.  And, this is going to be amazing during winter.  It's a robe that will certainly keep you nicely warm and cozy!A couple of things to note, though it's nearly impossible to tell in the pix (pictures), this robe is somewhat cinched in the back in order to show we women have waist lines I suppose.  When I first saw the back I wasn't overly thrilled but it doesn't bother me in the least or make a difference in fit.  I order items like this a size larger than I really need to and it is very comfy and doesn't look sloppy big on me.  That may be worth keeping in mind.Also, I've noticed that some people complain of this fabric pilling on them.  Because of my general choice of clothing (usually 100% cotton), I wash everything I own using the gentle cycle and low heat and haven't had any problems.  I also avoid washing this with towels as they can be a little abrasive in the dryer.I HIGHLY recommend this robe to anyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FM2ICCN3U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA2XNAG#wasThisHelpful","R30FM2ICCN3U5","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had never heard of this company until I bought this fan but WOW!  This is one AWESOME fan!  It is expensive but It's worth every dollar I paid for it!  It has 4 speeds.  On the low and medium speeds, it really is whisper quiet.  High speed is a bit louder.  This also has a ""turbo"" button that will really crank out some air!  Even on turbo it is quieter than just about any fan I've ever owned (which is a LOT!).  I did purchase a ceiling mount from another company for this fan so I'm definitely considering hanging it.The ONLY drawback or complaint I have is that it doesn't tilt quite as low toward the floor as I would like it to.The base is very heavy so this fan isn't going anywhere on you and you can tell immediately on assembly that this fan is high quality.  It has 5 blades rather than the typical three or four and the cage is made of metal, not plastic.  It is extremely easy to put together, no tools needed.  Oh, one more bonus feature is... because of the way the fan is made, you can tell EXACTLY where you're aiming it.  No more guessing or using the fan as a ""scope"" to try to aim it where you want it.  It is such a handy feature and a rather surprising one I didn't even think of until I had it all set up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OM8VIVO6V3GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4QP8N2#wasThisHelpful","R3OM8VIVO6V3GE","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is actually the second ""Yes"" by finishing touch I've purchased within a month.  I just LOVE this little shaver.  It is exactly like the small brow and facial hair trimmers you can buy just about anywhere for around ten bucks EXCEPT this is larger and has a wider head to it.It basically only works when up against the skin which is wonderful for power saving somewhat since the nice bright white light still blinks.  It gives an amazingly close shave.  Plus, I think the name is hilarious.  ""Yes"" vs ""No no!""It comes with a couple of attachments though honestly I don't see the need for them.  It works perfectly without them.  It is rechargeable and charges quickly.  I let my mother try it and she was instantly in love with it.This shaver is IDEAL for those cursed with KP - keratosis pillaris, aka rough bumpy skin since it does not allow the hair to be cut under the bumps but on top of them so the hair can't be reburried yet it gives a nice close shave... Go figure!

"This is the second flavor of Monster ""Muscle"" that I've tried.  The first flavor I bought was chocolate.  In my opinion it's just too watery to justify a chocolate flavor.  However I'm very used to drinking chocolate Ensure which is thick, rich and delicious.This vanilla flavor is a whole different story!  It's pretty good and I actually really like it.  How could you possibly beat the combination of high protein AND Monster's energy blend?!?  Of course this has more calories, way more calories compared to Monster Zero or even Monster Rehab (20 cals per can if I'm not mistaken), it has 200 calories total per can but Of course protein alone adds lots of calories.My only issue with this is price.  Boy is this stuff expensive!  You can buy an entire CASE of Monster Zero or even an entire case of Ensure for approximately the same price as this TWELVE pack!  There's just no way I can justify an expense like this.

"I've purchased so many different types of ""readers"" (on Amazon) over the last several years I couldn't even begin to guess brand names.  I can say that I've purchased only 6 packs (several) and prefer the ones with frames since they're a bit heavier and sturdier.  Some can be found in my reviews.  The ad for these glasses (a set of 4) made some pretty bold claims about clarity and wear & tear!  The claims left me thinking ""uh huh, suuure, riiiiiiight!).  But the reason I went ahead and bought a set is because these have a very high review average with LOTS sold.  One of my biggest concerns, other than looks and quality was the fact that the ad mentioned springs.  So as a woman, my thinking was ""well peachy...high quality glasses but they have springs that will catch my hair and pull it out strand by strand.  It's something that drives me bat*!?+  Weird or not, I like to be able to slide a pair of glasses on top of my head and use 'em like a headband from time to time so the glasses need to be strong enough to keep my hair back without pulling it out a strand at a time.  And these do!  They can hold back my messy mane and when I take them off there is no hair hanging from the glasses.  These glasses are slightly heavier than my last 6 pack but it's not nearly enough to notice or bother me.I had these less than 24 hours and was SO happy with them I went back and bought the 4 pack that contains red frames!I would recommend these to ANYONE I care about!

"I never in my life thought I'd be so happy with a pencil sharpener.  But since I've recently rediscovered the zen of ""adult coloring"" using intricate drawings with colored pencils, this sharpener became quite important.  It really is designed for colored pencils.  I tried several other sharpeners I had around but all the manual ones broke the pencil ""led"" and the electric one didn't leave enough wood around the color core so once again I was left with broken pencils.

"Finding the right cable for my iPad has been a multi year quest!  I'm not even joking.  Not even a little.  I absolutely can not believe how many cables I have been through to find one/some that actually meets my needs!I absolutely love, no, make that...like.  I really like these cables a lot.  They are NEARLY perfect.  I bought these because I need SOMETHING with some length to it to charge my iPad while I'm using it as I'm reading and drifting off to sleep.  It has been almost impossible to find cables that are longer than 3 feet but shorter than 10ft that can actually charge my iPad without fizzling out after a few days or MAYBE two weeks!So I came across these cables as a set of three and when I first used one thought ""FINALLY!  SOMETHING THAT WORKS!""  The length is PERFECT.  They haven't truly failed in the many months I've owned them (not like some 10 ft or even other 6 ft cables have!)...EXCEPT!...the ONE problem with these cables that drives me NUTS is the fact that they do NOT stay plugged into my iPad.  I finally had my iPad replaced knowing I did have some sort of problem at the 30 pin port.  I thought that would be the end of the cable stress.  It was still happening but it was the same cable I'd been using on the other iPad so I got another new one (of these) out of the pack and of course, even with a brand new iPad the brand new cables kept falling out!I think the real issue is the specs and I mean starting with Apple.  I think Apple expected that every iPad owner would only use their iPads for business while sitting still at their desks at work!  That is just NOT how it works in the REAL WORLD!!!  And not everyone can afford to buy all new equipment with the Lightning adapters.  I think this is a problem I can most likely fix myself but I should NOT have too!  If the manufacturer could make the 30 pin end fit devices a bit more snugly, man I would buy LOTS of these!!!I've come to realize that most 10ft cables will fry when used to charge iPads (resistance issue?  Dunno) and as stated, 3ft cables are useless to me.I must say that even though I have this one (irritating, frustrating, hair pulling) problem with these and all cables, I WILL most definitely purchase them again because they DO NOT FRY and that to me is most important!!!UGH!!!

"This headphone case meant for the LG wireless Bluetooth headphones is a great idea if your packing your headphones away for some reason.  Maybe you have an extra pair and need to safely store a set or know you won't be using them as you travel and pack them in a suitcase.I think however, that this case is a bit too large to be truly portable, to say fit in a purse.  A backpack?  It'd work amazingly well in that case. The LG brand headphones are SO flexible that I think they could very easily be rounded into a smaller circle without hurting the headset.  Of course I am NOT speaking of current small circular zip cases you might find at the drugstore checkout (that are clearly meant for wired earbuds)  Those are WAY too small and would surely lead to wire damage.Making this case smaller and more rounded is my recommendation to make this case truly portable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F5KLSR695M36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PWE3C7W#wasThisHelpful","R2F5KLSR695M36","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gosh I sure hate leaving a review that even hints at being ""bad.""The general rule usually says two is better than one.  Unfortunately that is not so with the double row of teeth on these combs.  Of course this is merely my personal experience.  I purchased 3 of them because my favorite comb that I've managed to hold onto for years never seems to be around when I need it.  I can't even guess how many and how many different flea combs I've tried and trashed over the years.  But there's this one single cheap comb I bought years ago that always seems to work the best on my cats.  I cannot comment on the use of these for dogs.What I've noticed with the extra row of teeth is that fleas tend to get caught between the two rows of teeth so it's sometimes very difficult to see if you've picked up any fleas.  Or, if not that, you might get a big ol' fat and full female stuck between the teeth of just one of the rows and that is much more difficult to deal with.Overall, it REALLY seemed like a fantastic idea but in practice, I can get 2-4 times the number of fleas with a single row extra fine comb than I can with a double row comb.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHSJH9W5OP5LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002RJMAK#wasThisHelpful","RHSJH9W5OP5LD","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just like everyone says, these are super cute!  As a total beginner with Fimo (Fi-who?), I consider this to be more of a sampler than anything else but I have zero complaints about the product.  I was a little surprised at their size but I realized that even one small 1"" stick can do LOTS of nails.  Plus, there are a lot of duplicates in the box if you needed more of a particular design.Again, to agree with pretty much everyone here, you really do need to be careful due to the uncovered, unwrapped  razor blade loose in the box.  Just don't dump the box into your lap then reach down and grab a handful!  YIKES!Ok, please forgive the following comments/suggestions.  I'm a nurse and worrying about others is my job!  So, with that disclaimer I'll say this:  To be perfectly honest, I do think it is a little irresponsible to have an open razor blade somewhere inside the box.  Maybe if were taped to the inside of the box somewhere it wouldn't bug me so much.  When you buy a pack of razor blades here in the States, each one is always individually wrapped in cardboard.There is a tool I keep in my toolbox which I think makes cutting these SO much easier as well as much safer in my opinion.  I'm talking about a scraper that holds regular razor blades.  They are rather inexpensive and I'd recommend getting one to anyone and everyone because not only is it safer since most come with a cap over the blade, it'll give you something to hold onto and help prevent your fingers from accidentally slipping.Another little disclaimer here...I'm not endorsing these sellers or specific products, just giving an example of what I'm talking about:  with these, to safely store the blade, you slide it out and turn the blade upside down so that the sharp edge is inside and covered:http://www.amazon.com/Original-Mini-Razor-Scrapers-Eight/dp/B0045ZVKI2/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&qid=1407100494&sr=8-22&keywords=razor+blade+scraperThis is the design I use.  I like this style because the blade is snugged in with a screw-knob and also comes with a separate blade cover:http://www.amazon.com/Titan-12031-Mini-Razor-Scraper/dp/B000OEDQQW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1407100470&sr=8-2&keywords=razor+blade+scraperSigh...one more thing.  I don't recommend blade holders that are made entirely of metal simply because most of them do not lock the blade in place while in use unless specifically mentioned.I hope you find this information helpful!

But, there is enough to do a countless number of different things to your nails and the variety is great.Honestly, I would consider these to be more of a sampler of different designs.  BUT, for $10?

"These nail polish stands/holders are SO nice to have around!  They keep your bottles tilted at just the right angle to make doing your nails much easier.  They are made from a really flexible rubber so not only do they conform to most nail polish bottles, they tend to stay put on a table top so you can just dip your brush in the polish and go.  They really prevent a lot of fumbling around with the bottle and brush.The only disadvantage I can think of is time.  They come from Hong Kong so it takes a while.

"This cuticle tool is absolutely indispensable.  It works very well to get rid of thick or excess cuticle.  I actually prefer this tool over cuticle nippers because this can get more of the excess cuticle than nippers can and it does so quite smoothly... after some practice.I do recommend this tool to anyone, especially those who like to use cuticle nippers but with a bit of a warning to be careful the first few times because this IS sharp and if you move too quickly, you could wind up catching some skin with it.  If you go nice and slow the first time and watch what you're doing, you'll be just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLVTZKTECTT9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHEUUC#wasThisHelpful","RLVTZKTECTT9U","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was perfect while it lasted....see update and comments... I absolutely LOVE this case!  It has 3 slots for using this as a stand (as opposed to only two slots on a lot of other cases I've purchased).  As stated in the description the case rotates so if you have to use your iPad while it's charging, the cable can be on either side while using it as a stand.  The flowery embossing on the pink one I bought is just gorgeous.  This also has an elastic band that can be used to hang on to the case but it's really there to keep the case/cover closed.The price of this cover is just right.  I tend to go through iPad covers quickly so buying an expensive one is out of the question.  I think I'll get a few more of these in different colors so I can rotate them out from time to time.I'll post an update after I unintentionally destroy it to let y'all know how long it will last.OH MAN!  10.26.14...Well the inevitable has happened.  The covering of the thin edges of the plastic case that holds your iPad in place have peeled off the plastic case.  Thankfully someone asked about it and reminded me I needed to post an update which you can read in the comments of this review.  But as I stated in my reply, I still use this case at night in bed because I haven't found another case with 3 positioning grooves AND the ability to rotate.5-15-15:  Another Update:  TOTALLY TOAST!  It just ripped right down the middle of the back of the case!When the edging came off as I previously stated, I was only disappointed for a short time.  But, I did make a mistake of sorts, I should have taken my iPad out and used some adhesive around the edges.  But, it is something I should NOT have to do!  Unfortunately,  I STILL can't find another case I like!!!  I have so many cases now it's just stupid!  The issue is those dadgum grooves!  I HAVE TO have more than TWO in order to be able to use my iPad in my bed!  I have one position for games, another for reading.  I just do not understand WHY it is SO hard to find another case similar to this one as far as how it's set up...just not how it is MADE!  I've essentially resigned myself to the fact that I may have to buy one of these every 6-12 months!

"Wow!  This stuff is STRONG!!!I'd never heard of VHB tape until I saw a show on the History (2) Channel.  I think it was ""Modern Marvels"" that was all about sticky stuff.  On the show it mentioned that this stuff (specifically this 3M brand) is actually used in building, using it to attach GLASS...those huge glass panels such as those on a skyscraper to the building.  I was blown away thinking ""they're using TAPE to hold up those HUGE glass panels?!?""  I'm quite sure though that the VHB they use is MUCH wider than this!  lolAnyway, we needed something to hold our large window valences (for 1"" blinds) in place since the plastic clips aren't the easiest things to work with, especially since it's so hard to find the right ones.

"These stencils are not like the metal nail plates that you see with nail stamping. These are truly thin and flexible yet strong. You can quite easily fold one around a nail to paint your design. However, I am not good at using typical design polishes to create these patterns so I purchased them to use strictly with an airbrush system. There are some very nice airbrush polish sets available here on Amazon that could easily be used to create a nearly infinite number of combinations! If you already have a makeup airbrush system then you can simply use that as long as you either get a second airbrush (recommended) or you get a cleaner that will thoroughly clean out the polish prior to using it again for makeup. There are several good cleaners here on Amazon. I would recommend that you disassemble the airbrush for cleaning.

"Normally when someone asks me what kinds of things I like, gadgets is usually my first answer (well, maybe motorcycles but that's clearly irrelevant to this review...lol).  The only exception to my affinity for gadgets is gadgets made for PETS.  I cannot even begin to recall how many things... gadgets I've purchased for pets in my lifetime.  Nearly all of them had one single thing in common, they are junk and break after only a few uses.However, with that being said, Andis has restored my faith in pet gadgets.I purchased this small De-Shedder as well as the large size.  These De-Shedders+ are really great.  I am so impressed with the thought that went into the design.  One of the most important things when it comes to gadgets used on cats is NOISE!  Wait, there's one thing more important than that.  The item has to actually work without falling apart.  Anyway, these are very, very quiet.  Even my more skittish (previously feral) cats aren't scared of it.  Plus the oscillation is very smooth which is a major bonus.  I was skeptical that an oscillating rake could make much difference over a standard non-electronic one but I was was wrong.  It really does make a difference.  It helps tremendously.I have a cat with an extremely long, thin, and silky smooth coat.  Nothing worked to grab all the hair from her that I know is there because she proves it in a most unfortunate way.  Ugh!  Even ""slicker"" type brushes can't do the job.  But, this device works extraordinarily well on her.Pros (in no particular order):  quality, price, effective, quiet, smooth action, cordlessCons:  I can't think of a single oneOther comments I have about this are:  This small size is perfect for cats.  It glides gently over heads, right between the ears.  At times I do wish I'd purchased the medium size to use on the rest of the cats' body because the large is best for dogs.  The one exception to that however is I can use the large size on my ginormous 30lb Russian Blue.  He's not fat, he's just huge!  I will say that these De-Shdders+ seem to be best for fine hair.  For instance I can't really use this on my Australian Shepherd with her thick coarse coat.  I have to use a much more widely spaced rake on her that curves at the tip to help get rid of her undercoat each summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L0WGSTPG761F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OE6UKU#wasThisHelpful","R2L0WGSTPG761F","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using a popular water based airbrush foundation, I quickly realized that for my dry skin it was not working out very well...AT ALL.  It seemed all it did was dry my skin even more than it already is, making my face feel tight and shriveled and rather than hiding or minimizing wrinkles, they got worse!  It was certainly not any better than ALL of the makeup liquid and powder that make the claim on late night infomercials to be good, if not PERFECT for dry skin.  Rather than hiding my crow's feet wrinkles around my eyes, it made them worse no matter how much moisturizer I used prior to spraying on the water based make up.One day I remembered that somewhere along the the way I heard about a silicone based airbrush makeup.  With my medical background, I started thinking about how silicone is used in the medical field.  It helps to decrease scars (surgical or ""uh oh"" scars) and is often prescribed to burn victims for severe scaring by means of silicone infused or lined garments.So, with all that in mind I went looking for that silicone based airbrush makeup that I was sure I'd heard about and here it is.  I absolutely love this makeup.  It actually refines the appearance of and sits quite nicely on my skin.  I don't get that tightness that I would feel from the watery stuff as it dried and dried my skin right along with it.  Belloccio's formula uses dimethicone which is so silky soft.  It is used in a lot of primers these days but often IS the primer itself.I definitely recommend Belloccio's airbrush makeup to anyone, particularly anyone who has dry skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14C8VLI6C6B8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006E920J0#wasThisHelpful","R14C8VLI6C6B8M","A3EDB62V8SMP3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EDB62V8SMP3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Virtual Cycle Ride DVDs really keep my exercise routine from being mundane.  I own several of them.

"What a great way to add a little something interesting to your exercise routine.  I believe this DVD would be great with a trendmill routine, too...except that the second ride might be a bit too fast.  The second ride was actually my favorite even though it was a bit faster.  I loved the beautiful hues of fall.  I could almost hear the crackling leaves as I ran through the forest.I think what makes this DVD special besides the high quality of the videography and sound is that each ride actually offers changing scenes as you ride through the forest.  I enjoyed the nature sounds, too.  The birds chirping added to the overall realistic feeling of actual being in a forest.Great DVD.

I love the sea horses as they do their graceful dance through the ocean plants.This is a high quality, relaxing dvd that gives you several options to choose from.  It is easy to use and will loop for continuous uninterrupted viewing.  I own many of Tony Helsloot's DVDs and love them all.  High quality with a variety of scenes.  All are great for meditation, to help you fall asleep or just to relax with.  High recommend this DVD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUD9OF8G4KXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSP09R2#wasThisHelpful","RTUD9OF8G4KXK","A30ZXHR9EP4YUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZXHR9EP4YUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this video.  The footage is realistic, high quality and the sounds are just like that of a real fireplace.  I appreciate the fact that you can choose from one of several fireplaces and they can be played continuously.  Music can be added by itself or with the natural sounds of a fireplace.  This is HD quality and does not shake or zoom in on the screen.  It is like looking at a real fireplace without the warmth.  If you add a campfire or pine scented candle in the room gives a very complete relaxation experience.I own over twenty of the World Nature Videos and I have found all of them to be high quality and colorful with realistic sound and many scene choices.  I have purchased many relaxation dvds and these are among the finest available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TTMPWFNGFCSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9089700544#wasThisHelpful","R3TTMPWFNGFCSL","A30ZXHR9EP4YUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZXHR9EP4YUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"High Quality Sound and HD video.  Can choose one of the fireplaces complete with crackling sounds of a real fire or the lovely winter scenery complete with ambient melodies.  Harp music, ambient music or Christmas tunes can be mixed with the sounds of the fireplace.  What a lovely way to spend a cold winter evening without having to carry in the wood.This is really very realistic and looks great on either the computer screen or on your television screen.I own many of the World Nature Video ambient videos by Tony Helsloot and have found them to be some of the highest quality available.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNN65VVJZ08M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9089700587#wasThisHelpful","RUNN65VVJZ08M","A30ZXHR9EP4YUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZXHR9EP4YUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely, colorful DVD with high quality sound and music.  You can choose any of the four fireplaces from a traditional Christmas fireplace with all its cheerful, festive decorations to a plain fire that can be played year round.  The other two fires are nice, too and each of the four can be played continuously for uninterrupted enjoyment or all can be played as one continuously.  Easy to use DVD that is sure to make your holiday experience more pleasurable without the fireplace cleanup.  Can be played with the sounds of a crackling, popping fire or with lovely Christmas music from classical selections to familiar carols.

"Another great Virtual Walks dvd to add to your workout.  There are three different walks to choose from.  The walk starts on a wooden walkway as it raises above the forest floor, this is followed by a jog through a narrow winding dirt path, then the jog takes you along a rocky hill on one side onto a twisting road through a scenic forest and you end on a trail with fallen leaves that crunch beneath your feet to walking beside a calm lake complete with ducks and sun sparkling on the calm water.  On this jog you will pass people on bikes, walking, benches and changing scenic routes which hold your attention.  The dvd is colorful with realistic high quality nature sounds of rustling leaves, birds, insects, etc.Each track can be played continuous individually or all can be played as one on a loop, that way your exercise routine is not interrupted by having to change the dvd track.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W0YJ95NC5X0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UU8KOBW#wasThisHelpful","R1W0YJ95NC5X0L","A30ZXHR9EP4YUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZXHR9EP4YUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A colorful HD set of DVDs for the holidays and any time you feel like celebrating.  This is a great set from the World Nature Videos DVDs/Tony  Helsloot.  The fireworks DVD is like actually being there.  There is four different high color HD displays with either music or realistic sounds of fireworks. There is one display that features the lovely Blue Danube Waltz during the display.  This would be great for New Year's Eve as background for a party or for your own July 4th display.I love the Christmas DVD and it is my absolute favorite.  I own several Christmas DVDs.  However, none have the HD colorful displays or the variety that this DVD does.  It is everything Christmas from the colorful lights to glowing candles.  There is relaxing winter wonderland scenery complete with falling snow.  There is some fireworks, a beautiful Christmas fireplace, and plenty of Christmas displays, decorations and even some relaxing candles.  This would be great for someone who cannot get out for the holidays, as a background during a party or just to get you in the mood for the holidays.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9B0PX4G8BH5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q0DEEBC#wasThisHelpful","R9B0PX4G8BH5Q","A30ZXHR9EP4YUC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30ZXHR9EP4YUC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great video for those of us who love the mountains and the snow.  You have a choice of three different walks.  My favorite is number one it is as if you are walking at a higher elevation in the mountains complete with the melting snow along the walkway.  The nature sounds are realistic from mountain winds to streams.  The clouds are ever changing.  One of the walks even includes a darkening sky which I found most enjoyable.  There is even a scene that includes cowbells in the distance.  Very nice dvd.I own several of the Isis Visual/World Nature Videos by Tony Helsloot and they are some of the best I've found.

"Okay, this is more like 4.5 stars but this has been my favorite noise machine to date and I've owned a few over the years. First of all, I don't need a noise machine on a daily basis anymore. I bought this one for a recent three week trip to Europe. I sleep at home with a ceiling fan for white noise and air circulation, even in the winter months. Our recent trip to Europe included a Mediterranean cruise and hotel stays in four different hotels in Spain and Portugal. There was enough white noise on the boat to not need the machine but we ended up using it in all of our hotel rooms.What makes this one great is the range of white noise options. There are several and only two worked for me, but that doesn't mean the same would work for you. And this is the first time any noise machine has had more than ONE option that worked for me. Once I found the two white noises I liked, I didn't experiment with the fan noises, but those sound more industrial than like the low hum of my ceiling fan. Not bad, but not my preference. However, if you are used to certain building fan sounds, you are probably going to find one you like on this machine.I also liked the volume control on it--I had no problem reaching a good level of noise according to our surroundings and acoustics. The half star reduction caveat is that this isn't a Boise speaker. There is a very slight fuzziness to the sounds, but these are white noises and that doesn't really distract from its usefulness.Finally, as I mentioned, this went to Europe with me and it worked beautifully with a plug adapter in all of the European electrical outlets. And if it hadn't, I always had the option to plug it into my computer instead since it has a USB cord.Anyway, this machine helped me sleep better, especially the four nights when we were down the street from a police station and had regular night sounds in the city. I may not have slept at all those nights without this machine next to my pillow.Other pros:A 60 minute timer if you want one. I don't since the lack of noise wakes me up.Smaller footprint that any other noise machine I've used.Easy to understand controls.It traveled well and was sturdy to the jostles of luggage.The USB power adapter is universal and if lost can be replaced with any standard USB charger/adapter.Really couldn't detect any sound looping in the fans and white noises, easy enough with these types of noises, but I've had enough machines that couldn't achieve that.Cons:It may be smaller but it has heft. I haven't weighed it but it is at least a pound which can be significant with luggage weight restrictions. All my previous machines have actually been lighter but with a much bigger footprint.The power cord is permanently attached. I would have preferred for the cord to be fully USB in both directions so I could remove and store the cord more easily instead of worrying about stressing the join between machine and cord. That said, there isn't any stress visible from wrapping the cord around the base and it is a sturdy cord attachment so far. But fully removable would have been safer and more convenient for me unless you are worried about losing the cord altogether.

"The locking lid and spout cover are improvements on the newest version of this Brita Pitcher that negate the earlier negative reviews on the earlier iteration of this pitcher. This is not a perfect pitcher but it is still an improvement over the earlier model. I wish these pitchers had more of an airtight lid. Also, the spout cover doesn't appear to be too sturdy. It is working fine for me but these are early days and I am not sure how long it will  last. I use my Brita mostly for cooking--I make a lot of soups and occasionally boil pastas. I also use it to make flavored waters in an infusion pitcher. It works well for that and helps remove the ""green"" taste and odor our local water has this time of year.  Of course, I usually have to fill and wait several times for water to filter when I am cooking. You cannot pour water until the reservoir has emptied and filtered all water in the pitcher. Otherwise the unfiltered water is going to pour out with the filtered. That is the nature of a water filter pitcher and expected. It is totally worth it and consider this one of my cooking tools. I like this model over some other brands because it has a sturdy base and won't tip over which is a threat in my often overfull fridge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9W37V6OFHM4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8M0S#wasThisHelpful","RG9W37V6OFHM4","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, this set of screwdrivers is for light household needs and they are perfect for that, especially for the price. And really, if I am needing extensive screwdriver needs, I move to the drill. Screwdrivers are like proverbial socks in the dryer in our house --and socks rarely disappear in our house so screwdrivers are worse--so I have my own set of screwdrivers in a small toolbox that are HANDS OFF without at least a verbal agreement to return them to their special place in the laundry room. But over the last few years some sizes are starting to disappear so it was time to replenish. I like the range of sizes and needs on these. They are comfortable and they work.

"2.5 stars rounded up to three since I like Playmobil in general. Okay, this is larger than expected and it does play music, but there just isn't much here to justify the price. I like Playmobil and this still thrills five-year-old Kensie who loves fairies and unicorns. ""They are my favorite animal!"" she says. But there is no real building or scope for imagination with this set with very few pieces and essentially a plastic cone I like to think of as a Rapunzel tower. It makes all of the Lego Elves sets look positively generous and bargain priced in comparison. And I have bought Playskool and Imaginext full castle sets for not much more than this. Perhaps the tv tie-in has raised the price on these even though I would not consider it as highly visible or coveted as other series?

"This is a beautiful watch. When the hubby saw it, he agreed and wished that it came in a guy's version. The pictures online are a little deceptive--the face is gray toned, no real trace of purple but the pattern is still very distinguishable with silver and gun metal tones. I don't usually choose leather band watches anymore and this one reminded me why I don't--it's rather stiff and not very flexible right now. Only time will tell if it holds up to wear or will break or split--an issue I've had with bands that are this stiff in the past, but I won't know if this will wear well until I wear it for quite a while. But the watch is pretty and I will enjoy wearing it. Later on I may see about changing the band out for a metal one.Edited later: The more I look at this watch's face, the more I love it. It is really attractive. When my mother saw it, she said she wanted one, too, and our tastes don't always mesh.

"These are certainly convenient and safer for usage than the traditional bottles of bleach but I am not sure if they are worth the price difference for most usual applications in my home.

I do like the low profile--the containers are surprisings small--and convenience but I am not sure I am convinced about the price and overall benefits.

"This is a pretty watch. I've not had it long enough yet to see if it is a reliable time keeper, but I rarely have problems with watches so I don't expect I will with this one either. The face on this is larger fitting the current styles in a larger watch face. I actually prefer a slightly smaller one myself but this is pretty and feminine without being over the top. I like the little crystals on the face and I always love mother of pearl watch faces. Of all my watches, this is going to be the one my mom wants, so it is also versatile in style. She will like the larger watch face for easier reading, too. I am reducing a star because I am not sure about the bracelet. It is an unusual clasp and I can see myself breaking or at least chipping a nail trying to open it.

"I am a little torn over this book. It contains great advice for the college bound but it is most helpful starting out with 8th and 9th graders--which I feel is when a lot of students are not going to receive it. Most teens and their adults are not looking for this type of book until at least junior year. So then you read it and feel like you are far behind and have already failed to achieve some of the goals because most likely you have. Which is our experience since I got this to share with a friend of the family who is beginning her college application process right now at the beginning of her senior year. But the advice is excellent advice. Then there's the up-to-date data about testing and such, which will be somewhat out of date by the time the 8th and 9th grader hits junior and senior year. So a new edition would be helpful--it's rather like buying a travel guide, some of the info stays useful for five years, some of it not as much. I do like that the book encourages the student to take charge of his/her own education track and not rely on parents to do it for you. So yes, recommended, but frustrating all the same when you come to it later than the authors planned but still need some of the advice included.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW1DB410PI0HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506200869#wasThisHelpful","RW1DB410PI0HP","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a sizable Folkmanis puppet collection that I have used for years with storytelling and interacting with children. The Snowy Owl--I've owned one for several years now--is always a big hit with the older kids thanks to the Harry Potter tie-in, but the little kids who are unaware of Harry Potter love it just as much. The real draw is the head turning that makes the owl seem life like although the beak doesn't move. The puppet is soft and cuddly but also has the structure for it to be a great puppet. It fits my slightly larger than average adult feminine hands but accommodates the kids who play with it well, too. When I pulled this one out recently to share with my younger nephews and nieces, the owl was one of the more popular puppets since they could easily manipulate the head, easier than some of the other puppets that require a bit more dexterity with fingers and hands.

"So Lightning cords disappear faster than socks in my household. We need them for the cars and the house. The children are especially hard on them, with cords lost to fraying or simply lost period. The summer started with a sufficient number and by end of summer, we were at practically a negative number again. So obviously we needed replacements and preferably at a reasonable price. Since Apple overcharges for their cords--cords which have the highest rate of fraying at the connector joins, too--I am not eager to give my money to them. Of course, certified cords are a must so that they will hopefully work. This one does. I have become an AmazonBasics fan since the tech peripherals I have bought from haven't failed me yet. (We own 4HDMI cables, 1 set of computer speakers, a car charger, etc. in the line. And while this white cord was free, I had previously bought a black one that works well for us.) This cord works much better than the ZeroLemon brand I bought earlier this year.

"The North American Bear Dolly Pockets line is a fun way to share traditional fairy tales with the youngest people--i.e. children!--in your life. For me, these dolls inspire and almost require at least introductory interaction with your children. I find they are most successful when you introduce the doll and a fine picture book version of the tale--in this case, Goldilocks and the Three Bears--at the same time.Use the doll and finger puppets to help read/tell the story (be sure to use three different voices for the bears!) and when the book is done, your kid will want to retell the story over and over with the doll and puppets herself (or himself!). This is especially true with the 2- 5 year-old set.Tired of reading the same book three times in a row in one sitting? Using puppets like these give the pre-literate child an opportunity to replay the story over and over without having to reread so many times you are a little crazy at the end, as much as you love your kid and even the story. I enjoy watching the kids in my life replay the story themselves, watching them process and embrace the story.The puppets fit my fingers just fine and my hands are larger feminine hands. They do not fit on my husband's larger fingers. But they fit perfectly on little fingers which is the point.No, these are not branded by a certain conglomerate, but that is a bonus if you are wanting to have a break from that and share more traditional versions of the fairy tale offered in this line.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4Q2B04DBI0H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJ5MJ3G#wasThisHelpful","R4Q2B04DBI0H4","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have the PF7500 F5 and this one, the PF7400 F4. There is a $10 list price difference on these with this version being the less expensive. According to Remington, this has a shorter battery life between chargers--60 minutes vs. 40 minutes. There is not much difference otherwise. I keep these plugged in so it's not something I've tested. They pretty much shave the same, but I do feel a slightly different grip on the PF7500 F5 and prefer how it feels in my hand although the difference is pretty minor. I like foil shavers for my legs. My old Remington--which barely holds a charge after 11 years--was a treasure from when I first bought it. It was marketed to women, but Remington doesn't seem to do that so much anymore. And really, a foil shaver is a foil shaver, whatever the color or words on the box. This one I am keeping for travel but I have a feeling my niece will shanghai it during her next visit. If I were to buy a new one of these two models, I would pick the PF7500 F5 despite the extra $10. It feels a little better and seems a little more powerful. But it's a shaver. My legs are happy.

I've owner several Crock Pot branded ones over the years and still have a large Crock Pot and a very large Hamilton Beach slow cooker in my kitchen. I wanted a smaller one for smaller recipes and this went well with my assortment. It is cute.

That said, I work from home many days and won't feel qualms about using it on days that I do. But I wouldn't set it up in the morning and leave the house with it unattended.

"I've been looking for a way to save calories and cholesterol for a while now and had stopped enjoying fried foods. When I saw the Aero Fryer, I was curious and wanted to try it.As soon as I got it, I cleaned it and began using it. The first thing I cooked was a large pork chop. The second thing was a batch of sweet potato fries.Here's what I discovered by cooking these 2 items...1. Setup is very easy. It's only 5 items. (base, metal cooking drum, meat rack, fry basket, cooking extender and the top cooking/power/timer piece)2. Very easy to use. Basically, once you set up the fryer with the food and put the top on, you just set the temp and the timer and it starts cooking.3. It heats up immediately! No real preheating needed. You can put frozen stuff right in there. While it's hot on the inside, it's not that hot at all on the outside.4. When you want to interrupt cooking to flip, just flip up the handle and the fryer turns off and you can lift the top off and flip then put the top back on and flip down the handle and it starts cooking again.5. The fryer cools down quick which makes it safe to handle.6. The cooking extender allows you to put more stuff in there like fries and such.7. Cleaning is easy. Easy to break down as well.So here's some tips I've learned...•It cooks meat great but it's small so you can get maybe 2 items in there at most.• The farther the food is away from the top burner, the less crispy things get so for fries, onion rings and tater tots, use the extender ring.• Heat up the fryer a little before you use it (maybe 3 minutes). 500 degrees will purify any impurities so the meat or anything else will come out fine.• Don't touch the glass top or extender ring. While the Fryer handles heat impressively, those 2 things still get very hot.• Again, this isn't a full family cooker. The size measurements should tell you that. It's awesome as a personal meal cooker and you can stretch it to 2 but feeding 5-6 will take a while. However, that also helps with portion control.• The recipe book, tongs and optional oil spray bottle are nice add ons.Overall I really liked using it and will continue to do so. If you are expecting the exact same results as a Oil vat Fry Daddy, you will be a tad disappointed but the old fryers also use oil which hurts you health wise. This AreoFryer gives almost the same results with A LOT LESS CALORIES, FATS and CHOLESTEROL.

We locked it in place wrong the first time and had to disassemble and then reassemble so it would work. The dart colors worked well for us--we have found them all over the house and not lost one yet. Overall, it's a cool gun but there are a few quirks that make it less than perfect. My crew definitely likes having so many darts loaded at once even if they don't always fire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QF970V6OR7G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDP7R2W#wasThisHelpful","R1QF970V6OR7G5","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using the earlier version of this five subject version of this notebook for a year now for work and have already ordered a new 5 subject one for the coming year to use with my biggest client. I used to use legal notepads, but the convenience of these spiral notebooks meets my needs much better with pockets for loose pages from the client, securely bound pages for my own notekeeping and easy reference, and a sturdy, private cover. The only difference between this one and the one I used for a year is the movable pocket tabs--which aren't necessarily an improvement for me, but I think they could be convenient if they stay in sturdy enough. I won't know about that until after a few months usage at least. I can't imagine anything better suiting my needs after using this brand for the last year and finding it surprisingly perfect for my needs. I can see these being great for students, too.

"He already loves this. My husband has big dreams for football tailgating this fall. His old portable George Foreman grill bit the dust two years ago--hubby's fault for leaving it out in the weather--and he's wanted a new one ever since. His old one had legs, but he likes the reversible griddle on this one and then the way it folds down, making it much easier to transport. It's not very heavy either--I could carry it comfortably for a reasonable distance, too. The reversible griddle and nonstick surface also makes it easy to clean. As for cooking, if you like cooking on the surface of a Foreman grill, this will work great for you. If you are not a fan of Foreman grill surfaces, you'll not like this very much. We received our first Foreman about 16 years ago as a gift and have learned how to grill well on both the indoor and outdoor versions. I am not a fan of nonstick surfaces, but for the occasional outdoor excursion, this is much easier to deal with than charcoal and it cleans up well before you pack it up to return home. We'll be keeping this one for a while, especially if the nonstick surface holds up well enough which it has on our previous Foremans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX6FUDQ65VDGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUVQ#wasThisHelpful","RX6FUDQ65VDGO","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fisher-Price Little People toys are some of the favorites in our family. The Disney Princess ones are especially popular for obvious reasons. Our original castle and figures have survived 12 years of playing and are still the first toys pulled out of our closet when visiting children play in our home, even children who have technically aged out of the Little People intended age range. So the figures are a slam dunk in this set--we already owned all three but having seconds is always nice, especially to facilitate sharing. The castle is already beloved by the kids as something new but I prefer our original castle with its nooks and crannies and less, well, pinkness. This version will happily entertain and please the kids for more years to come though, for hours at a time. Whenever the house is filled to the rafters, there is always at least one child playing with the Little People sets in our closet. The ""dancing"" element may be too complicated for the intended age range, but these toys are predecessors to Imaginext so the kids in that are older age range are good at manipulating the mechanics unlike the toddlers for whom the set is really intended. This is up to the usual Fisher Price standards so overall a reliable and happy making toy that will last for years judging on the previous iterations we own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMRZU8AWR9L4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT1BY#wasThisHelpful","R2LMRZU8AWR9L4","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book--along with the earlier titles in the trilogy--for my 12-year-old niece for some of her summer reading. She is currently obsessed with everything Japan, manga, and anime and is reading less traditional novels as a result. I thought this series would make a great compromise. So far, she has been happy with the series which is a challenge since the siren call of watching anime and reading fan fiction taunts her every day. She is an advanced reader and reads everything at her fingertips but is picky right now due to her new obsession. The unusual plot and special skills of the characters as well as the inserted artwork and settings make it appealing and a series she was eager to try and enjoy.

"These are more like 3.5 stars for me. They are bright. They are fun. The erasers are the better white ones standard to many pencils these days, but not as big as I would like. They erased these pencils well enough.However, the family consensus is that these do not write as well. The hardening effect on the lead means that the pencil doesn't ""flow"" as well onto the paper. Now with some kids that is a bonus--less smeary pencils, less breakage of the point and a lead that sharpens more reliably without shattering or breaking. These pencils deliver those benefits for you. But I found myself pressing harder for a darker line than I am comfortable with. It felt like the pencil would skip if I didn't--actually it did skip when I first wrote with it before I determined the pressure I needed to apply--the same way some ink gel pens will skip and leave tiny gaps in your lines. So it is matter of what is important to you. Durability vs. ease of writing.I am also not sure about the price point here. I am seeing a first listing price that seems rather high at an average of 67 cents a pencil.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T50U7AT5SWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHHVX8Y#wasThisHelpful","R3T50U7AT5SWT","A2TS040W2FW5O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TS040W2FW5O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I am a HUGE fan of EcoTools brushes. You can't beat these brushes for the quality and price. I searched for years for brushes like this and spent lots of money on other brands that didn't perform or feel nearly as nice as these do. My favorite is the EcoTools Domed Bronzer Brush which I use for loose powder. This brush is different from the others I have used and I wasn't sure about it over my bronzer. The verdict is that I like both for different reasons. Not sure which I will end up ordering again soonest. This particular brush is also just pretty and the white brush is nice for helping me see when a cleaning could help. But to be honest, I tend to replace these pretty often due to the price point. I am still coming out cheaper with these than when I use to buy those shedding, rough expensive brushes touted at the makeup counters. And after using EcoTools, most brushes feel to rough.

The giant boxes we receive for other items are just as sufficient for the price and similar weight if not heavier.

"This is my favorite flashlight. This flashlight is very bright; it is brighter than my car's low-beam headlights. The PD35 has five brightness settings, as well as a strobe setting. The setting is selected by pushing a switch on the side of the flashlight. The flashlight is turned on (and off) by pressing the pushbutton switch at the back end of the flashlight. I typically set the brightness at the third setting. This flashlight is impressively effective at supporting inspections of equipment in large industrial facilities, even at a distance.If you perform an Amazon search for ""Fenix PD35,"" you can find several ""package"" deals where a PD35 flashlight has been bundled with batteries and battery chargers. There are two one-cell batteries made by Fenix for this flashlight: the ARB-L2 (2600 mAh) and the longer-lasting ARB-L2S (3400 mAh). Fenix sells two chargers for these batteries: the ARE-C1 and the ARE-C2. The PD35 uses one 18650 battery or two CR123A batteries (I am told by a battery fanatic that it is better to use one ARB-L2/ARB-L2S battery than two CR-123A batteries).The size and weight (3 ounces) are perfect for someone who will equip this flashlight (in its holster on a belt) in a work environment for hours and hours.IF YOU THINK YOUR PD35 IS DOA:My flashlight appeared to be DOA (dead-on-arrival). After fully charging the battery, I inserted the battery into the flashlight and pushed the button to turn it on. Imagine my disappointment when nothing happened. I tried other batteries and checked battery voltages with a multimeter; the batteries were fine, but the flashlight would not turn on. I had (sadly) decided to return the flashlight for a refund when a friend made a suggestion that solved the problem. The cylindrical body of PD35 can be separated at two locations by unscrewing; this is how you open the flashlight to insert and remove the battery (or batteries). If your PD35 appears to be DOA, try completely unscrewing the flashlight at BOTH locations, then reassembling the flashlight. You may need to do this several times to remove some of the coating material. During my initial efforts to get my new PD35 to work, I had unscrewed the connection at the rear end of the flashlight to insert the battery; however, I did not unscrew the second connection at its front end (since I did not know of its existence at the time). After unscrewing and reassembling both connections a few times, the flashlight worked just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNSXKX6OGL49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK5Y1NS#wasThisHelpful","R1XNSXKX6OGL49","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The TP-LINK Archer C5 wireless dual band 802.11ac router provides quality and functionality at a reasonable price. It is very easy to install and setup and it has all of the functions I will ever need. I am very pleased with this router.If you are considering purchasing this router, I recommend that you go to its product page on the TP-Link website and read through the ""Quick Installation Guide"" (so you know what is involved). If you want lots and lots of details, you can also download the 147 page ""User Guide"" from the website. The TP-LINK Archer C5 is considerably larger than my previous router: the dimensions are 9.6 by 6.4 by 1.3 inches (243 by 160.6 by 32.5 mm).The following items are included:- Archer C5 router- DC power adapter- Ethernet cable- ""Quick Installation Guide""- Resource mini-CD, which includes the ""User Guide""I recommend that you take a photo of the label on the back of the router before you get started. It may be useful to have this photo displayed on your computer as you first setup your new router. Information on the label includes: wireless password; default access URL (http://tplinklogin.net); default user name; and default password. It might also be good to have the information on this label if you call customer support, since the label has the product's model number and serial number (which they will want).Notable features:- Supports 802.11ac, as wells as 802.11n, 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g- Simultaneous 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless connections- Gigabit WAN port, four gigabit LAN ports, two USB 2.0 ports- SSID broadcast control, 64/128/152-bit WEP encryption, Wi-Fi protected access (WPA2- PSK, WPA- PSK), firewall protections- Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), Guest Network access, parental controls- On/off switch (I never before had a router with an on/off switch)Most folks will only need to use the ""Quick Installation Guide"" to setup this router. A hardcopy of this guide comes in the package. If you want a PDF version of the guide search for: TP-LINK Archer C5 router and go to the ""Download"" tab on the product page of the TP-Link website. For setup, you will probably only need to use the ""Quick Installation Guide"" guide and the configuration wizard [accessed by CD or a web browser (http://tplinklogin.net)]. The default IP address is 192.168.0.1. You should definitely change username and password (from defaults) for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. I also turned off the SSID broadcast. Lastly, you may need to update the firmware.A copy of ""User Guide"" is provided on the included mini-CD. You can also download the ""User Guide"" (as a PDF) file from the vendor's website. The ""User Guide"" is thorough, step-by-step (with lots of screen shots), and easy to understand. If nothing else, I suggest that you look at the explanation of the front panel lights. The examples in the ""User Guide"" are for Windows XP; this is not a problem, since all of the required Windows functions can be accessed in a similar fashion in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.Speaking of the front panel lights: the ""System"" light is on (solid) during initialization, then starts flashing when working properly; it would make more sense (and be less distracting) to have this status-light flash during initialization then turn solid.My home has a whole-house (hard-wired) Ethernet system with cables routed to a central junction box. The TP-LINK Archer C5 router has one input port and four output ports: my cable modem is plugged into the router's input port; I have three Ethernet cables and one four-port switch plugged into the router's output ports.If you are having a problem with a multi-port switch communicating with the router, try cycling the power on the switch (e.g., unplug it for at least five minutes, then re-energize it and give it time to establish communication).This router has six antennas: three internal antennas for the 2.4 GHz band and three (attachable) external antennas for the 5 GHz band. You will probably find that the 2.4 GHz band is better than the 5 GHz band. If you want to improve 5 GHz signal strength, you can try altering the location of the router in your home (trying to minimize walls, ceilings, and floors between the router and wireless devices) and the position of its antennas.I recommend this TP-LINK Archer C5 router to folks who want to upgrade to the faster 802.11ac standard but who do not want to spend a lot of money. For considerably more money, you might consider the ASUS (RT-AC68U) Wireless-AC1900 Dual-Band Gigabit Router.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG5GPO8SX5CPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JZFG6QS#wasThisHelpful","RG5GPO8SX5CPE","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Doctor Who"" was a British television show that was produced from 1963 to 1989. While ""Doctor Who"" was specifically developed for children, folks of all ages have been enjoying the show for more than 50 years (i.e., it was a ""family show""). The title character (The Doctor) is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who can travel through all space and time in his TARDIS (which, due to a broken chameleon circuit, is stuck in the form of a blue police box).During the show's 26 seasons, there were seven different actors who played The Doctor. I have seen every episode for the third (Jon Pertwee), fourth (Tom Baker), fifth (Peter Davison), sixth (Colin Baker), and seventh (Sylvester McCoy) Doctors. I have seen most of the available episodes for the first (William Hartnell) and second (Patrick Troughton) Doctors (many of the episodes are not available because the BBC reused the video tapes on which they were recorded).I recently watched all of the ""Doctor Who"" episodes featuring Sylvester McCoy (the seventh Doctor) in order. Overall, these episodes are bad. As Verity Lambert (the first producer of ""Doctor Who,"" from 1963 to 1965) said, ""You've got to be able to suspend your disbelief, and with Sylvester McCoy it got so camp. It was ridiculous, and I think that's why people stopped watching it."" Most folks hated seeing The Doctor over-acting, behaving like a clown, and rolling his Rs (e.g., ""Rrrrrrrrrrobot""). Sylvester McCoy was not responsible for the poor quality of the ""Doctor Who"" shows during his years; producer John Nathan-Turn (J N-T) and script editor Andrew Cartmel were entirely to blame for the horrible shows made during the McCoy years.Time and the Rani is the first episode of Season 24 from 1987. This episode is important because it features the first appearance of the seventh Doctor, played by Sylvester McCoy. Of the 159 stories in the original Doctor Who series, I would say that ""Time and the Rani"" is among the 20 worst. The ""Mighty 200 Poll"" conducted by Doctor Who Magazine (which rated 200 episodes from the old and new Doctor Who shows) rated ""Time and the Rani"" 198 out of 200 (third from the bottom). The same poll rated Sylvester McCoy as the second worst Doctor (with, of course, Colin Baker being the worst).In ""Time and the Rani,"" The Rani (an evil renegade Time Lord whom we met in ""Mark of the Rani"") causes the TARDIS to crash-land on the planet Lakertya. At the very beginning of the story, the Doctor ""regenerates"" into his new form (Sylvester McCoy). Very shortly, we learn that The Rani has kidnapped the Doctor to repair equipment she needs for some evil plan. As is customary following a Time Lord's regeneration, the Doctor is very disoriented and confused and not quite himself (neither his old self nor his new self).Pros:- Excellent video quality.- The original story by Pip and Jane Baker is pretty good, although it has way, way too much ""filler."" Pip and Jane Baker also wrote ""Mark of the Rani"" which was shown in Season 22. Unfortunately, their original story was vitiated by changes mandated by the new story editor, the producer, and a BBC exec.- Good first-time use of digital special effects.- Good supporting cast.- Interesting costumes and makeup.- Good outdoor scenes (which were notoriously difficult to shoot).- Witty dialog here and there.Cons:- Criminally bad portrayal of The Doctor by Sylvester McCoy. Mr. McCoy plays The Doctor as a buffoon. While the Doctor had sometimes been whimsical and funny (as with the Patrick Troughton's second Doctor and Top Baker's fourth Doctor), he had never before been portrayed as a clown. This ruined the series for me. When The Doctor played the spoons (including Kate O'Mara's breasts as a percussive surface) I knew that the show was doomed.- The Doctor's companion, Mel (Melanie Bush, played by Bonnie Langford), is dreadful. Before producer John Nathan-Turner, Doctor Who had some truly great companions; after J N-T took control of ""Doctor Who,"" he originated the most annoying and hated companions in the series. For example, compare Mel to Leela (a companion of the fourth Doctor): when confronted with a monster, Mel (like Peri before her) screams and screams and screams and screams; in contrast, Leela might turn to the Doctor and (with a gleam in her eye) says, ""Doctor, we must make weapons and kill the beast!!!"" In fact, Leela might just pull her knife and plunge it into the heart of the monster without saying a word.- The portrayal of The Rani was not as good as it was in ""Mark of the Rani.""- Horrible background music.- The question-marks on The Doctor's costume. This was an idiotic idea of producer John Nathan-Turner, started in the last season of the fourth doctor. J N-T is also responsible for dressing the sixth Doctor, Colin Baker, in that ridiculous clown suit.In summary, you should skip this story until you have seen the episodes for Doctors 1 through 5. With a few exceptions, the Sylvester McCoy years were rather bad in comparison. Even so, I am glad I got this DVD because I liked the Special Features.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0JE6WUU7ESP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MA1JZY#wasThisHelpful","R1U0JE6WUU7ESP","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my favorite flashlight. This flashlight is very bright; it is brighter than my car's low-beam headlights. The PD35 has five brightness settings, as well as a strobe setting. The setting is selected by pushing a switch on the side of the flashlight. The flashlight is turned on (and off) by pressing the pushbutton switch at the back end of the flashlight. I typically set the brightness at the third setting. This flashlight is impressively effective at supporting inspections of equipment in large industrial facilities, even at a distance.If you perform an Amazon search for ""Fenix PD35,"" you can find several ""package"" deals where a PD35 flashlight has been bundled with batteries and battery chargers. The Fenix PD35 can also be purchased by itself (Fenix PD35 2014 Edition 960 Lumen CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Tactical Flashlight with holster, lanyard and Four EdisonBright CR123A Lithium Batteries).This bundle includes the following:- Fenix PD35 flashlight- Fenix ARE-C1 battery charger, which supports either AC or DC (e.g., car) charging- Fenix 2600 mAh ARB-L2 rechargable lithium-ion battery- Two CR123A lithium batteries- Belt holster for the flashlightI purchased two of these PD35 bundles. I now wish I had purchased the bundle that includes the 3400 mAh ARB-L2S battery, instead of the 2600 mAh ARB-L2 battery: Fenix PD35 2014 Edition 960 Lumen CREE XM-L2 U2 LED Tactical Flashlight, Fenix ARE-C1 two bays Li-ion battery charger, Fenix 18650 ARB-L2S 3400mAh rechargeable battery with Two EdisonBright CR123A Lithium BatteriesThere are also bundles that include the superior Fenix ARE-C2 charger. The ARB-L2 and ARB-L2S batteries are also sold separately (if you want spare batteries).The size and weight (3 ounces) are perfect for someone who will equip this flashlight (in its holster on a belt) in a work environment for hours and hours.IF YOU THINK YOUR PD35 IS DOA:I ordered two of these PD35 flashlight kits. Both flashlights (BOTH) appeared to be DOA (dead-on-arrival). For both flashlights, I inserted a fully-charged battery (voltage verified with a multimeter), pushed the button to turn it on, and nothing happened. I had decided to return the flashlights to Amazon for a refund when a friend made a suggestion that solved the problem. The cylindrical body of PD35 can be separated at two locations by unscrewing; this is how you open the flashlight to insert and remove the battery (or batteries). If your PD35 appears to be DOA, try completely unscrewing the flashlight at BOTH locations, then reassembling the flashlight. You may need to do this several times (five to ten times) to remove some of the coating material. During my initial efforts to get my new PD35s to work, I had unscrewed the connection at the rear end of the flashlight to insert the battery; however, I did not unscrew the second connection at its front end (since I did not know of its existence at the time). After unscrewing and reassembling both connections a few times, both flashlights worked. Dear Fenix, Please fix this problem.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7AYVG2G29J2G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR9U08I#wasThisHelpful","R7AYVG2G29J2G","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Audio Technica ATW-1501 is a professional-grade system that allows you to wirelessly connect your guitar to an amplifier. I am using it with electric and acoustic-electric guitars.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:- The transmitter (UniPak® body-pack transmitter): the digital transmitter that converts the electronic output of the guitar to a digital wireless signal. Has a sturdy clip that allows you to fasten the transmitter to a belt or the waist your clothing. It could also be placed in a pocket.- The receiver (in the form of a stompbox): the remote device that receives the digital wireless signal from the transmitter, decodes it, and converts it to an analog signal for your effects pedal(s) and guitar amplifier.- Connecting cable: has a standard 1/4-inch jack to plug into your guitar and a 4-pin UniPak® connector to plug into the bodypack transmitter.- Power supply (AC-to-DC converter) for receiver: 100-240 VAC (50/60 Hz) to 12 VDC 0.5A (center positive) switched-mode external power supply.- Two hook-and-loop fasteners to attach receiver to effects board.WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO PROVIDE:- Two AA batteries for transmitter.- A cable to connect the receiver to your amplifier or first effects-box (standard guitar-style cable with 1/4-inch jacks at both ends). I am using a sturdy cable intended to daisy-chain effects-boxes.Since the receiver uses standard 9 to 12 VDC power jack, it can be powered from a common effects-pedal board power supply, as long as the input is isolated.PROS:- It works! As far as I can hear, wireless performance is no different than on the cable.- Simple to setup and use. After unpacking the box, it took me less than five minutes to get the system operating. The most difficult part of the initial startup was figuring out how to turn on the transmitter (you need to push the button for several seconds to get it to turn on).- Digital instead of analog. No noticeable interference, static, distortion, clipping, or frequency changes. Audio Sampling: 24 bit / 48 kHz.- Two outputs (Output A and Output B). Using a slide-switch on the receiver you select how the stomp switch functions: (1) Switch between Output A and Output B; and (2) Mute/Unmute Output A. With the first option, you could switch your guitar between two different effects-chains or amp systems (for example, if switching between lead guitar and rhythm guitar). The second option (which I am using), allows me to connect my Peterson strobetuner to Output B and my Line 6 POD X3 Live multi-effects pedal (which goes to the guitar amp) to Output A. With this setup, pushing the stompbox switch mutes Output A (guitar signal to amp), while still allowing me to use the strobetuner. The default position of the switch is to Mute/Unmute Output A.- The receiver is designed to be mounted to a pedal (effects) board.- Long transmission range (up to 60 feet).- Metal construction for durability.- Excellent user manual. A printed manual comes with the product. You can download it in PDF format from the manufacturer's website (Audio-Technica dot com, search for ""ATW-1501"" or System 10 Stompbox).FACTS OF LIFE:- The receiver can be paired with up to eight transmitters. However, at the receiver, you can only select one transmitter (instrument) at a time. In other words, the receiver cannot receive the signal from more than one instrument simultaneously. From the Audio Technica website: ""If you would like to use multiple transmitters with one receiver for the System 10 Stompbox, up to 8 transmitters can be paired with a single receiver, provided that each transmitter has a different System ID. However, only one transmitter can turned On at a time; all other transmitters must be turned OFF when not in use.""- A special instrument cable (provided) is required to connect the transmitter to the guitar. For spare or replacement cables, search Amazon for ""guitar transmitter cable"" or go to your local guitar store. Audio Technica and Shure make such cables.- Battery life of the AA batteries in the transmitter is about 6 to 8 hours. You can use rechargeable batteries. There is a ""Transmitter Battery Power"" indicator on the stompbox receiver; also, the LED on the transmitter will flash if batteries are low. Keep plenty of spare batteries on hand. (And, of course, you should still carry an old-fashion cable or two.)- I did not change any settings on my equipment; however, do not be surprised if you feel the urge to make minor tweaks after switching from cable to wireless (similar to what you might do when changing cables or cable length).SETUPFor the receiver:- Place the stomp-box receiver where you want it.- Connect the receiver to your amp or first effects pedal with a standard guitar cable. In my case, the receiver's Output A is connected to the input of my Line 6 POD X3 Live, which (in turn) is connected to my guitar amp.- Plug the power supply into the receiver stompbox (use the little rubber grommet at the plug to help prevent damage to the plug).- Plug the power supply into an AC outlet. If outlet is switched, turn on outlet when ready.- You do NOT need to set channel number. The receiver and transmitter are already ""paired"" (right out of the box). If you want to change the ""System ID"" for the transmitter, or if you wish to ""pair"" additional transmitters to the receiver, instructions to do so are in the user manual.For the transmitter:- Insert two AA batteries.- Attach the provided cable to the transmitter.- Plug the transmitter's cable into your guitar. Hook the transmitter to your belt or clothing, or put it in your pocket.- Turn-on the transmitter by pressing the POWER/MUTE switch for a few seconds.- You do NOT need to set channel number. (See above.)The On/Off and Mute/Un-mute functions of the body-pack transmitter are accomplished with the same switch (POWER/MUTE switch). To minimize user errors, I would prefer two different switches: one for On/Off and the other for Mute/Un-mute. Also, I would like the On/Off function to be a slide switch that locks into position, instead of a switch that must be depressed for several seconds.MISCELLANEOUS:- The transmitter has both a high-impedance input for instruments and a low-impedance input with bias connection for use with dynamic and electret condenser microphones.- The receiver receives its DC power input from the provided AC-to-DC converter that plugs into a wall outlet. There is no On-Off switch on the receiver. As with all electronic equipment, you should probably unplug or switch off the power supply when the system is not in use.- The user manual states: ""For best performance, some routers and Wi-Fi-based wireless systems may need to be up to 30 feet away . . . ."" I have not noticed any interference problems; however, it might be a good practice to routinely verify performance (while moving around) during sound checks at a new location.- So far, I have had no problems with reception; however, if you encounter reception problems, try repositioning the transmitter (on your body) or the receiver so the antennas have a better line-of-sight between each other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HESEPYOWC1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INZY55K#wasThisHelpful","R23HESEPYOWC1Y","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All in all, I am very happy with the performance of this Remington XR1350 shaver. This Remington product line also includes the XR1330 and XR1370 shavers. The XR1350 provides up to 50 minutes of shaving time per charge, while the XR1330 provides 40 minutes and the XR1370 provides 60 minutes. I charge this shaver approximately once per week.As with all electric shavers, the shave is not as close as a razor cut; but that is just the nature of these devices. I have been using Philips Norelco shavers for many years. Even when the shaver is new, or has had new blades installed, the Norelco shavers have performed disappointingly. This Remington shaver performs better than my Norelco shavers. Shaving takes less time and is closer; also, the cutting system is far less irritating to the skin. Shaving is improved by having the shaving heads pivot to allow them to follow the contours of the face. This shaver is also very quiet.The shaver is designed for ""dry"" or ""wet"" shaving. It can be used in the shower (which is why it has a charging stand, instead of a direct AC plug). The shaver's shape and texture make it very easy and secure to hold when wet. It can be used with a shaving gel.The cutters can be removed and rinsed under the faucet for cleaning.This shaver compares favorably to my Panasonic ES-LT71-S Arc3 Men's Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Flexible Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System. The Panasonic provides a closer shave (I give it a five-star rating), but it requires an added monthly expense for the cleaning-system supplies.The shaver charging stand features a ""quick charge"" mode that will give the shaver a partial charge in roughly five minutes, for three minutes of shaving. Hopefully, this would be sufficient to get you shaved and out the door.Check with your state, county, or city to find out if they have any restrictions on the disposal of lithium (LiFePO4) batteries. The ""Use and Care Guide"" provides instructions for removing the battery for disposal, if required.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BDZ4BTFWJ7S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I1MWAU2#wasThisHelpful","R1BDZ4BTFWJ7S9","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This version of Windows 8.1 is for installation on a new computer (with no operating system installed) or on a computer that is NOT currently running Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, or XP. This product is NOT for upgrading; if you are upgrading from a previous version of Windows, then get the upgrade package.This is the ""Full"" version of Windows 8.1: this means you can get technical support from Microsoft; it also means you may have the option (later on) to transfer the license to another computer. If you don't want/need technical support or the potential to transfer the license to a new computer, then look at the ""OEM"" version (Windows 8.1 System Builder OEM DVD 64-Bit). Perform a web search for: Windows 8.1 OEM license. According to Microsoft, if you are building a computer for personal use, then the ""Full packaged retail product is needed.""This is NOT the ""Professional"" version of Windows 8.1. Make sure you are selecting the version you need/want. To learn more, just perform a web search for: Differences between Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Professional. Windows 8.1 Professional also comes in an ""OEM"" version and a ""full"" version: Windows 8.1 Pro System Builder OEM DVD 64-Bit and Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro - Full Version.I just installed Windows 8.1 on a newly-constructed computer. It loaded very quickly (approximately 20 minutes). Loading Window Updates took roughly another 30 minutes. I gave Windows 8.1 a five-star rating because it is much faster and much more stable than the Windows 7 that I use every day on another computer. My Windows 7 machine crashes at least five times per week; in contrast, my Window 8 Professional machine and my Windows 8.1 machine have never crashed, frozen, or reset.I did have one mishap as I loaded software on my new Windows 8.1 machine. As I went to load an old version of Roxio, Windows 8.1 warned me that it was not compatible; but I loaded it anyway. Upon rebooting after that, Windows 8.1 was somehow compromised, and its Auto Repair function initiated a complete wipe and reload of Windows 8.1. Lesson learned: I will not attempt to load old software and hardware on my new Windows 8.1 machine.Windows 8.1 has many powerful features that were completely new to me. The easiest way to learn about these new features is to read a book (just search Amazon books for ""Windows 8.1""). I liked Windows 8.1 Inside Out, but it is more in-depth than most people probably want.THE ""DESKTOP"" IS STILL THERE:A lot of folks I know HATE the new ""Start"" screen (""metro style"") user interface. I spent several weeks learning how to use it; but in the end, I abandoned the Start"" screen in favor of the (old familiar) ""Desktop"" app. So, to all you folks who hate the Start screen: Just use the Desktop instead. You can switch to the Desktop simply by pressing the key combination [WINDOWS key]+D. Or, as I did, you can setup Windows 8.1 to boot to the Desktop instead of the Start screen. Simply (1) go to Desktop; (2) move the cursor to a blank area of the Toolbar at the bottom of the screen; (3) right click and select ""Properties""; (4) select the ""Navigation"" tab; (5) place a tick mark in the box next to ""When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of start.""You can setup up your Windows 8.1 Desktop to be just like your old Windows 7 Desktop, except there won't be a Start button. (Quite frankly, those Microsoft folks made a huge mistake taking away the Start button.) On the Desktop, you can also setup the Tool Bar (Quick Start icons) and System Tray just like you did in previous versions of Windows. In short, you can make your Windows 8.1 look just like Windows 7, but the underlying operating system will be much quicker and a lot more stable.Speaking of the Start button; Windows 8.1 adds a modified Start button of sorts (a Windows-Flag) at the lower left-hand edge of the Desktop toolbar. If you left-click on it, it opens the ""Start"" screen (the same effect as pressing the Windows key on your keyboard); if you right-click on it, it opens the ""Power User"" menu (the same effect as pressing Windows Key plus X simultaneously). Once on the ""Start"" screen, if you click on the little arrow at the bottom left, you will get a listing of your programs/apps.I found it helpful to add the following icons to my Windows 8.1 Desktop: Computer (formerly ""My Computer""), Control Panel, and Network. To do this, right click on any clear area of the desktop and select the Personalize option. In the left pane of the Personalize window, click Change desktop icons. Tick the boxes for the icons you want displayed on the desktop (Computer, Control Panel, Recycle Bin, User's Files, Network). Click the Apply button.I have read that ""Windows 8.1 Update 1"" will boot computers without touchscreens to the desktop by default and will use desktop apps by default. Of course, Microsoft (OBVIOUSLY) should have had this feature in the original Windows 8.That's enough about how to set up the Desktop. Once you get Windows 8.1 working on the Desktop app, take some time to learn how to use the new ""metro-style"" user interface. On my dual monitor system, I have the Desktop on my center monitor and the ""Start"" screen (TileWorld) on the side monitor. You should probably get a book to help you customize the Start screen by learning how to add (pin), delete (unpin), resize, move, and group tiles. I think most non-business users will prefer the new Start screen interface.WINDOWS 8.1 IS EASY - BUT ONLY AFTER AN HOUR OR SO OF TRAINING:Let me just say: Microsoft made a huge mistake by not including a very simple and obvious tick-box to provide users with the option to ""Use Classic Windows."" Now, it only takes about 10 minutes to get Windows 8.1 to look and function just like Windows 7; but that's 9.5 minutes longer than it should take!It takes some effort for the new user to learn how to setup Windows 8.1; but after you get it setup, your Window 8.1 machine will be very easy to use (you won't even think about it). You should probably get a friend, grandchild, or book to help you on your first day. Just about everybody should get some Windows 8.1 training, even if that training is nothing more than watching some youtube videos. Obviously, Microsoft should have produced some videos (maybe eight 5-minute videos) to orient the new user! The user interface is so different most folks will get angry with it if no one has explained it to them first. You see, very little is obvious or intuitive; all of the menus are initially hidden, and there is no clue as to how to display them. But don't get angry! Just spend a short time (less than an hour) learning some basic Windows 8.1 tricks and secrets. When I built my new gaming computer fifteen months ago, I read the book Windows 8 Secrets in its entirety before loading the operating system. It's a good thing I did, otherwise I would have been lost (and, yes, probably angry). Luckily for new users, lots of nice people have posted some great youtube videos that can potentially teach you most of what you need to know. You could also go down to your local computer store and play with Windows 8.1.You can save yourself a lot of (first-day) anger and frustration by immediately configuring Windows 8.1 to use the Desktop user-interface instead of the new Metro-style user-interface (per the instructions above). Do this immediately after your computer boots to Windows 8.1 for the first time. If you do, you'll find yourself in a (relatively stress-free) familiar environment . . . something that looks and behaves just like Windows 7, but without the ""Start"" button. Other than that, printout and use the Windows-Key shortcuts discussed below (especially Winkey+C and Winkey+I).WINDOWS-KEY SHORTCUTS MAKE LIFE EASY:Memorize and use the ""Windows Key"" (Winkey) keyboard shortcuts! (The Winkey is the key on the bottom row with a depiction the Microsoft flag; my Winkey is just to the right of the CTRL key.) For example, if you hold down the Winkey and press C, the ""Charms"" bar will be displayed. The ""Charms"" bar is perhaps the most important interface in Windows 8.1. If you learn the Winkey keyboard shortcuts first thing, you will be able to get most things done in Windows 8.1 right away!Helpful Winkey keyboard shortcuts:Winkey: toggles between Start Menu and last appWinkey + D: opens DesktopWinkey + C: opens ""Charms"" barWinkey + E: opens file explorerWinkey + F or Winkey + W: searches for filesWinkey + I: opens the Settings charm (to shut down your computer, for example)Winkey + Z: opens ""app bar"" (the menu user interface that is normally hidden when interacting with a Windows 8 app)Winkey + X: opens the ""power user"" menu (which includes programs and features, power options, event viewer, system, device manager, network connections, disk management, computer management, command prompt, task manager, control panel, file explorer, search, run, shutdown or signoff, and desktop)Winkey + R: opens run-program window (like when you used to go to Start, Run)LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT WINDOWS ACTIVATION:Windows 8.1 activated over the internet just fine. I had read that Windows 8.1 activation was tied to the specific motherboard; but, apparently, Windows 8.1 loses its activation if you change the memory or hard drive. When I changed out the memory modules (for larger capacity), Windows gave me a message that I would need to re-activate within three days. When I decided that I wanted a larger hard drive in this new machine, I cloned the smaller drive to the larger drive; in the process, Windows activation was lost on the larger drive. Lesson learned: Your life will be easier if you finalize your hardware installation BEFORE you activate Windows 8.1.LOCAL ACCOUNT VERSUS MICROSOFT ACCOUNTYou can setup Windows 8.1 user accounts to be either a ""local account"" or a Microsoft account. Just perform a little web research for: Difference between local account and Microsoft account. There are pros and cons associated with each option.Quite annoyingly, it is NOT obvious how to choose ""local account"" during the installation of Windows 8.1. Understandably, some folks are angry because they feel that Microsoft is FORCING their new Windows 8.1 machine to be linked a Microsoft account. Actually, it is simple (but not at all obvious) to setup Windows 8.1 with a ""local account"" (so the operating system is not linked to Microsoft).During installation of Windows 8.1, when you get to the ""Sign in to your Microsoft account"" screen, don't enter the log-in information (account and password), instead: (1) at the bottom of the screen click ""Create a new account""; (2) on the resulting ""Create a Microsoft Account"" screen, just skip over all of the empty fields and select ""Sign in without a Microsoft Account""; (3) on the resulting ""Your Account"" screen, setup your ""local account"" user name and password.To switch from a Microsoft account to a ""local account"": (1) Get to the ""Start"" screen (toggle Windows key); (2) type ""Users""; (3) select ""Add, delete, or manage other user accounts""; (4) on the resulting ""Accounts"" screen, select ""Your Account""; (5) select the ""Disconnect"" option and then setup your ""local account"" user name and password. To switch from a ""local account"" to a Microsoft account, perform Steps 1 through 4, then at Step 5 select ""Connect to a Microsoft account.""You can also setup Windows 8.1 to use a four-digit PIN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8OAJ1815J3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDSI7QO#wasThisHelpful","RX8OAJ1815J3F","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really appreciate this product. I used it to make a backup drive for my laptop computer. Cloning was surprisingly quick. The newly cloned hard drive booted the computer and everything worked just fine. I next used the product to clone a (jam-packed) desktop drive to a larger hard drive. Again, everything worked great. This product is unbelievably easy to use. A recommendation: Read the product manual before you clone.MICROSOFT DE-ACTIVATION:I discovered that a new hard drive causes Windows 8.1 and Microsoft Office to become deactivated (""activated"" status might be lost on the cloned drive). Your Microsoft products might re-activate over the internet; but you might need to call Microsoft (and convince a real person) to re-activate Windows or Office. This deactivation is NOT a fault in the Apricorn software; it is a function of the Microsoft software detecting that the drive has been changed. By the way, Windows 8.1 also deactivated itself when I added more memory to my computer.YOU MAY NEED TO RE-LOAD DRIVERS:After I installed the cloned drive, the computer's LAN connection did not work until I reloaded the motherboard's LAN driver. You might want to have a flash drive loaded with your computer's drivers (at least the LAN and/or Wi-Fi driver) before you clone.A FEW TIPS AND HINTS:Before you clone, backup your important files to an external hard drive, a flash drive, a network drive, cloud drive, DVDs, etc. (Just in case something goes wrong.)You can download the product manual from the Apricorn website (as a PDF file). It is really worth the time and effort to read through the manual first.On the Apricorn webpage for the kit, you can find some troubleshooting tips (frequently asked questions).You can also download the latest version of the cloning software (EZ GIG IV) as:(1) The Windows-based program to load on your computer, and(2) A disc image (ISO) file that you can burn to CD to produce a bootable disc (""burn to CD,"" not copy to CD).I chose to boot the computer to the Apricorn CD. To do this, you may need to go into your computer's BIOS to set it to boot from CD.The Apricorn software won't work unless it senses the Apricorn ""SATA Wire"" adapter.This product will make an exact (sector-by-sector) copy of your hard drive. Therefore, it would be good if you did two things before you clone:(1) Instruct Windows to perform a ""disk check"" of the hard drive to be cloned(2) Defrag (or ""optimize"") the hard drive to be clonedBefore you start cloning, you need to instruct windows:(1) Never go to sleep (never hibernate)(2) Never turn screen off (turn off screen saver)Don't use the full-auto cloning option unless both the ""Source"" drive and the ""Destination"" drive are exactly the same size. If they are NOT the same size, I would recommend that you enter the manual setup (""Advanced Options"") part of the software to set the desired partition sizes. For example, if you are going to clone to a larger drive, you'll want to enter ""Advanced Options"" to specify the size of each partition. You can also specify files and folders to omit from the cloning.The instructions state that you should connect the new hard drive to the ""SATA Wire"" adapter. Actually, the cloning software will work no matter which drive (old or new) is connected to the ""SATA Wire"" adapter and which is in the computer. You will identify which drive is the ""Source"" (old) drive and which is the ""Destination"" (new) drive in the software.CLONING 3.5-INCH DRIVESThis product is specifically designed to be connected to a 2.5-inch drive; however, it is possible to use it to clone a 3.5-inch drive.You can easily clone a 3.5-inch drive to a 2.5-inch drive (or vice versus) by attaching the 2.5-inch drive to the ""SATA Wire"" socket and having the 3.5-inch drive installed in the computer. In this case, you just instruct the software that the 3.5-inch drive is the source and the 2.5-inch drive is the destination (or vice versus).To clone a 3.5-inch drive to another 3.5 inch drive requires an adapter cable to connect the 3.5-inch drive's data port to the data socket on the Apricorn ""SATA wire"" adapter. Also, you must provide power to the 3.5-inch drive to be cloned (since the 12 VDC it needs cannot be supplied via a USB cable). You can do this in one of two ways: (1) with your computer unplugged, you can connect one of your computer's SATA power supply connectors to the drive; or (2) you can connect a SATA power supply from a kit like the SABRENT USB 3.0 TO SATA/IDE 2.5/3.5/5.25-INCH Hard Drive Converter With Power Supply & LED Activity Lights (USB-DSC8).  I used the NSI LK-13526 7-pin internal SATA Male to SATA Female Extension cable - 7 pin SATA M/F - 20 inch (50 cm) to connect the Apricorn ""SATA wire"" adapter to the 3.5-inch drive's data port. To make this work, I had to snip off the hard plastic locking pieces on either side of the male end of the connector.You can also use the Apricorn ""SATA Wire"" adapter (without the software) to read and write to 2.5 inch (notebook-sized) hard drives via a USB connection. That means, you can use this device to recover data off of an old hard drive. Just connect the drive to the adapter, plug the adapter into a USB port, and use file manager to copy files.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G7C67NNXORM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C983NA#wasThisHelpful","R2G7C67NNXORM5","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently built a new home-office computer with the G2030 Pentium processor and the following:- ASUS P8H77-M/CSM LGA 1155 Intel H77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard- Corsair Obsidian Series 350D Performance Micro ATX Computer Case with Windowed Side Panel CC-9011029-WW - Black- Corsair RM Series 650 Watt ATX/EPS 80PLUS Gold-Certified Power Supply - CP-9020054-NA RM650- Corsair XMS3 4 GB 1333MHz PC3-10666 240-pin DDR3 Memory Kit for  Core i3 i5 i7 and  CMX4GX3M1A1333C9- HGST Travelstar 2.5 Inch 500GB 7200 RPM SATA II 16 MB Cache Internal Hard Drive (0S02858)- LG Electronics DVD- No video card (I am using the on-board video)As you can probably tell from this list, I was trying to build a very ""cheap"" computer. The total cost, not including the operating system, was 500 dollars. If I had used an i5 processor, it would have raised the price of this build by approximately 130 dollars. Obviously then, you can save a lot of money by purchasing the least expensive processor that will still get the job done.This new computer is replacing a nine-year-old office computer. It will not be used for games; instead it will be used for professional and academic software such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Project, Photoshop, drawing programs, math and statistics programs, system models, and proprietary science and engineering programs. For these applications, this Pentium processor works fine. For a gaming computer, I would recommend an Intel i5 processor instead of this Pentium. For video editing or animation you might be better off with an i7 processor.Since this computer will not be used for games, I did not install a video card; instead I am taking advantage of the integrated video processor in this Pentium. The on-board video is fine.CPU Cooling:To save money, I used Intel's ""stock"" cooler assembly that was included with the Pentium processor. My other home-built machines use Corsair H100 CPU coolers (forced liquid flow coolers). Based on temperature readings, Intel's ""stock"" cooler seems to work just fine (100 dollars saved!).This was the first time I ever installed the ""stock"" cooler. I am very glad that I watched some youtube videos before I tried it myself; it can be just a little bit tricky if you've never done it before.You might want to consider getting a tube of ""thermal compound"" (Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound 3.5 Grams) just in case you don't succeed on your first attempt to install the cooler. The cooler comes with thermal compound already applied; but if the installation goes wrong, you'll need to remove the compound and reapply a small amount of fresh compound. The thermal compound improves heat transfer at the point where the CPU contacts the bottom cooler plate. Luckily I got the cooler installed okay on the first attempt; but I had a tube of thermal compound just in case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VPYQER4WIXIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5ZZZ70#wasThisHelpful","R1VPYQER4WIXIB","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""System Builder"" version of Windows 8.1 is for installation on a new computer (with no operating system installed) or on a computer that is NOT currently running Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, or XP. This product (""System Builder"") is NOT for upgrading; if you are upgrading from a previous version of Windows, then get the upgrade package.This is the ""OEM"" version of Windows 8.1. Perform a web search for: Windows 8.1 OEM license. According to Microsoft, if you are building a computer for personal use, then the ""Full packaged retail product is needed."" With the OEM version, you cannot get technical support from Microsoft; also, you can activate it on one and only one computer (the license is linked to the hardware). If you want technical support and/or the potential to transfer the license to a new computer, then look at the ""full"" version (Microsoft Windows 8.1 - Full Version).This is NOT the ""Professional"" version of Windows 8.1. Make sure you are selecting the version you need/want. To learn more, just perform a web search for: Differences between Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Professional. Windows 8.1 Professional also comes in an ""OEM"" version and a ""full"" version: Windows 8.1 Pro System Builder OEM DVD 64-Bit and Microsoft Windows 8.1 Pro - Full Version.I just installed Windows 8.1 System Builder on a newly-constructed computer. It loaded very quickly (approximately 20 minutes). Loading Window Updates took roughly another 30 minutes. I gave Windows 8.1 a five-star rating because it is much faster and much more stable than the Windows 7 that I use every day on another computer. My Windows 7 machine crashes at least five times per week; in contrast, my Window 8.1 Professional machine and my Windows 8.1 machine have never crashed, frozen, or reset.I did have one mishap as I loaded software on my new Windows 8.1 machine. As I went to load an old version of Roxio, Windows 8.1 warned me that it was not compatible; but I loaded it anyway. Upon rebooting after that, Windows 8.1 was somehow compromised, and its Auto Repair function initiated a complete wipe and reload of Windows 8.1. Lesson learned: I will not attempt to load old software and hardware on my new Windows 8.1 machine.Windows 8.1 has many powerful features that were completely new to me. The easiest way to learn about these new features is to read a book (just search Amazon books for ""Windows 8.1""). I liked Windows 8.1 Inside Out, but it is more in-depth than most people probably want.THE ""DESKTOP"" IS STILL THERE:A lot of folks I know HATE the new ""Start"" screen (""metro style"") user interface. I spent several weeks learning how to use it; but in the end, I abandoned the Start"" screen in favor of the (old familiar) ""Desktop"" app. So, to all you folks who hate the Start screen: Just use the Desktop instead. You can switch to the Desktop simply by pressing the key combination [WINDOWS key]+D. Or, as I did, you can setup Windows 8.1 to boot to the Desktop instead of the Start screen. Simply (1) go to Desktop; (2) move the cursor to a blank area of the Toolbar at the bottom of the screen; (3) right click and select ""Properties""; (4) select the ""Navigation"" tab; (5) place a tick mark in the box next to ""When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of start.""You can setup up your Windows 8.1 Desktop to be just like your old Windows 7 Desktop, except there won't be a Start button. (Quite frankly, those Microsoft folks made a huge mistake taking away the Start button.) On the Desktop, you can also setup the Tool Bar (Quick Start icons) and System Tray just like you did in previous versions of Windows. In short, you can make your Windows 8.1 look just like Windows 7, but the underlying operating system will be much quicker and a lot more stable.Speaking of the Start button; Windows 8.1 adds a modified Start button of sorts (a Windows-Flag) at the lower left-hand edge of the Desktop toolbar. If you left-click on it, it opens the ""Start"" screen (the same effect as pressing the Windows key on your keyboard); if you right-click on it, it opens the ""Power User"" menu (the same effect as pressing Windows Key plus X simultaneously). Once on the ""Start"" screen, if you click on the little arrow at the bottom left, you will get a listing of your programs/apps (essentially providing the functions of the old Start Button, and more).I found it helpful to add the following icons to my Windows 8.1 Desktop: Computer (formerly ""My Computer""), Control Panel, and Network. To do this, right click on any clear area of the desktop and select the Personalize option. In the left pane of the Personalize window, click Change desktop icons. Tick the boxes for the icons you want displayed on the desktop (Computer, Control Panel, Recycle Bin, User's Files, Network). Click the Apply button.I have read that ""Windows 8.1 Update 1"" will boot computers without touchscreens to the desktop by default and will use desktop apps by default. Of course, Microsoft (OBVIOUSLY) should have had this feature in the original Windows 8.That's enough about how to set up the Desktop. Once you get Windows 8.1 working on the Desktop app, take some time to learn how to use the new ""metro-style"" user interface. On my dual monitor system, I have the Desktop on my center monitor and the ""Start"" screen (TileWorld) on the side monitor. You should probably get a book to help you customize the Start screen by learning how to add (pin), delete (unpin), resize, move, and group tiles. I think most non-business users will prefer the new Start screen interface.WINDOWS 8.1 IS EASY - BUT ONLY AFTER AN HOUR OR SO OF TRAINING:Let me just say: Microsoft made a huge mistake by not including a very simple and obvious tick-box to provide users with the option to ""Use Classic Windows."" Now, it only takes about 10 minutes to get Windows 8.1 to look and function just like Windows 7; but that's 9.5 minutes longer than it should take! Also, Microsoft should have provided a simple and obvious tick-box to allow users (especially business users) to completely disable the new Metro (Modern) interface.It takes some effort for the new user to learn how to setup Windows 8.1; but after you get it setup, your Window 8.1 machine will be very easy to use (you won't even think about it). You should probably get a friend, grandchild, or book to help you on your first day. Just about everybody should get some Windows 8.1 training, even if that training is nothing more than watching some youtube videos. Obviously, Microsoft should have produced some videos (maybe eight 5-minute videos) to orient the new user! The user interface is so different most folks will get angry with it if no one has explained it to them first. You see, very little is obvious or intuitive; all of the menus are initially hidden, and there is no clue as to how to display them. But don't get angry! Just spend a short time (less than an hour) learning some basic Windows 8.1 tricks and secrets. When I built my new gaming computer fifteen months ago, I read the book Windows 8 Secrets in its entirety before loading the operating system. It's a good thing I did, otherwise I would have been lost (and, yes, probably angry). Luckily for new users, lots of nice people have posted some great youtube videos that can potentially teach you most of what you need to know. You could also go down to your local computer store and play with Windows 8.1.You can save yourself a lot of (first-day) anger and frustration by immediately configuring Windows 8.1 to use the Desktop user-interface instead of the new Metro-style user-interface (per the instructions above). Do this immediately after your computer boots to Windows 8.1 for the first time. If you do, you'll find yourself in a (relatively stress-free) familiar environment . . . something that looks and behaves just like Windows 7, but without the ""Start"" button. Other than that, printout and use the Windows-Key shortcuts discussed below (especially Winkey+C and Winkey+I).WINDOWS-KEY SHORTCUTS MAKE LIFE EASY:Memorize and use the ""Windows Key"" (Winkey) keyboard shortcuts! (The Winkey is the key on the bottom row with a depiction the Microsoft flag; my Winkey is just to the right of the CTRL key.) For example, if you hold down the Winkey and press C, the ""Charms"" bar will be displayed. The ""Charms"" bar is perhaps the most important interface in Windows 8.1. If you learn the Winkey keyboard shortcuts first thing, you will be able to get most things done in Windows 8.1 right away!Helpful Winkey keyboard shortcuts:Winkey: toggles between Start Menu and last appWinkey + D: opens DesktopWinkey + C: opens ""Charms"" barWinkey + E: opens file explorerWinkey + F or Winkey + W: searches for filesWinkey + I: opens the Settings charm (to shut down your computer, for example)Winkey + Z: opens ""app bar"" (the menu user interface that is normally hidden when interacting with a Windows 8 app)Winkey + X: opens the ""power user"" menu (which includes programs and features, power options, event viewer, system, device manager, network connections, disk management, computer management, command prompt, task manager, control panel, file explorer, search, run, shutdown or signoff, and desktop)Winkey + R: opens run-program window (like when you used to go to Start, Run)LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT WINDOWS ACTIVATION:Windows 8.1 activated over the internet just fine. I had read that Windows 8.1 activation was tied to the specific motherboard; but, apparently, Windows 8.1 loses its activation if you change the memory or hard drive. When I changed out the memory modules (for larger capacity), Windows gave me a message that I would need to re-activate within three days. When I decided that I wanted a larger hard drive in this new machine, I cloned the smaller drive to the larger drive; in the process, Windows activation was lost on the larger drive. Lesson learned: Your life will be easier if you finalize your hardware installation BEFORE you activate Windows 8.1.LOCAL ACCOUNT VERSUS MICROSOFT ACCOUNTYou can setup Windows 8.1 user accounts to be either a ""local account"" or a Microsoft account. Just perform a little web research for: Difference between local account and Microsoft account. There are pros and cons associated with each option.Quite annoyingly, it is NOT obvious how to choose ""local account"" during the installation of Windows 8.1. Understandably, some folks are angry because they feel that Microsoft is FORCING their new Windows 8.1 machine to be linked a Microsoft account. Actually, it is simple (but not at all obvious) to setup Windows 8.1 with a ""local account"" (so the operating system is not linked to Microsoft).During installation of Windows 8.1, when you get to the ""Sign in to your Microsoft account"" screen, don't enter the log-in information (account and password), instead: (1) at the bottom of the screen click ""Create a new account""; (2) on the resulting ""Create a Microsoft Account"" screen, just skip over all of the empty fields and select ""Sign in without a Microsoft Account""; (3) on the resulting ""Your Account"" screen, setup your ""local account"" user name and password.To switch from a Microsoft account to a ""local account"": (1) Get to the ""Start"" screen (toggle Windows key); (2) type ""Users""; (3) select ""Add, delete, or manage other user accounts""; (4) on the resulting ""Accounts"" screen, select ""Your Account""; (5) select the ""Disconnect"" option and then setup your ""local account"" user name and password. To switch from a ""local account"" to a Microsoft account, perform Steps 1 through 4, then at Step 5 select ""Connect to a Microsoft account.""You can also setup Windows 8.1 to use a four-digit PIN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYMCDVMGTWO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F3ZN2W0#wasThisHelpful","R1KYMCDVMGTWO0","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a review of the NOCO Genius G750 6V/12V 0.75 Amp Smart Battery Charger and Maintainer.I have many 12 volt batteries in the 20 amp-hour (Ah) range that require periodic charging so they will always be ready when needed. Having recently had good experiences using the NOCO GENM1 battery charger, I was curious to try NOCO's lighter-duty chargers/maintainers. For the past few years, I have been using Battery Tender products (which are also five-star products).I am completely satisfied with the performance of the NOCO G750. It is certainly the equal of my Battery Tender 021-0123 Battery Tender Junior 12V Battery Charger.You should definitely read the User Manual before using this charger. The User's Manual that comes with this product has very, very tiny print; luckily an easier-to-read User's Manual can easily be found online (in PDF format).If you are looking for a higher-capacity charger, check out NOCO Genius G1100 6V/12V 1.1 Amp Smart Battery Charger and Maintainer. Between the NOCO G750, the NOCO G1100, and the Battery Tender Junior, I would recommend the NOCO G1100 due to (1) its higher charging current (quicker charge); (2) better indications; and (3) additional charging options (e.g., the G1100 has a specific charging mode for AGM batteries). However, the G750 would be perfect for smaller lead-acid batteries (like a lawnmower battery, for example). I use the NOCO Genius G3500 6V/12V 3.5 Amp Smart Battery Charger and Maintainer for the battery in my car.For a 4-amp, waterproof charger check out:- NOCO GENM1 GEN Mini 4 Amp 1-Bank Waterproof Smart On-Board Battery ChargerThe G750 is suitable for all types of 6 volt or 12 volt lead-acid batteries, including wet (flooded), gel, MF (maintenance-free) and AGM (absorption glass mat) batteries.The NOCO Genius G750 is a 0.75-amp ""smart"" charger. However, it is not fully automated; you have to initially use the MODE button to select one of two ""Charge Modes"" (6 V or 12 V). So far, I have only used the ""12 V"" mode.The NOCO G750 charger/maintainer comes with two sets of quick disconnect cables that allow connection of the charger via: (1) wires with ring terminals or (2) wires terminated with battery clamp connectors (see the product photos). You can purchase additional quick-disconnect connectors (NOCO Genius GC002 Eyelet Terminal Connector). This makes charging multiple batteries with a single charger easy; you simply leave a quick-disconnect eye-terminal connector attached to each battery, then move the charger from battery to battery. The positive charging wire has an inline fuse (10 amp automotive blade fuse) close to the battery-side termination. Also check out NOCO Genius GC003 12V Plug Connector.The G750 can charge battery sizes from 1.2 to 30 amp-hours. In contrast, the G1100 is rated for battery sizes from 2.2 to 40 amp-hours, while the GENM1 charger is rated for battery sizes from 20 to 120 amp-hours. The NOCO G750 takes roughly twice as long to charge a battery as the NOCO G1100, and roughly nine times as long as the NOCO GENM1. The NOCO G750 would be perfect for those smaller (1.2 to 10 amp-hour), non-AGM batteries; personally, I would select the G1100 to charge batteries greater than 10 amp-hours.A charging times comparison is provided below:-  30 Ah battery: 33 hours with G750; 18 hours with G1100; 3.7 hours with GENM1The G750 can charge batteries larger than 30 amp-hours, it will just take longer. The charger will go into an ERROR condition if it is in ""Bulk"" charging mode for greater than 120 hours.The G1100 converts an input of 85 to 130 volts AC (alternating current) to a DC (direct current) output suitable for charging a 12 volt lead-acid battery. The charger controls DC output during a seven-step charging cycle, with a peak voltage of 14.4 volts DC in ""12 V"" mode (or 7.2 volts for the ""6 V"" mode).The G1100 weighs only 0.5 pounds. Its dimensions are 4.5 x 2.7 x 1.3 inches. Unlike the NOCO G1100 and GENM1, the G750 has no AC power cord (i.e., the AC plug is an integral part of the charger's body). You can use an extension cord with this charger; there is a table in the User Manual to determine the minimum AWG size of the extension cable.  NOCO includes the exact same table in the User Manuals of several different charger models; instead, the User Manual for each charger should explicitly state the requirement for that specific charger.The charging process (from the NOCO user's manual):- The battery charger will begin in the STANDBY mode, indicated by a GREEN LED. In the STANDBY mode, the battery charger has no current output.- The user starts the charging process by pressing the MODE button to toggle to the appropriate charge mode (6 V or 12 V). Upon selecting the charging mode (6 V or 12 V), a RED LED will light the selected charge mode and the CHARGE LED (Red) will light indicating the charging process has started.- When the battery is fully charged, the CHARGE LED will change from RED to GREEN, indicating the charge process is complete.- The battery charger can be left connected to the battery at all times to provide maintenance charging. However, it is good practice to check the battery periodically.The five-step charging cycle (from the NOCO user's manual):Step 1 (Diagnostics): Checks the battery voltage to make sure battery connections are good and the battery is in a stable condition before beginning the charging process.Step 2 (Soft Start): Begins Bulk charging process with a gentle (soft) charge.Step 3 (Bulk): Continues Bulk charging process to 90% of battery capacity.Step 4 (Absorption): Brings the charge level to 100%. The battery charger will deliver small amounts of current to provide a safe, efficient charge and limit battery gassing.Step 5 (Maintenance): Continuously monitors the battery voltage to determine if a maintenance charge should be initiated. If the terminal voltage falls below 12.8 volts (or 6.4 volts for a 6 volt battery), the charger will start the Maintenance cycle until voltage reaches 14.4 volts (or 7.2 volts for a 6 volt battery) and then discontinues the charge cycle. Maintenance cycle is repeated indefinitely to keep the battery at full charge, without overcharging. The battery charger can be left connected indefinitely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IRQ6X4M449TF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LX3AS6#wasThisHelpful","R1IRQ6X4M449TF","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a wide selection of batteries and associated battery chargers. For small chargers, I have been using the ""Battery Tender"" line of products (I particularly appreciate the quick disconnects that are available for the Battery Tender chargers). I wanted to try this NOCO GENM1 4-amp charger because: (1) it is specifically designed to be mounted, and (2) it is supposed to be waterproof (not just water resistant) and spark-proof.If you want a charger with battery terminal clips, this is NOT the charger for you. This charger is specifically designed for spark-free operation; therefore, there is no ability to connect and disconnect energized leads (which could cause a spark). If you want terminal clips, check out these other NOCO chargers:- NOCO Genius G750 6V/12V 750mA Amp Smart Battery Charger and Maintainer- NOCO Genius G1100 6V/12V 1.1 Amp Smart Battery Charger and Maintainer- NOCO Genius G3500 6V/12V 3.5 Amp Smart Battery Charger and Maintainer- NOCO Genius G7200 12V/24V 7.2 Amp Smart Battery Charger and MaintainerIt really helps to read the instructions and safety precautions for this charger. The supplied user manual is difficult to read due to very tiny print. The product manuals for most NOCO products are pretty easy to find online in PDF format. For the GENM1, perform a web search for NOCO Gen Mini User Guide (it helps to limit the search to the geniuschargers website).The NOCO GENM1 is a 4-amp ""smart"" charger (i.e., it is fully automated). Therefore, you can leave this charger continuously plugged-in without any worry of overcharging your battery. For example, you can leave your boat or RV unattended for weeks or months with the charger in continuous operation. Up until now, I have been manually charging low-use batteries every one or two months; this fully automatic charger is much more convenient.NOCO states that the GENM1 is suitable for all types of 12 volt lead-acid batteries, including wet (flooded), gel, MF (maintenance-free) and AGM (absorption glass mat) batteries.The NOCO model GENM1 is for one battery bank, while the model GENM2 is for two battery banks (i.e., the GENM2 model has two sets of charging leads). The GENM1 and GENM2 are rated at 4 amps (charging current) per bank. If you have a boat with a 12 VDC starting battery and a 12 VDC trolling motor battery, you might wish to consider the NOCO GENM2 or the NOCO GEN2.The NOCO GENM1 charger is the ""mini"" version of the NOCO GEN1 charger (the word ""mini"" is even printed on the charger face). If you want a charging current greater than 4 amps per bank, check out NOCO's line of 10-amp chargers:- NOCO Genius GEN1 12V 1-Bank 10 Amp Smart On-Board Waterproof Battery Charger- NOCO Genius GEN2 12V+12V 2-Bank 20 Amp Smart On-Board Waterproof Battery Charger- NOCO Genius GEN3 12V+12V+12V 3-Bank 30 Amp Smart On-Board Waterproof Battery Charger- NOCO Genius GEN4 12V+12V+12V+12V 4-Bank 40 Amp Smart On-Board Waterproof Battery ChargerAs alternatives, check out:- Battery Tender 022-0157-1 Waterproof 12 Volt Power Tender Plus Battery Charger.- MinnKota MK 210D On-Board Battery Charger (2 Banks, 5 amps per bank)The GENM1 charger can be used on battery sizes from 20 to 120 amp-hours. In contrast, the NOCO Genius GEN1 12V 1-Bank 10 Amp Smart On-Board Waterproof Battery Charger is rated for battery sizes from 25 to 230 amp-hours. The GENM1 takes approximately twice as long to charge a battery as the GEN1. For my applications (maintaining low-use batteries), this is not a concern.A charging times comparison is provided below:-  30 Ah battery: 3.7 hours with GENM1; 1.9 hours with GEN1-  50 Ah battery: 6.2 hours with GENM1; 3.1 hours with GEN1- 100 Ah battery: 12.5 hours with GENM1; 6.3 hours with GEN1- 120 Ah battery: 15.0 hours with GENM1; 7.5 hours with GEN1The GENM1 can charge batteries larger than 120 amp-hours, it will just take longer. The charger will go into an ERROR condition if it is in ""Bulk"" charging mode for greater than 80 hours.The GENM1 converts an input of 70 to 130 volts AC (alternating current) to a DC (direct current) output suitable for charging a 12 volt lead-acid battery. The charger automatically controls DC output during an eight-step charging cycle, with a peak voltage of 14.4 volts DC. You should probably verify that this is an appropriate charging voltage for your specific battery. For example, some gel batteries have a recommended charging voltage of 14.4 VDC, while others recommend 14.1 VDC. Similarly, some batteries might recommend 14.7 VDC.The GENM1 is designed for permanent installation (e.g., in a boat, RV, or truck). It is very easy to install, although I can imagine installations that could be challenging due to difficulty in routing wires, locating a mounting position, or in having insufficient wire length. It meets ISO 8846 Marine standards and is ignition protected (US Coast Guard 33 CFR 183.410).The GENM1 does NOT come with quick disconnects. I suspect NOCO wanted an unbroken connection between the GENM1 charger and the battery terminations to reduce the possibility of sparking (which would be really, really, really bad around engine fuel or hydrogen in a boat). For models with quick disconnects, check out the previously mentioned G750, G1100, G3500, or G7200 NOCO chargers.The GENM1 comes with four 1-inch Philips-head screws to mount the unit. It might be advisable to use stainless steel screws (or bolts) for mounting, with silicone sealer to waterproof the screw holes. The charger weighs 3.3 pounds, so make sure to connect it to a sturdy surface. Its dimensions are 6.6 x 2.2 x 3.8 inches. The AC cord is 6 feet in length. The two DC output leads that connect to the battery are 6.3 feet long (NOCO recommends allowing 1 foot of ""slack"" in the charging wires). For a simple ""shore power"" connection, check out NOCO Genius GCP1 Black 13 Amp 125V AC Port Plug.The charging wires come with eye terminals for connecting to the battery: the eye terminals have an inside diameter of 1 centimeter (a little more than 3/8 inch). If need be, you can find battery terminal adapters such as Shoreline Marine Battery Marine Terminal Kit (Red/Black). The positive charging wire has an inline fuse (15 amp automotive blade fuse) close to the eye terminal (i.e., close to the battery-side of the connection, where it is supposed to be).The GENM1 charger has only two indications: (1) a CHARGE LED (which can light either green or red), and (2) an ERROR LED (which lights orange).- When the battery is charging, the CHARGE LED will light red. This LED will remain a solid red color (not blinking) until the battery is fully charged.- When the battery is fully charged, the CHARGE LED will light green. This LED will remain solid green (not blinking) until either the battery charger is disconnected or the battery becomes discharged.- If a reverse polarity condition exists, the orange ERROR LED will light.- If an ""Error"" condition exists, both LEDs will flash. There are several reasons an ""Error"" condition could exist; for help troubleshooting ""Error"" conditions, see the TROBLESHOOTING section of the user manual.When you connect this charger to a battery, the AC power connection is unplugged (as a very important electrical safety precaution). Therefore, the charger has been designed to light the ERROR LED for a reverse-polarity condition even when the unit is connected to a battery with the AC power disconnected.So far I have used this charger to charge three lead-acid batteries of various sizes with no problems. I really appreciate the fact that this charger is fully automatic. The charger has now been permanently installed. I have not yet had the chance to see how this charger operates unattended for months and months.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP74YKWMV3BW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CBTRN26#wasThisHelpful","RP74YKWMV3BW4","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of ""Be Dangerous On Rock Guitar"" by Richard Daniels.I purchased this great guitar course in the late 1980s directly from The Heavy Guitar Company (they now have a website). At the time, I also ordered the associated (six) cassette tapes, the ""Be Dangerous Wall Poster,"" and the ""helpful fretboard dots."" The large wall poster illustrated the guitar fretboard, showing the pentatonic scale patterns and associated ""blue"" notes (I had the poster mounted on hard board at a framing shop). The fretboard dots (an inspired idea) could be applied to the fretboard at the locations of the scale pattern notes to help the aspiring rocker learn the pentatonic and blue scales. To be clear: The cassette tapes, the poster, and the fretboard dots are NOT included with this books; they had to be ordered separately (I don't know if you can still get them, or not).This course came out in 1984 (I think). At the time, it was one of the few courses available on rock guitar. I certainly learned quite a lot from this course (back in the day). Richard Daniels did an excellent job explaining, organizing, and illustrating concepts from music theory directly applicable to rock guitar. I am extremely impressed with this book: I'm doubly impressed that it was written and illustrated by just one guy. His explanations of scales and intervals are the most accurate I have read in any consumer music book. Richard Daniels, you did a great job!This was a great course back in the 1980s. These days, some thirty years later, there's a lot more at-home training available for guitarists, including books, DVD courses, and internet videos. Even with all of these new and wonderful training materials, Richard Daniels' book still does a better job teaching some subject matter. Therefore, even if you are a veteran rocker, you might learn some new and interesting guitar concepts by reading this book. If you are a beginner looking for just one at-home guitar instruction program, I recommend John McCarthy, Learn Rock Guitar Mega Pack. For a book on basic music theory, I recommend The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory, 2nd Edition. However, no matter what other method you chose to initially learn rock guitar (including a guitar teacher), you should eventually add ""Be Dangerous On Rock Guitar"" to your music library to bump your knowledge and skills up a notch.This product does not include the original cassette audio tapes. If you are interested in acquiring these tapes, maybe you can get them from The Heavy Guitar Company (I don't know). Quite frankly, I had some issues with the cassette tapes. Richard Daniels chose to make the tapes with very wild sound effects: I suppose he thought guitarists would find it amusing and interesting. I found such effects to be distracting: I would like to see new audio tapes produced in MP3 format in a more straight-forward (less weird) manner. I converted the tapes to MP3 files which I play through the guitar amp with an iPod.Here are some of the topics touched upon in this book:- The characteristics of sound (frequency; wavelength; frequencies of the six open strings; intensity; the envelope curve; protamento; vibrato; timbre).- Theory of the major scale (the tonic, octaves; the monochord; the dominant; harmonics; the mediant; just intonation; equal temperament; tuning the guitar so it can play all keys).- The great staff, intervals, consonance and dissonance, triads, other combinations (major, minor, dominant 7th, major 7th, minor 7th, augmented, diminished, major 6th, minor 6th, 9th, 11th, major add 9, minor 9th, major 6/9th), inversion, range, time, form, definitions.- Chromatic scale, fingering principles.- Scales (E major scale, A major scale).- Chords (theory of chord construction; major triads; CAGED movable chord forms; complex chords; chord charts).- Rock structure and the chords of rock (4/4 beat; how to very easily determine the guitar chords to use in any key using the fretboard; the turnaround).- The blues scale (universal blues fingering patterns).- Octaves on the guitar.- String techniques (bending, pulling, hammering, slide, vibrato).- The relative scale (the relative scale sound; three part circle - major, blues, relative).- Enhancing blues scale with filler notes.- Primary lead guitar patterns in E and A.- Lead runs.- Rock's two primary chords - E and A.- Notes in and around the open D, G, and C chords.- Position and use of sixth and seventh.- Inversions of the suspended fourth chord.- Inversions of the augmented ninth chord.- Position, cause and effect of power chords.- Position and use of harmonic overtones.- Fretboard positions used in rock.- Guitar tricks (the tip off; hammer on; wild bends; right hand on board; open string harmonics; artificial harmonics; hammer on fret harmonics; running harmonics; bent or slide harmonics; tri-pack technique; string rake; against the stand; rapid picking; hit back; the power slide; creative wa bar technique; chuga; pinky pull offs).- Deciphering recordings.- 40 great rock passages.I would love to see Richard Daniels (perhaps in partnership with ""Rock House"") produce a set of modern instructional DVDs to go along with this book.Thanks to Richard Daniels for this book! I learned more about rock guitar from this book than from any other source. My copy has been used so much it is falling apart; I suppose it is time to buy a new one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUXEGMCCATA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0895243148#wasThisHelpful","RSUXEGMCCATA8","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of ""Learn & Master Fingerstyle Guitar"" with Steve Krenz.This DVD-based training program is produced by the same folks (Legacy Learning) who publish the popular ""Learn & Master Guitar"" course. Both courses feature Steve Krenz. He is a very effective guitar teacher; he obviously has many years of experience teaching students of all ages, interests, and abilities. See the Legacy Learn & Master Guitar website for more details about their various courses.With guitar lessons from a guitar teacher costing between 40 and 120 dollars per hour, this course is quite a bargain. Many years ago, I once spent a year with a guitar teacher going through Mel Bay Guitar Melody Chord Playing System. That year of instruction cost 1,500 dollars (not adjusting for inflation). While I felt the cost was worth it, I am very happy that much cheaper DVD courses are now available as an alternative.""Fingerstyle"" is a technique of playing the guitar by plucking the strings directly with the fingertips, fingernails, or picks attached to the fingers, as opposed to ""flatpicking"" which involves plucking the guitar strings with a single pick. When playing ""fingerstyle,"" the thumb typically maintains a rhythm (usually playing alternating bass notes on the lower three strings) while the remaining fingers pick out the remaining chord notes (or a melody) on the higher strings.""Learn & Master Fingerstyle Guitar"" with Steve Krenz would probably be best for someone who is new to ""fingerstyle"" guitar. Even if you are not a beginner, you might benefit from this course; completing the lessons (including the ""advanced workshops"") could potentially fill in gaps in your prior education and experience. Also, if you are a guitar teacher, going through this course might give you ideas that could improve your instruction of this material. Actually, I am a little disappointed that they did not add three more lessons (DVDs) to this course to raise the level of instruction (and playing) just a little.This is a thoroughly professional product: the training is well designed, the video and audio are outstanding. You don't need to know how to read sheet music to use this course.This course is not for the absolute beginning guitarist; I suggest that you first finish any one of the following before starting this course:(1) Six to twelve months of lessons with a guitar teacher(2) At least lessons 1 through 10 of Gibson's Learn & Master Guitar(3) Fender Presents Getting Started on Electric Guitar - DVD or Fender Presents Getting Started on Acoustic Guitar - DVD(4) The Rock House Method: Learn Rock Guitar - Beginner ProgramThis course will work best if you can already play open chords and barre chords, with no hesitation between chord changes. Having said that, lots of folks have learned chords and fingerstyle simultaneously: it's challenging, maybe even aggravating, but it can be done.The ""Fingerstyle Guitar"" course includes the following:- 9 instructional DVDs- 1 CD with a PDF file of the course booklet and MP3 files of the ""jam-along"" tracks- Fingerstyle arrangements of over 20 songs- Beginner and advanced workshops for each session- ""Lessons with the Masters"" featuring Phil Keaggy, Thom Bresh, and Pierre BensusanThe course does not come with a pre-printed course booklet. Instead, the 137 page course book is included as a PDF file on the included CD. You can either print out the whole booklet at once, or you can just print out the page(s) you are working on. The course also comes with ""jam-along"" tracks as MP3 files on the included CD. ""Jam-along"" tracks allow you to play the guitar parts over pre-recorded bass and drum tracks. I play such tracks through my guitar amp via an iPod. (I used an acoustic-electric guitar while going through this course.)Here is an overview of the content:Lesson 1: Fingerstyle technique; fingerstyle technique exercises; nails; fingerstyle guitar tips; fingerstyle resources - guitars.Lesson 2: Adding notes; alternating bass notes; syncopation; metronomes.Lesson 3: Intervals (3rds, 6ths, 10ths); working with intervals; strings.Lesson 4: Arranging for fingerstyle; finding melody notes; ""Danny Boy""; finding your own melody; footstools.Lesson 5: Classical technique; Giuliani studies; hybrid classical picking; study in A minor; ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring""; nylon strings.Lesson 6: Slides; hammer-ons; pull-offs; creating open position runs; hammer on tricks; harmonics.Lesson 7: Jazz chord families; adding color tones; adding a bass line; repeating diminished chords; fingerstyle resources - The Real Book.Lesson 8: Pop fingerstyle; Merle Travis technique; advanced fingerstyle technique; pull-offs to open strings; capos.Lesson 9: Lessons with the Masters - Phil Keaggy, Thom Bresh, Pierre Bensusan.Lessons 1 through 8 are all followed by a ""Beginning Workshop"" and an ""Advanced Workshop,"" which also include many song arrangements. The lessons are roughly 40 to 45 minutes in duration. Each workshop is roughly 30 minutes long. As with all DVD courses like this, it is great to be able to replay portions of the lessons and workshops as many times as necessary to master the material.In summary, this is another excellent at-home guitar training program from Steve Krenz. It is ideal for the beginning guitarist who has at least learned basic chords. Intermediate and advanced players may also benefit from the course; but there may be some who feel that the course is too basic for them (i.e., they might end up disappointed that they spent their money on the course). I am glad I went through this course: it helped me to correct some bad habits, it taught me new theory and techniques, and it is helping me to regain some long-neglected skills. The ""workshop"" exercises from this course will now become part of my daily guitar workout.Please note, there are some pretty great fingerstyle videos on a popular video website.For intermediate players who want to learn from a master, check out DVD-Jorma Kaukonen's Fingerpicking Guitar Method. For you young folks out there (who don't know what you missed), Jorma Kaukonen was the lead guitarist for the Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna. While he is known to many as a rock guitarist, Jorma loves fingerpicking, and he is a great instructor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35N4VS9YURYAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1450788947#wasThisHelpful","R35N4VS9YURYAO","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets"" is an excellent professional reference and textbook. It is intended for professional dietitians and other health care professionals (such as nutritionists, doctors, nurses, public health professionals, policy makers, educators, etc.). The book clearly assumes the reader has previously completed an ""Introduction to Nutrition"" course. This book is suitable for use as a university textbook for students who have previously completed their first nutrition course. Also, anyone who has completed a course in biochemistry will be able to readily follow this book.This is the third edition of this book. It has been fourteen years since the first edition was published; this edition brings the book up to date with current research and, I presume, it incorporates comments from many years of use by professionals.The book seems to cover every possible facet of the subject matter. I can only assume that it was developed from a very meticulous analysis of the dietitian's job. The text provides comprehensive coverage of each topic, supplemented by extensive lists of references to aid those who want to read additional academic papers. With the many cited references, the book provides a great review of literature on the subject.As with many textbooks, the content is dense (in a good way: thorough, complete, and concise) and also a bit ""dry."" You should give yourself several months to go through this book; it is not intended for a casual weekend read.I think it would be best to go through this book as part of a university course. If your university does not offer a course on vegetarian diets, perhaps your university will give you credit for studying this book under faculty supervision (as an ""honor's research project,"" for example). I would guess that this book is suitable for a three semester hour university course.Chapters:-- Book Intro: An Overview of Vegetarian Diet (pages 1 to 2)1.

"This is an excellent light bulb: bright white light with very low power consumption.While it's a great bulb, the product page mistakenly identifies this product as an R30 bulb; actually, it is a BR 30L bulb (L stands for ""long neck""). A BR30 bulb can be used in place of an R30 bulb; however, this ""long neck"" bulb may stick too far out of your specific light fixture. For example, I bought this light to use in a recessed ceiling light: unfortunately, the bulb sticks out too far. I am very unhappy with Amazon for not identifying that this is a BR 30L bulb. I submitted a correction to Amazon, but they declined to accept it. I have posted a ""customer image"" of the product box; the fact that the bulb is a BR 30L can be seen in the lower right-hand corner.The box the bulb comes in states that the bulb is dimmable. I did not test this feature. By the way, the box is very hardy; the bulb is well-protected during shipping.This GE LED bulb produces 750 lumens, draws 12 watts, and has a life expectancy of over 25,000 hours. A similar CFL bulb produces 825 lumens, draws 13 watts, and has a life expectancy of 8,000 hours. A regular incandescent light bulb draws 60 watts and has a life expectancy between 750 and 1,500 hours. In other words, by switching to LED bulbs, you will use 75 to 80 percent less power than you did with incandescent bulbs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IF8KCTDFN6E9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KNW6V0#wasThisHelpful","R1IF8KCTDFN6E9","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I highly recommend Rusty Cooley's ""Arpeggio Madness.""An ""arpeggio"" is the sounding of the notes of a chord individually, one after the other, ascending or descending, perhaps spanning more than one octave. This course will help program your fingers to rapidly play arpeggio patterns (patterns that hit on the notes of a chord); this skill will greatly improve your ability to play lead throughout the changing chords of a song.This three-DVD set is cheap: you would need to spend many hundreds of dollars to receive this training from a guitar teacher. But then, how many guitarists who play at this level (like Rusty) are willing to teach this material? Not many. Rusty is really generous to offer this training to us mere mortals.""Arpeggio Madness"" is for advanced guitar players; before you start this course, you should have previously learned all of the following.- Instant note recognition of all notes on the fretboard- Keys (notes in every key)- Chord construction (notes in any chord)- Guitar chords for any given key- Major and minor scale patterns (played in any key).In short, you need to have previously completed training equivalent to Rusty Cooley Fret Board Autopsy- Scales, Modes & Patterns Level 1, and Fretboard Autopsy - Scales, Modes & Melodic Patterns - Level 2 - DVD (or, perhaps, Fretboard Theory Book and 4 DVD Bundle 25% Off Desi Serna).This product comes with a great instruction booklet (of approximately 100 pages) in PDF format. There is a copy of the booklet on each one of the three discs. Just copy the PDF file to your computer, then print out the entire booklet or only the pages you are working on each day. I am really impressed with the instruction booklet.Rusty Cooley is, of course, a great guitarist; but he is also an excellent instructor. He does a great job on these DVDs explaining the concepts. I felt that Rusty's ""Fretboard Autopsy"" course did not have adequate explanations and graphics. ""Arpeggio Madness"" certainly does not have any such problems: Rusty's explanations in this course are nearly perfect (clear, concise, and easy to understand). He communicates very well. I also appreciate how he has integrated his spoken explanations with references to the booklet. The booklet is loaded with good-sized graphics, as well as text explanations.It will probably take most folks several years to master the skills taught in this course. I (sadly) will never achieve the level of skill required to master the material on the third DVD. Even so, it is great to have a guitar instructional program that is so challenging. Thanks to Rusty and the production team for making such a great DVD course.In this instructional DVD, Rusty Cooley uses his Rusty Cooley signature, seven-string Dean guitar which he tunes down one-half step. While he uses his seven-string guitar, all of his instruction is limited to the standard six strings. However, students will need to drop tuning one half step to exactly follow Rusty's examples (i.e., change tuning to E-flat, B-flat, G-flat, D-flat, A-flat, E-flat). I feel that he should have used a six-string guitar in standard tuning for this course.This product allows you to gain free access to the Rock House website, where you will find lots of free supplementary learning aids. For example, you can download the ""backing tracks"" (drum and bass rhythm tracks) for these lessons. I play these through my guitar amp via my iPod. Such backing tracks are more fun than a metronome.Also check out the book Arpeggios For The Modern Guitarist BK/CD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GURX2VTCLCRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0054TOTOK#wasThisHelpful","R2GURX2VTCLCRW","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In short, you should skip ""Your North Carolina Wills, Trusts, & Estates Explained Simply,"" by Linda C. Ashar.I made an assumption when I purchased this book: I assumed that it had been written by an attorney currently practicing law in North Carolina. If I had performed a little research before placing my order, I would have learned that the author practices law in the state of Ohio. This book seems to be limited to information that the author read in the North Carolina General Statutes (available online). While this may have some benefit to potential readers, it is no substitute for experience gained through years of practice in North Carolina, including experience with the probate courts in the state's many counties.I am not a lawyer, but I have acted as executor (personal representative) in different states (through the entire year-long probate process). I have agreed to be the personal representative for a will written in North Carolina. Instead of waiting for the last minute (so to speak) to educate myself on my duties, I have been proactively learning about specific North Carolina estate planning and probate laws. Therefore, I was initially relieved to find this book on Amazon; unfortunately, this book failed to live up to my hopeful expectations. While this book could be helpful to some, I have read much better books on the subjects of wills, trusts, and estates.Plan Your Estate by Denis Clifford was much more helpful to me. It is better written, more systematically developed, better organized, and less cluttered. Of course, ""Plan Your Estate"" is a generic book (written for all of the states); but with just a little online research, you can inform yourself on specific North Carolina laws and probate practices. I believe that such research will leave many folks better informed, and less confused, than reading Ms. Ashar's book. If such an approach does not work for you, then (by all means) try Ms. Ashar's book. In all cases, you should consult with a qualified North Carolina attorney.I assumed that this book had been written from the ground up to specifically address North Carolina laws and probate practices. Instead, I discovered that the book was initially written for another state, and then edited by the author based solely on a review of North Carolina General Statutes. This approach works okay (not great, but okay) much of the time: the manuscript will make a generic statement about a topic, and then there will be an added comment about North Carolina law. However, this approach occasionally failed when the author was unaware that North Carolina laws and customs differ from the generic discussion. Also, this approach is often ineffective and confusing, as it surrounds the North Carolina-specific information with distracting generic discussions. The one and only chapter in the entire book that is specific to North Carolina law is a chapter on the Last Will and Testament.If you look at the Amazon author page, you will find that she has revised her books for many states (Ohio, California, Virginia, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Indiana). Since this book still contains references to Florida terms and practices, I must conclude that the book was poorly edited after it was revised for North Carolina.While this book may be better than no book at all, I would have preferred to have a book written specifically for North Carolina residents by an attorney with decades of experience working with North Carolina clients in North Carolina probate courts. Since this book contains several errors concerning North Carolina law and probate practices, I cannot recommend it to potential readers. For example, at one point she mentions a probate-avoidance technique that is allowed in most states, but NOT in North Carolina. At another point she addresses two methods to accomplish a probate task and states that both methods must be used; in fact, the first method is preferred, while the second method is used only if the first method cannot be. Granted, all of the book's errors would come to light when you eventually consult with a North Carolina attorney; however, a book of this kind should have zero errors. The author also seems to be unfamiliar with some of the specific terms used in the North Carolina probate courts. It might have helped her to download and review the North Carolina probate forms prior to revising her book for the state.A great deal of the text in this manuscript should be block-deleted. The text frequently wanders and is often only peripherally connected with the central topic of the discussion. I have a friend who uses the term ""blah-blah"" to describe the style of writing that frequently appears in this text. For example, if you replaced entire sections with ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"" you would gain just as much useful knowledge as if you had read the original text. The publisher should hire an editor to delete all off-topic or otherwise unnecessary text; this would potentially eliminate some 30 percent of the text.Since this text was originally written for another state and then revised for North Carolina, it can potentially leave the reader a bit confused. Just one example: many times the author addresses ""community property"" requirements (such as those in California), but then immediately informs the reader that North Carolina is not a ""community property"" state. Obviously, it would have been much better to simply delete all discussions on ""community property"" requirements.The book fails to discuss the special requirements that apply when the ""personal representative"" (or ""administrator"") is not a resident of the state of North Carolina.The book's discussion about the tax consequences of life insurance payouts is hazardously incomplete. The book makes the erroneous statement that a ""life insurance policy payout is taxable income."" Refer to IRS Publication 525. Life insurance proceeds paid to a beneficiary because of the death of the insured person are not taxable unless the policy was turned over to the beneficiary for a price. However, interest income received as a result of life insurance proceeds may be taxable.For ""estate tax"" purposes, the decedent's ""gross estate"" must include the proceeds from life insurance payouts, if the decedent owned the policy. Refer to IRS Publication 950. But then, very few Americans meet the criteria to pay ""estate taxes"" any more. On page 83 of the book, Ms. Ashar incorrectly states that the deadline for paying estate taxes is 90 days; the limit is 9 months, NOT 90 days. Also, the book incorrectly states that the ""Gift Tax"" must be paid if the annual per-person limit (14,000 dollars per year under the 2013 adjustment) is exceeded. This is not necessarily true: if you exceed the annual limit, you must file IRS Form 709 (available on the IRS website). Most Americans who file this form will NOT end up owing any federal gift taxes.In the end, for all taxing matters (federal and state income taxes, as well as federal and state ""estate taxes""), you need to consult with your attorney, accountant, and/or life insurance agent for the complete, true story on these issues.I spotted so many potential errors in this book I have concluded that it is an unreliable reference. As an alternative to reading this book, check out the following:1.  Web pages by practicing North Carolina lawyers in the fields of ""estate planning,"" ""elder law,"" and/or ""probate law."" For example, perform a web search for North Carolina Estate Planning Blog. That web site was much more helpful to me than this book.2.  Download North Carolina probate forms and the guidebook. Perform a web search for North Carolina Court System Forms, and then select the result for NCCOURTS. Under the search ""category,"" select ""Estate."" Or, easier still, just perform a web search for AOC-E-850, North Carolina Estate Procedure Pamphlet. That (free) document is more useful and accurate than this book. Also, take a look at form AOC-E-201, Application for Probate and Letters. I would recommend that you (as part of your estate planning) create a file to help your ""personal representative"" fill out this form.3.  Read the North Carolina general statutes for yourself. They are actually pretty easy to understand. Just perform a web search for North Carolina Probate Law, and then select the result for NCGA. Probate law is in Chapter 28A.I do not recommend this book because it is much less effective as a learning aid than similar books on wills, trusts, and estates. Also, the book was written by an out-of-state lawyer who may have an incomplete understanding of the state's laws and customs. I recommend Plan Your Estate by Denis Clifford instead, followed by a trip to a practicing North Carolina lawyer (to learn the complete story about wills, trusts, ""Advanced Health Care Directive,"" powers of attorney, and probate-skipping practices).","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAZESFB8DLV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160138419X#wasThisHelpful","RAAZESFB8DLV1","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Medical Physiology"" by Walter F. Boron, et al. is an outstanding reference.- It is nearly perfect for a one-year undergraduate course.- It has too much material for a medical school course; however, the extra material may be useful as a reference for future courses and later practice.- It does not go into enough detail for a graduate school course; however, a graduate course could always be supplemented by outside reading.As an alternative to the Boron textbook, a lot of folks like  Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology: with STUDENT CONSULT Online Access, 12e (Guyton Physiology). That book also has a much appreciated condensed version: Pocket Companion to Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 12e (Guyton Physiology). The Hall (Guyton) textbook also comes in a Spanish version (Fisiologia Medica, 11e (Spanish Edition)).""Medical Physiology"" is admirably well-written. The subject matter itself is easy to understand; but I think a lot of folks are going to be challenged by many potentially unfamiliar terms from biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. The book has an excellent index; however, the publishers should add a glossary. I greatly appreciated the cross-referencing within the text which helpfully guides the reader to both past and future sections of the book.The two editors of ""Medical Physiology"" (Walter F. Boron and Emile L. Boulpaep) are professors in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology at the Yale University School of Medicine. Therefore, it should not be surprising that this physiology textbook eventually reduces discussions to the cellular and molecular levels. Such an approach might anger folks who prefer their physiology at the ""black box"" level. Personally, I think the level of detail is nearly perfect.This is a multi-author book with (by my count) twenty-six contributors. Most of the contributors are on faculty at Yale Medical School. The obvious benefit to this approach is that each topic is covered by a person who is an expert at teaching that topic. To avoid the pitfalls of the multi-author approach, the editors carefully rewrote each of the articles to produce a ""single voice"" in the narrative. The editors did a great job integrating the submissions by the many contributors: also, subject matter is sequenced, supplemented, cross-referenced, and indexed to optimize student learning.This textbook has some of the greatest illustrations that I have ever seen. I am certain that most students will remember the visual representations long after the purely verbal explanations have faded. The illustrations alone are sufficient reason to buy this book. I especially admired the three-dimensional perspective drawings.The editors do not address prerequisite learning for this course. I think most students will not understand this book without the benefit of a prior course in biochemistry or molecular biology. Taking a biochemistry course concurrently will not help much: this book requires a broad knowledge of biochemistry even at its very start.Medical schools do not allow sufficient time to cover the entire book. Since this book was written and edited by medical school faculty, I assume they are perfectly aware of this fact. Therefore, I suppose they wanted to write a comprehensive book that could serve students in future courses, as well as clinical practice. If you are not given enough time to study this entire book, I would recommend focusing your studies on your professor's lecture notes and supplements. It also helps to have more concise references for review, such as Physiology: with STUDENT CONSULT Online Access, 4e (Costanzo Physiology) and BRS Physiology (Board Review Series).If you are a college undergraduate who wants to attend medical school, I would highly recommend that you take a one-year biochemistry course. Not only will such preparation help you understand physiology better, it will surely make your medical school course in biochemistry less stressful. Obviously, if you have the time, you should also complete a full one-year course in physiology (or physiology and anatomy) as an undergrad. Physiology at the level taught in this textbook is not difficult to understand; however, there is huge amount to learn. Since medical school may not allow you enough time to learn it all; then learning it before medical school might be beneficial.By design, the book teaches the physiology of a normally-functioning human body. After all, one must fully understand ""normal"" before one can understand and diagnose ""abnormal."" (""Abnormal"" is covered in a pathology course.) The book occasionally uses ""clinical boxes"" to briefly touch upon abnormal conditions, but only when such a discussion will more fully ""connect the dots"" (so to speak).I was disappointed that this textbook did not explain long-term feedback and control processes (i.e., situations that may require months to establish a new equilibrium).""Medical Physiology"" has no self-assessment questions. You might benefit from using BRS Physiology (Board Review Series).For those of you who want even more detail (graduate students), try the following: Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Fourth Edition, Molecular Biology of the Cell, and Lewin's Genes X.""Medical Physiology"" comes with a ""PIN"" number that allows for use of online references, including a consult and an online version of the textbook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7RJRAAJ4R1VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1437717535#wasThisHelpful","R7RJRAAJ4R1VE","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very pleased with the performance of this Remington WetTech(tm) Rotary Shaver.For the past twenty years (or so), I have been using Philips Norelco shavers. Even when new or with new blades installed, the Norelco shavers have performed disappointingly. I have to make multiple passes from several different directions: even then, stubble remains, especially on the neck.This Remington shaver performs much better than my Norelco. ""Dry"" shaving takes less time and is closer. This shaver produces an even closer shave if I shave immediately after my morning shower. The shaver is specifically designed to be used in the shower (it even comes with a non-breakable shower mirror); since I live in a drought area, I do not intend to shave with the shower running. The Remington website recommends their own ""Men's Sensitive Shave Gel"" for use with this shaver. Shaving with a gel with this shaver works great. The cutters can be rinsed under the faucet for cleaning.I am disappointed that the Remington AQ7A shaver does not come with a trimmer.While I like the charging stand for this shaver, the use of such a stand means that I cannot use the shaver while it is charging. Many times in the past, I have been thankful that I could use still a shaver plugged into the wall when the battery was dead. You can't do that with this shaver. However, the shaver charging stand features a ""quick charge"" mode that will give the shaver a partial charge in roughly five minutes; this is enough charge to get you shaved and out the door.Here are a few items from the ""Use and Care Guide"" that came with the shaver:- Full charge time: 90 min- Cordless shaving time: 60 min- Quick charge: a 5 minute quick charge will allow for 3 minutes of shaving- Charge shaver for 24 hours before its first use. During initial charge ignore the electronic indicators as they are in ""start up cycle."" (Normally, the blue charging light comes on when charging. For the initial charge, the blue light came on, then it went off again.)- Use shaver until recharge is required.- Head and cutters should be replaced every 12 months.Check with your state, county, or city to find out if they have any restrictions on the disposal of lithium (LiFePO4) batteries. The ""Use and Care Guide"" provides instructions for removing the battery for disposal, if required.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ATSXIINZ9JKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB5YFEU#wasThisHelpful","R2ATSXIINZ9JKO","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the Monoprice Backlit Macro Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with USB Hub, Headset, Microphone Jacks and Cherry MX Red Switches (109181).This ""mechanical"" keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever used. I recommend it. It is well built and the ""Cherry MX Red Switches"" are great for rapid typing.Mechanical keyboards like this are expensive. Instead of a printed circuit board with a momentary contact underneath each key, a mechanical keyboard has an individual switch under each key (see customer photo). Such high-quality mechanical key switches have a much different (i.e., better) ""feel"" than cheaper keyboards that employ a three-layer plastic membrane. (Perform a web searches for ""membrane keyswitches"" and ""scissor switches"".) Some folks love mechanical keyboards, while other folks hate them. I prefer mechanical keyboards: my typing speed is better and I make fewer typos. With cheaper membrane keyboards, you have to ""bottom out"" each keystroke (press the key all the way to the bottom). With a mechanical keyboard, the key will register when it is depressed approximately half way. Because of this, mechanical keyboards can be less jarring to use (once you reprogram fingers not to bottom-out each keystroke).Before receiving this keyboard, I used a Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition keyboard. That Razer keyboard is great: I'd give it a five-star rating. While the typing response of the Razer is great, the Monoprice 109181 is slightly better. The Monoprice also comes with a lot gaming features (""bells & whistles"") that the Razer lacks (refer to the Amazon product description above). If you do not care about such gaming features, then consider either of the following: Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition - Essential Mechanical Gaming Keyboard (RZ03-00810200-R3U1) or Monoprice Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - Cherry MX Blue (109433).This is the first illuminated keyboard that I have every used. I previously rigged a keyboard light using a Goal Zero 14101 Luna USB LED Stick Light attached under the lip of the desktop. While that worked fine, having lighted keys is even better. Each key is individually backlit with its own LED. The red backlight is adjustable from dim to very bright (it also has a very bizarre mode that oscillates between dim and bright). I adjusted the brightness to its lowest setting.For me, the best feature of this keyboard is the touch behavior (""action"") of the keys (the way they behave when pressed and released). The concave keys make it easier for fast fingers to find, press, and release keys by feel alone. To test drive this keyboard, I went through a typing tutor program that I have been meaning to preview for a friend's kid. This is the best keyboard I have ever used for high-speed typing. Also, typing on this keyboard seems to be less stressful to fingers and wrists: when one is typing 40 to 60 hours per week, it is very nice to have a great keyboard like this.I appreciate this keyboard's ""rollover"" behavior. If you don't know what that is, perform a web search for ""rollover (key)"". With my rapid typing style, some modern keyboards (with the best of intentions) will sometimes block rapid or simultaneous keystrokes. So far, I have never had an instance of the keyboard blocking rapid or simultaneous keystrokes. Read the Amazon product description for an explanation of this keyboard's ""rollover"" performance.Of course, this keyboard is not designed just to make rapid touch-typists happy. Instead, it is designed for gamers. Therefore, I employed a rabid gamer to ""test drive"" this keyboard with a favorite first person shooter game. Reports from the front lines indicate that this keyboard is awesome for gaming. Apparently, the ""rollover"" behavior (mentioned above) can save lives in such a game.The keyboard features two unpowered USB ports which, for example, would be good for connecting a mouse. There is not enough power available at these USB ports to operate an external hard drive. The connections for a microphone and headset are just ""pass-throughs"" to the computer without any amplification (functioning just like simple extension cables). I like the sturdy (removable) wrist pad that comes with this keyboard.I tested this keyboard with three computers, each using a different version of Windows (Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8). The keyboard worked immediately with each computer without having to load the disc that was provided with the keyboard. I next tested this keyboard through a KVM (keyboard/video/mouse) switch connected to the three computers. The keyboard worked fine with two of the computers, but it did not work with one of the computers. Two other USB keyboards I own worked through the KVM switch with all three computers just fine; so I have no idea why this Monoprice keyboard works with two of the computers, but not the third. The keyboard worked fine when connected directly to one of the third computer's USB ports.I was worried that a single USB connector would not provide enough power for the keyboard lights when connected through a KVM switch (a single USB port). The keyboard functions just fine powered through the one USB connection. By the way, this keyboard has the thickest USB cable I have ever seen on a consumer keyboard.The Monoprice 109181 keyboard comes with four orange keycaps plus a key removal tool. These keys are probably intended for the W, A, S, & D keys (used so much by gamers), but they can be installed over any key as desired (see photo for example).This keyboard comes with inadequate documentation/instructions. I doubt if this will be a problem for most folks. Something important to know: Fn+F12 toggles between gaming mode and PC mode. By default, the keyboard disables the WINDOWS key. This will prevent you from using those handy keyboard shortcuts in Windows 8. To re-enable the WINDOWS key, simply press and hold the Fn key, then press the F12 key (notice the G light in the upper right corner turn off).In short, this is the best keyboard I have ever used. I especially appreciate the typing response, but I also like the macro capabilities and the ""rollover"" behavior. I hope I am able to figure out how to make this keyboard function through the KVM switch.I would love to see Monoprice make a version of this keyboard without the number pad (like the Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCJ7SYPI8EQ07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081TQ83K#wasThisHelpful","RCJ7SYPI8EQ07","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this product a four-star rating because (as described later in this review) I judged the cable's audio performance to be inadequate for my primary application (connecting an iPod to a headphone amplifier). However, the cable works perfectly fine for other applications.This cable allows you to connect a standard stereo ""mini"" jack to two RCA jacks (left channel and right channel). With this cable, you can connect the audio output from an iPod, iPad, iPhone, or computer to the stereo audio inputs on an audio amplifier, a car stereo, a headphone amplifier, or a television. For you old-timers, it also allows you to connect the RCA outputs of a cassette tape player or turntable preamp to the ""mini"" jack audio input of a computer.I ran a little experiment with this cable. I connected two iPods to the two analog inputs on one of my headphone amplifiers. One iPod was connected using this Belkin cable and the other iPod was connected using a ""Straight Wire"" brand cable. I simultaneously started playing the same song on both iPods (""Baba O'Riley"") at the same volume. I then compared the two by switching back and forth between the two inputs (a so called ""A-B Test""). (And yes, I did test each iPod separately to make sure performance was evenly matched.)Before running this experiment, I predicted that both cables would perform approximately the same. I was very surprised that the ""Straight Wire"" cable was astonishingly better. Some of you might think that I am being unfair comparing this Belkin cable to the more expensive ""Straight Wire"" cable (which costs roughly two to three times as much). However, the performance of this Belkin cable simply fails to meet the minimum requirements for high fidelity audio (and no, I am not an audiophile).I cannot recommend this Belkin cable to anyone who wishes to play an iPod through a stereo; the performance is simply unsatisfactory for that application. However, I also tested this cable by connecting a laptop computer's audio output to a television; for watching television shows and movies, this cable is just fine. I also tested this cable by connecting a cassette player to a computer to convert some language training tapes to computer files. I was satisfied with the cable's performance for this application.If you care about sound quality, then you might wish to look for higher-quality cables, such as those made by Straight Wire, Cardas, or Kimber. Such cables cost two to ten times more than this Belkin cable, and a lot of folks don't think they are worth the price. My Cardas cable performs even better that the ""Straight Wire"" cable; but I can't really say it was worth its high price. However, I can earnestly recommend the cheapest Straight Wire cable over this Belkin cable.If you do not care about high fidelity audio, then this Belkin cable will get the job the done for you.

"To reduce home energy consumption, I previously replaced most of the incandescent light bulbs in the house with CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) bulbs. I am now making the switch from CFL bulbs to LED bulbs. LED bulbs do not contain mercury (as CFL bulbs do) and they last three to four times longer than CFL bulbs, and some forty times longer than incandescent bulbs.This Philips LED bulb produces 830 lumens, draws 11 watts, and has a life expectancy of over 25,000 hours. A similar CFL bulb produces 825 lumens, draws 13 watts, and has a life expectancy of 8,000 hours. A regular incandescent light bulb draws 60 watts and has a life expectancy between 750 and 1,500 hours. In other words, by switching to LED bulbs, you will use 75 to 80 percent less power for lighting (more or less).I only have one of these bulbs at the moment; they are pretty expensive, so I am trying the bulb in various applications before placing an order for additional bulbs. This bulb is advertised as ""dimmable,"" so I installed it in a light fixture supplied through a common dimmer switch (i.e., a dimmer switch designed for use with regular incandescent bulbs). The LED bulb dimmed just fine. You may find that you need to install a special dimmer switch. If so, search Amazon for . . .  LED Dimmer.I have attached a photograph of this LED bulb (830 lumens, 11 watts) installed in a fixture with a 60-watt-equivalent CFL bulb (825 lumens, 13 watts) and a full-spectrum incandescent bulb (860 lumens, 75 watts). The Philips LED bulb is in the middle. It may not be obvious in the photo, but the LED bulb is bright white, while the two other bulbs have a yellow tint. To my untrained eye, the LED bulb appears brighter, even next to the 75 watt incandescent bulb. The LED bulb is also a lot cooler to the touch.I have also tested this bulb in other applications around the house. Since it is a standard A19 size, it fits a standard light fixture. It works quite well in (1) a wall fixture in the hall; (2) a vanity fixture in the bathroom; (3) a table lamp equipped with a shade; and (4) a drafting lamp with an articulated arm. This bulb probably will not work in a lamp with a shade that is designed to attach by a clip to a regular light bulb.If you can find ""non-dimmable"" LED bulbs, they might be cheaper for applications where you have no need to dim the bulb.This bulb is size A19; look for an LED bulb in the larger A21 size if your application requires that larger size.I tested this LED bulb with a modified sine wave inverter. It worked great (unlike CFL bulbs which do NOT work with most modified sine wave inverters). Therefore, this bulb is a good choice for use with inverter power systems (e.g., RV, boat, cabin, solar power). Your batteries will last considerably longer if you switch to LED bulbs from regular incandescent bulbs.The fact that LED bulbs do not contain mercury makes their responsible disposal a lot easier. Check with your county to find out if they have any restrictions on disposing of LED bulbs; also check with your county and local retailers to find out if they accept LED bulbs for recycling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23X3U6TJIFIWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APTS030#wasThisHelpful","R23X3U6TJIFIWT","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Westcott Straight Titanium Scissors with New Handle Design, 8-Inch, Two per PackThese Westcott (ACME) scissors are a good choice for inexpensive, light-duty scissors. The price for these scissors is ridiculously low, yet they perform well. The blades are very (very) sharp and cut light material with ease. You should not expect such inexpensive scissors to perform like industrial-grade shears costing much, much more.These scissors are good for cutting paper (three sheets at most, I would guess), cloth (one layer with pattern), soft plastic (up to six mils I would guess), very light cardboard (like a Priority Mail envelope), tape, thread, string, yarn, soft-stem flowers, etc. These scissors would be perfect for the office or for a first aid kit (for cutting tape, gauze, and clothing). With plastic handles, these scissors weigh less than conventional all-metal scissors; therefore, they are a good choice for backpack utility kits.These scissors are NOT appropriate for cutting heavy cardboard (such as an Amazon box), stiff plastic (like product packaging, tie-downs, or zip ties), several layers of cloth, hard flower stems (such as roses), or poultry. These activities require medium-duty or heavy duty scissors-shears costing considerably more money. If you use these Westcott light-duty scissors for anything other than ""light duty,"" they will probably break at the pivot point. If you want scissors that are appropriate for the above activities, then check out my list of (more expensive) scissors-shears at the end of this review. Actually, you might have more luck performing searches for ""shears"" rather than ""scissors.""Another option for light-duty scissors is Scotch Precision Scissor, 8-Inches (1448). I previously purchased the Scotch Precisions scissors to cut electrical tape; they are also very good scissors considering their low price. Another good choice for a first-aid-kit scissor is the Prestige Medical Fluoride Scissor, Black, 5 1/2 Inch.Prior to receiving these scissors, I previously had seven Westcott scissors; they all continue to perform well after many years. My favorite scissors are my Westcott Precision Kleencut 12-inch (6.75 inch cut) scissors/shears. They are over twenty years old and will (as long as I keep sharpening them) cut just about anything, including heavy cardboard and heavy plastic. I wish Westcott (ACME) would make those again. Also check out the smaller Westcott scissors available on Amazon.If you are looking for medium-duty or heavy-duty scissors, check out the following:- Westcott Forged Nickel Plated Straight Office Scissors, 8""- Wiss 29N Industrial Shears and Scissors- Gingher 220540-1004 Rounded Bent Trimmers, 10-Inch, Industrial Pack- Mundial 314-8 Industrial Forged 8-Inch Stay-Set Utility Shears- Fiskars 10-Inch Heritage Tailor Shears- Wusthof 5558-1 Come-Apart Kitchen Shears- Dressmaking Scissors heavy tailor's shears 10"" Spirale No. 44525, Made by Kretzer Solingen/Germany- Messermeister 8-1/2-Inch Take-Apart Utlility Shear- Kuchenprofi Professional Stainless Steel Poultry Scissors with 5-Inch BladeIn summary, the Westcott Straight Titanium Scissors are good scissors for the price.

"Judith Shapiro's new book, ""China's Environmental Challenges,"" should be read by everyone in the world. I highly recommend it. Every school and public library should carry this book. Every university and every large corporation in America should invite her to speak. If she has not done so already, I would encourage her to pester Joe Biden (the American Vice President) until he gives her a few minutes of his time for a briefing on this important subject.The book structures its discussion of Chinese environmental challenges on the themes of ""globalization, governance, national identity, civil society, and environmental justice."" This book is intended for college students: it is a well-researched, broad primer on the subject. It is a book chiefly about the impact of Chinese industrial activity and governance on the environment. It is not a book about environmental science or the creation of environmental policy; hence, there is no discussion of customary risk-based rule-making practices. It is a book about the near past, the present, and the near future; it is not a book which attempts to look ahead 50 to 100 years, or more. It is principally a book on domestic environmental issues within China; however, certain important international issues are also addressed. While this is mostly a book about environmental issues, it sometimes addresses food and industrial safety problems.I would judge that there are no prerequisite learning requirements for this book; thus, anyone from any background can read it. Dr. Shapiro conscientiously provides the reader with required background information when needed. Having said that, I recommend that students first read Managing the Environment, Managing Ourselves: A History of American Environmental Policy, Second Edition by Richard Andrews. I also benefitted from having previously read The Great Chinese Revolution 1800-1985 and Public Policies for Environmental Protection.According to the author's Home Page, Judith Shapiro is the Director of the M.A. program in Natural Resources and Sustainable Development at the International School of Service of American University in Washington, D.C. If you are interested, perform a search for Dual Degree Programs: University of Peace. I mention this because the book itself only provides the briefest background of the author's current activities. According to her webpage, she teaches university courses in Global Environmental Politics, Environmental Politics in Asia, Environment and Politics, and Washington Environmental Workshop.According to the author, this book was ""written primarily for students of global environmental politics and contemporary China, it is also intended for any thoughtful person who seeks a better understanding of some of the core issues of our time."" Keep this target group in mind as you read the book. Experts will benefit from this book as well, as it will give them a general overview of Chinese environmental policy issues.The book is smart, well written, and eminently quotable. Judith Shapiro has a talent for explaining very complicated issues very effectively, yet succinctly. The main chapters of this book are admirably well written. I am amazed at the mass of information Dr. Shapiro has included. I am more amazed at her ability to effectively communicate her expert understanding of broad, complex issues. Her writing style is very clean, lean, and lucid. She never wanders. I also appreciated her meticulous citation of references.A digital sample copy of the first chapter (""Introduction: The Big Picture) is available on the author's website. As discussed later in this review, I felt that the first chapter is weaker than the rest of the book (i.e., the main chapters). After reading the book's ""Preface"" and first chapter, I was tempted to skip the balance of the book. I am glad I ignored this temptation: I learned quite a lot from reading this excellent book. Impatient readers might want to start the book at the ""Overview"" section at the end of Chapter 1 (page 29 of the paperback edition).Dr. Shapiro helps her readers achieve an understanding of the highly complicated, real-world, practical issues and activities that impact the domestic Chinese economy and environment. She examines the environmental policy differences between rich countries and developing countries. She discusses how environmental protection goals often seem to be at odds with activities to alleviate poverty. She relates how adequate environmental policies are promulgated by the national Chinese government, but then circumvented at the local level. She provides lengthy discussions about the concepts of ""face,"" national identity, citizen activism, and environmental justice. She discusses such issues as corruption, bribery, and nepotism. She also makes the reader aware of the complexity of economic decision-making in this former command economy.As a textbook for an introductory college course, this book succeeds admirably. I imagine that the class discussions associated with such a course would be lively, informative, and thought provoking. Any student who could take a course from Judith Shapiro would be most fortunate indeed. Considering the population of China, the growing power of China, and the potential global environmental impact of Chinese industry and activity, everyone around the world should read this book. And, of course, all young people should be learning Mandarin.The book explores how the rapid growth in China in the past few decades has led to adverse environmental consequences both within China and around the world. This rapid growth is being driven by the demands for a modern standard of living within China, as well as by the demands of developed countries to out-source manufacturing to China. It is not at all surprising that the Chinese people aspire to achieve the same standards of living as exist in the West. The Chinese middle and upper classes are growing rapidly: the newly affluent are now demanding the same material goods and symbols of status as folks in developed countries. The question is: Can the Earth sustain the activities required to maintain so many people at such a standard of living?I am in awe of the Chinese people for the impressive changes they have implemented in just a single generation. At a time when other countries are trying to avoid economic collapse, the Chinese economy has been booming. The material standards of living in China have improved dramatically in recent years. The amazing success in China is a tribute to the brilliance and hard work of the Chinese people. Yet in achieving this great success, China has been exploiting the environment in a manner and at a rate that is unsustainable. The adverse environmental impact includes such well-known issues as air, water, and ground pollution, but it also extends to other countries where natural resources are being extracted at an unsustainable rate to meet Chinese industrial demands (demands often created in developed countries, such as the U.S.).The Chinese national government recognizes the environmental challenges associated with the rapid changes in their country. The Chinese have taken a leadership position at the global level in their desire to promote sustainable environmental policies around the world. At the national level, the Chinese government has promulgated admirable environmental goals, policies, and regulations. Unfortunately, environmental regulations are being intentionally circumvented at the local level. Local and regional officials and enterprises find it is much more rewarding to ignore the national environmental regulations, since such regulations impede growth and profit. Historically, locals have been rewarded based on metrics of output and growth, not on metrics of environmental impact. Many have adopted the philosophy of ""pollute now, clean up later."" This same philosophy was followed during the earlier industrial revolutions in England and America; however, the populations of those countries were substantially smaller than the population of China. With a population in excess of 1.3 billion (and growing), many folks believe that environmental collapse will certainly result if the Chinese do not alter their current, unsustainable practices.Now that the Chinese people are enjoying higher standards of living (with the lucky few now enjoying private cars and better apartments), many Chinese are beginning to see the environmental price that is being paid for their improving fortunes. The air is conspicuously filthy; lung cancers are on the rise; water is polluted; food is suspect. A growing minority of Chinese is beginning to protest for better environmental protection and improved food and water safety. It seems unlikely that there will be any changes unless the Chinese people reject the philosophies of the West that glorify conspicuous consumption. Also, a system of rewards and severe punishments needs to be employed to change behaviors at the local level. Call me a pessimist, but this outcome does not seem realistically possible (in spite of some recent executions).Dr. Shapiro quite appropriately uses the terms ""sustainable development"" and ""sustainability"" quite frequently. Sustainability is, perhaps, the most important concept in a book of this kind. She first introduces, and briefly discusses, the term on page 11 of the first chapter. She seems to be assuming that her readers are already completely familiar with this concept. To serve to a potentially broader readership, I would suggest that the author include an entire section in the ""Introduction"" chapter to thoroughly explain this potentially new concept to the readers. On the very first page of the book, I think she should ask the question: ""Can the Earth sustain ten billion human beings (one-fourth Chinese) at a standard of living currently enjoyed by those living in developed countries?""I did not see the term ""livability"" used in the book. (I first had this term explained to me by the late Dr. Shirley Friedlander Weiss of the UNC Department of City and Regional Planning). Dr. Shapiro once used the phrase ""intangible aspects of sustainability""; but she should have introduced her readers to the concept of ""livability."" ""Sustainability"" and ""livability"" should be mentioned together in such discussions.If China emulates Western behaviors, environmental collapse is inevitable. China cannot follow the path to industrialization previously taken elsewhere (including America). Instead, China needs to ""leap frog"" forward in its development (not to be confused with the ghastly ""The Great Leap Forward""), employing high-tech, environmentally-friendlier methods to achieve better standards of living. Also, such a ""leapfrogging"" strategy can save billions of dollars in capital costs in addition to reducing adverse environmental impact. The Chinese people could jump ahead two generations in technology without following the same paths of development as the West did. Could the Chinese people lead the world in embracing the values ""livability"" and ""sustainability"" over Western-style materialism? It would be pretty to think so.The penultimate page of the first chapter poses the most important questions of the book:- ""Do people in developing countries such as China have an inherent 'right' to the same living standards as those in the developed world?""- ""Can China develop first and clean up later, as much of the developed world did, or is this no longer an option given the limits on the planet's resources?""- ""Does the developed world's standard of living have to change if we are to keep from planetary ecological collapse?""These are (of course) excellent questions. Since this seems to be a textbook for college students, the author sometimes poses questions that seem intended to spark thoughtful class discussions. Therefore, she does not always provide the explicit answers to such questions.If Dr. Shapiro revises this book in a few years, I hope she will consider making some changes. While the main chapters of the book (Chapters 2 through 7) are nearly perfect, I feel that the ""Preface"" and ""Introduction"" (Chapter 1) could be improved. While the author may have targeted this book for college students, it could (and should) be studied by millions of diverse readers from all around the planet. Such potential readers could have quite different backgrounds in culture, language, education, work experience, and environmental attitudes. The ""Preface"" and ""Introduction"" should be revised to immediately and tightly focus the attention and interests of this diverse audience onto the specific topics and goals of the book.The ""Preface"" of the book is largely an autobiographical story of the author's experiences as young Asian Studies major teaching English in China. While this preface is probably very effective in establishing a rapport with a class of young college kids, it is not as effective as it could be in orienting the international reader to the subject matter. Although I found the preface to be interesting, I would recommend deleting it entirely.The first chapter of the book (Introduction: The Big Picture) fails to speedily explain the book's purpose and scope. For example, the author does not identify her target group (students of global environmental politics and contemporary China, and others) until after twelve pages of preface and an additional thirty pages of introduction. She should have revealed this target in the first paragraph of the book. The reader does not reach the book's ""Overview"" until the closing four pages of the chapter (forty pages into the book). To ""hook"" her reader, the author should provide this ""Overview"" in the first few pages of the first chapter. She should also employ standard tactics to ""sell"" her audience on the book straight away. Lastly, I think it would be best to shorten the first chapter: it is not as precisely focused, organized, and lean as the balance of the book. Although the book could improve its beginnings, the rest of the book is superb in covering its major themes of globalization, governance, national identity, civil society, and environmental justice. As stated previously, the main chapters of the book are very well written, informative, and thought provoking.The chapter on ""environmental justice"" is quite well written. Every student of environmental policy should read this chapter. The author seems to have written this chapter for those who already share her views (i.e., she is ""preaching to the choir""). She should have included more insight into the thoughts of the rich and powerful men in China. I suspect that many powerful Chinese men would consider much of this chapter to be the idealism of a nave school child. And so, I would like to see a version of this chapter written in manner to convert the sinner.While the book shares the views of scholars (""thinkers""), bureaucrats, activists, complainers, and the common folks, it never included the views of ""doers."" We never hear from the managers of large-scale projects within China. I would have been quite interested in hearing from project managers who have spearheaded multi-billion dollar construction projects such as new cities, roads, bridges, dams, power plants, transmission lines, chemical plants, paper mills, textile mills, pharmaceutical plants, etc., etc. It is one thing to have knowledge gained through study; it is quite another thing entirely to have knowledge gained through personal experience. This book seems to present ""doers"" as corrupt environmental criminals, instead of as remarkable men and women who are trying their best to transform a country.There is another group that the author should have tapped for her book: young Chinese men and women who have obtained graduate degrees from American universities in the fields of Environmental Science & Engineering and City & Regional Planning. I would very much like to hear what such highly-educated professionals have to say five to ten years after returning to, and practicing in, China.I disagree with the author's assertion (quoting Qu Geping) that environmental regulations require ""supervision from the ground up."" This might be true in a country like China; but in America, environmental regulation by ""mob rule"" would be a disaster. In my own experiences with the impressive staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as the world-class researchers who support the EPA, environmental regulations are best promulgated by specialists with a rare combination of intelligence, education, experience, wisdom, and rationality. Luckily, we have such people in the U.S. Without such people, half of the mob would probably vote to party hard today, with no concern for future consequences. This does not mean that U.S. environmental regulations are promulgated without input from the citizens. Regulations are based on Acts of Congress. Politicians, sensitive to the voting triggers of the other half of the mob (admittedly pressure ""from the ground up""), are prone to use ""no risk"" language in Acts. It is then up to the EPA to quantify risk and establish cut-offs for abatement mandates. Also, in the U.S., regulations require a public comments phase and public meetings. Environmental policy created by experts using risk-analysis, risk management, and risk communication, and with due consideration for the feelings and needs of citizens, produces far better results than ""supervision from the ground up.""Nits to pick:The book identifies NOx as ""nitrogen oxide."" (This may be an editorial error.) The term ""nitrogen oxides"" should be used when referring to NOx, not ""nitrogen oxide.""  NOx refers to any combination of the combustion gases nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in air. Refer to Fundamentals of Air Pollution.The author states that nuclear energy has a risk of ""explosions."" I would like to assure everyone: It is quite impossible for a nuclear power plant to ""explode."" A steam explosion is possible and a hydrogen explosion in the containment building is possible; but it is impossible to have an atomic explosion that produces a mushroom cloud. However, as the Japanese and Ukrainians have demonstrated, damaged reactor cores can lethally contaminate the air, water, and ground by releasing billions of curies of radioactive fission products. Even so, no one should state or imply that a nuclear power plant can ""explode."" Even so, the point the author is trying to make in the discussion is valid: I suppose one could substitute the term ""reactor accidents"" for the word ""explosions.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKIGFJ5SJQU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745660916#wasThisHelpful","R1NKIGFJ5SJQU1","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Update (10/28/15): It has now been three years since I installed two pairs of these memory modules in my home-built computer (4 DIMMS, for a total of 32 GB). The memory has operated flawlessly.I installed four of these memory modules in my new computer. They are working just fine. I ran a (self-repeating) memory test for over 24 hours prior to loading the operating system.Before you order memory modules, you should review the webpage and ""User Guide"" for your motherboard. I recently built a new computer using the ASUS Maximus V FORMULA LGA 1155 Intel Z77 Extended ATX DDR3 2800 PCIe 3.0 HDMI SupremeFX IV Audio Motherboard. The ASUS website (quite conveniently) provides a Qualified Vendor Lists (QVL) of compatible memory for this motherboard (although it may not be up-to-date for 8GB modules). Your motherboard's vendor may have a similar list.If you purchased a ready-built computer, then look on the manufacturer's website to verify that you are purchasing the correct memory. For example, if you purchased your computer from the biggest computer maker, then log-on to your account, enter the Service Tag number for your computer, and then find the memory requirements. Or, you could just call and ask.My computer's motherboard requires (1.5 volt) DDR3 dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), installed in ""matched sets"" for ""dual channel"" function. My motherboard's ""User Guide"" recommends installing DIMMs from the same vendor, with the same CAS latency, and of the same version or date code (D/C). Because of this recommendations, and because these memory modules were ridiculously inexpensive when I bought them, I went ahead and installed the maximum memory of four 8 GB DIMMs (32 GB). You can buy this memory with one pair of DIMMs or two pairs of DIMMs: Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory (CMZ16GX3M2A1600C10) or Corsair Vengeance 32GB (4x8GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Desktop Memory (CMZ32GX3M4X1600C10).If you are interested in over-clocking memory, then you might want to research (1.5 volt) DDR3 DIMMs with higher clock ratings (i.e., 1866 MHz, 2000 MHz, 2133 MHz, and 2400 MHz). Naturally, I wanted the 2400 MHz memory; but I decided to try the much cheaper 1600 MHz memory first.Please note: If you are only installing two DIMMS, you may need to install them in only two specific slots on the mother board (i.e., you can't just install them in any two slots). Check the ""User Guide"" for your motherboard to ensure that you are inserting the DIMMs in the correct slots. Of course, if you fill all slots with ""matching"" DIMMs, this will not be a concern.No matter how much physical memory you install, your copy of the Windows operating system may limit how much memory your computer can use. The 32 bit versions of Windows can only address a maximum of 4 GB of memory, with only (about) 3.5 GB of that usable.Windows 64 bit memory limits:- Windows 8 Professional: 512 GB- Windows 8: 128 GB- Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate: 192 GB- Windows Vista Ultimate: 128 GB- Windows 7 or Windows Vista Home Premium: 16 GB- Windows 7 or Windows Vista Home Basic: 8 GBLastly, I recommend that you run a memory test on your newly-installed memory. I used Memtest86+ (it's free). Extract the image (iso) file from the ZIP file, and then create a bootable CD by burning disc from image (do NOT copy the iso file to CD, burn disc from image). I ran this memory test prior to loading the operating system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28G6JF6E04P9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006EWUO22#wasThisHelpful","R28G6JF6E04P9S","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I highly recommend ""Windows 8 Secrets."" I would have been very, very angry with Windows 8 if not for this book. Thanks to the authors and publisher for making my transition to this new operating system painless. Here's an idea: read the first four chapters of this book and then head down to your local computer store for hands-on experience using Windows 8.Windows 8 is the biggest single step-change in operating systems I have ever seen. It is, quite simply, a whole new operating system. This operating system is so completely different from previous releases of Windows that Microsoft should have given it a name other than ""Windows."" A great many functions of Windows 8 are not at all obvious or intuitive; therefore, one is forced to learn many ""secrets."" But do not worry: you can learn the basics of Windows 8 very quickly (in just one or two hours). However, because so much is hidden, most folks will need help: you will either need instruction from someone who already knows how to use Windows 8 or you will need a book.""Windows 8 Secrets"" was the only book I needed: with just two hours of reading, I was able to use Windows 8 with little hesitation or effort. Windows 8 can be extremely frustrating if you do not know the ""secrets"" (there is NO CLUE what to do - - - because all of the menus are hidden); but you can learn the ""secrets"" very, very quickly with this book. After a day or so, your Windows experience will become ""automated"" (like driving a car): you won't even think about it.If you do not like to read, there are some pretty good Windows instruction videos on a popular video website. Such video training is often better than the book, because you can see the system response along with a running narrative. However, be warned: there are some videos that are inefficient and misleading; in other words, some of the well-intentioned video makers don't know the best Windows 8 ""Secrets."" The ""Windows 8 Secrets"" book was better (more accurate and more efficient) than any of the videos that I watched.By the way, the Desktop is still there (just like previous versions of Windows). After you have setup your Desktop, Toolbars, and Start Screen, your computer will be (from that point forward) very quick and easy to use. Also, while the Start button (orb) is gone, it won't be missed: with the new features of Windows 8, it would have been entirely redundant. Any of your applications that run under Windows 7 should also run under Windows 8.I will tell you the most useful Windows 8 ""secret"" (for me): Memorize and use the ""Windows Key"" (Winkey) keyboard shortcuts! For example, if you hold down the Winkey and press C, the ""Charms"" bar will be displayed. The ""Charms"" bar is perhaps the most important interface in Windows 8. Trust me: If you learn the Winkey keyboard shortcuts first thing, you will be able to get most things done in Windows 8 straight away!Here are a few of the more helpful Winkey keyboard shortcuts:Winkey: toggles between Start Menu and last appWinkey + D: opens DesktopWinkey + C: opens ""Charms"" barWinkey + E: opens file explorerWinkey + F: searches for filesWinkey + I: opens the Settings charm (to shut down your computer, for example)Winkey + Z: opens ""app bar"" (the menu user interface that is normally hidden when interacting with a Windows 8 app)Winkey + X: opens the ""power user"" menu (which includes programs and features, power options, event viewer, system, device manager, disk management, computer management, command prompt, task manager, control panel, file explorer, search, run)Lastly, while on the Start Menu, just start typing . . . and see what happens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L6UFNBYBJNFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118204131#wasThisHelpful","R1L6UFNBYBJNFO","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like the Corsair ""Quiet Edition""fans; I replaced all of the fans in my new Corsair Vengeance Series Military Green C70 Mid Tower Computer Case (CC-9011018-WW) with ""Quiet Edition"" fans.You can find out all the technical details about Corsair fans at the Corsair website (Products, Cooling, Air Series Fans). There are two lines of fans: the ""Performance Edition"" fans and the ""Quiet Edition"" fans. As these names imply, the former have higher air flows while the later operate more quietly (at lower air flows).There are two ""Quiet Edition"" models: the AF model and the SP model. The AF model is used when air flow is unrestricted (such as the exhaust fan at the back of the case); the SP model is used when air flow is restricted (such as air flow through drive bays or through a radiator/cooler).The AF120 and the SP120 are 120 mm fans while the AF140 is a 140 mm fan: Corsair Air Series AF120 Quiet Edition Single Fan (CO-9050001-WW), Corsair Air Series SP120 Quiet Edition Single Fan (CO-9050005-WW), Corsair Air Series AF140 Quiet Edition Single Fan (CO-9050009-WW).There are some really great review videos for the Corsair fans on a popular video website. The review on the TastyPC channel was particularly helpful to me, since it quite clearly compared the air flows and noise levels of the various fans. I made the decision to buy the ""Quiet Edition"" fans based on that video. The CorsairMemoreyInc channel also has good video reviews.Each fan comes with: three color rings in red, white, and blue (these are very easy to swap without tools); a voltage step-down adapter; and four fan screws.The voltage step-down adapter (which looks like a short extension cable) reduces voltage to the fan from 12 VDC to 7 VDC. This voltage reduction lowers fan speed and air flow, resulting in further noise reduction. If your system can be adequately cooled with the fan operating at 7 VDC, you might want to install the step-down adapter to achieve even lower noise levels. Be sure to monitor your temperatures with the CPU and video card at maximum use.The only thing I do not like about these fans is that the provided fan screws are not wide enough: the screw heads can slip through the screw holes in the Corsair Vengeance C70 case. I secured most of the fans with screws that were used with the original ""stock"" fans.I recently built a new desktop-style computer using the Corsair C70 case and the Corsair Hydro Series H100 Extreme Performance Liquid CPU Cooler (CWCH100). The C70 case comes with three stock fans; the H100 CPU cooler comes with two stock fans for the radiator. Although the Corsair ""stock"" fans are very good, I decided to replace the three case fans and the two H100 fans with ""Quiet Edition"" fans.In my Corsair Vengeance C70 case, I:- removed the front center drive bay (to reduce air flow obstruction) and replaced the stock fan with an AF140 ""Quiet Edition"" fan mounted outside of the case as a supply fan (these changes maximize air flow to the video card),- installed an AF140 ""Quiet Edition"" fan in the side panel as a supply fan,- replaced the stock fan at the exhaust with an AF120 ""Quiet Edition"" fan,- replaced the remaining drive bay's stock fan with an SP120 ""Quiet Edition"" fan as a supply fan, and- replaced the two stock fans on the H100 CPU cooler with two SP120 ""Quiet Edition"" fans as exhaust fans.As advertised, these ""Quiet Edition"" fans are very, very quiet in operation, and they are keeping the CPU, motherboard, and case temperatures very low. I disconnected the AF140 fan in the side panel because it is not needed.If you are on a budget, you might want to keep the stock fans that come with your case and CPU cooler. Those fans are somewhat noisier; but they have really great performance curves. I just wanted to experiment with the ""Quiet Edition"" fans; I am glad I used them for this build.  I really appreciate the lower noise levels and the air flows are more than adequate (CPU and case temperatures are low). I highly recommend these fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I5VAMGX50CGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RESGGC#wasThisHelpful","R1I5VAMGX50CGA","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Be sure to monitor your temperatures with the CPU and video card at maximum use.The only thing I do not like about these fans is that the provided fan screws are not wide enough: the screw heads can slip through the screw holes in the Corsair Vengeance C70 case. I secured most of the fans with screws that were used with the original ""stock"" fans.I recently built a new desktop-style computer using the Corsair C70 case and the Corsair Hydro Series H100 Extreme Performance Liquid CPU Cooler (CWCH100). The C70 case comes with three stock fans; the H100 CPU cooler comes with two stock fans for the radiator. Although the Corsair ""stock"" fans are very good, I decided to replace the three case fans and the two H100 fans with ""Quiet Edition"" fans.In my Corsair Vengeance C70 case, I:- replaced the stock fan at the exhaust with an AF120 ""Quiet Edition"" fan,- removed the front center drive bay (to reduce air flow obstruction) and replaced the stock fan with an AF140 ""Quiet Edition"" fan mounted outside of the case as a supply fan (these changes maximize air flow to the video card),- replaced the remaining drive bay's stock fan with an SP120 ""Quiet Edition"" fan as a supply fan,- replaced the two stock fans on the H100 CPU cooler with two SP120 ""Quiet Edition"" fans as exhaust fans, and- installed an AF140 ""Quiet Edition"" fan in the side panel as a supply fan.As advertised, these ""Quiet Edition"" fans are very, very quiet in operation, and they are keeping the CPU, motherboard, and case temperatures very low. I disconnected the AF140 fan in the side panel because it is not needed.If you are on a budget, you might want to keep the stock fans that come with your case and CPU cooler. Those fans are somewhat noisier; but they have really great performance curves. I just wanted to experiment with the ""Quiet Edition"" fans; I am glad I used them for this build.  I really appreciate the lower noise levels and the air flows are more than adequate (CPU and case temperatures are low). I highly recommend these fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEIRXDPL4F8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RESFR2#wasThisHelpful","R2WEIRXDPL4F8B","A2X4PBSVF3CGSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X4PBSVF3CGSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very happy when I was offered this in at a discount in exchange for an unbaised review. As I am a huge attack on titan fan, and a fan of anime in general. I bought an XL and it fits on me just like it should, bit lose just how I like it. My favorite thing about the shirt is the material it is made out of. It doesnt really feel like cotton, but it is. The average shirt when I have on, especially since it is hot out or at least it is at the time of me posting this, I get hot very fast, but at least with this shirt I stay cooler for a bit longer, and that is a very important factor for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ1YYO3NVM157/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GMSXUJW#wasThisHelpful","RZ1YYO3NVM157","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon removing this from its package I was dumbfounded. It was so small, only to unzip it and figure out, ""Wow holy crap this bag zips into itself!"" That is by far one of the most awesome things I have seen a big have. If I get tired of having it on my back and there is nothing in it, I can somewhat minimize how encumbering it is on you. As for the bag itself just like the listing says, it is incredibly lightweight. I have been using it for the gym when I travel down due to my shorts not having any pockets. Unlike my school bag because this is so light it does not make my back hot, and because of the material if anything was to spill inside of it I can easily throw it in the wash.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25QHOTYGE3YED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQ5M6G0#wasThisHelpful","R25QHOTYGE3YED","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.This is most certainly without a doubt the strangest mouse I have ever had the pleasure of using. The way you can fold it up and kind of mold it to a position you are comfortable with is a very nice touch. If you pair this up with a memory gel wrist rest, you can be making some serious steps to not end up with arthritis in your future. The mouse does have a slightly learning curve, but nothing a few hours of facebook, or tumbling will not fix. It is a relatively silent mouse, and I had no problems with bluetooth connectivity.

I cant speak too much about people saying about the foggyness after a few washes, I do my washing by hand and this seems like something that only happens with a dishwasher.

The fact that it is bluetooth 4.0 for this price is rather nice, and on top of that for it to be able to be plugged in to my phone when it is not bluetooth is helpful as well, in case my headphones are dead, or if my phone battery is low. So the fact that I have multiple options makes this better than most. As for the sound quality and noise canceling, I am very impressed, unlike other headphones I have had, when I turn my music up loud, it does not begin to crackle, even with my equalizer on.

After a while of wearing them and being up and about, that pain that we all know all too well comes back. Not to mention, I am not sure if it is just me, but you should not sleep with these on, anything that is a bit tight on my feet while sleeping causes me so much pain durring the night that I will end up waking up.

There is nothing like having a scrub on your face to get rid of that griddy feeling, if you know what I mean.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUOSBCUN62JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKDUARQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LUOSBCUN62JF","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this item in exchange for an unbiased review. Now I havent used this myself so I will be speaking from my nanas pov, shes only used this to peel potatos so far and she said it helped alot. She used to use one of the older versions where you hold a handle and carve it yourself. This one is more like a razer, and the original one was very stressful on her hands, however since this is easier to hold obviously it is more comfortable for her, and she doesnt peel as much of the potato off.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GLKCLAARSXDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P556RHU#wasThisHelpful","R2GLKCLAARSXDM","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review. For the price this is a decent bluetooth speaker, as some of them will cost significantly more. The sound quality is better than I expected for the price, but sadly turning it up to max volume on my phone, without my equalizer on. Though it could be that I do not have the settings tuned right yet, so that could be a variable. Otherwise it is true that this is bluetooth, however I kind of wish that it just had NFC.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MIWJUDT1C5X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1Y8AS2#wasThisHelpful","R3MIWJUDT1C5X2","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product at a discount for an unbaised review.I actually like this headset alot, its not too bulky but its not too small either, the foam around the ears is nice, due to the fact that they kind of fit around my ear, and dont just cover the whole thing. And the fact that they still fit around my head, though right now my ear hurts like hell, so I dont really want to put any headphones on. I notice in some of the other reviews people mentioned a static issue at first, though I didnt have this issue so I can not attest to that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BXDM4J5A57P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJ1ORQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3BXDM4J5A57P4","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this product at a discounted rate for an unbaised review. The timing of finding this was pretty nice, as my cousin's old turtle beach head set broke, he is actually on his third pair or so. So for starters I can only HOPE that these last longer than 6 months or less than that that. I am not going to complain too much, the look of these is very nice, they would go right alongside anyone who had an alienware computer, so they nicely complement each other. Above all else my only real problem is that when you turn the volume up all the way the sound gets a bit grainy. Otherwise  I would say that these are a solid pair of headphones, and at 15$ if you want to start streaming or just talk to your friends. You just cant pass on the price","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQU0BY7RPPRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RNDC6JU#wasThisHelpful","RJQU0BY7RPPRA","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item for a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.Now it is rather funny that this product was offered to me, because recently I also backed a project on kickstarter for a similar device. All and all that one has a few more features but has the same total battery. I love the fact that this has such a high capacity, its among some of the highest I have seen for the size that it is. It still can fit in your pocket, or bag so it is perfect for on the go charging. There is nothing more helpful than having some extra battery power when you are sitting on the train listing to music and your phone is at 1%. Because lets be honest, public transportation sucks. So this has already come in hand numerous times. I can even get about two charge cycles while using it on my one plus one! Very impressive!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P55TPR1OR1JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH8DL0U#wasThisHelpful","R1P55TPR1OR1JT","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a discounted product in order for an unbiased review.The device itself is pretty solid, when it comes to extending alot of these work the same way, there isnt much to say about that. Though I wish there where clear directions on the locking system, you really need to make sure its in tight. I tried this with dummy phone first and it actually fell out. It wasnt defective or anything, I just didnt have it on correctly. So you want to make sure your phone is sturdy, otherwise my only other gripe is the short charging cord, it kind of makes it impossible to charge it anywhere else other than a usb hub or your computer, unless you have a longer one around. Otherwise it is a great addon to any selfie addicts arsenal!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R308DICBTVBRIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSQNRJY#wasThisHelpful","R308DICBTVBRIJ","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was offered this product in exchange for an unbiased review.First of all, my selfie game isnt too strong, so when I was offered this I was pretty excited at the chance to see how it worked. I very much love the fact that so far this has been one of the only selfie sticks I have seen that has bluetooth. You have no idea how helpful that is, considering that it is somewhat hard to be able to time the shot, get to your pose in time, and such. Very much less of a hassle with the extra button to take the picture for me! I would include a picture with the review, but sorry everyone my selfie game isnt strong enough yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BGTD9U059L4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGSZ9QO#wasThisHelpful","R1BGTD9U059L4F","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands down one of the most amazing things I have ever seen and used in my whole life. And yes that sounds very exaggerated but seriously wow! Ive used this thing twice so far, and in both instances it has been impressive! One use was on my key chain, my aunt had given it to me and it broke, applied some bondic to the hole with the metal part in it. BAM good as new! The other was to my glasses, out of nowhere one day the frame of them just snapped! I was just standing there with them on and it snapped. I could have gotten some new ones but hell, who wants to pay another 300$? So I busted bondic out and to my surprise it holds it in place!

"I saw a razer just like this on kickstarter recently so once I was offered a discount for my unbaised review I was very pleased for the chance to buy one honestly. It works just like how I thought it would! Im so happy that I no longer have to deal with cleaning my razor so often, my beard is pretty husky if you will so cleaning the hair the got stuck in my old razor is a real chore. But now I have this and some good ole shave secret oil and I am good to go! I can even sharpen the razor if I want to!

"Now this is a first for me, Ive never heard of anything like this, basically these sticks make it so that if you are trying to whiten your teeth and you dont want to do some chemical process, you dont know what those types of things can do, however this is far more natural. Ive read my fair share of horror stories with crest so this is a better option. Along with the fact that there is no water or toothpaste needed, so if you are in a hurry or forgetful like I am, than these factors can help out alot. Ive only been using it a few days but I feel like I can already see changes. But I will update this in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N48IGIEMCD1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYJYSTM#wasThisHelpful","R1N48IGIEMCD1D","AJ9KBX3PW1M0R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ9KBX3PW1M0R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
