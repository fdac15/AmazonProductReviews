"This is my favorite camera of all time. Purely manual, needing a battery only for the meter, and with bullet-proof construction, classic good looks, and very manageable weight. I've tried Leica, and Zeiss, and a vast array of digital cameras, but this is the one I would never part with. It has aperture priority mode, fully manual mode, and shutter speeds from B to 1/4000. Metering is center-weighted, with no ""spot"" option (the only thing I would change). The meter can account for film from ISO 12 through ISO 6400. It allows for multiple exposures and exposure compensation. If has extremely capable TTL flash and fill flash capabilities. It will use almost any Nikon lens ever made (just not the modern ""G"" ones, and there is an almost limitless supply of used lenses to check out.If you are interested in film photography and want to get away from digital, but don't want to risk a lot of your pictures ""not turning out"", this is an excellent first choice camera. If you already shoot film, already use Nikon digital, or just want the best film camera you can buy, this is also an excellent choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXIONE2YE319/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005LERN#wasThisHelpful","R3QXIONE2YE319","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can't beat the price (free at the time of this review). But like so many free Kindle books, this is difficult to read for two reasons. One, there is no table on contents. This is an over 600 page compendium of several old books, but there is no way to jump from one book to the next. Two, there are tables of genealogies which are exceedingly difficult to navigate in this format.Perhaps worthwhile if you just want to read straight through, but probably not worth your time if you need to skim or use it for a class.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WFYH8LXK18HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FL0I3M#wasThisHelpful","R2WFYH8LXK18HX","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this. A lens cap is mostly useful when your camera goes into the bag, where it needs to stay on to avoid scratching the lens with the cap itself. And that's exactly where many lens caps fail (in my experience), by popping off on the edge of the bag. This cap can't do that. It is slightly slower to take off, but when I'm shooting, I walk around with the cap off anyway, so that isn't a detriment for me. I use it with the Zeiss 50mm f2.0 ZM Planar and it stays put far, far better than the weak cap that comes with the lens.This is cheap, it fits, and it works quite well for my style of shooting. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPHKC8APCZHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AE1K9G0#wasThisHelpful","R1JPHKC8APCZHL","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best double edge blades I've found. They are sharp, cut well, and last me about 4-5 shaves, which means this box will last me about 18 months. Since it cost about the same as a 4 pack of Mach3 Refill cartridges, I'm definitely saving money, and getting a better shave while I'm at it. Plus it's fun. What's not to love?

"I'm just getting into medium format photography, and this is amazing. I'm enjoying this film so much I'm considering selling my digital camera. Some day, perhaps, film will no longer be made, but until then, I'll be shooting this and Tri-X .

"Does Tri-X even need a review? This is absolutely the classic black and white film. I develop it myself, and have pushed it two and three stops without difficulty. Developed as ISO 400 it is also fantastic. If Tri-X has a fault, it's that it is too easy to use. The exposure latitude can make you lazy, because chances are if your lens cap was off and you pressed the shutter, you got the shot.So much fun, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29ND54O3TMFJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I2JI3A#wasThisHelpful","R29ND54O3TMFJJ","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this. It stays out of the way of all important buttons, improves my grip, and makes shooting easier. The grip itself matches perfectly with the camera finish, and indeed I forget that it didn't come with my x100s. I had tried another product for this purpose, the Fotodiox Pro Thumb Grip for Mirrorless Digital Cameras  and while it worked out, I was bothered by the fact that it requires a small screw applying pressure to the hot shoe to stay in place. It also didn't fit as snugly as this Lensmate version. The higher cost of this accessory was worth it.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VJI4ZGBKBT30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E259GQI#wasThisHelpful","R3VJI4ZGBKBT30","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about this is the cost. It fits my Fuji X100s fairly well, but the part that fits into the hot shoe is just slightly too narrow, and so arm rocks forward a hair while in use. Additionally, it is fixed to the hot shoe by a tiny hex screw which presses into the shoe when tightened. It probably won't damage the camera, but I spent too much on the camera to let a couple of dollar accessory damage the hot shoe. I upgraded to the Lensmate version http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E259GQI and am quite happy with the change.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQWDIGC3CL4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D86UQWK#wasThisHelpful","RUQWDIGC3CL4I","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are cheap, well sized, they hold tightly and protect your lens. Can't ask for more. I'm not a fan of the lens keeper bit, but that holds true for all lenses, since the dangling cap is just plain annoying.

"Just heard these guys in the gym, and I had to stop my workout to figure out who they were. The music is great, simple and upbeat. Certainly not a lot of lyrical depth, but that may come with time. The misuse of an apostrophe in their name is a bit silly and though some argue it's no worse than the mis-used umlauts in Mötley Crüe's, at least there you know the band was in on the joke. Here I just have to wonder if the band and their label know the difference between a plural and a possessive.All of which has little bearing on the music of course. If you like the clips of ""San Francisco"" and ""The Great Divide"", you'll likely enjoy the whole album.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJ8SV02ZMTP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUTADNI#wasThisHelpful","R1RJ8SV02ZMTP9","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came to this book knowing almost nothing about beekeeping, and picked this as an introduction. I finished it with a great appreciation of the art, and even more for the wonderful insect we all depend upon. The authors cover (apparently) all that is needed to start an apiary, and cover everything from an organic perspective.Chapter one is a discussion of the pros and cons of this specific hive type. Though all the examples in the book are based on the top-bar hive, a lot of the information translates to other hive styles as well. Chapter two is an overview of honeybee biology, and discusses organization, bee types, and the concept of the ""superorganism"", the idea that a hive can be conceived of as a single organism. He then proceeds in chapters 3-5 to discuss beekeeping basics and hive management.This section was enormously impressive to me, as he lays out the system by which the beekeeper decides how to rearrange combs to encourage or discourage swarming, to maximize honey production, and keep the hive healthy. Chapter six discusses the particulars of extraction of honey from this hive style, and details how he cleans combs and harvests the wax, using mostly solar power. He then discusses evaluating queen health, treating and managing disease, and raising queens. The book closes with a discussion of planting to attract and feed bees.I am not yet a beekeeper, so my evaluation is not one from experience, but I feel the information in this book is sufficient to give me a start at it. It is quite well written, well organized, and has clear, pertinent pictures illustrating concepts. I loved reading it and am anxious to put these concepts into practice.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K12SMNCR64IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603584617#wasThisHelpful","R2K12SMNCR64IA","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is apparent to any thinking person that we can't run from pollution forever. Eventually, every ""over there"" becomes here, and our culture regarding manure (both animal and human) has failed to embrace this fact.Mr. Logsdon seeks to address this deficit. He covers practical aspects of animal manure handling, discusses how these considerations are different and similar to human manure handling, before moving on to the basics of microbe science and how we actually reduce soil fertility by depriving it of these natural fertilizers. He closes with a discussion of how this relates to large scale municipal waste and its use as biosolid fertilizer for commercial farming.While much of the information here is found in other references as well, no one else can write it with Logsdon's wonderful style.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOKGEKJKE8DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1603582517#wasThisHelpful","R2OOKGEKJKE8DR","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are good aspects to this film. A lot of the science is well presented, the interview subjects are well chosen, and the message is clear. However, the multiple video-game like interludes and reenacted scenes from the life of the presenter add a bit of ""late night infomercial"" atmosphere that is tough to watch.The weakest aspect though, is that it doesn't really address the fact that the meats and vegetables eaten by paleolithic people were nothing like the meats and vegetables available to us today. It doesn't address the problems inherent in grain-fed meats. It also glosses over the fact that our grain-eating ancestors were able to wipe out or replace their non-grain eating competitors. These are common criticisms of the Paleo diet, and they must occur to anyone watching the film, so it was tough to see an otherwise strong effort to support this diet fail to answer the most common critiques.Probably worth watching, but I'm glad I didn't pay for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTD0AH8KNIJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AX4QF70#wasThisHelpful","RFTD0AH8KNIJA","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this film. As other reviewers have stated, the filmmakers rent an acre of land in Iowa and use it to grow corn. During the process they interview farmers, ranchers, and agribusiness executives about the way corn figures into the food system in America. They make high-fructose corn syrup in their kitchen. They interview random people in parking lots who make authoritative but unsupported shocking claims about the effects of corn.Most of what they cover is touched on in other films more extensively, and this isn't the best made or most informative work on the subject. But it does provide a thought-provoking look at how ubiquitous corn is in our diet, and asks some good questions about the way we've constructed our food system.Recommended with reservations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11E3EVSVX628O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F9XQ9A#wasThisHelpful","R11E3EVSVX628O","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an immensely hopeful genre of film, if only because the subject is so important. And while the amateurish cinematography and 16mm vintage look interludes were initially distracting, I grew to appreciate both over the course of the film.

"I love this genre of film. As an armchair farmer, who dreams of expanding his large-ish garden into a moneymaking enterprise, I've watched quite a few films like this. So I am familiar with the message and style. This is very similar to The Greenhorns, except from a Canadian perspective. Quite enjoyable, but if you're debating spending money on this vs. watching something for free (assuming you have Amazon prime), the biggest advantage this has over other choices is slightly better cinematography and cool Canadian accents.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J40UFL80XY51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRWJTDI#wasThisHelpful","R3J40UFL80XY51","A3CMWAX6I8IR4W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CMWAX6I8IR4W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a repeat, from April 2013.  It's well reviewed, though, and a good game, so if you didn't get it before, here's your chance.  I actually got it then, but hadn't played it (it was one of those 3AM ET gets; I went back to sleep and then forgot about it. :D)  At that point, it had only had a few reviews.I've played it now, and it is very much a keeper.  It's a platform game with a unique twist--that draws from those sliding tile number games from when I was a kid.  Once you get into the game a bit (level 1-3), you have to rearrange the tiles to finish the course.  Tap out to see the entire game board, slide a tile to allow a clear path for the next bit, and doubletap to resume play.  Doubletap again as needed to go out and rearrange tiles again.  A great original twist! You can play on without beating the time.  Graphics are simple and fun.

And the Mirror Assistant from the iTunes App Store will walk you through it.Open the app on your Fire TV and select Mirroring Assist from the pink bar.  The QR code thingy will become active.  Underneath it will have the device number for your Fire TV (Android-AFTM-xxxxx) and a nine digit Mirroring ID.  When prompted on your iDevice, either scan the QR code or enter the nine digit Mirroring Id (without hyphens) to connect the device.  On your iDevice, swipe up to access the Control Center and select Air Play and turn on Mirroring.I found that there's a bit of a lag with the Fire TV Stick. Video didn't work well, and even switching screens and photos sometimes lagged. This may be one instance where a Fire TV's extra processing power helps.  But still, I can see me using it occasionally (and this may give me the excuse I need to upgrade to a Fire TV).I would pick this up now as it's free and hope the developer makes it better for video.  But still, if you want to share your photos from your trip and don't have an Apple TV, this might be the thing for you now.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TCU9WV1DCEQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLMZIZK#wasThisHelpful","R3TCU9WV1DCEQT","AYYKDLL6BOCEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYKDLL6BOCEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a standard mahjong solitare game where the tiles that you match are coffee themed.  Other than the different tiles, the twist is that you play against a countdown timer to try to get through ten layouts in a level.  I got through seven.  This may be frustrating for some.  I'd give this game three and a half stars.

"I enjoyed this book--I think the character of Katerina is getting fleshed out and developing into the kind of strong, feisty female character I love.  In the first book of the series, I felt she let things happen to her, in this one she starts to take control of her own destiny.

You try to guess the correct path between pairs of shapes. You cannot cross a drawn path. The difficulty builds gradually, in lieu of a tutorial.  You start with the most basic set and work on, adding multiple paths as you go.  The shapes that have to be joined have a white shape within the shape; empty shapes are intermediate waypoints that must be crossed.  For example, starting points might be triangles with a small white triangle inside.  When you get to multiple paths, you can only cross a path at a designated intersection  (designated with two interior shapes) that both paths must pass through.  For example a stop-sign shape with two little diamonds inside.When you've connected two shapes, the entire path is outlined in white. An illegal move will show with a red outline. When you've completed the puzzle correctly, the entire drawing turns solid white and the next game appears automatically.As you connect shapes, you hear little electronic boops.  I like that you can turn the sound on and off easily in mid game by tapping on the little triangle at the top of the page; a drop down that allows you to end the current game, resume or mute/unmute the sound appears.  Tap on the little triangle now at the bottom to go back to the game","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYB8Q90IF7IZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA8WNZ0#wasThisHelpful","RYB8Q90IF7IZ0","AYYKDLL6BOCEU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYYKDLL6BOCEU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's an arcade-style puzzle game.  Each level, you get an increasingly complex obstacle course of dots, bars and arrows which may or may not be moving and which sometimes have special attribues.  The goal is to flick your playing piece, a small circle, through the obstacle course, bouncing off or passing through the course to the target, where it will be sucked in if it gets close enough.  You have to get there within a set number of bounces.I found this quite enjoyable--I'm up to level 45 now.  Some of the levels are quite challenging--it's often just the matter of a degree or so in the angle you choose to flick your playing piece.

"This is a quite intriguing and quirky puzzle game.  You are exploring a world, one level at a time, one puzzle piece at a time.From the main menu, you can play, set options for sound, look at the credits, or click on a link that takes you to web pages about the game including a YouTube video.Clicking on Play, you'lll see the  main levels.  I recommend tapping on the two Demo modes and playing them, as they demonstrate two different kinds of game play.  In one of them, you have to drag the playing piece and match it up to the starting piece.  You can select the pieces given in any order.The other mode, you only have to tap the piece you want to play, but the game determines which piece has to be placed next.  I found this more difficult.  In both modes, you earn points for solving quickly and can earn up to three stars per level, so there is a replay value.From the main level screen, you can tap on any available level (some will be locked initially) and select an available sublevel to play.In the games where you fill the designated spot next, too many wrong moves/and or time will cause you to lose the game.  You can replay.  Levels that have been won can be replayed in either mode (pick the piece of fill the spot).There is a little chiming noise that is heard when you play a piece in some modes.  That is an audible cue to how many stars you've earned for that piece--1,2 or 3 stars based on time.  If it annoys you, you can turn it off from the main menu.Playable in either landscape orientation.  Exits cleanly using the exit button (door) and plays in airplane mode.I give this game four and a half stars, though I can see I'm going to have a challenge earning all three stars on all levels.  The stars give it replay value.  The only negative is it's a bit dark and the pieces can be tiny even on my 8.9"" Kindle Fire HDX.

"This is a physics based game built around golf. I'm not usually interested in golf games, but this is more like Angry Birds with a golf club than like a real golfing game. I liked this game.There is a tutorial, I recommend it. You can also play a practice course, which I also recommend. You earn golf bux by completing achievements and can then use the golf bux to unlock power ups or purchase additional shots. You can buy additional golf bux, but you earn a lot by playing the game and earning the achievements. You can pinch to zoom in and out.Use the controls on screen to aim your ball and then the Go meter to change the strength of your swing. I didn't like the popup ad that appeared the instant I opened the game, but haven't had another popup. Hopefully they won't be too intrusive--they shouldn't be in a paid game.

"This is a quirky but intriguing addition to a hiking app repertoire.  It shows you the view from the top of various peaks and labels the mountains you can see.  You can also pinch or spread to zoom in and out.It needs some work.  The controls and menu system aren't all intuitive. The initial mountain peak database isn't complete, which isn't made clear.  You need to tap on the ""i"" icon to go to Info and then tap on ""coverage"" to go to the world map.  Pinch or spread to change the part of the world you are viewing. You can tap on the map to select a tile of coverage to install.The first tile installed automatically was my local area.  The tile installed includes the map and elevation data and the peaks that can be searched in the database, so if you want peaks from a different area--say, Everest in Nepal--you'll have to download that tile separately.  I'm going to be traveling to San Diego soon, so I downloaded that tile and was then able to search for Mt Laguna and Mt Soledad, two mountains I know I'll be visiting (driving).I like that from the info page for a viewpoint, you can change your perspective (altitude) which allows me here in flat Alexandria to see more peaks.I recommend that users check out the user's manual at www.peakfinder.org/mobile/manual/This is definitely better than the reviews indicate, even with the flaws.  I recommend downloading it and fiddling with it a bit.  I'm going to use it when we go hiking in San Diego to try to figure out the view from the top of Mt Laguna.

"This is a very nice tower defense game--I enjoyed it immensely.  You have to prevent ""heroes"" from rescuing a princess in a castle safe using various traps--spikes from floor, spears, acid dripping from ceiling, overactive air conditioning. The evil overlord is at the top directing the waves of heroes. You earn currency by accumulating ""screams"" from the princess (there is also a scream generator) and coins and screams that the heroes drop when you kill them (no blood).  There's also a flying monkey I haven't quite figured out.  Like Plants v Zombies, there's a meter at the top that tells you how you are doing with the waves of heroes.  Also like Plants v Zombies, you pick the traps that you are going to use for each stage.I didn't encounter any of the problems playing it with my HDX that some report in the reviews--unless I tried to play in airplane mode. Then the game would not advance past the splash screen. If played with WiFi on, the game played fine--I'm currently up to stage 7.The game does offer in-app purchases, but so far none are needed to make purchases in the shop; you are able to accumulate enough ""stuff"" to do upgrades, etc.One of the other top reviewers reports embedded spyware. This, combined with the inability to play in airplane mode, is a big red flag for those with security concerns. It's a shame, because it is a really good game.... I give it five stars for game play, but will probably bring that down to three for the inability to play in airplane mode with the spyware that's reported.

At the bottom of the screen are two options to change the orientation of the tiles--this may help you see the board differently enough to recognize matches--a shuffle key that looks like a die (dice), an undo button, a pause button and a hint button (the ""advance"" button on the far right).  The hint button lights up a match--you have to look closely to see it.  The shuffle button adds 10 seconds to your time.

"This is a cute physics based game.  You drop blocks of ice containing fish onboard your boat.  Each level you have a primary goal--total number of blocks, weight of blocks or height of blocks for example, a time goal and an additional goal of not knocking the dog off the boat (not sure if this is consistent on all levels).  You can earn up to three stars on each level.  Only the primary goal is mandatory to clear the level with at least one star.If a block falls off the boat, your level ends.  If you don't make the time goal or other goal, you clear the level but lose stars.My only issue is that there is no way to pause the game or start a replay within the level.  If you want to start over, you need to drop a block into the water to get the replay option.

"This is a kind of endless runner, er, faller game which is better than the average star rating would indicate.  Apparently back in 2012, when first released, it had some issues.You have a little gremlin who is very, very hungry and goes into free fall.  Using the tilt mechanism, you have to help the gremlin eat all the doughnuts, pies and cakes he goes by while falling and avoid the enemies. There is a health meter--if your health goes down to zero, you lose a life. Occasionally there is a new life powerup that he can consume to gain a life.  The game is over when all the lives are exhausted.  There are various levels with different enemies on different levels.You earn various trophies.  Unfortunately, once you earn a trophy, you can't tell what you earned it for. :D  Check out the trophy screen from the main page and tap on the trophy silhouette to see what you're aiming for.There is a calibration screen when you first start playing.  There is also a help screen on the Main Menu which basically tells you what you can probably figure out for yourself as you play--the game doesn't need much instruction.  Options include turning sound on and off, replaying the story or resetting the game.I liked the game as endless runners go.  It's more relaxed than some of them but gets progressively more challenging.

"*This book was gifted to me in exchange for an honest review*As promised here is the review for Ghost Files Volume 2…Be ready for Ghost Files Volume 3.Apryl Baker does it again…she just keeps me on the edge of my seat with Ghost Files Volume 2. Her writing is so suspenseful its hard to quit! The book draws you in so quickly with Mattie having to deal with another foster home, and not a very nice one! I just want Mattie to be happy and free from all the hurt she has had to deal with. Thankfully Officer Dan comes to the rescue…or does he? I loved all the new characters that are introduced in this new book, the living and the dead ones. She meets some scary characters. My favorite scene in the book is when she meets the painter. I found this scene intriguing, scary, and confusing, but thankfully Miss Baker explains all the confusion away. Mattie and Dan also get to find out a bit about their pasts. Will this new information strain their relationship or will it make it stronger? With all that happens in this book, Ghost Files has me on an emotional roller coaster with heart break, stress, loss, and physical pain. I rate this book 5 creepy stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W87GY6IW9821/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ7YP0G#wasThisHelpful","R1W87GY6IW9821","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went into this book blind. All that I knew was the tagline - ""Things are not always what they seem"" - and THAT is the best way to describe this book.Ice, is the President of the Regulators MC. He's a widower trying to raise a teenage daughter. Morgan is a prim and proper banker. Their worlds collide when Ice's daughter, Brooke, becomes best friends with Morgan's sister, Madyson - and when I say collide, I mean BOOM! Personalities clash. But when Madyson disappears, and Morgan begins her own investigation, Ice steps in hell bent on finding Madyson and taking Morgan as his own.I expected the same type of MC book. It wasn't.

"Whoa!! Kick is dark, violent, discomposing, and bloody. I'm still in shock - and I freaking LOVED every single bit of it. I could not put it down. Where do I even start? Kick is so broken, lost, and numb. Indie is totally shattered.Raised in a MC by a sadistic father, Daniel ""Kick"" Johnson is taught that brotherhood is everything. But when they take it too far, Kick betrays them. Now in another MC, Kick is fearful everyday that they will learn of the betrayal to his first MC. When Kick finds a kidnapped victim, he defies his orders to kill her, and decided to take her for his own, giving her a new name - Indie.Kick is far from the typical hero - he is NOT the good guy. You want to strangle him one minute and in the next, you are rooting for him to take vengeance. Carmen Jenner did an amazing job on this book. It scares me how she made me feel empathy for such a disturbing character, but she did..

"Do you believe in fate?Skylar was a good time girl that barely got to know a guy’s name before she left him in his bed. Until one night she hits rock bottom, determined to change her life she chooses to do something selfless. After deciding to give up men and booze she decides to be a surrogate. Since she has never had a child of her own she has to go about the whole surrogate thing unconventionally. What she never expected was to find a new best friend and fall in love with her husband too.Griffin and Erin were high school sweethearts. Erin is not able to have her own baby and is not considered a good candidature for adoption so they never though they would have a child at all, until Skylar.Skylar meets Erin and Griffin and agrees to be their surrogate. She instantly bonds with Erin and she is instantly attracted to Griffin.“You know I love you, right, Erin? You know I’d do anything for you and I want to do this. I really do. I just need to know I’m doing it for the right reasons.”Skylar really evolves in this story but not so much that it is a complete surprise. You just know that she is a good person deep down and she just had to figure it out for herself. She does this with the love and support of her best friend Erin. Even though Skylar is in love with Griffin she would never betray Erin by acting on these feeling. Skylar experiences loss and learns to love in more ways than one. She finally gets to her true self only to lose her other half.After tragedy strikes everyone is left to clean up the pieces and figure out what is the truth and what has been planted by someone they love.

When you talk like that, all I want to do is throw you down and scr*w the h*** out of you.”The heartfelt and unconventional relationship between these three people is beautiful. The author writes the story beautifully and makes you feel every emotion that Erin, Griffin and Skylar are going through. I laughed, cried, and swore at the unfairness in it all.The epilogue will leave you feeling good about it all and makes you realize that sometimes Fate has its own agenda.I know I haven’t given much away on my review and that was by design, it would ruin the story to give too many details.Have the tissues ready and be prepared to fall in love with all three of these remarkable characters. One last thing…READ THIS BOOK!Fate-Faith-Family","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L9MGH9EWYSR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014I0BTE8#wasThisHelpful","R2L9MGH9EWYSR3","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***Just a little note***Hold On is the EPIC (Yes I said EPIC) finale to the ‘Burg Series.  Each of the ‘Burg series installments can be read as a standalone BUT I am a huge believer in reading an entire series, because quite frankly I feel  you do not have a FULL picture of the world the author is trying to build if you only read a random book in the series.  Even when the author does a masterful job of recapping some of the secondary character history it still does not tell the whole story.  So if you haven’t read the series to completion and have no plan to I would skip the epilogue in this book because it is really a series epilogue as much as it is a book epilogue.  But who knows you may get intrigued by some of the other characters in the epilogue and decide to read the series in full so I take that back.On to the review…As I was saying Hold On is the FINAL ‘Burg series book and I could not be having a harder time letting go of these characters.  From page one of the series (For You) Kristen Ashley brilliantly brings to life the small town of Brownsburg and its crazy, loyal, loveable and sometimes completely broken citizens.  The series has angst, betrayal, love triangles, suspense and a LOT of lovin’.  So it is not a surprise to this reviewer that she chose to go out, coming full circle with this book giving us the story of Cheryl who was the bamboozled stripper girlfriend of Denny Lowe, the serial killer who was obsessed with Feb and Colt.  After finally pulling her life back together with a little help of Feb and Colt, the single mother and former stripper turned bartender, Cheryl and her son Ethan become part of the ‘Burg family.  This story is also about Garrett “Merry” Merrick the final single hot cop, who has been in the background for 5 books.Two lost souls that are friends but become so much more.Merry has been in love with his ex Mia since he left her and now she is moving on and he is miserable.Cher has been secretly in love with Merry for years but knows it cannot be anything more, well because he us hung up on Mia.Merry decides to drown his sorrows and everyone knows that you should never leave a friend to wallow in misery alone so Cher decides join in the shots and to enlighten poor Merry on a few things…“That’s bulls***, Merry, straight up.  You got good, you don’t let it go.  It lets you go, you hold on.  It slips through your fingers; you pull out all the stops to get it back.  You got something’ worth fighting for, you fight for it.  You do not sit on your ass waitin’ for it to come back to you.  You show whoever that is they mean something and you go all out on that, and the only way you go down is doin’ that s*** swinging.”Merry has some deep emotional baggage that he must overcome and Cher being a single mom and survivor needs to learn to finally trust others to help live instead of just exist.  Cher’s son Ethan is amazingly bright and charming and he steals the show many times in the book.  (He makes me want to go all gooey on him).Merry and Cheryl are great together, they have witthy banter, and can read each other's mood better than anyone else. The chemistry is there and it does not take long for that pull to start is magic.This installment of the ‘Burg is the no less dramatic, suspenseful, exciting and romantic than any of the other books in this series.  There is a healthy dose of all of them in the form of drama queen exes, certifiable stepmothers, dangerous neighbors, Ryker’s mysterious dealing and of course Merry and Cher themselves.  We touch base with familiar faces from the previous 5 books and we see how everyone is doing.The epilogue is what makes this book EPIC; I mean it is amazing and could not have brought me more joy if it tried.  I loved getting to see the future for some of my favorite book friends and love the slip in of one of my favorites of the hot bunch.Honestly I could wax poetic all day about this book because there is so much to love but since I have to get back to the real world I will wrap it up.Thank you Kristen Ashley for taking care of my ‘Burg friends.  Thankfully I own the series so I can always visit when I feel the need, which will probably be in a couple of weeks.5 stars does not come close to the amount of love I would want to give this book but alas that is not the way of the rating scale. So to show more of my love I am giving it 5 HEARTS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLG5F3C1MMK5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YUR6BUM#wasThisHelpful","RLG5F3C1MMK5N","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review.*Girls is a very intriguing book! First off this is Savannah Avery’s first novel, and I have to say it was a great book. This is a short book of only 144 pages, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t a great read. There are four main characters in this book and each one is a mystery to me except for Coco because she is the narrator. I found it interesting that when Savannah wrote the book she waited until the end to explain how her and Kitty came to be. Her writing leaves an air of mystery around the entire story…it keeps you wondering. I wondered throughout the entire book..where were the parents, why didn't they care ect. But Miss Avery does a great job of answering all of your questions at the end of the book..so just hold out. Each girl was missing something in their life and I believe that is why the excepted M so quickly. Although it is scary how easily young girls can be influenced by someone so quickly. I found that M had some good advise about boys…don’t let them take your power. I did feel that Coco was a bit too dramatic about her and Mark in the beginning but it was a good flaw and made her a better character. This book was unlike anything I have ever read. It didn't have much suspense but I also couldn't stop reading it. The story just flowed for me and never became dull. I think that is because I wanted to see how M came to be who she was….was she a madam, was she abused as a child, was she planted in the school to get recruits? This was a book I will remember for a long time…I rate it 5 stars for originality, and content.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJHLPFSQC6MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1512077925#wasThisHelpful","R3EJHLPFSQC6MA","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I couldn't wait to dive into Tyler and Meredith's story. Laramie introduced Tyler Blackfoot in the first book of her Heaven Hill MC series, and something about the silent-but-deadly larger than life man made me want to know more. And Meredith - I had to know what happened! In Meant To Be, we witness the horrible attack against the ""too nosy for her own good"" reporter and Tyler finding her in the aftermath. Without a second thought, he became her protector and her shield.Where do I begin - I love the way Laramie writes. Her style allows you to see both sides; what they think, how they feel, and I enjoy reading stories like that. This is an MC book, but she gives us a glimpse into the harden shells that these men have had to erect around their hearts.One of the best things I enjoyed in this book, was the way Laramie treated Meredith's rape. It wasn't down played. The most tender moment for me was when Tyler tells Meredith about his tattoo - swoon worthy.This was a wonderful book, and with the introduction of Jagger (and Tyler's skull cup) I had to dive right into the next book in this series. I know I gave the first book a 4.5, but that was because it was the beginning of a series. The intermingling of new and older characters is a talent, and I wanted to see how her followup book would fare. I'm happy to say, I'm hooked and I love this author - 5-stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGUSU5DZO686O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDDC0NK#wasThisHelpful","RGUSU5DZO686O","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meant To Be is the beginning of a new series by Laramie Briscoe. Denise is a single mother with two teenage children. No father, no child support, and losing her job when the factory closes, has her financially in a bind and she's getting ready to lose her house. When Denise picks up an extra waitress shift for Roni, her coworker, little does she know that she's now came under the radar of the local MC, Heaven Hill - especially Roni's brother Liam, the chapter's Vice President. When a deal goes bad and Denise and her children are caught in the middle, Liam puts her under his protection as his ""old lady"".Let me say, I read a lot of the MC genre books. Starting a new series is never easy. The first book is the introduction. It takes a lot to keep them fresh and new. Laramie Briscoe has taken both sweet and rough and created a believable MC world in the hills of Kentucky. At first, I wasn't sure I would like Liam, because of William, his father. But Liam showed that when he claims you as family, he protects his own.I loved the secondary characters. They are blended in with humor and a sense of honor.  Laramie Briscoe did an amazing job introducing and including the members of the club and extended characters from the small town.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KT9QIN306VA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSEHXQU#wasThisHelpful","R2KT9QIN306VA4","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to tell you how I came to read this book. I was at Books and Bourbon, which was a book signing that I attended in Kentucky. That’s where I met Apryl Baker’s and stopped by her table because of her book “The Ghost Files”. The cover drew me right in!  Also the fact that it will be turned into a Major Motion Picture says a lot about the book.  Not only does the cover pull you in…but the first page does as well. I couldn’t put it down, and I can't wait to read the second and third book as well. Apryl is a great suspense writer, and she is good at plot twists….(can’t give too much away). I would have to say this is more of a suspense book rather than a horror book. It just keeps you guessing.  Baker’s take on ghosts is pretty normal…its hard stray from what everybody knows. Her ghosts are typical, but they are creepy. Her take on the Reaper legend is pretty creative. I like that she also talked about wraiths in the story! It isn’t just about the ghosties.  Mattie is such a great character! She is tough, caring, courageous and daring. I also like that Mattie knows who she is as a person, and I feel like I can relate to her character (we have a lot of the same qualities). I found that I enjoyed the fact that Mattie handles her problems in a very teenage way. She just does, and worries about the consequence later. Although I am still kind of unsure of Officer Dan’s intentions, I like him as well. I love the banter between the two characters and the loyalty that Officer Dan offers Mattie. He really completes the story; I enjoyed the fact that he was so young and its easier for Mattie to trust him and his boyish good looks. Overall this books was a great read, and I can’t wait to review the next two for you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUV0XT874FVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ62OMS#wasThisHelpful","RXUV0XT874FVV","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a fun little witchy book! Carlie is such a fun character, and she is somebody I would love to know and be friends with. I love how she is in touch with everything around her and how she cares for her little town. She is insightful, caring, smart, small but tough. I found that I enjoyed how much her craft keeps her in touch with nature, especially the moon.  I enjoy how Terry writes…he adds in little bits of life advise that just make sense. For instance this quote was my favorite, “take care of things that take care of you.” The book has many more of these fun, little insightful tidbits. I also like how Terry describes his supernatural characters..some of them are so unique. He also does a good job of describing the classic creatures as well….the mummy was my favorite!  I would have liked to have known more about what happened with Major he is only mentioned briefly in the story…I kind of expected him to be more of a protagonist. I would also like to see a book written about the grandmother, because Carlie mentions her powers so often.

"*I was given a copy of this book for a honest review.MERK! I have been ""Team Merk"" since Debra Kayn introduced us to him in For Life. Oh, I love Cam, but Merk stole my heart. We all knew he'd been in prison for murdering a man, but when we learn the whole reason of who and why - well, that completely does me in.Merk has been haunted by the crime, because of a young girl's plea to help her. Being the only witness to the crime, she unwittingly helps to convict Merk for the murder. The young girl, Desi, is now a grown woman, who is one of the best pool hustlers around; and when Merk is hired, by Desi grandfather, to keep her safe, he sees his chance to make her pay for putting him behind bars.I love Debra's books. It's that simple. She has a way of showing a gritty, ugly side to the Moroad MC, and yet, somehow, she is able to endure these hardened criminals to our hearts. Merk is a haunted soul, and drink is his choice of addiction. Even when Merk was with Christine in For Life, the alcohol is what controlled his actions. Desi has a way of both infuriating him and calming him; and although the alcohol is always a temptation, Merk is finally finding peace with a woman who owes him.I'm giving this highly anticipated continuation to her Moroad MC series 5 stars!

"To be quite honest I did not want to read this book, before you bite my head off let me explain. I am a HUGE KA fan.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER but I felt very little connection to these characters as they did not live in the 'Burg.  I know, I know I should have read the book before I made any judgments but like many people I loved my 'Burg characters.  I am protective of the people there and was worried I would not get to see them if this book took place in Chicago.  Gladly the book takes place in Chicago and the ""Burg and we get to see A LOT of our favorite characters and the birth of Cal and Vi's baby Angela AND their wedding!!!  I LOVE CAL AND VI to the extreme so that was a super BONUS.So after re-reading the first 4 books in the series I decided that I should read this one because a) I owned it (I one clicked the entire series a while ago) and b) the newest and final book in this series is coming out Sept 1.  Let me tell you I was thankful I did.  I love these characters.  Benny and Frankie are complex and hilarious.  Frankie is broken and lost and she is living a half-life because she lost her boyfriend 7 years ago and in doing so she lost his family, who she loved very much.  Benny and the rest of the Bianchi's blame Frankie for the death of his brother and they have been holding a grudge for 7 years.Fast forward to book 2 in the 'Burg series (I highly recommend you read at least ""At Peace' in the series if not the entire series before you read this one} Frankie helps save Benny's cousin Cal's woman Violet and is severely injured in doing so.  Benny realizes that she is the 'one', always has been and he is determined to get her.  Frankie does not agree and has a hard time getting over the guilt that is associated with being in love with her late boyfriend’s brother.“You were mine, even when you were his.”-BennyThis story is complex.  There are nasty family members, there is lots of healing and forgiveness and there is a lot of self-discovery.  This book is like the biggest onion you will ever peel and with every layer you cry a little more, No Joke.  Not to say that it is not witty, funny and sometimes downright hilarious.The Bianchi's are quite funny and endearing not to mention overbearing and a pain in the behind.  We see a lot of Theresa, Vinnie and Sal in this book and we see and finally understand the whole family dynamic a bit more clearly than in book 2.KA easily integrated our Chicago couple into the 'Burg and it did not feel forced or contrived, Seeing as Frankie made acquaintances in the 'Burg most noticably with Vi and Cheryl I hope we can look forward to her in the next book. Did I mention that there are a few of our Rock Chick friends in this one? I just about squealed like a school girl when it happened. EEPP!All in all I am very happy that KA did not disappoint and I am able to move on to the final *sniff* book in the series knowing all is well not only in the 'Burg but the Windy City as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GO3SJ1FBPFZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JXW6GFE#wasThisHelpful","R3GO3SJ1FBPFZG","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was about more than the love story between two characters, it was about four character, two that have decades to make up for and two that have their whole lives ahead of them.Couple #1 Mike and DustyFirst Mike Haines who we met in “At Peace” when he was fighting a losing battle to win Violet’s heart event though we all knew, even Mike, that she was always going to be Cal’s.  He is a divorced dad of two teenagers that has been unlucky in Games of the Heart. He has not given up but he will not go into another relationship easily after being burned twice.Dusty Holliday moved away from the ‘Burg right after high school. She left everything, her family farm, her family and of course Mike, who was at the time her sister’s ex boyfriend  (whom she secretly loved)The death of Dusty’s brother brings her back to the ‘Burg and Mike.  What starts off as Mike going to give Dusty a wakeup call about her “bad behavior” ends up with them in bed and starting a relationship. Of course things don’t go smoothly for our couple, so when they hit a road block, in come Reesee, Mike’s teenaged daughter and Finn, Dusty’s nephew, to knock down that barrier.  It is nice to see that when Mike and Dusty do FINALLY get on the same page and they stay there.  They have many obstacles the biggest one being Dusty’s sister and Mike’s ex high school girlfriend, Debbie.  Not to mention exes that will not go away and the fact that Dusty has a home, business and life in Texas.Couple #2 Finn and ReeseeThey are in the background but as the relationship with Dusty and Mike hits a roadblock they scheme to get Dusty in town to stay. In doing so Finn and Reesee embark on a sweet journey of young love that has its own obstacles, the biggest one being Mike, who does not want his baby girl dating but especially not by a guy who is experienced like Finn. With a little help from Dusty these two find a way.Poor Finn has had the resposibility of becoming the ""man of the house"" dumped on his shoulders at the young age of 17. With Reesee he feels his age and that weight is not as heavy.Reesee is a child of divorce and ishaving trouble finding herself. Finn makes her feel good about herself and with little boost the her self esteem she seems to find her way.This storyline is simply adorable and I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed it.KA really brought this story full circle.  The relationship with Finn and Reesee lets us see what the relationship between Mike and Dusty could have been if Mike had not been with Debbie first. I am so happy Mike and Dusty as well as Finn and Reesee get their HEA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39X8DZ551FJVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KYH3P4#wasThisHelpful","R39X8DZ551FJVL","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Each of the books in The 'Burg series is meant to be read as a standalone but I highly recommend you read all the books in order, it makes them more enjoyable and also make the story flow better (even though KA does a masterful job of recapping with out repeating).Layne Tanner and Rocky Garrett have a past, Rocky left Tanner one day and never explained why. 18 years later Rocky's brother is investigating a dirty cop in the department, a case that Tanner was working as well until he was almost shot to death and now Rocky is determined to help, by trying to seduce the dirty cop. Tanner is not having it even if he is still pissed at Rocky and decides they should have a pretend relationship as a way to keep her safe and a way for her to find excuses to be at the station. She can get near the guy but not so near she will get hurt. Rocky reluctantly agrees.Rocky and Tanner butt heads at first then find a way to call a truce but when pretending feels real. emotions start to surface and feeling get hurt, can you still call it pretending?I liked Rocky, she is sad and it shows all the time, even when she tries to hide it. Tanner who knows her better than anyone else in the world can feel it like a heavy blanket and he is determined to find out what it is and help her fight it.“It’s not fake is it?” Jasper asked softly and Layne studied his son thinking he had vastly underestimated Jasper too.“It was, Jas, it isn’t anymore.” Jasper nodded. Layne continued. “She doesn’t know that yet, though.”Jasper stared at him then his mouth twitched before, very slowly, it spread into a smile.”Who knew a small 'burg could be so full of crime, especially crime as evil as the one being perputrated in Brownsburg, Indiana?The secondary cast of characters play a huge role in this book. There is Gabby the awful ex wife, Jarrod the cheating ex husband, Ryker the crazy yet likable sideckick, not to mention Dev the nutty ex CIA agent that is Tanners mentor and Tanners mother who hates Rocky with a firey passion. Tanner teenage sons play a huge role in this story because the crimes being commited are against children.With much going on in this book its a wonder that Rocky and Tanner actually get together. Sit back, buckle up and hang on tight because this book is crazy from the prologue to the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9S1JMGP0QBET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AU8KM0#wasThisHelpful","R9S1JMGP0QBET","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review.  I haven't met a Winter Renshaw book that I haven't fallen in love with. She has quickly become one of my go to authors.  Arrogant Bastard is a bit of a departure from her other books and I think that is a sign of what a truly talented writer Winter Renshaw is.  Jensen has to leave his father's house after he is caught in a compromising situation. He goes to live with his mother who he hasn't seen in years. She is married to Mark and he has two other wives in addition to her. They have a little community of sorts with the children from the three different sister wives.  They live a very private and religious existence. There are rules that have to be followed for just about anything you can imagine. When Jensen meets his mother's new family he is introduced to his stepsister Waverly. They are not related by blood, only through marriage and they become good friends. Jensen begins to loosen up Waverly's uptight ways and show her how to enjoy life and in the process they end up falling for each other but it's unacceptable for them to be together.  I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait for the next one in the series.

"I've read all of D. Kelly's books and her Acceptance Series is one of my all time favorites. #TeamDanielforever! D. is one of those authors that I just one-click without even reading the free sample chapters, because her writing is so consistently great.  Cassidy is a woman that has had a very troubled childhood and as a result, she has a hard time accepting love and trusting people. She is full of insecurities and feels unworthy of her fiancé Zack's love. Zack is a total sweetheart and has been in love with Cassidy since they met when they were just kids.  On the day they were supposed to be married, Cassidy panics and runs out on Zack. There is some drama with a family member that plays a part in all this and it's the last thing an already insecure, Cassidy needs. Zack immediately goes after her. He has to somehow make her realize how much he loves her and always will.  This book is a sweet love story, but the steam factor is still there. In spite of the drama of her running out on their wedding, this book is fairly low angst. It's a nice departure from the typical bad boy books, to read about a genuinely nice guy that loves his woman and isn't afraid to show it.  Chasing Cassidy is a great summer read and I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to whatever D. Kelly has in the works. I'm giving Chasing Cassidy five stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PYUH94ZKSAZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012MFM742#wasThisHelpful","R3PYUH94ZKSAZ2","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WOW!  The old quote about you can't go home rings true for Scout! From everything I've read, this book was written before to Kill A Mockingbird, but was rejected by the publisher.  I think I know why.This book finds Jean Louise a.k.a  Scout, all grown up and returning home from New York. Things in Maycomb, Alabama have changed. Jean Louise no longer see things through the eyes of Scout. She's finally able to see injustice's that were going on around her.Jean Louise narrates this book in her present tense, and as memories as Scout.  This is very witty and it is like a walk through old Alabama.  I found it to be a delightful and sort of disturbing.  Disturbing?  I think we are all fortunate to live in this era, where people are treated equally.  The sins of our past really bothers me, all of our prejudices and down right hate.This book was written in the 1950's, I think one of the reasons it was rejected, is because at that time it would have been very controversial. Harper Lee was very insightful and I feel she was well before her time.I think it's time to read to Kill A Mockingbird again.Harper Lee receives 5 stars in my book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIDX10S020DB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3DNKIE#wasThisHelpful","R2AIDX10S020DB","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Broken Juliet by Leisa Rayven is squeal to Bad Romeo.  I enjoyed this book but it was so close to rehash of Bad Romeo, it was hard to tell a distinct difference.  Rayven set the bar so high with Bad Romeo, and Broken Juliet was a really good book. I hate to say this and I know it's not the popular opinion, but I was a little disappointed.Broken Juliet is from Cassie POV again. Since Bad Romeo ended in a cliffhanger, we all really wanted to know wht was going to happen. What did we get?  We really didn't get anything new, a few mind blowing scenes of whoopie. This book was really slow but so witty that it still kept my pages turning.I give Broken Juliet 3 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVS8JD5QDGMN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O79HOGI#wasThisHelpful","RVS8JD5QDGMN6","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"River Savage writes another gripping story, this time it is of a real affliction that affects many military veterans, PTSD. I don't know much on the subject but what was written in the pages of Desertion has made me feel that is time I learned a bit more.Jesse meets innocent nurse Bell in Incandescent and again she has an encounter with him in Affliction. She becomes an object of fascination (because she does not fall for his charming ways) He tries to win her over with his lame pickup lines but Bell is not interested in a player like Jesse, no matter how hot she may think he is. She has not time for him or men in general.Jesse hides behind his easy going facade because he doesn’t want people to see the real him. He lets people see what he wants them to see, no more no less.Bell is stuck in situation that suffocating her even if she does not see it because she is busy taking care of those around her that she fails to see her life for what it is, existing.Bell decides to ask Jesse for help with a situation she has she goes to a club party and seeks him out. When a drunken Jesse takes a woman back to his room for a little fun he is completely thrown that it turns out to be his very own object of desire.I cannot say much more without giving away the good stuff but these two both have demons that they must overcome. In true River Savage form she takes you on this journey as Bell and Jesse fight these demons and try to survive and come out the other side together.I'm not going to lie at first I did not really like Bell, she was too innocent and bit of a woman child. But thankfully she starts to take control and she grows up and I grew to actually like her until I didn't, again. She is not Kadence. But she has her moments and in the end she was somewhat likable.Jesse on the other hand, I loved until I wanted to slap him silly, shake him, or possibly punch him in the face. Then I wanted to hug him and kiss him and soothe all his pain away.I would have given this story five stars and usually a River book does that for me BUT there were a few drawbacks to this one. But thanks to Ms. Savages ability to make you feel right along with her characters I only deducted half a star despite its flaws. My reasons for my hald star deduction are:1)Bell's friends, I mean really, these girls are a bunch of enablers. Cowing to Bell's situation and never really pushing her to be herself and not someone she thought she should be. The only SANE female that Bell knows before the club is her sister, AVA. She tells it like it is.2)Then there is the whole Jesse hooking up with another girl after hitting on Bell. I mean seriously, come on.3) Jesse and Bell's first time (I will say NO MORE)So to sum it up:This installment of the Knights Rebels is an emotional roller coaster that makes you want to put your hands in the air, screaming but at the same time hold on for dear life (still screaming of course). So grab your tissues, your alcoholic beverage of choice and hang on for another thrilling ride with The Knights Rebels.****ARC RECIEVED IN RETURN FOR HONEST REVIEW*****","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITRMRN4724RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3GI5MC#wasThisHelpful","RITRMRN4724RE","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who knew getting  a flat tire could change your life? When the Joker pulls off the road to help a woman and her baby with a flat tire he did not realize it was none other than the object of his high school affection Carissa Teodoro.  Carissa finds something vaguely familiar about her motorcycle riding knight in shining armor but with the long hair, sunglasses and facial hair she cannot be sure. With an offer to help her out further with her automobile needs and without telling Carissa his true identity,  Carson “Joker” Steele gives her his  business card with his numbers.Although Carissa makes a snap judgement about all bikers she finds she is immediately wrong about this one especially. Taking up the offer of fixing her tire she takes her car to the Ride and decides to take Joker a thank you as well.  Carissa does not take charity.  She does not want to owe anyone, anything. So begins a battle of wills when she gets the royal treatment on her junker car.The attraction between Joker and Carissa is instant but it also stems back to high school. Even if Carissa does not know it yet. What will she think and do when she finds out the enigmatic Joker is her high school crush Carson Steele. Will Joker be able to hold on to the girl he has loved since he was a teenager?Ride Steady is the best in the Chaos series so far. The writing and character dialogue was realistic and entertaining.  There were moments in the book that had me laughing and also others that made me cry (the prologue was tear jerker). Kristen Ashley has outdone herself and proven she can write pretty much any genre with ease. The story is told from many points of view including Tack the Prez of The Chaos MC and Carissa’s ex-husband (yeah we endure that jerks mind for a spell).Ride Steady is an entertaining and enjoyable ride that I would highly recommend to romance readers and MC lovers alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123F9IX0790G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145553322X#wasThisHelpful","R123F9IX0790G1","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.Since this was the first Sierra Simone book I've read, I wasn't sure what this book was going to be like going in to it. The cover is very appealing and sexy so that made me hopeful, that the writing would be also. As soon as I began reading,  I was immediately drawn in to the storyline by Father Bell and Poppy's attraction to each other. Talk about some serious steam factor. Sierra was able to create such amazing sexual tension between them. It really kept me on the edge of my seat. Sierra's writing is really good so even if you find the subject matter a bit distasteful, it's still worth reading. For me, the fact that he was a priest didn't bother me at all.

"I'm always excited when I find out about an author that is new to me. In this case Jax Newman is also ,new to the self publishing world, with Fade to Black being her debut novel. This book doesn't read as if a new author wrote it though. The story is interesting and well thought out. She has created interesting, likeable characters that I want to know more about. I loved Tristan and Freya and how they met was nice and original. Jax infused this story with lots of humor. The clever banter between Tristan and Freya had me laughing out loud. I'm looking forward to the next book in this series and getting to know these characters even more!I'm giving Fade to Black 4 stars and looking forward to more from Jax!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOI8XTWQPYSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCOZSS4#wasThisHelpful","R2SOI8XTWQPYSB","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Robyn Roze's since I first read Chain of Title last year. I enjoyed it so much I immediately followed it up by reading The Keeper Series which was also amazing. When I found out about the release of HELLKAT, I was ecstatic and I have to say it definitely lived up to my high expectations for it.Kat James comes from a wealthy family, but she has distanced herself from most of them. She enjoys life on her terms until she meets cowboy, Tucker Williams in a hotel bar and that's when things get start to get really interesting. The two of them have some serious chemistry and at times, I thought they were going to burn my tablet up! At first there's a lot of banter between the two of them, which I really enjoyed and Kat does her best to stay away from Tucker but to no avail. Robyn even included some mystery in the storyline and it makes for a lot of excitement and tension.I can't wait to see what Robyn comes up with next. I love reading her books but I'm always a little sad when I finish one because her writing is so good I want it to go on and on.....Robyn writes intelligently and seamlessly. Her words have a beautiful flow to them. I often find myself re-reading sentences just to savor the way she strings the words together. She has a true talent for writing and in my humble opinion it's only a matter of time before she becomes a household name in the book world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBCU2PZNMLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZB80IYE#wasThisHelpful","R3TBCU2PZNMLN","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Something's Gotta Give by Maggie Adams is the perfect mix quick whit and steam. It is the third installment in the Tempered Steel Series. I love this series and this book was a great installment.Chance is a charmer, and he charmed his way into my heart in Leather and Lace. He continued to make me swoon in Something's Gotta Give.You can't but root for Chance, he is so sweet, and there is defiantly great chemistry between him and Georgia. The Coalson family's saga continued and I think we are getting closer to culprit to their problems.Georgia thinks she can resist Chance but who is she kidding? Who can resist any of these men? Where can we all find one? They are great to their ladies in more ways than one!Adams has a knack to keep you turning her pagers and you wanting more of the Coalson men.

"I thought that Cassia Brightmore‘s debut novel Malevolent was twisted but with the release of Evanesce, I can see she has delved even further into the darkness this time around.  I cannot believe the stuff that comes out of her head.Evanesce centers around the small town in Texas that has seen a rash of disappearing women and infants.  No women or infants are safe. The local PD is stumped.There are two stories that run parallel, one being told of goings on in the house of horrors and the other being the second chance love story between Nora and Gabe.Evanesce tells you the story from a third person POV so that you get a good idea what is going through the mind of every player on this warped chess board. Even more frightening is that you want to know what they are thinking, even the villain's head is a place you want to poke around in. The reader is taken through every emotion of these characters. They hurt, you hurt. They cry, you cry. And hurt and cry you will.Cassia serves up a mixture of dark and twisted with a bit of sexy.Be prepared for your mind to be blown!*** I was gifted this ARC in exchange for a honest review****","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYLQZM3VSOHJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFOQ5GM#wasThisHelpful","RYLQZM3VSOHJ6","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fire inside is an emotional journey that required lots of tissue and wine.Lanie has had it rough since she was eleven years old and the world as she knew it was shattered.

"I am completely enamored with Jackson Steele, The man is sex on a stick and he is tall dark and dangerous. This story answers so many questions like Sylvia's relationship with her father, Jackson's link to Megan and Ronnie and so much more. But like any great book it leaves you wanting more.J. Kenner spins a story of secrets and demons into a story of love enduring. I love that even though Sylvia is damaged she can see the error of her ways when she is being unreasonable about something, Jackson too, can admit he is wrong when it is necessary and these two come together and act like adults and work together to figure it out. The growth as couple is amazing and I am eating it up. Then ending had me practically screaming at the author because I cannot believe the curve ball that was thrown and now has set up the mystery for the next book.Bravo to J. Kenner for incorporating not only Jackson and Sylvia into the Stark world but keeping our favorite couple involved in a completely natural way.I just might die from anticipation because the next book is not slatted to release until September but I will endure","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTPPC12HUTOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O6V45CS#wasThisHelpful","RYTPPC12HUTOI","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I was gifted a copy of this book for an honest review.Be careful what you wish for. Ace White wanted to be a star and now he is. But being the lead singer in a put together band isn't exactly what he wanted. He has no control over his song choices, no real friends, and even his band doesn't like him. This isn't because he's arrogant or on drugs - it's because doesn't play up to everyone's fake lifestyle. When he disappears and changes his appearance, he feels free.It's hard to believe that someone would want to give up a life of luxury to live in a trailer park, which is why it is the perfect place for him to hide. And then he meets Iris. I loved seeing this couple together. After being around so many people who used him, he was unprepared for someone who just wanted to be nice to someone.I enjoyed this new read from Michelle Valentine. This was not the typical rough rock band story that I'm used to reading from her. In some ways it was almost too sweet, which is not a bad thing. The one thing that I would like to see with the next installment in this series, is more interaction on the band dynamics and how this relationship will affect the other members - will it bring them together or bring out the reasons they all don't get along.  I'm giving Michelle Valentine's Wicked White - 4.5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6I1GXY6D19PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STR28PQ#wasThisHelpful","R6I1GXY6D19PW","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book picks up after Motorcycle Man of the Dream Man series, you do not have to read Motorcycle man but it is highly recommended...We met Tabby and Shy in the Motorcycle Man when Tabby was just 16 years old and a very troubled young girl. Shy was kinda in the background but he was present. Fast forward a few years...Parker ""Shy"" Cage is a man-whore biker that is loyal to the Chaos MC. He takes their motto of Living Free to new heights.  He loves his blood brother and his MC brothers. He respects his MC president and would never do anything to betray that trust until he falls for his only daughter Tabby.Tabitha ""Tabby"" Allen is the only daughter of the Chaos MC President Tack Allen. She was wild in her youth but now is a nurse that is healing from a personal tragedy. Making amends with Shy after years of estrangement from him because of an incident when she was just 19, Shy and Tabby become great friends. Tabby denies that she can have feelings for Shy because she is not in the head space for such a thing. Until she realizes that Shy is not waiting in the wings for her. When confronted with him and his girlfriend she freaks and decides to skip town. Needless to say when Shy finds out she is leaving he FREAKS out! They have a heart to heart and decide they want to be together. But will the Chaos MC accept this relationship, especially with Tabby's not so distant loss  and Shy's reputation? Can Tack take the news like a father and the President of the Chaos in stride? These are just some of the huddles these two will have to endure to be together.The story of Tabby and Shy was good, really good. I was engaged from the prologue. I was unsure that I was going to really care about yet another MC book but KA totally had me wanting more. You really end up caring about Shy and his own demons on top of poor Tabby and the crap she had to put up with from her crazy mom. There is action in the secondary plot that includes KA's other resident hot guys, such as Lee Nightingale, Hawk, Lawson and Brock! So that in itself is a win-win!Highly recommend this read to those that enjoyed the Dream Man series especially Motorcycle Man.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27D2MOU2LC0UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMIL9C8#wasThisHelpful","R27D2MOU2LC0UC","A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23ZLQSV5Y0MQD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm very impressed with the amount of light this little desk lamp provides.  It's a very minimalist design so it fits into most any décor and takes up so little space.  The adjustable 'neck' of the lamp lets you move the light closer or further away or turn it facing up down or sideways.  The added slot for a phone and a usb charging port make it the perfect desk accessory.  This would be the perfect desk lamp for a college student or anyone with limited desk space.  For its size, it produces as much light as you could want. Another feature that I like is that it's sturdy.  It's not one of those cheap lightweight lamps that you can knock over with just a touch.  The base is heavy and sturdy.  I really can't say enough good things about this product.  It has a permanent place on my home desk and I use it every day.  My phone sits and charges as I work.

"For fans of cherries, this is a delicious snack bar.  It has basic simple ingredients and is compatible with the Zone Diet if you're into that.  I love the flavor and the crunch.  It's chock full of cherries and almonds and has tiny bits of dark chocolate as well.  It really satisfies me when I'm having a craving for something sweet.  They're only 180 calories but do pack 8 grams of fat mostly from the almonds.  It also has 10 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber.  Overall much better for you than a candy bar.  They're great to throw in your purse or pack to have on hand when you need a snack.  My daughter likes to take them in her lunch bag and my husband packed a few for his hiking trip.  If you're not a fan of cherries, then skip this one because it is intensely cherry flavored.

"This is my second set of Bird's Eye View window film and I love both of them.  I put these on some small windows near my front door.  They fit perfectly and look really nice.  Not only do they keep the pesky bluebird from knocking his head on the window, they also provide a bit more privacy.  They couldn't be simpler to install.  You just clean your window, then spray it with water and place the sticker where you want it.  I used a credit card to press out the air bubbles and a few minutes later the window is dry and the sticker is set.  Since installing these on my back door and front window, the bluebird has been staying away and I feel like I've had pretty etched glass installed.

"Ubersleep works well for me.  Taking melatonin usually gives me crazy dreams but for whatever reason this blended formula gets me to sleep without any nightmares and I sleep for at least 4-5 hours which is pretty good for me.  The capsules are a little large and they do have the distinct Valerian smell that is a little unpleasant but as long as they work I don't care.  I take it about an hour before I will be going to bed and I start feeling drowsy within 30-45 minutes.  As a long time insomniac, it's nice to find products that work without any strange side effects and Ubersleep does just that for me.  It's a great alternative to prescription products.

My daughter even resorted to soaping the window but nothing deterred him.  After installing these eye catching little window films, the bird hasn't been back.  And, I have to say that I really like the way that they look on the door.  It's really pretty especially when the sun hits it just right.

"I was very impressed with this novel by Julia Heaberlin.  The story is unique and well told.  The suspense builds slowly as Tess relates the story of her life.  As a teenager, she was a track star and her life seemed full of promise.  That all changed when she woke up in the middle of a field surrounded by dead bodies and bones.  As a grown woman, she has to confront some choices she made after surviving the threat on her life as well as try to discover whether the murderer has been leaving clues for her find.

"Finders Keepers is even better than Mr. Mercedes.  The whole story is a continuation of Mr. Mercedes but it is also a ripping good yarn that stands alone.  The novel begins as a reclusive elderly author faces down three masked thugs in a home invasion. After all his unpublished work and squirreled away money are stolen, the story follows two timelines.  Morris Bellamy, the thief, tells the immediate aftermath of the robbery and what becomes of the loot.  In a future timeline, a teenage boy, Pete Saubers, stumbles across the loot at a time when his family is desperate for money. His father is injured as a result of the Mercedes Killer's spree and unable to work.  What becomes of each of these people and the stolen money and manuscripts is what comprises the rest of the novel.  It is at this point that the characters from Mr. Mercedes show up.  Hodges, the retired detective, and Brady, the psychopath, make appearances along with Holly and Jerome.  The thrilling conclusion pits Morris against Pete with Hodges et al racing to intervene before it's too late.  The cliffhanger ending is one that left me in open mouthed astonishment.

"My beagle is obsessed with her new toy.  As soon as we received it in the mail, she began sniffing the package and it's been by her side ever since.  She keeps it in her doggie bed.

"I've never been much of an eyelash curling girl.  I mostly just go with a touch of mascara but as I've gotten older, the eyelashes seem to be disappearing.  I have been using this item and have been impressed with how much more volume and length my lashes seem to have when I use it first before applying mascara.  The little gel pad on the curler makes it very comfortable, no pulling or pinching while using it.  Even a very uncoordinated and terribly nearsighted person like me can use it easily.  My daughter has taken to using this one over the one that she has because she says it works better.  The Georgie Beauty Lash Curler is working well for us Georgia Beauties.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGLVZ70RDCKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOZ3FBK#wasThisHelpful","R3VGLVZ70RDCKA","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always end up throwing away at least a portion of the produce that I buy because it spoils before we can finish it so I was excited to try this GreenSaver produce keeper.  It works amazingly well.  It's the perfect size for berries so I put a basket of strawberries in it after reading the directions.  Different types of produce require you to adjust the lid to accommodate individual differences.  I put the basket of strawberries into the container and deliberately left half of them for a full week just to see what would happen.  Usually they would be at least half mushy and spoiled.  Upon opening the GreenSaver, I was amazed to find that they were all still fresh.  The taste was perfect.  I was sold.  This little gem has been in continuous use ever since.  I am also buying other sizes for all my produce.  They are perfect for stacking in the refrigerator and honestly will pay for themselves in a short period of time from the money you don't throw away in spoiled produce.  I am recommending this one to friends and family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49K9V7IW6Z3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TO8X0EC#wasThisHelpful","R49K9V7IW6Z3B","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate applying sunscreen.  It's messy and time consuming and you end up feeling a bit like a greased pig by the time you're done.  Last year, we opted for the spray on sunscreen which is easy to apply but still leaves you feeling sticky and then washes off much too quickly.  So, I certainly was skeptical that this product could do all that it claims.  I have to admit that I was wrong.  It actually does go on very quickly and absorbs easily.  A little goes a long way.  It doesn't make your skin feel icky or look shiny or white coated.  It doesn't particularly feel cool but I guess if you are out in the sun it might be different.  We were outside all day at a charity fun run and didn't get burned at all.  Also, an added bonus for me, there's no bothersome fragrance to have to contend with.  Quite simply, it does what it claims.

"This one had me right up until the very end and then it sort of swerved off course a bit.  Robert McCammon, the author of Swan Song, does not disappoint with his storytelling abilities.  You are grabbed on page one by the plight of a boy caught in the middle of a battle between two alien races.  He can't remember who he is or what has happened to him.  Through his eyes you learn about the power that the technologically superior aliens have.  The boy eventually joins with another group of human survivors and in their struggles he begins to understand that he is much more than ordinary.  He may be the answer that humanity has been searching for to finally win back the earth.  If you enjoy books like War of the Worlds or The Stand, you should enjoy this latest addition to the post apocalyptic genre.  My only issue with the book was that for all the momentum it had through 75% of the story, it sort of loses speed near the end.  Some of the solutions that are presented just seem a bit too cliché, like a B movie ending.  Overall, the book was quite good and I'd recommend it for fans of the genre or for fans of Mr. McCammon.  If you enjoyed Swan Song, this one will be right up your alley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMFN3HWP254LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596067039#wasThisHelpful","RMFN3HWP254LZ","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm a fan of post apocalyptic fiction and I was also a fan of Mr. Percy's last book so this seemed like a perfect novel for me.  The premise is interesting, a retelling of the Lewis and Clark story but set in the distant future where plagues and radiation have ravaged the planet.  People live in a walled city that was once St. Louis.  Life is harsh.  One day a woman arrives to tell them of a western paradise where life is thriving but she also warns of danger on the horizon.  The novel has its interesting moments.  It also has stretches that were just a bit too monotonous and predictable.  It took me a while to get through the book which isn't really long but I would get to one of the less interesting parts and just set it aside for awhile.  I do enjoy the way that this author introduces a historical event with a completely different perspective.  He did something similar in 'Red Moon' and it worked well.  In 'Dead Lands', it wasn't quite as successful.  Still, if you're a fan of post apocalyptic fiction, it's worth a read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROHH9R9YDRW97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455528242#wasThisHelpful","ROHH9R9YDRW97","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am truly in love with this moisturizer.  I have recently noticed the telltale signs of aging on my face, a few tiny crinkles near my eyes, some dark spots, some dryness.  I've never been into using a lot of products on my face.  I usually wash, apply a light moisturizer, maybe some powder and mascara if I'm going to work, etc.  I knew that I needed to start putting more attention into taking care of my skin, especially because of my age.  I just hate the way most of the creams for 'mature skin' feel.  They're usually greasy and heavy.  I end up feeling it on my skin all day or all night and I hate it.  Olay Featherweight Moisturizer is completely different.  It goes on like silk and absorbs quickly and it doesn't feel like anything.  I've seen an improvement in the dryness and texture of my skin.  It looks brighter.  I'm impressed.  I also love that the moisturizer contains sunscreen.  I neglect using that too often and it's nice not to have to think about it.

"I stumbled across this series on a video streaming service that I subscribe to.  I was sick with the flu and just trying to pass the time while I felt miserable.  After the first episode, I was completely hooked and ended up watching series 1 and series 2 over the next couple of days.  The whole show is just completely amazing.  Gillian Anderson especially gives a stand out performance as Stella Gibson, the lead detective on the case of a series of strangulation murders in Belfast.  There is an interweaving of plots featuring a number of the characters but it all eventually ties back in to the one being handled by DCIS Gibson.  To see the portrayal of a woman as strong, intelligent, independent and sexy all at the same time is quite rare but Ms. Anderson pulls it off easily.  At one point one of the other detectives asks her, ""Do you realize the effect that you have on men?""  She is unapologetically in charge of the investigation and has no problem with putting anyone, even her superiors, in their place when the need arises.  Jamie Dornan (of Fifty Shades of Grey) plays the serial killer and he is completely believable as the loving father/husband who secretly stalks and then murders women before returning home to bathe his kids and put them to bed.  He is both a man and a monster.  Every single character on the show is done with such authenticity and attention to detail that you get completely lost in the story.  Series 2 has a cliffhanger ending so I'm hoping that means a season 3 will be forthcoming.  Fingers crossed.  Honestly, though, if you enjoy shows like Criminal Minds, True Detective or Law and Order, this is a must see.  This is not a show for the kids, however, as it features sexual violence, nudity, and profanity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL855HUNDUXRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DW5IKN4#wasThisHelpful","RL855HUNDUXRQ","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not the kind of book I would typically pick up to read but the description sounded so interesting.  A young boy is born and immediately ostracized by his mother due to the lightness of his skin.  He grows up terribly neglected and only after he's older and escapes does he get adopted by a caring father in America.  The novel is inventive certainly but almost too far out at least for me.  They boy's inner life and dreams are told in an almost psychedelic trippy style that just didn't work for me.  As the book progressed, I sort of got lost.  The plot gets a little convoluted and at some points almost contrived.  I can see that other people disagree with my thoughts due to the high ratings the book has already gotten and I'm sure this is just a matter of personal preference.  If you're into very fantastical stories, this might resonate more profoundly for you than it did for me.

"Our vet recommended we try Natural Balance limited ingredient for our dog that was experiencing a recurrent skin rash.  It's kind of pricey in the vet's office so it was nice to find it on Amazon.  Our dog immediately loved it.  She was sniffing around the bag before I even opened it.  The dry food is disc shaped about the size of a dime.  She's a beagle/terrier mix so on the small side and it wasn't difficult for her to chew. She's done beautifully on the food and is no longer experiencing a problem with her skin.  I researched the brand just a bit and find that overall it's a good choice for dry dog food.  Depending on the type of Natural Balance you buy it can contain chicken byproducts which isn't great but better than the grocery store brands that are almost all corn.  If you can afford a little bit pricier food or if you pet has special dietary needs, Natural Balance is a good alternative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CF5IOIDKCCWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JS1J9JU#wasThisHelpful","R2CF5IOIDKCCWX","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We had been suffering with a wireless router of a different type for years.  The signal was always weak and we had to restart it at least a few times each week even when there was no power outage.  Our devices would just lose the signal.  Since we installed this TP-Link router, our WiFi reception has been so much better throughout all areas of our house.  We haven't had to restart it even once since it was installed.  Setting it up was very easy even for a non tech savvy person like myself.  I just followed the instructions and it was done within 15 minutes or so, easy breezy.  I can't speak about any of the technical details related to how this item works and honestly it doesn't really matter to me.  All I care about is that it does what it's supposed to do without causing me a lot of grief.  This item does that exactly.  I have recommended it to a couple of family members and coworkers who have similar issues with their home WiFi.  Another nice thing about this model is the price.  It's one of the least expensive wireless routers and it works well.  That's always a winning combination.  If you are a typical home computer user like myself who uses Wifi to access email, social media and Netflix, this will fit the bill for your needs.

"I just got an Xbox One console for Christmas.  It came with Watch Dogs game which was a major disappointment.  I traded it in and got Dead Rising 3 which absolutely blew me away.  I played Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 on Xbox 360 and they were okay games.  This one is so much better.  It's not just the graphics although they are like 100% improved. I really enjoy getting into the Story or Campaign mode of games and playing through all the challenges.  I'm not really into co-op gaming much at all.  DR3 has a very good story with lots of little side missions to keep things interesting along the way.  The game gets progressively harder the longer you play.  By the last campaign, it's wall to wall zombies almost everywhere but by that time you have a lot of cool weapon combos that help even the odds along with a variety of vehicles and combo vehicles that are completely cool.  I really love this game and would recommend it with one caveat.  Their is language and some sexual references that definitely are not appropriate for younger players.

"Like most people, I have dry skin in the winter.  My usual recourse is to use a moisturizing lotion after showering.  It takes a couple of extra minutes but it's worth it.  The idea of being able to get this all done while still in the shower sounded like a win-win.  It didn't quite work out that way.  The lotion itself is rather thin and watery.  It tends to come out of the bottle really fast and goes everywhere if you're not careful. It does smell rather nice and leaves a silky feeling behind almost like you've used a fine talcum powder.  If you don't have a large shower (I don't), your best bet is to just turn the water off for a bit to get this rubbed on your skin.  Otherwise, it's washed away as soon as you swipe it on.  That's a problem for me because when I turn the water back on, I either get a blast of super hot water or a blast of icy cold water (weird pipes).  After rinsing the lotion off, I step out of the shower and dry off.  My skin does feel smooth and soft, like I've used a  body lotion.  The problem is that now the shower is all slippery with the lotion that was just washed off of me.  So, I have to grab a cloth of some kind and wipe the floor of the shower off enough that I don't go skating across the bathroom the next time I decide to shower.Given the option of having to wipe down the shower after each use or simply swiping on some lotion after showering, I think I choose the latter.  It's easier and takes less time plus I feel it gives me more moisurization.  If you have extremely dry skin and need more than just body lotion, this might be something you'd want to try in addition to whatever you currently use.  The scent is very light and did not cause any problems for me and I'm usually very sensitive to any type of fragrance but it is not unscented so that may be a consideration for some people.  I guess overall my impression is that this is a bit of a waste of space in my bathroom.

"If you're looking for the right filtered water bottle to carry around in your car or to the gym, this one fits the bill.  It's slightly larger than the plastic water bottles you buy but not so big that it's cumbersome.  It couldn't be simpler to use.  Just fill the bottle, put the cap on and drink.  Water is filtered as it travels from the bottle into the spout.  It removes the majority of impurities and water definitely tastes better after filtering.  There is a no slip area around the middle of the bottle which is nice afer you've been working out and have sweaty hands.  The only drawback, which I've found is universal with these type bottles, is the amount of suction required to get a really good sized gulp of water.  You have to kind of squeeze the bottle and suck at the same time.  Then there's the wheeze of air returning to the bottle when you stop.  Normally not a big deal but I carry one of these with me everywhere and in a quiet place it's noticeable. My favorite part of this bottle, though, is the size and shape.  A lot of filtered water bottles are just too large and clunky to carry around.  This one is small and sleek enough that it's not a problem. Overall, I've been very pleased with the Bobble bottle and will probably order at least one more of this type.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSEIWUL38U3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2SPF9M#wasThisHelpful","R1BSEIWUL38U3Z","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Laurie King's novels of the continuing life of Sherlock Holmes and Mary Russell.  The plots, locales and mysteries are always intriguing and keep me turning pages until the end.  This novel is perhaps the best of the series in my opinion.  Mary and Sherlock are finally returning home after time spent in India.  Their exploits in India were covered in the two books previous to this one in the series.  On the boat home, they meet a young woman who needs their help to protect a prince and reclaim a book of secrets.  This is a true gem of a story with authenticity of period and place.  The writing is no less than superb.  I love these stories partly because they harken back to the works of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle who have been favorites of mine since grade school.  If you haven't read any of Ms. King's previous Mary/Sherlock books, you will still enjoy this book.  It can stand alone as a mystery but it is so much better if you've gotten to know all the players and history from the previous books in the series.  I think I'll be giving this novel to a few friends as a Christmas gift.  Any mystery lover would enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CR4XVPJMKZFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345531795#wasThisHelpful","R3CR4XVPJMKZFY","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nivea is a trusted name in my family for products that are good for your skin.  This lovely gift set of body wash, lotion and lip balm comes in a nice blue and white reusable round metal tin.  The products all work well to hydrate and smooth skin and are not highly fragranced which is important to me.  I especially love the lotion.  My hands get so dry in winter and this now sits on my bedside table so that I can use it nightly on hands and elbows.  My skin is so much softer and doesn't have that dry, tight feeling that I usually get in winter. The body wash lathers well and leaves your skin feeling sort of dewy after showering.  The lip balm glides on smoothly and evenly and I like the sort of chunky tube it's in which makes it easier to find in my purse. This would make a great gift for a teacher, coworker or family member.  I plan on buying a couple more myself to give to my mother-in-law and a couple of coworkers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24A4FVUTV8FJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N75NI7W#wasThisHelpful","R24A4FVUTV8FJX","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed the Blueberry Almond Fruit and Nut Toppers.  They were almost addictive.  The product is made sort of like peanut brittle and then cut into bite sized cubes.  The outside is all almond but when you bite into them, you get the sweet and tangy blueberry flavor as well.  They're called toppers but I enjoyed just eating a handfull of the little squares as a snack on their own.  I did try them on yogurt for breakfast and it tasted great, giving the yogurt a nice crunch.  I can see using them in salads because they're not overly sweet and would pair nicely with some blue cheese and spring greens.  There's really no way to go wrong with these no matter how you decide to eat them because they're yummy with anything. The ingredients are all natural so you can feel good about giving your family a healthy treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WKNAJ4GJ0LAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SL2OQK#wasThisHelpful","R2WKNAJ4GJ0LAJ","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt of Stephen King's brilliance.  I read everything he writes and usually have it preordered for months in advance as I did this novel.  The story is intriguing.  It's about the relationship between a man and the pastor he knew as a young boy at several different points during their lifetimes.  The minister is obsessed with electricity and using it to heal people.  His first such experiment is witnessed by young Jaime Morton as it helps his older brother regain his voice after an accident.  Charles Jacobs, the pastor, turns away from religion after a tragic occurrence but he and Jamie meet each other again about 15 years later and this time Jamie is the one who needs his help.  Jacobs has by that time expanded the scope of his experiments and his fascination with the power behind it.  Jamie discovers how remarkable this can be but what is the cost for such a miraculous invention?  It is only after another 20 years or so when Jamie discovers that his old friend is now in the tent revival healing business that he begins to delve into what ""the Rev"" is doing and how it is affecting those he ""heals"".I really enjoyed the novel right up until the very last chapter or so and then it simply lost me completely.  It's an ending that just leaves you feeling hopeless and depressed. It's scary in a sort of 1980's B movie style but mostly I just sat there thinking ""this is it?  this is how it's going to end?"".  I was hoping there'd be some little something maybe even in the last sentence that would leave this faithful reader with just a shred of hope or closure but that didn't happen.  It's disappointing in a major way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251BKFTKKUTMS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476770387#wasThisHelpful","R251BKFTKKUTMS","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We just got laminate flooring in our bedroom and I needed an area rug.  The beautiful color and pattern in this one looked ot be the perfect fit.  It is lovely and one of the softest rugs I've ever felt.  I was so excited when I first opened it.  There are, however, a couple of problems with it.  First, the ends want to roll up no matter what I use under the rug.  Short of taping it to the floor, there doesn't seem to be any way to get the rug to lay completely flat.  I'm not sure if that's because it was rolled during shipment or if that's just the way this rug is.  We've tried putting heavy items on the ends and leaving them for a day, using one of the foam mats underneath to hold it down and even rolling it the opposite way and leaving it for a day.  Nothing has improved it.  I worry that I'm going to trip over it. Granted, laminate has a very slippery surface so it might work better on top of carpet or vinyl tile. Secondly, the fibers are always coming loose.  I thought it was just because the rug was new and it would stop after a few days, but every day I seem to find more fibers poking up or coming loose. I worry what this is going to do to the integrity of the carpet after a while.  As pretty as this rug is, I simply can't recommend it unless you are planning on putting it someplace that is a ""no traffic"" area.  If you need a rug that can withstand actual use, it would probably be wiser to invest in something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AONT2WGIUFFN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A2CQBFO#wasThisHelpful","R3AONT2WGIUFFN","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gets one star from me not because it's not well written or informative. It is both of those things. I simply found it to be very dry to the point of being boring.  I understand that this is not a novel but I did expect it to be a bit more salacious given the description of the book.  Being not of the Catholic faith, I also found it rather difficult to follow all the terms and titles that were used.  To be quite honest, I only made it approximately half way through the book before finally throwing in the towel.  Trying to keep up with all the people involved and the different investigations and reports ended up being like taking some type of class rather than enjoying a book for me.  I don't usually review books if I haven't finished them but I wanted to let others know what they are in for if they buy this book.The book details the ""scandal"" that happened at an Italian convent in the 19th century which does involve attempted murder, heresy and lesbian affairs.  That does not, however, mean that the book is scandalous in nature.  It is written in a very dry style with direct quotes from testimony or writings of Vatican investigations or from the diaries of priests or nuns.  Not exactly the stuff a scintillating story.Again, I want to reiterate that Mr. Wolf, the author, is obviously a brilliant scholar specifically in the history of Catholicism.  This book was also originally written in German and translated into English so perhaps something was lost in translation.  At any rate, this simply wasn't what I was expecting in this book.  If you enjoy minutely detailed histories especially as they relate to the Catholic church, I'm sure this would appeal to you. If you're wanting your 'Scandal' to be a bit more like the television show, then look elsewhere.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7ZBCUWBLWU45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351909#wasThisHelpful","R7ZBCUWBLWU45","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is really a surprising value in a smart phone.  It comes with all the gear you really need to get started at no extra cost - Surprise!.  It is as thin and lightweight as an Iphone and the display and graphics look as good.  We have been extremely pleased with the performance of the phone in everything we've used it for thus far, texting, calling and gaming.  It has a camera and the one downside to this phone is that the pictures aren't great.  But, hey, I have a digital camera to use for when I want pictures.  I'm not much of a phone expert and in fact this is the first smart phone I've owned.  I'm old school when it comes to cell phones, what can I say?  My husband has an Iphone 5 though and he was amazed at what this phone can do for the price.  I can't comment on gaming abilities of the phone or technical aspects of it because I know nothing about either of those things.  What I can say is that it works beautifully for the things that I need which are calling, texting and access to email, internet.  I have not had the first problem with any of those features.  I also like the fun color of the case.  It really stands out in my purse or on my desk so I don't have to go searching for my phone amid a bunch of clutter.  Overall, I have been very pleasantly surprised by this phone and have recommended it to friends and family.  If you're looking for a good, basic smartphone that doesn't cost a fortune, you can't go wrong with this BLU Windows phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8DJQAMCP5JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQGFQ7C#wasThisHelpful","R1A8DJQAMCP5JZ","A3JXBZ8F65100O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JXBZ8F65100O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far I've read two of Julie's books and I've enjoyed them both. This Gothic-style romance was completely different from her first book. I haven't ready anything quite like this book. The writing style was very good and the plot moved along at a brisk pace. The complexity and detail shown reflects the author's creativity. The setting with its Southern culture, graveyards, and creepy secret cult also gave the story an intelligent feel. The creepy scenes and odd characters added to the story's appeal and the mysterious twists and turns in the plot held my attention. I loved the emotion, the tension, the intrigue, and the sizzling romantic elements. I also appreciated how there were several instances where I had no clue about what was going to happen next, and then the author tossed in a curve ball I never saw coming. There was nothing predictable or cliche about this novel. There was even a faith/spiritual thread in the book. And the ending was sweet with just the right amount of resolution to satisfy me as a reader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UUVRJLGFJUE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937178315#wasThisHelpful","R1UUVRJLGFJUE6","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now this was a sensational story. I didn't know if I'd like it at first, but I thought I'd give it a try. I've not read many books set in Brazil, but wow, this was a good one. There were so many double crosses, secrets, red herrings, and conflicts, there was never a dull moment. But the best part was the healing that took place in both of their hearts.So yes, there was action and suspense for people who love car chases and guns going off. Plenty of vivid details there. The way that the hero fought his emotion and at the same time wanted to see the heroine heal emotionally, well, it was very touching. And the way the heroine resisted love because of her past and fought the good emotion she felt around the hero made my heart flutter.I even got teary-eyed a few times as I experienced the emotional conflict with her. There is just something beautiful about watching a woman who was hurt and abused her entire childhood (and resigned to being treated like trash) awakening to the idea that she can be loved. Sigh. Beautiful stuff. It reminded me a bit of Redeeming Love in that respect. I highly recommend this book. Oh, and the ending was perfect.

But like anyone, nobody is all bad even if they are self-centered. You saw some of the unpleasant consequences of some of the choices she made. I also felt a bit sorry for her at times because of her husband's gambling and then sending her son away to help him get educated. I felt her mother's heart. Anyway, I would watch this movie again.

"This was a fun read and it had an interesting plot beyond the usual boy meets girl romance. I learned a bit more about New Zealand culture and lingo while enjoying the story. I saw some phrases I remember friends using from that part of the world, like, ""I'm chuffed."" Some of the equivalent terms made me smile. And the rugby players... oh my. Koti was quite a hunk, at least from what the author described.The heroine started out feeling disdain toward the hero, but it didn't feel forced. In fact, it was one of the more believable ""girl can't stand guy"" conflicts I've seen yet. She had a lot of reasons to be cautious about men. She had some wildly feminine ideals, too. I loved the emotional part of the story toward the end, like around the time they split up. I loved how the content of one of the later arguments offered Koti some insight... showing him a depth in their relationship that went beyond the superficial. The heroine made some great points that challenged him.Anyway, the story got pretty steamy at times, but the plot was interesting so it wasn't all about the steam between them. And it didn't get gross like in erotic fiction, or I wouldn't have finished it. There was actually a compelling story within this book.

I cared about the characters so much my heart ached at times. I would love to see this book in print. It's long, but very good. I enjoyed the entire ride!The story felt real to me and the characters were complex. I often got so lost in the story I forgot I was reading. The plot was emotional and compelling. My heart pounded more than a few times. And the ending... OH MY! If that doesn't make you want and jump up and shout, ""Yes!"" nothing will. Very well done!I'm a big fan of fiction written about Europe during the war anyway, and this story had just the right amount of tension, romance, and setting. I must have read upwards of fifty books or more during this time period and this was one of the better ones. There were so many compelling twists and turns in this story.

"I was on the edge of my seat and even jumped a few times when I was startled by action (mostly shooting.) This movie reminded me of a ""Bourne Identity type"" movie because of the constant chase scenes and government involvement. Only these were teenagers running from killers. I thought the actors did very well at playing their rolls as terrified young people who didn't know what to do/where to go next or who to trust and/or run from.There were some impressive self-defense moves/action that were well executed by Lautner. I liked the overall theme and the emotions that he exhibited while playing the role of someone who just found out his whole life wasn't what he'd always believed. It was kind of cool when he started to realize that all the boxing with ""dad"" was to equip him with the skills needed to defend himself if attacked, thus preparing him for the day he would be targeted.

"I found this book compulsively readable. It was sent to me by the publisher to review for my honest opinion, so here goes... It reminded me of someone talking to the reader who has ADHD. Just when you think you are tracking with the story line, it goes off on another tangent. At the same time there were so many cultural elements, foods, and interpersonal issues in the book, I couldn't help being interested. Some of the cultural stuff I got a bit lost with (like the legends related to Indian culture) but overall, I found it hard to put down.The writing was interesting, and at times beautiful. The point of view was a bit convoluted because it seemed like most of story was being told by Mina, but at the same time it was impossible for her to be some of the places with Meterling. So she was sort of an omniscient POV, but not completely. I've never read a book quite like it. Once in awhile the author slipped in Simon's point of view, too. So while it was a tad odd to follow, I got used to it soon enough. The ghost thing was exceptionally weird, but again, still interesting.Clearly this story was fiction, but I enjoyed reading it for the most part. I was never bored. Not once. Confused, maybe. But not bored. So for that, I give it four stars, but overall it was more of a three and a half star book. Three was nothing remotely Judeo-Christian about this book, but it was not offensive to me. I feel like I learned something about people from the Island of Pi in the Indian Ocean who did not like being referred to as people from India, but at the same time they were part of that culture. Kind of like people from Hawaii being American, but Polynesian at the same time. I enjoy learning about cultures I know very little about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L3BBSENBTU2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307960447#wasThisHelpful","R2L3BBSENBTU2D","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched this movie on Netflix and it started out great. Then I was hugely disappointed when I found out why ""something felt wrong"" the second time he went to England. Samantha was crazy to stick around. Then poor Simon proposes... ugh, poor guy. I felt bad for him. He had no idea. I didn't like the fact that they never really talked about what they did when they were apart after the first time (except for that one huge argument,) but I did like how it showed that the people they were with were mere substitutes for who they really loved. But after awhile even that gets troubled by the conflict that comes with being disloyal to the commitment they'd made to each other. So the unfaithfulness part of the story was a bummer, but it was different than is usually portrayed because they each knew about other people, just not the full extent of the other person's involvement. Even though some viewers hated the ending, I found it profound because you could see in their eyes the impact that their straying had on both of them. It didn't leave them unaffected. Sheesh, I'd feel bad too if I knew that I had a fill-in lover for a time when I was apart from my true love. So I liked how the realism was shown - that the thing they wanted most (to be together) was tainted by their straying on both ends. I would have been more upset if they had reunited and been super happy like neither of them had done anything to hurt someone else (and living with someone when you really love someone else is not going to make you happy unless you have no conscience.) They both had broken hearts needlessly by allowing someone to love them that they couldn't truly love back. So while the ending was tough to tie up neatly and make a true happy ending, I found it realistic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FOZQQDAX0YL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z29XEI#wasThisHelpful","R2FOZQQDAX0YL3","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a sweet love story set during the Civil War. I tend to be a sucker for war love stories. This one had a bit more gore than a like to read about, though. I have a weak stomach. All the stuff about stench and lice was realistic I'm sure, but...ew. But I did like the way the characters interacted. I appreciated how loyal people were when they had seen sacrifice for people on the either side of the war. Poor Joe was sick for what seemed like forever. I thought it was sweet how he helped Beth heal by believing in her. She had rejection issues, and because of an injury when she was younger, the man she was in love with as a youth no longer wanted her. Joe saw beauty in her that made his former southern belle seem selfish and petty. It had the typical ""wounded soldier from the other side of the war falls in love with the woman caring for him while he's feverish and at death's door"" theme, so there were no surprises. One of them had to be angry with God and the other encouraged them to let go of the hurt. I didn't see how the quilt played a part in her emotional healing. I must have missed the connection.

"I don't typically read books in this genre, though it's kind of funny that I've read two in the past month. I really enjoyed this story for a number of reasons. I think it's cool how the author used a dystopian and futuristic world to show the importance of what God created and how altering the divine order in our lives makes us a bunch of clones of each other.We all need a purpose for our lives and given the right conditions, we will all, at some point, long for something better. We all make choices that make us who we are. Without emotion and love, we have nothing. Since God is love, it all ties together. I found the way the author tied that all together quite fascinating. I would consider this a high concept novel, though the concept if firmly based in a Christian worldview.I appreciated the deep point of view used by the author to show deception and how putting our hope in something that isn't real is kind of like falling in love with our sin. In the end it leaves us feeling emptier...worse than before. I saw Dr. Loudin as not just an antagonist, but also a ""satan"" figure in that his goal is not only to get the character to believe the deception, but he was willing to not only mess with her mind and her emotions, but destroy her soul to accomplish that. Very profound stuff.And the way the biblical truths were presented to the characters was emotionally moving. The way they were willing to sacrifice their lives for each other was also very touching. The insight and sense of a higher purpose because of the teaching they received from John touched my heart. The ending left me anticipating the next book. I can't wait to see what this author cooks up for book two.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20CQXJA0WMFWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401688721#wasThisHelpful","R20CQXJA0WMFWS","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This author sure knows how to pack emotion, tender moments, and passion within the pages of each book she writes. I loved this book. It was compelling and interesting. I appreciated how there were so many lessons about secrets, forgiveness, and knowing God in a personal way inserted into the story line. I also loved how the author showed that a relationship with the living Savior does change the way someone lives their life and eventually people who long for similar peace will seek the same relationship.The romance was delectable. I adored the hero. He was very heroic and delightful. The way he sacrificed his time to help Madison was admirable. I loved how he taught her to swim so she wouldn't be so afraid to be on the water. The tension was tastefully written, but palpable and intense at the same time. There was true love going on within the pages of this book. It flowed smoothly and naturally and I had a hard time putting it down once I got wrapped up in the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MK2UYHLAHY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401687008#wasThisHelpful","R26MK2UYHLAHY4","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I've enjoyed a number of historical fiction titles over the years by a variety of historical novelists, I thought this might add to that broad knowledge base. I've read about Henry IV and Elizabeth Woodville (Royal Mistress,) Richard III and the Nevilles (The Kingmaker's Daughter,) Lady of the Rivers (about Elizabeth Woodville's mother, Jacquetta, and her husband Lord Rivers,) The Red Queen (Margaret Beaufort) and numerous other stories about the Tudors, Plantagenets, etc., I found this book quite historically engaging. I would have rated it higher, but it took me over a year to finish reading it. Not because it wasn't interesting, but because of the many details including references and historical events. It takes me a lot longer to read non-fiction for this reason. Regardless, I think it helped illustrate the backgrounds of several prominent women during the Middle Ages and their political aspirations/issues. I would highly recommend it for history lovers, particularly those interested in the politics of the 14th and 15th centuries. It also has lineages and pictures in the book, which added to its appeal.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8AUP2MNOHT7P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451629540#wasThisHelpful","R8AUP2MNOHT7P","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book. It was a sweet and tender romance with a character I'd gotten to know previously in Short-Straw Bride. I'll admit, I adore the Archer boys, so I was excited about reading this book. It wasn't quite as enthralling as the last story, but it was spiritually deep and brought tears to my eyes toward the end. That mess with Holly had me holding my breath, too.The story was filled with themes of doing the right thing and the importance of being honest in every way. A little deception is still deception, and coming clean before God and man is good for the soul. I also liked the emphasis on the power of prayer and listening to God's voice in your heart. Those are all decent lessons for any good story. The author just made them more fun because of her lovable characters.Stealing the Preacher's core themes were the importance of listening to God, being patient, and being willing to allow God to direct your steps. I appreciated the spiritual aspects of the story most of all. But I also adored Crockett as the hero and the love he felt for Joanna because of her caring heart and her desire to serve others. He treasured that more than just her pretty face. I thought that was a wonderful theme as well.I believe this story illustrates very well how good men want someone who will be partner for life in all ways, and that woman needs to be someone they admire. That's an admirable message for aspiring young single ladies who want to win a good man's devotion. Flirtation and temptation are not the ways to accomplish that end. Very well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I24SKZ9AW79N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764209663#wasThisHelpful","R3I24SKZ9AW79N","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting, though quite long, novel of about 500 pages. The omniscient point of view took some getting used to, but once I got the hang of the author's writing style, I found it effective. I liked how the author inserted many issues that are still common to women today into her novel set during the reign of Edward IV. Some things may never change this side of heaven. I appreciated how she inserted the realism of the times when it came to faith, prayer, and culture. At the same time, the characters were not above cursing at appropriate times. None of the language felt gratuitous to me, though there were some terms that sensitive people would find offensive.There were realistic scenes in the book that fit the plot. Nothing seemed over-the-top in my opinion, and though there were some pretty descriptive scenes, much of the intimacy was implied. The story focused on her relations with three historical men, so there had to be intimacy as part of the story. I felt pity for Jane in her first marriage. I could see how she felt cheated. Then to have the King of England requesting her... well, she didn't have much choice in that. The other other two liaisons made sense as well, especially to a grieving woman who didn't want to live on the streets.Jane was a likable character and not portrayed as a slutty woman, or manipulative. I liked that she was just a normal woman in unfortunate circumstances that would be easy to sympathize with. There was a scene where Jane finally reconciled with her father that evoked a lot of emotion in me. It was very well done. I was so glad to see Jane happy after so much tragedy and to finally get the baby she longed for and the legitimacy she craved. Then to find out it happened for her in real life and is recorded in history, well, that was especially touching. All in all, this was a good book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHV182FEPM373/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451648626#wasThisHelpful","RHV182FEPM373","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was fun and a bit of a thrill ride for the first half. Then it morphed into a romance in the second half with a short spurt of danger toward the end. The use of the term goons to describe the terrorists did take some terror out of the plot, though. It didn't sound as dangerous to me. What I liked best was the dynamics between characters including the quick wit and sense of humor they had with each other. The dialog was great. What wasn't as believable to me was the speed in which they developed feelings for each other. Even if they felt that way I don't think they would say it quite so soon. I'm sure it happens at times. The author just didn't convince me even though the hero became breathless over her beauty a hundred times. I liked the characterization overall and the way the author delved into technology. I feel like I got a mini-lesson on cyber security. That was fun. I enjoyed the spiritual part of the story, though some of it seemed a bit forced. At the same time some great points were made. Overall it was an enjoyable story and I would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXSF8DBRXIXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611162033#wasThisHelpful","R2TXSF8DBRXIXN","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love books that make me think. This is the type of novels that leaves you pondering things even after you finish the last page. I really liked how the story ended because it brought closure to everything. I also appreciated the realistic struggles that the hero and heroine had. This author does a good job with stirring emotion in the reader and making hearts ache as well as rejoice. There were just enough ""we think we've found out what happened"" scenarios to make it seem suspenseful, even though it wasn't a suspense novel. There was also a mystery element to the book. It would be hard to sit around waiting when the trail seems to grow colder by the day.The questions Mitch asked himself were legitimate ones. How do you know when it's time to let go? How do you get peace in a situation like this? Why did God let it happen and why did it take so long to find out the truth? Well, God knows what he's doing and if we tune into His will, we will find peace and a deeper relationship with Him, but we have to surrender our own plans first. It's really hard to talk about some of the characters' journeys without posting spoilers and this is the kind of book that you don't want to cheat and read the end first.Half the beauty of reading the story is not knowing the outcome. The moral and spiritual dilemmas are more complex when the reader doesn't know the future... just like in real life. How many decisions would we change if we knew what the future held? It was a realistic and touching journey for me in that respect. I really enjoyed this story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDGRGZND37ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416599975#wasThisHelpful","R2HDGRGZND37ZS","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed the historical aspects of this story and the pictures the author included. The emotional bonding that took place between characters over various incidents that occurred at the fair was well done. I appreciated the insight the author had into a number of issues. One had to do with how the belief in someone's abilities and admiration of them as a person will increase their feelings for each other. Especially men. They want the woman they are attracted to also believe in them as a person and what they can do, not just the length of time they had known each other. That makes for a stronger kind of love; one that leads to a passionate marriage rather than just a comfortable one.The hero, Cullen, was very likable, but also quite manly. The description of his physique was quite hot, actually. I enjoyed how the author used the need for him to learn how to lip read as a way to meet the woman he became attracted to and make it difficult for him to learn from her by putting them in a number of private situations. That was great when it came to developing tension between them. His fierce protectiveness of her made me love him more. He was a good guy and cared deeply about a number of things, including loyalty. One of his most intense issues was his need to put out fires to save lives. He got to the point where he had to rely on God to see him through some tough issues. I loved that he grieved along with Della during a tragic time at the fair. It helped bond them even more. That was very well done.The heroine, Della, was a sweetheart as well. The way her feelings slowly developed for the hero was touching. The scene with the little girl in her class was a tear-jerker, but it really made Della think about what the kids experienced from being separated from their parents. Della had her own frailties, but she was a tough lady. Her response to seeing the hero's buff physique made me smile. I felt like I was touching those ripped muscles. And that first kiss... whew! Great romantic tension. She got a bit skittish at times when she felt like she couldn't trust him, but she came around and that made me admire her more. Very enjoyable story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4KXFUDUTBJV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451692374#wasThisHelpful","R4KXFUDUTBJV8","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was hoping to see this at the theater but missed it, so I watched the DVD at home. I really enjoyed the movie. I haven't seen these actors before (and if I have I don't remember them) and I thought they did a pretty good job. That little girl was adorable. The heroine was put in an impossible position and I thought it resembled ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" with Julia Roberts, but it was a different theme and setting. The movie was more chick flick than thriller, but it had it's moments that made me a bit jumpy. The chemistry between them seemed real enough. I would watch this again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWPTT61B5NK9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BN3EE1O#wasThisHelpful","RWPTT61B5NK9P","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved this book. Over 80% of it was read to me by my Kindle Fire HD, but I had no trouble understanding it because it was in the first person POV and there was only one character to track while listening. Anyway, I bought this book to find out more about Scott and to see what happened. I was not disappointed. Things just really took off and now I'm feeling bummed that the next book isn't out yet. I loved how the author wrote life like she saw it for this character and wasn't worried about being PC when it came to conversations and actions. These characters acted like real people would.I love the setting because I was young in the 1980s and when computers first came out. I remember the chat rooms and going dancing with friends. Some people might take issue with them drinking champagne a few times, but they never got drunk so it didn't bother me. Phoenix did get drunk in the first book, but she wasn't a believer and her boyfriend made her drink too much. I liked this book better even though the first book sets the foundation for her past, which helps you understand the second book. I found this story compelling and very interesting. The faith elements became a pleasant surprise I hadn't seen coming. I am definitely going to buy the third book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37U3D0KQG8NIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A86QEE2#wasThisHelpful","R37U3D0KQG8NIX","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More like 3.5 starsCatherine's Pursuit is the conclusion to a series about the three McKenna girls - also identical triplets - who were separated at birth and found each other again. I do love adoption stories and particularly ones that focus on a search to find biological parents and/or siblings to help one better understand family roots and genetic traits. The original story of what happened to them was part of a previous book and I found it quite heartbreaking. It didn't get rehashed in this story so people who haven't read previous books might feel a bit of deprivation there. The history was touched upon, but in a very light manner.Overall the story was heartwarming and a bit warm and fuzzy. There were a few scenes with a bit of action, like when Collin went to the bar and ordered a drink so he had to deal with some demons from his past, but for the most part this story moved at a slower pace. This seemed to fit the time period and character development. I enjoyed experiencing Catherine's transformation as well as Collin's. The way the author showed Catherine's change from a pretty spoiled young lady to a woman who understood hardship worked well. I wasn't feeling the connection between the hero and heroine for most of the book, but when they finally came to realize the love growing between them it played out in a very sweet scene. The fact that Collin also changed over time to become more confident was rewarding as well. All in all, this was a nice, sweet historical romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AV3G079UN7ZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1621360199#wasThisHelpful","R3AV3G079UN7ZR","A1KSGE7FCMX6SY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1KSGE7FCMX6SY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I can't get him to chew his nylabones no matter which flavor, and I'm too hesitant and cheap to try antlers because they look so sharp and expensive. These are perfect!! I like this size for puppies but will probably get the next size up as he grows into an adult. The weight measurement (15lbs) seems accurate.

"These are quality rain boots!! The rubber is very flexible and solid one piece, with no messy seams or other places for leaks. They are the BEST waterproof rain boots for kids I have seen on the market. And made in Canada makes them all the better!Other pros:--the liner is very thick and warm. These are not just rain boots, but snow boots as well. The liner inside will keep my son's feet toasty warm, especially with socks.--the top has a drawstring to cinch up once his pants are inside the boot. This is an awesome feature to keep out any extra snow or rain!!My son wears a toddler size 9 and I ordered a toddler size 10 thinking they would be roomy. Unfortunately with the liner inside, these were much too small for my son and he couldn't get his heel down into the boot with the liner on. So I ordered the little kids size 12 and they look HUGE but the looks are deceiving because with the liner inside they actually fit comfortably with room to grow into this fall/winter. I'm posting a photo of the liner so you can see what I'm talking about.Other than the sizing issue, these are awesome!! So perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G831AZPB5FB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007FAQ6RY#wasThisHelpful","R1G831AZPB5FB4","A2W31Q06MFO6AC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2W31Q06MFO6AC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These work great.Pros:--They clean food really well. Even stuck-on food. I rarely have to re-wash a dish unless it was super baked on food.--Easy to stick in the dishwasher.Cons:--Sometimes the tablets are cracked in half or the red ball is floating around the packaging. Not sure if it affects how it works, but it can be messy to get it all out of the wrapper.--If you have very hard water you will still need a rinse aid. These don't make your dishes sparkles and shine without an extra rinse aid for hard water.--Can be dangerous to have around small children.

"I bought the Crocband II sandal and the ""Timberland Adventure Seeker 2-Strap"" both in toddler size 9. The crocs are a bit wider and longer, which is perfect for my 2 yr old's feet. He has very fat feet in the area where the ankle meets the foot, so a lot of shoes are just too small for his thick foot. Crocs have always been the best fit, and these Croc sandals didn't disappoint! The Timberland sandals were also a good fit, but a little harder to get on and a little more snug. I will be sending back the Timberlands just because the Crocs are a better option for us. Both shoes were extremely well made and I love that the Timberland sandals have such a soft memory foam, flexible sole. I took away one star because the Timberland sandals have more velcro on both straps and that concerns me because velcro typically starts to age and look old after awhile, whereas the Croc sandals have a different type of velcro and only on one strap.

"Bosch is now 61, working with Cold Cases, when he's called personally into an active case--investigating the death of a councilman's son...who just happens to have been somebody with whom Harry has had problems in the past. Irvin Irving's son had died as a result of falling from a hotel window. Was it suicide, an accident, or was he murdered? Strangely enough, Irving wants Bosch on the case, forgetting the bad feelings between them, because Irving believes Bosch has the integrity to see the case through and come up with the right answers...Of course, Irving is right and Bosch does find the answer, but...Be prepared to hear a continuous reference to the words ""High Jingo."" Is Harry running a straight-forward case...or is he being played... or even betrayed? One thing he knows is that the current chief of police had probably made some deal with Irving in order to have Bosch on the case...the problem was that at this point he had no idea what the bargain included, confident, though, that he'd figure it out before long.Actually, both of the cases were assigned specifically to Bosch, and Chu, the first one, a cold case, was explained by the lieutenant, noting that there was something wrong about the case and it had to be kept confidential until they discovered what exactly happened... Because it went back to the discovery of DNA of one Clayton S. Pell, who had just been released from prison. Bosch immediately saw this guy guilty, given his known record...except that he would have been eight years old when the blood had been left at the scene... The victim had been 19 when she was snatched on the street and the blood had come from a small smear found on her neck...  To clear Pell, they were going to have to find the real killer...Several characters in the story--Bosch's daughter and Clayton Pell's counselor--allow readers a chance to see the personal side of Harry. The relationship between Harry and his daughter is wonderfully sound and she's already planning to join the Police Academy, with Bosch already training her in all the little ways he has become such a great officer. Then Harry is attracted to his counselor, Hannah Stone, when he goes to meet Pell for the first time.Another female friend is Kizmin Rider who once was Harry partner and who is now in the Chief's office Readers first meet her during an interesting discussion of another DROP... Bosch has asked for an extension to his retirement for another five years. During this book, Harry goes back and forth considering whether he just wants to go ahead and retire and be with his daughter more than he normally has in the past...One thing immediately became apparent to Bosch...a cop was probably involved in the death of Irvng... Connelly spends some time in the novel to explain about the controversial choke hold that had been used in the past--I appreciated this back-fill information since all of us are aware of the deaths attributed to this hold! And the outrage from those deaths! And, indeed, Bosch's assumption moved forward in a direction that could lead to the death actually being a murder... Because that choke hold left a mark on Irving's body!There is an interesting relationship with Bosch and his partner that creates a unique situation later in the book. Bosch is a man who is used to working on his own and has a difficult time sharing all that he is thinking. I could understand that because so many different options were coming forward for consideration...in both cases... But the Irving case was supposed to be top priority, while Bosch was interested in the cold case... No matter what, both cases were being handled, whether or not Harry was willing to feed every thought to others, especially Irving's father...Oh yeah, reading Michael Connelly's series with Harry Bosch sure makes a very smooth read! You've probably read them all if you are a fan, but I I had been neglecting my top favorite authors to respond to other requests for reviews...Won't let that happen again. I missed several of this series since the early ones I had read many years ago, and it was great to watch Bosch, one of my favorite cop characters, working again... Hope you enjoy learning about The Drop. I loved it!And by the way, in case you, too, hadn't heard, the TV series is now available! I started to watch the first one on my Fire, but the book kept calling me back...I'd rather read the book first...LOLAnyway, if you haven't read this author, surely you are not a fiction reader, else there'd be no way you haven't heard of him! Do check this book out, in particular. This one is a must-read for fans of the series and highly recommended for those who love thrillers, suspense and police action!GABixlerReviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTYQTRUW3NXMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RCNGT4#wasThisHelpful","RTYQTRUW3NXMN","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You may have red my review of Barrett's fascinating  earlier book, Forget Yourself! If not, do take a moment to read it before you leave today...When Redfern's book arrived with his warmest regards, he said, ""...hope you enjoy reading it, and that it gives some insight into a poor and often ignored city, as well as the sometimes fascinating lives of its residents..."" Of course, I hadn't purposely ignored the city, but I admit I'd never heard of it, so...I went out to find out a little more introduction to the city itself. In my opinion, this novel is more character-driven, so I got involved with the people more so than the setting.With a tight job market and shortage of housing, we find most of the characters in Barrett's novel living in shared housing. Some individuals become close, as friends, while others may not even see their roommates for weeks. Barrett has created quite a number of characters within his novel, but the main characters are Richard, Dom, and Caroline. You will meet each individually, as the book moves from character to character, each sharing part of the story, perhaps added to by their friends at that time; while some others speak on their own. One other character, Rutti, takes somewhat of a lead role--and has a delightful use of language that took me awhile to follow...For instance, the use of ""Zie"" which I looked up and found to have a number of different uses--so I gave up trying to find them in a dictionary, because I soon got used to reading him! LOLRutti and Richard were roommates, but Richard had decided to move out. Rutti is gay; Richard is straight. Strangely enough, we meet Caroline first. She lives with a group of women who have become close, one claiming to be Caroline's best friend, although by the time we get into the story, I'm not quite so sure she was, indeed, even a friend. Caroline is involved with Dom, who has just agreed to room with Richard--both straight. Maybe...I say, maybe, because when it happened, everybody declared that they were closet gays... Which they weren't.. But they did fall in love...* You see, Richard and Dom hit it off right away. They learned of shared interests and quickly started to share them, spending many hours together pursuing those interests... Until people began to notice and Caroline in particular... Especially when her friends started bad-mouthing Dom...Combining what is happening in Swansea and the surrounding area and venturing into the lives of several of the minor characters allows readers to gain a much-needed perspective of the environment in which these young people must live and interact. For instance, a local club was burned down and not only the issue of who did it, but the more important one of not having a place to congregate is being widely felt...Friends are important and a means by which they can share their daily lives. One friend is dating another, so they try to match-make friends as they are able...There are interesting little shorts interspersed that move readers far into the future which, if you are intuitive, might lead you to start thinking how the book ends...maybe...There is also one token Christian student who, in passing out pamphlets which nobody wants, is taken into one of their homes and given food and shelter--in other words, being treated better than the group that was sponsoring him... An interesting twist that puts a knife where it belongs...in the backs of those individuals who have scorned and denied those who love differently and refused to accept those who have different feelings in relation to sexuality...On the other hand, from my perspective, who has seen the world move from sweet innocence of friendships into a world that is so sexualized you can't escape being bombarded with sexuality in all its blatant glory, it came to me that we are no longer able to feel special love for friends of the same sex. You know what I mean... we are now afraid to touch for fear of being accused of sexual harrassment. A pastor once told me he couldn't hug me while I was crying due to restrictions...The examples could go on and on... In essence, we have lost the ability to love friends (phileo)...especially of the same sex...Now I'm not questioning the various forms of sexuality (eros) when I say this. But when Richard and Dom got friendly and especially enjoyed each other's company, everybody automatically assumed that they were having sex... There in Swansea, the other minor characters quickly started to argue whether Richard was two-timing Caroline, because he loved the man with whom he was now living. Because phileo versus eros love was not even considered to be what had happened... They loved each other...They fell in love with each other... When we say that we normally consider it is a sexual relationship. How sad... Dare I say that Richard and Dom had merely found a very special phileo/friend with whom he could relate...Now, this philosophical discussion is part of my thoughts about the book and its impact on me...It reminded me that we, in the United States and across the world, are not even able to claim a close friendship with those who become beloved phileo...friends. Caroline's friends were adamant that she should break up with Dom. Some of Dom's friends escaped from their own friendship with Dom, thinking he was now gay...Quite a mess, as you can see... But I was intrigued throughout the novel as to what interpersonal relationships were being affected purely because Richard and Dom had expressed love for each other.Watching the dynamics of what happens among the group of characters was extremely fascinating. What happens is heartwarming, and full of expressions of love toward fellow man. Is there a place in today's world for this kind of love? I think so... Dare I say we are trying to find our way to find and retain loving relationships in today's world of judgment, hatred, and using sex as the predominant (and only?) act with another human being?This book is a fun way of considering how you feel about other people. Sexual activities are spoken of, but not spotlighted. It is the exploration of emotions that Barrett presents to his readers...and it speaks of individuals being free to express their emotional attachment to others without being labeled gay, straight...or...different...I as the reader, probably falls into the ""different"" category because I'm recommending that you highly consider this book. There is a basic story that is so simple, yet so magnificent in impact...

"Thus begins the story of Elisabeth Belle Sterling... Based partially on the life of a close friend of the author, Shirley Dunn... I don't think I've ever known any true Southern girls, who apparently have some type of mystique about them? LOL Elisabeth Sterling, is the narrator and main character in this first novel by Olivia deBelle Bryd. The story takes place during the Vietnam War and Elisabeth becomes the wife of a military man...But first, she shares much about her early life and on through college when she decides to remain unmarried and become a spinster. Congrats to her that she did keep her promise to herself not to have sex before married, but no way was she going to remain a spinster after she meets the right man! Of course that was quite awhile after she had fallen in love with Cameron and then got jilted right after college graduation.I won't say that her story prior to marriage was any different than other young women, perhaps being a little dramatic when she declared she was considering entering a convent since she was having such lousy luck in dating... Luckily her friend, Mary Kate. pointed out she was not Catholic and put a quick damper on that option... Later she met her one and only through a blind date...Kincaid and Elisabeth soon became a couple, then married and readers begin to know more about both of them, but Kincaid would never talk about his mother. Elisabeth was tenacious in solving mysteries, but when Kincaid's mother showed up at their home one day, she immediately knew it was upsetting her husband...Soon Elisabeth was teaching and their life was happy until Kincaid was called to go to Vietnam. Elisabeth was devastated since they had just celebrated their first anniversary...Elisabeth is funny, romantic and wonderfully in love with her husband and constantly lets him know... But sorrow is coming and Elisabeth will not be able to handle it well...This is the first book I've read set during the Vietnam War that provides the perspective of the wife left behind to wait... I am sure that any woman in that situation, no matter what war, will find this compelling book a worthwhile read. Check it out on my blog for pics and music. It literally is full of emotional stimulus--excitement, happiness, sadness... and more sadness... There is a strength to Elisabeth and Kincaid's love, but there just may be a bigger hand holding their lives...Yes, there are so many books out there to read, but I do hope you give this one your consideration... It is highly recommended and may be just what you needed at this time...GABixlerReviewsPaperback provided for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTC10DGJYC0L9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881465011#wasThisHelpful","RTC10DGJYC0L9","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMG! When evil powerful people are in control, they can create major... messes! Poor Brandon Drake has gone through hell and is now back there! Would it have been better to leave him as he once was--a psychopath? Perhaps, because he probably would have already been dead...Instead, one man, a Senator, had taken Brandon and had his brain revisioned. It did change him for the better, even though the Senator's plan for him was quite different! But Brandon had seen what was going on and escaped and had full four years of being a kinder, gentler, and finally loving man...With the Senator's death, one of his own men eliminated the interim director of the special department within CIA and automatically became director! He wanted the psychopath back...so he could work for him...never realizing that The Scorpion was uncontrollable...Well, it is confirmed that my favorite of the Trilogy is Go!; however, Run is an entirely different type with an ending that uniquely carried through on the theme originally started in Season 1... Readers will have the opportunity to learn much more about Brandon's early life as well as his time in the military. Even the other soldiers were afraid of him, and his commander had taken an assault from him, without reporting it, because he considered him so valuable to the success of his unit...The Scorpion felt he was invincible and in turn did just about anything he wanted!As was his nature, Scorpion didn't want to wait and escaped from the Mohave facility, killing everybody, including the only person, the doctor, who could have helped him...Wilmot paired him with another formidable man and sent them on their first mission--to kill Jed Crane who had escaped but knew about what had been going on. There was no choice Crane must die... He was living in a favela in Brazil.And that's when the Interceptor returns! Readers will recall that when Brandon had been declared a hero, a comic had been developed, calling the hero Interceptor...You see, Wilmoth had not listened closely enough to the doctor who had returned Drake to a psychopath. That is, that the person he had become for four years would still be part of Drake's memories! And when he was sent to kill Crane and found, instead a woman with whom Crane lived, he had changed when she begged for her life! Interceptor took over and prevented his killing her!After having to be dragged out of the hovel where they'd learned Crane was living, Drake wanted to know just exactly what had happened and why he had been struck down, unable to perform... At the same time, Crane was coming home when they were leaving and snapped pictures of Drake, who was believed to be dead!Soon the two--the Scorpion and the Interceptor were in battle! Best I can think about it would be to have an individual with multiple personalities, in this case two, fighting against each other, rather than taking over and coming out when the other didn't know it. Whew! Just reading the rest of the story is an exciting battle like no other!In order to learn how to rid himself of the Interceptor, the Scorpion went home to start learning about what had happened...leaving his father beheaded once he told him all he knew... Readers watch the trail of bodies as the Scorpion searches... How does he get rid of the Interceptor? Kill the object of The Interceptor's strong emotional feelings! Belinda Reese!Belinda Reese and Emily, Brandon's sister, are now living with Tyler and his father... Tyler has hooked up with Nikki who we met in the last book... and Tyler is helping to promote her new career as a singer...by investing in the music business, about which he knows nothing! His idea?! Add a glockenspiel to her band! Wish I could hear it! Quite a number of songs are included, as written by Nikki, so this side-plot was a fun addition to this extremely violent final novel in the trilogy.You might say that the ending of this finale book wrote itself...it was inevitable and yet so poignantly done that you, the reader, will be satisfied...

"How I wish that my new uber-Hero was really alive and working to eliminate those in Human Trafficking...The world needs a man that moves right in, no matter who he's confronting! Human Trafficking has got to stop! And in Go! Brandon Drake makes a major effort toward just that! First, let me remind you about an article I wrote some time ago suggesting to authors that, with a trilogy or series, they provide a overview of what happened in the previous book.. This author did just that--cool!--so now we are picking up where the last book left off. Brandon is confined to Leavenworth!Of course, at that point, Brandon was not aware of his siblings, but as soon as he saw Tyler, who looked like Brandon, he accepted what he was being told! Even more reason to escape, besides getting back to his love, Belinda! Brandon succeeded in escaping, but was seen running and was shot... But Brandon wouldn't let anything stop Tyler from finding Belinda and bringing her back to the Cabin...Which included Tyler ""dressing up"" as Brandon and saving Belinda from the Feds!Which he succeeded in doing; however, neither of the brothers had realized just how bad Brandon was from the shot and he had not been able to take care of himself while Tyler was gone, even to build up the fireplace... He turned to Gin to help keep him going... Once Tyler and Belinda made it back to the cabin, they found Brandon huddled in a blanket, nearly frozen... and delirious. They got him to his bed and Belinda immediately wrapped him with lots of covers while Tyler built a fire...During his recuperation, they made plans to find exactly where Emily was. Emily had been a nun, having live in the Carmelite Convent since she was young... and had since been accepted into the Carmelite Life. After serving for quite some time and becoming a favored nun, she began to question whether or not she made made a mistake taking her final vows...After much thought, she asked to be permitted to leave...and was refused..Soooo, she escaped! There is an indication that the Church knew about Brandon's escape and that they had wanted to keep her safe inside the convent. However, from Emily's perspective, she felt that she had lost her faith if she could not be free to act on her own, making decisions for herlife...They were right...Emily did not understand the ways of today's world...and soon was in the hands of a human trafficker! Can you image Emily being approached by a handsome man offering to help? And that's how she was on her way, depending on a beautiful man, the first she'd seen outside of the convent for years...At the same time, Belinda was trying to convince Brandon to spend more time resting and healing and holding off going for Emily... But he quickly explained that he needed to bring his family together. And Tyler had a plan...that would be very dangerous...he was going try to buy Emily...using his real name and notorious reputation as the very rich sexy playboy that he was... First Stop was the Citadel...I think this second book might be my favorite of the trilogy, but since I've already started reading the third, I'll withhold my final decision... Now, there is no doubt about it, the best is yet to come as Brandon finds that inner demon to fight against the criminal traffickers and free his sister!What's that you're thinking? You've got to read this? Well, I totally agree because it's part of my favorites this year--The entire Trilogy I am sure!GABixlerReviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL57IUQF4S3YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YD8497U#wasThisHelpful","RL57IUQF4S3YS","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There will be many individuals who will claim that this book is a must-read besides me... For me, it's the most important book I have read, ever, and probably will continue to be... By now, some of you have realized that Human Trafficking is a topic I highlight whenever books include something about this unforgivable activity that is spreading across the world like a deadly virus!What I did not know, however, is how human trafficking has become the ultimate goal of criminals in whatever area of corruption is carried on! Drugs are used and gone, it has been seen; but enslaved humans can be used over and over and therefore much more valuable as a product!And what is the primary tool by which Children are seduced? The Internet--particularly that smart phone that you've just handed to your young child or teenager after giving in to their crying, pouting, demanding, just to keep them quiet! The question is, do you routinely monitor their use after that?Do you follow any of the terminology used about the Internet? If not, you are not prepared to deal with what your child has access to and is probably already using!Many parents are both working these days as expenses soar...Children are often on their own... In the past, they could moan, !I'm bored."" Not anymore! Giving in to just one request--a smart phone--will give your child access to the world. Sure, it helps to do homework...but, believe me, that ad on the TV that shows the little boy hiding what he's really doing on the computer, instead of his school paper, is true!When I discovered the seduction of games, I was shocked!  For instance, Grand Theft Auto was bad enough to spotlight stealing cars and getting away...but now, the latest has the scenes showing as if your child was in the driver's seat...And they've added prostitution...where the child can have his own performance to be visualized in his mind as if he were there! What's worse, however, is the finale where the driver kills the prostitute by car--so that he doesn't have to pay for the sex! OMG! This is bad enough for an adult to participate in--but now, just by providing access to the Internet--you allow your child to play the same games! Or you purchase them for them, thinking that the game is all about fast cars and ""pretend"" stealing... ""Pretend sex"" for a child is just the same as having it, in my opinion!Facebook is no longer a site that interests children and teens...Their parents can connect to them! The other sites mentioned in this book I had never heard of...and I'm on the computer every day and have a good knowledge of using the computer and the concurrent terminology... All I can visualize is all these child predators out there, joining what are teen sites, building a false identity and seducing young girls and boys into something that either becomes embarrassing such as sharing a nude picture, or being blackmailed or worse, having the photo sent all over the world to other predators...Nothing shocked me in this book as being something I was not aware of, especially with my reading schedule. What did shock me was the merge of gangs, drug lords and other large criminal enterprises moving in so that the net to capture children has grown to such an extent that stopping it MUST be from the efforts of everybody who loves and wants to protect children, teens...and adults as well (Human Trafficking is about any age and either sex.)What that means is that even while police, at every level, are diligently working on the problem, it has moved well beyond their ability to handle it! A Frightening Thought: Are the majority of people who watch Special Victims: Law and Order and have kept it popular, actually criminals learning from the program?!Have you used limiting  of access to the phone or other electronic tools as a disciplinary action? Wasn't successful was it? Seduced is all about how access is used to groom and recruit young people, which all too often ends in exploitation. It is designed to be a parent-empowering program. It is a guide for parents to understand the influence and coercion processes, and most critically, equip adults with dialogue, insights and psychology that can put the power back into parenting...Please, please consider this important book! It may save your child's life! What is found in this book is NOT fiction; it is based upon actual case studies from all over the world, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES! Don't wait until it's too late and then spend the rest of you life regretting that your child has disappeared...GABixlerReviewsPaperback provided for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39AXRV625CN4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGUGUZW#wasThisHelpful","R39AXRV625CN4S","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Osgoode Trilogy must be considered from a totally different genre from Martin's other Trilogy. This time she presents a Legal Thriller! Conduct in Question, for you who enjoy legal thrillers or mysteries, in particular, will be quite pleased! Martin's expertise and experience in practicing law--small estates--has been wonderfully put to creating a suspenseful, taut, and a puzzling mystery story, where readers will not be able to keep up with which ""who"" is doing ""what."" I was caught from the first page and had selected a number of characters as the main villain, which proved to be wrong, in trying to figure out who the serial killer was!What, you thought real estate law could not be a thriller??? Wrong!I loved how Martin molded her story completely around the community's land dealings, while concurrently, everybody in town was afraid because of the continued hideous attacks on young women... You see, as many artists do, ""The Florist"" tried to follow the works of Henri Matisse, by carving flowers, with a knife, into his victims bodies... Certainly not like a tattoo that somebody might choose, especially since the color was always red...the blood running from the cuts that had been made... Whew!When we meet our main character, he seems quite the milquetoast. His flamboyant boss has been the front man for their law firm, while he has been kept in the back, doing all of the work...Harry Jenkins was really an unhappy man--with his job, with his wife, and especially his lack of freedom...Then everything changed...His boss dropped dead at the office and he was left the only partner in their firm. Frankly, his death was not really a loss, except he had taken out a personal loan against the firm! And now Harry was being hounded by the bank officer to repay!At the time of his boss's death, Harry had just been given the instructional handover of the estate of Marjorie Deighton. Later, they had been scheduled to  meet with Marjorie, to revise her will, but when he and his secretary got there, they found Marjorie dead... Jenkins was positive that this really wasn't a natural death, even though the first police investigation indicated it was..Two deaths--his boss who had brought a ton of past poor decisions to rest now on Jenkins... including a mysterious ""secret trust"" of Marjorie Deighton, which was not included anywhere in the office's files!And the dysfunctional family of Marjorie, who immediately surrounded him like wolves, waiting for the will to be read and handled...Then Jenkins thought he found some relief, when a new client came to him, asking him to handled everything related to the acquisition of a group of sites,which surrounded the Deighton home, as well as a church... The latter presented its own set of problems when they wanted their land changed to a commercial property in order to allow some part of its land for development.The amazing thing for readers to watch is the slow change of Harry Jenkins as he tackles each and every issue in a professional, courageous manner--even when he makes some wrong decisions, that gets him into worse trouble, he carefully and meticulously faces the challenge and moves to correct...the type of lawyer we'd all like to work with when needed!The author's character development of Suzannah Deighton was critical for the storyline. She was the youngest of three siblings due to inherit; however, the more important part of this character is her being trapped in a relationship with a man who abused her. In fact, all three were so uniquely crafted, along with the back story of each, that it makes you wonder how they were all still interacting as a family unit... The entire character development and dialogue is outstanding in so many different ways! I loved it; I believe you will too!

"What happens when an emphasis is placed on the criminal element, a small percentage of an entire population of a country? Of course the answer is easy for any thinking person--a reputation is formed... In this case, all Italian-Americans are part of the criminal element! One of the major ways this type of prejudice is transmitted is through Mass Media... Adolph Caso has updated his earlier edition and I had a chance to read the 2014 edition now available. It is disheartening, to say the least...America does not have a history of actually accepting the huddled masses yearning to breathe free, does it?  Perhaps we are no different than other countries, I don't know, but I do know enough from actual history, not fictional accounts, to know that we have not lovingly accepted ""different"" people. Adolph Caso has had the opportunity as a writer, publisher, and more, to research and study the actions against, just one group of people. by the media. In my opinion, the evidence is damning.The thing about the media is that you normally see, read, or hear about what is being said as a single entity... Unless you read a book, such as Mass Media, the impact of what is being ""fed"" to your brain is not noticed--until you become saturated and disgusted with it--or, worse, believe it to be true... If you are an older American, you may have already realized how much the media has skewed and damaged both individuals as well as entire races and those of specific nationalities... And we allow it to happen, either by not caring, or by lack of attention.Adolph Caso has recognized this problem and has spoken out on behalf of his heritage--He is an Italian-American, proud of it...and thinks they've deserved better! I agree! Let's look more closely...The Author first looks at The First Amendment...then proceeds to provide background documentation to support what he says. He refers first to Cesare Beccaria's book, On Crimes and Punishments and then on to other references. In fact, the book is full of historical documentation to support what he presents as he speaks out against Mass Media... and to some Italian Americans such as Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather, who have supported the denigration of the reputation of Italian-Americans... But Caso does not limit his documentation to fiction--actually it is more toward newspapers such as the New York Times who used headlines like ""The Mob Gambles on Atlantic City"" or The Boston Globe who spotlighted that Rocco Antonelli, held two jobs, and made more money than the governor... Details were, of course, omitted and the reader would naturally pick up on the insinuation received first-page coverage! What!? All done around election time, too...Unfortunately, the sad display of this type of ""selective reporting"" continues for page after page, ad nauseam. There is no need to doubt Mr. Caso's information, full details plus an index are provided for readers.  The impact of the prejudicial headlines alone is offensive for everybody, in my opinion. Who wants a newspaper to flaunt prejudice?!And then we get into the unwillingness to reveal sources...and they claim it is to protect the rights of the public... Ahhhhhh, not this public member...Another issue covered in the book is one about which I'd already changed my earlier opinion...that of prayer in school... If you feel strongly about this topic, the discussion alone, I think, is worth your checking out the book...Going into many historical controversial issues have been merged into the book to support the continued negativity about the worth of Italians and Italian-Americans.On the other hand, I must say I was relieved and enjoyed going onto a topic that brings pride--the contribution of Italians to the world of music! While Caso's review involves music from different countries, it is impossible, in my opinion, not to already have experienced the joy brought by Italian composers and artists...An interesting closing to the book is a guide, ""How to Lessen Media Abuses"" which would be applicable, I am sure, for everybody's use! We can all show similar types of abuse by mass media!Whether you are an Italian American is irrelevant as it relates to how Mass Media is handling the news of America. Can we really afford to allow this to continue? Think about it... This book is highly recommended...GABixlerReviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V3VFHVU5C95S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N01HO8W#wasThisHelpful","R3V3VFHVU5C95S","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many any of us specifically seek answers about our spiritual lives... As has author, John Van Dixhorn... He wrote the book at the age of 76, to confirm his thoughts and actions throughout his life and to ensure when he was gone, his truth would be available...He hooked me, as early as in the Introduction...The author's education and experience background clearly shows his expertise in writing the book he's sharing with you, the readers. This is always important to me. In this book, written in memoir form, there is both the story of the author's life, as well as documentation and discussion as to why and how the changes were made in his life, to present role of, psychologist...Using the format of memoir allowed the author to speak openly and honestly about how his life evolved. It is an excellent story that, I believe, will capture the hearts and minds of anybody who reads it... For some, like me, it might mean much more than just reading another memoir or about a man's religious philosophy...Much of what is Prisoner of Belief may hit you directly where you've been struggling...John Van Dixhorn was born into a religious family structure that was mandated by the faith of their fathers' religion... Much like, my guess is, you and I. For many years he lived within the role established for family members. But John had a mind that started to think for himself... and he questioned the specifics about those in his religion, learned through his first religion. He went on to later ""be saved"" into knowing Christ as his savior...and received many blessings during that time, except that, he began to question what the Holy Bible said...As John moved toward his teens, thoughts of sex started... One of the important issues covered is the erotic struggles of a teenager... I have long felt that the church, any religion, has failed miserably in providing guidance and reality assistance to individuals about their sexuality. There is no other explanation for a Christian, in my opinion, to see the present state of the world regarding sex and all it has become! Of course, the Bible does nothing in this regard--there is only one way to remain your entire life, or as some are taught, to become a suicide bomber and receive virgins as your reward in Heaven... Or through some other ""story"" to explain why to be celibate...The author's revelations were not surprising in this area--his first sight of the sex act was between animals, he was told that masturbating was sinful and was even told that others would know it because the whites of his eyes would yellow... But what is really the issue regarding sex for Christians, and others...?Moving into the age of his career choice was the most revelatory... especially, ""What about this Bible?""The trouble for John really began when he had gone through seminary, was preaching, and found that there were few parts of the Bible about which he could fully create and teach on The Word...When a man who has chosen to minister as his career no longer finds it is possible, he looks within himself to realize that he still wants to help people. John Van Dixhorn did not quickly make the decision to further his education in Psychology. You will find his deep commitment to searching for the way to be a real and faithful evangelic minister was not an easy road to take. I applaud him for sharing the deep and gut-wrenching thoughts and actions he took to become who he is today.I want to quickly say that this book, is in no way, an attempt to bring readers around to his way of thinking...it is his story and his alone to tell. It rings true, I believe, and has not been censored to try to garner great masses of reader attention. Yet, in my opinion, it is his openness and attention to detail of what he went through, that will cause readers to be willing to listen to his story...You just might find something that I did..a balance against which you can consider or reconsider your own beliefs...  For me, it has to be considered a must-read... If I had the money and the guts, I would place this book into the hands of every person in the world who believes that their holy writings are truly God's words, for each and every one of us to follow...GABixlerReviewsPaperback provided for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R358RYWYG4T7I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1478736313#wasThisHelpful","R358RYWYG4T7I8","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of course, he's handsome, intelligent and brave, but this time, he's also quite a surprise--and he doesn't even know it...yet...The fun part of the novel is that our hero's got all the equipment--strange, new gimmicks to help him be a superhero...

He had stolen files when he'd disappeared from his job and had discovered that there was a totally organized plan to eliminate specific people/areas...The problem was that he was always in the midst of decoding the files and had already missed the first attack and, now, had been late for the second one.Except he had discovered Belinda as she was trying to escape and immediately acted to get her out of harm's way...except the escape route was going to also be dangerous--at least in her mind!And before he stopped to think about it, he had brought Belinda to his cabin--a place nobody else knew about and was purposely kept secret for that reason!For Belinda, she immediately fell in love with the location, the quiet, and, slowly, with Brandon...For Brandon, he was very aware of her, but realized he'd possibly placed both of them in danger by bringing her here... Brandon had no choice but to immediately go back to work, trying to figure out the next target. In the meantime, Belinda was full of questions and wanted to help...Belinda was becoming more and more confused and afraid, asking Brandon to turn to the police. It was then Brandon told her just exactly who he had been working for when he discovered the plans for war... Emphasizing that he didn't know who could be trusted, even the local police might be tied in some way...To prevent the third attack would be up to Brandon...Peter Darley shares about his early efforts to publish this book--I'm certainly happy he continued to try after the many possible frustrations that face writers these days... Did you notice his comments about a TV series...Well, I agree with him that it is worthy of being a movie and the first book is packed full of enough action to fulfill the needs of one Season!Soooo, I immediately went out and got season 2 and pre-ordered season 3. That's how much I'm interested in following the Hold On! series! So, you can be on the lookout for the next two books on my blog! But, why wait? I highly recommend you start reading Peter Darley...right now!GABixlerReviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MMQKS5H608XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXTI2FM#wasThisHelpful","R3MMQKS5H608XA","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How do you decide that an author will be a favorite by his first novel? For me, it's easy...the writing itself is great, but, more importantly, the story line and characters blend together into a perfect combination of topics that interest me and are presented in a time period that brings back memories and also exhibits the character development that reveals a like-minded attitude of the writer.I think the most intriguing part of Kaufmann's stories is that, along with a very complex mystery to solve, there is also glimpses of some traumatic event(s) that has occurred, but is only provided by tantalizing teases referring to, normally, James' feelings.The main character, Detective James McCallum, is Scottish and calmly speaks of his personal opinions to others, letting them know they are wrong about what they are saying or doing, but not necessarily in a critical manner. Readers can respect him, admire him, and enjoy getting to know him. Especially in relation to his best friend, Drew Aldala... Please check out yesterday's review of the introductory novella, Rampage on Rogers Avenue to learn more.McCallum was able to make a connection with the injured boy, Trevor. He stuttered and didn't talk much because of that, but James was able to win him over and at least discover his identity. There had been very little evidence in the Alley...a trumpet mouthpiece,  a broken record and a string that had been wound round Trevor's fingers, protected as if it was very important to him... But why? what could a string be used for that was so important?Finding enough pieces of the record, they were able to consider that it might be Tucker Wilson, who played jazz in Harlem. But as they continued the investigation they found that Tucker was scheduled to play in a nearby club and that Trevor was going to be given a guest slot. Now that would be impossible...Trevor had been only one of a group of students who were receiving private lessons on various instruments. But Trevor was undoubtedly the most skilled. Could his attack be personal, out of envy or hatred?In this second novel, we meet Stacey, a close friend of James. Actually, the instigation for the four to meet came from Drew's wife, so James hoped that agreeing would help further the relationship that was developing as James once again began to closely interact with Drew.No matter at what stage of the case from James' standpoint, Drew will force a recapitulation of all that has transferred thus far. For readers, we quickly learn about the case, the clues and the individuals involved...But it is only when Drew has mulled it over and has arrived at acceptable options will he then share with James! It's kinda fun to see James' frustration and yet, the amazing conclusions from Drew always fits all the pieces together!With Leroy's arrangement to play for Tucker Wilson, James and Drew decided to take their lady loves out to hear him and hopefully talk to him about Leroy, seeing whether he knew any possible reason for him being attacked. While there, Drew watched as drugs were sold nearby in a corner...and naturally drug dealings became a prominent issue for their investigation...But no matter all the different options that were being discovered, there was still one question that haunted all those involved... Why was that alley called ""Forgotten Alley and who had put up a sign with that name?I loved it! The book is mostly character driven with some really well-defined individuals that readers will get to know very slowly, by the looks of it! This book, as well as the first, had mysteries which proved to be complex enough that readers will probably have to wait until the ending to know what has really happened... As least I did and you know that's the kind of mysteries I most enjoy! Hopefully, this posting will give you enough to consider whether you are interested in reading the book... My advice is Yes! Do check it out further!GABixlerReviewsPaperback provided for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0IX38YQSCDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1RSQMY#wasThisHelpful","R1P0IX38YQSCDY","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I had the chance to read Assault in Forgotten Alley and realize there was a novella that started the series, A Scotch and Herring Mystery, I immediately downloaded Rampage on Rogers Avenue to meet the main characters right from the beginning. I am certainly happy I did!The merge of Jewish life is prominent in this new series, but it is the characters that complement won my attention. I highly recommend you consider reading David Y. B. Kaufmann!There is a mystery within the mystery regarding the relationship between James and Drew. They had been friends since they were very young, but something had occurred within the past few years that caused their separation. This is an ongoing issue that continues into the next book, and perhaps will enter future novels.In this first mystery, we enjoy the first encounter of the two friends. Drew is now married and has become a Rabbi. His father was a police officer, killed in the line of duty... Although James had known about some of this, and had even attended events in the background, they had not spoken...I wasn't quite sure whether James had taken advantage of the Jewish connection of his latest case in order to contact his old friend, and partner. Readers will begin to find little tidbits out that add a personal flavor to the series...Especially the development of Faigy, Drew's new wife...Especially enjoyable is the interaction between the two friends as it relates to a case... James, by the way, had Drew's father as his mentor while Drew listened and observed his father in action as he handled his cases. Of the two, Drew is the Sherlock Holmes to his Watson, James McCallum...  James has an interesting background which will be explored more fully in the novel--review coming next. Apparently, James' father was on the other side of the law, BUT, was very good Friends with Police Officer Aldala, allowing the two young boys to become close friends. However, James has yet to be totally accepted as the new, and only, detective in his precinct and creates some prickly situations when he refuses to condone any type of prejudicial slurs against the Jews living in the community...Another little tidbit, quite surprising, is the Rabbi's interest and collection of hero action comic books! I look forward to seeing how this is worked into the upcoming books!A pawn shop has been broken into, the owner beaten...This mystery is not anywhere near the complexity of Assault in Forgotten Alley. It does a great job, however, of seeing the clues gathered by James, then Drew, and then readers listen while the two regurgitate the details almost ad nauseum as is sometimes the case for difficult cases. I enjoyed the back-and-forth banter and quickly decided this author had a new fan! Actually, you see, readers will either being learning new things, or being reminded of the symbols of the Jewish Religion while working to solve a difficult mystery! Loved it!GABixlerReviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE91JFE0DC2V9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EHNL64#wasThisHelpful","RE91JFE0DC2V9","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMG, this is one of the most complicated books, and trilogy, that I've ever read. Readers will be just as confused as the main character, Lawrence Juste. The author gives little to help us through the maze that Juste travels. The ending? well, it could not have been any different, even though it will be a total surprise, I guarantee it! I was tense throughout the entire last book--who can Juste trust? Who can I, the reader, feel confident enough about to know whether to believe any of the individuals that surrounded Lawrence. At the end, I realized I totally believed only Mary, Lawrence's sister, who had been declared insane many years ago... A suspense thriller like no other...If you have not previously known of this trilogy, I highly advise you read my reviews for Patchwork Man and Patchwork  People  to become somewhat acquainted with the story. The trilogy follows Kenny, who later changes his name, from his childhood through to the present. Kenny's family was torn into pieces by the courts and Kenny grew up on state care, only to be later taken into the home of a prominent man who lavishly took care of him, for favors...The money that had been given to Kenny is now being demanded back by family representatives and, Lawrence, who is himself now a man of the courts, is fighting for his life, by going back into his earlu life to try to figure out and gather information about what has happened.For quite recently, the wife who he had just buried, had begun to send him messages... A key point to remember is that everything that Lawrence, and you the reader, will learn, will come to you in pieces...His life, by now, has broken into so many pieces that he's not sure patches can ever help... Indeed, trying to get over your spouse's death has just begun when his whole world turns topsy-turvy... And a young boy is a major reason why... His Social Worker becomes another individual who has unfortunately also gained a piece of his heart and they begin an affair. Soon, however, he begins to doubt her as trustworthy. And, soon, he begins to realize that the boy is probably a member of his family...but how and who is his parents?!In the midst of the personal crises that were entering Juste's life, including the loss of his car and home through vandalism/fire, there were many legal issues that surrounded him, all of which he was suspected for, or was a ""person of interest..."" There was the theft of the majority of the money from the law firm of which Lawrence was a member... Then there was the trouble that Kat's, his lover, brother got into and was being used for a bit of blackmail. Then one of Lawrence's sister was murdered, a woman who was supposedly Danny's mother but wasn't... and who Lawrence had been accused of being intimate with to father the boy... Then Win, his older brother, was accused of that murder, so Win needed his brother to act as his solicitor...In the meantime, his dead wife, now back, was using Danny to send Lawrence messages. and at one point was kidnapped for millions in ransom...There is no way I'm going to even try to tell you the ""story"" as it moves forward, but if you pay close attention, you will be able to follow everything, even if you don't pick up any clues about what's happening. At one point, you may even question whether Lawrence is indeed guilty of some of what he's being accused of... But, no matter what, you will easily determine that somebody, or more than one person, is out to ruin Lawrence...and has been doing a wonderful job in totally discrediting him professionally, if not personally (for everybody, that is). Because one person--Danny--believes in him... And, for Lawrence that is enough to make him do what he had to do, to ensure Danny was ultimately safe.And what we do know is that money is at the root of all that is evil!I've said it before and I'll finish with it again...This is a brilliantly  plotted trilogy, full of intricate planning that is full of obfuscating activities until only, as the final book is ending, that the main character has begun to understand, even if he doesn't know the full truth yet, that, finally, readers will know it all, even as he learns, and accepts, the total truthful amazing story! Simply fantastic!GABixlerReviewsBook provided for review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3VMRC0FSA8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0LFAB8#wasThisHelpful","R3P3VMRC0FSA8Z","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It may be accepted nation-wide for homosexual marriage, but we all know that there will always be those who will not accept it. At the same time, those who are homosexual are the ones who are judged, harassed...and watched... Sylvie Nation tells of a young girl, Dez, who had fallen in love with Britney and had become a couple. But Dez was having a hard time with accepting the attention that was made every time they went out together. All they had done was go out to dinner... But a group of men had watched them all through the meal and then followed them when they left...Most of us have known people who were in same-sex relationships...Most of mine have been in a business environment or in a group situation where you don't think about their personal choices...This story, therefore, for me, was an eye opener. We've all heard of cruel harassment or even worse, but normally that is told to us second-hand. I applaud Sylvie Nathan for writing this short that will surely be of help to young teens who are already or will begin to face this sad and hurtful type of discrimination...Britney was able to have those hurtful feelings slide off her back, without making a scene. Not so Dez... And when it caused trouble between them, Dez chose to not go out as a couple again...Obviously, that was not the answer...So Britney decided to give her an ultimatum!This is a heartwarming, sad, and, finally, victorious story that is well worth your time. It's a short story with a big message for both straights and homosexuals as well. It's time to accept the world's people as they are... Love is a beautiful story in itself...GABixlerReviews","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IAAS9HMVF2M2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUWCZIK#wasThisHelpful","R2IAAS9HMVF2M2","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author-Illustrator O'Malley hits hard into an issue that confronts most children--if they are the least bit different... Of course, being different means that you are different from the bully that claims you are, right?Sometimes a child, in this case Mandy, might not really know that they have turned into a bully. A child might have some basic leadership skills that has resulted in her having friends that seem to automatically follow and accept what she says. Sometimes that is based upon their beauty, or that they wear the right clothes... Once Mandy was deemed a leader, she proclaimed herself the coolest kids in school. The problem was that she immediately started placing herself as the model upon which ""cool kids"" were accepted to be her friends.Kayla was  somewhat of an activist--if Mandy didn't change, she would counter her actions with her own. She formed a ""Cool Kids Club"" for everybody that Mandy had declared uncool! Hey, a very cool idea in my opinion! Kayla was also a leader, but that came because she was always nice and tried to help people. And she even tried to help Mandy, but Mandy just wouldn't listen...But...was it too late... According to her own rules, Mandy was about to become ""uncool!""The illustrations in the book are line drawings, colored, which I thought matched the story line, since Kayla was into art as well. You will meet most of the main characters in pictures throughout the 62-page book. The writing is of particular interest since the author has matched the style of talking to age-appropriate children who will probably be reading the book themselves!O'Malley has actually slid in a great lesson, while providing a great story that most children will immediately relate to for one thing or another... Mandy quite easily decided what made a child ""cool,"" including height, whether they wore glasses, and other simply silly things that hurt when you're the brunt of being declared uncool! By simply being Kayla, as she was, the story comes full circle with everybody, including me, quite satisfied!Better check it out and find out who the really cool kids are!

"In many ways, the poetry of John is unusual. Whereas, for me, at least, I think of poetry as romantic, sometimes sexy, but mostly that it is beautiful to read and enjoy. Not so, in the book called My Last Mistress by John. Was it written in the later years of his life as somewhat of a memoir? Had he learned, realized, how he had lived his life and felt some compulsion to seek, perhaps, forgiveness?The book is divided into 5 sections: The Will to Wander, To One Too Near, Exploration and Defeat, At Last the Dawn, and Ending and Aftermath... A number of poems are entitled as if they were written for specific people and indeed sometimes are answers to an individual as if he had received some missive from that individual and chose to respond in poetry form. But the reader only gets to know the Initial: H, P, etc. I was therefore somewhat hesitant to read, to try to understand, and often read only further because I was compelled to read on...From the poignancy of young love in ""Musings at a Lakeside Inn"", or ""Night Over Jersey"", we follow John through the beginnings of temptation such as with ""Secretaries... Then in ""Jealousy"" the cynic starts to appear as he has passed from temptation on to feelings of rightness, or desire...or need. But reality starts to enter when he pens ""Adultery...But like the publisher suggests on the back of the book, John's words are found through his muse indeed, but with love, he's still the worse... For me, this was clearly demonstrated as he wrote the title poem, ""My Last Mistress"" which appeared earlier this week on my blog...Check it out if you haven't yet read... At this point, he has lost all sense of emotional stability, as he discusses his last mistress with a woman he is now trying to seduce. If she was disgusted as I was with what he said, she didn't have dinner with him that night...But is there hope for John? Is this unique book really his life story in poetic form? And does he end life still looking for something--a fantasy he will never find? Or does he one day reach a point when he has no choice but to look backward and reflect on his failings, his joys, his triumphs? Readers will be intrigued to follow John's road--some of his stories are sad, some will amaze you with his inability to see himself at that time, others will be funny, such as the adultery poem--if it wasn't so close to reality...Funny, you know, the poetry of the 70s might just have led to what is routinely occurring in today's world... Except most hide it, deny it, or else Instagram it to the world! I think it was brave of John to create the story of his life--or, if not biographical, to be able to look at the lives of men and put it before readers in such delightful verse!While John is the more thought-provoking of the two writers, Laura Lee presents as a bold, unapologetic woman who happily shared her thoughts. I was most intrigued by her poem regarding her death which was posted earlier this week in my blog. I would admit that was probably due to my age and love of books, LOL!Frankly, Lee's poetry is too allegorical for my taste. I've become so literal in reading so many books that I have come to dislike having to figure out what the author wants the reader to understand about her words. Take for instance, ""Pop the Cork"" Sure, I get the gest of it--the romantic tale in which she shares her feelings and desires... but when I read, I don't want to guess...so, please, could anybody help me understand what ""Pop the Cork"" means if it doesn't mean what I think it means...LOL... Still, when you read such a verse, it does tend to haunt you, wanting you to explore whether this is really, after all, just a story about a genie in the bottle perhaps??? Wanting to be taken home by the Captain!But then when she got explicit, it was very explicit... such as with ""Desire."" Please note that the poems mentioned are included as part of my review, on my blog...You may want to get a better sampling by visiting...And, of course, I was pleased to read about Midnight, with quite a different story... my favorite, of course...This book of poetry is refreshing in its honesty, its depth of emotional sharing, and its topical interest. While some poems are erotic, most, instead, are a revelation of the writers' personal emotions about their individual lives and those within their surroundings. Nothing is sacred, yet it is in no way a form of  content that is not suitable for adults and some young adults.If you enjoy poetry, I wholeheartedly invite you into this memorable merge of the lives of one woman and one man, speaking out to readers in the best way they know how to express their feelings. Their sexuality is the reality of being wholly man and wholly woman, sharing what has been important to them, respectively. For me it was revelatory...and memorable...GABixlerReviewsPaperback provided by publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239LFY9N02T6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRT96K4#wasThisHelpful","R239LFY9N02T6M","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a serious reader, the title of this 17-page book should alert you...If you have never heard of Restless Leg Syndrome and know you have some type of physical feeling that is bothersome in your legs, then this book may be sufficiently long enough to make you aware that something could be medically wrong and can be treated.The booklet is well-written and has presented sufficient researched material to make it worthy of your consideration. However, any author that claims to be providing the ultimate guide is...frankly...lying. This booklet may be helpful, but it cannot take the place of sound medical advice and may result in your not taking the time to talk to your doctor about what could be something much more serious. Yes, the author does constantly refer readers to your doctor...But why then write the booklet and title it as something that will totally solve your problems?As I said, this booklet is well written, presenting as a paper you may write for school based upon topical research. If you prefer somebody else doing that research, then this may be just the book for you. For myself, there were too many references to other diseases--chronic renal failure, diabetes, iron deficiency and Parkinson's disease, to make me feel comfortable about following advice purely from the book.I can only assume that this information was copied out of some other book, perhaps written by a doctor, since the writer uses the word patients, diagnoses, and other references which are easily identifiable as those that would be written by a doctor. Normally in a book such as this that is not written by a physician, you would get references from which the writer is getting his information. You would also normally read about it in first person...For instance,  if I were writing such a book, I would say smething like this...I have found that my right leg is more likely to go into restless leg activity. Since my sister and I both have the disease and we both have a body deformity that shows that our right side is lower than our left side, there may be a correlation between that. However, once I identified that I was experiencing the syndrome...all I did was start moving my legs. By constant extreme motion for a short or sustained time period, I am able to feel relief...  Now in no way would I claim that I have the ultimate guide to eliminating this disease...I am merely stating that I did not research it, I did not consult with a doctor...I just applied some basic logic that if my legs were restless, then I needed to get them moving...Frankly I really got nervous, when the writer started talking about medications...As all of you know, when an individual chooses to write about something that required education and/or experience, I want to know that individual's credentials. Needless to say, I was not satisfied with this book or the author. It is clear to me that the individual is a writer that has chosen the self-help arena in which to make a living...Do check out the range of topics for his books, especially the one on yeast infections written under a pseudonym... Sometimes this type of booklet can at least give you information that you did not previously know. But, really, do you want to learn about health issues from an unknown?

"The culture of the Far East has intrigued me for many years, perhaps having started when I would attend different programs on the university campus where I worked. I loved to see the costumes, the cultural dances... Ultimately, I had used oriental decor in my bedroom when I was still living in my condo. Getting the opportunity to learn more is always an exciting adventure...I was enchanted with The Forbidden City--the architecture, the beautiful grounds...and the idea of secret rooms to be discovered! Wouldn't it be wonderful to visit there for a longer time so we could explore every corner!One of the most important thing in Roman's books is that readers get to meet some of the children from each country. And don't forget to exchange your money into renminbi because you might want to bring home a wawa for your own little girl...Can you guess what that would be? I know it will help her remember all the fun she had when she met the little Chinese girls...Almost everybody has heard of the Great Wall of China, but while it would be fun to visit some part of it...we would never have the time to walk the entire Wall, would we? You may also want to see the terracotta army that was discovered underground. It has come to be the most popular tourist spot...And talking about food, if you are like me, you'll be in heaven--Chinese food is my favorite...I prefer Szechuan but you'll learn about Cantonese food, about Peking Duck and all of the delicious noodles you would have with your meal. I learned about fried ice cream to finish our meal, which I've never had! I've love to try it, wouldn't you?I learned that even though there are other sports there, the favorite sport would be ping pong! And apparently, children start learning early... The coming of the New Year is a very important time of celebration. You'll learn all about it in the book.And as I again flip through the pages, especially about the New Year and those depicting the architectural wonders there in China, I must highlight that something has changed about this series! It is still wonderful--but now, it has been upgraded in quality, color and the artistic pictures available on each page. I was impressed before, but I hope that these recent changes are indicative of a continuation of this fantastic series. And don't forget that there is always a pronunciation, short definition, and English translation of major words in the book!Children are bound to enjoy a group of books that is especially written just for them and with their interests in mind.

"Nora Jamieson has written a spiritual book. It's title is even more intriguing to me--Deranged... While we rarely hear that word actually used, most of us would say it means the same as crazy, mad, insane.. But does it? During the entire book, whenever, a woman asked herself whether she was deranged, I paused, wondering what she was really thinking. So I looked it up and found another definition... to upset the arrangement, order, or operation of; unsettle; disorder...For me, this was a much more far-reaching definition that hit home...Women's lives are often upset, unsettled, become disordered...Right? Would you agree?Deranged brings readers three stories: Reckoning, The Looking Back Woman of Scantic Gap, and The Taxidermist's Daughter.The three women whose lives are explored in this book may be familiar to some readers. To others, it will be totally...weird... There are several similarities...they have an affinity for animals that surround where they live...there is also some type of background story about an ancestor that is now important to the individual. Especially when each of them starts looking inward at their own thoughts, their lives and how they relate to others...I have always been such a person and considered the phrase, ""Know Thyself"" as one of the key points to guide me in life. Do you think it important? In reading Deranged, readers will automatically be compelled to consider the words of the author, considering what they would do in each situation. I found myself attuned to the first woman's story, Reckoning. She finds herself in a supernatural situation where she has been left with the task by her now dead mother, to bury the urn of ashes of her father. But the earth rejects the urn. It is back on the surface the next morning, or, in the last situation, it is thrown at her back as she walks away and hits her!Anna at 60 is trying to figure out what had happened in her parents' life that leaves her, now, struggling to bury her father. She was unable to forgive her mother who had destroyed all the family pictures, leaving her with an emptiness she wonders if she can fill. But then finds a picture of her mother's husband in the urn...when he was young, with her alone...before the children...Why were ancestors deleted from their lives?And then the story of the coyote who is poisoned...She finds one of her goats killed next. Was it in retaliation? Do the coyote mourn their dead? She knew she loved her goats and felt the loss of her own. Did even coyote feel the love and loss of their own as well?There is a mystic quality of both the writing and the stories being told. Each presents a different woman, a different longing for what their life is supposed to mean. The last one, The Taxidermist's Daughter is deep and disturbing, although it is not surprising. When Louise was born, her father wanted a son and her mother allowed Louise to be called Lou and be taught as if he were the son that would carry on the family business--to become a taxidermist...When, on her birthday, her father presented her with a new knife, but accidentally called her Louise, it was the beginning... Lou had died but what happened to Louise? She started by forgiving her mother...Each of the women's stories is so unique and revelatory, that readers will think that each of the characters are different people, drawn from the experiences of those known by the author. And, they might have first come to thought in some way like that since the author is a counselor. But is the mysticism and magic totally fantasy? Or is there really some connection to our ancestors, to the animals around us, to the past and what it was meant to teach us, that we have lost in today's society? The Looking Back Woman helps us ponder that question...There is reference to Native American Tribes and to the time when women were burned as witches, but there really isn't, in my opinion, a definite source of the spiritual guidance in this book. But if you take it as a whole, you will definitely see the connection between humans, animals...all sorts of nature... Have we grown so far away from what we learned as our ancestors lived and taught us. Have we missed something by getting caught up in the hustle-bustle world we now live in. What I can tell you is that whether or not you find new answers for yourself or not, you will, I believe, experience a type of rejuvenation, a period of time for yourself, in thinking of yourself, your life and how you feel about that life. It's a compelling read and I highly recommend you check it out for your consideration!GABixlerReviewsPaperback provided for Review","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUG477NBX6NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996219501#wasThisHelpful","RVUG477NBX6NF","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No matter what the novel, I am always first attracted to the characters that people the book. In The Sunrise, we meet a couple who are both rich and well-known in their area of Cyprus--Famagusta. The Island had gained independence and President Makarios was in office at the beginning of the story. Islanders were called Cypriots and had been living there for many years. Some were called Greek Cypriots due to their heritage while the other primary group was Turkish Cypriots. There was a blend of people--working together in the largest industry--tourism... There was a need for all to support the island and many became good friends, no matter their background...Why is it that some people are allowed to use their prejudices, their hatreds to stir up trouble. It happens over and over, all over the world... While America was dealing with Watergate and the world watched, rumblings and secret meetings and solicitation of supporters was beginning in Cyprus... And before the end of the book, this beautiful island had been destroyed by bombings, forced evacuation and...all those vicious actions that take place during war...  The island had been split and the portion of Cyprus, which included Famagusta--including The Sunrise--had been enclosed with wire fences!Savvas and Aphroditi had owned a hotel in Famagusta and were in the process of building The Sunrise, which would be the most luxurious and beautiful hotel on the island...For Savvas, we watch as he becomes immersed in a greedy need for biggest and best...and more and more... At the same time Aphroditi, who had worked on the interior decisions for The Sunrise, feeling part of the whole organization, was now pushed aside, with little to do. Worse, her father had died and left all his property to Aphroditi. Savvas convinced her to immediately sell all of it and put it to work on their (his) growing empire... Aphroditi was stripped of all of her wealth, except for the jewels that Savvas would give to her. Seemingly to show her off as the wife of the Great Papacosta!During the years Aphroditi had been married and  chose her Jacki O style, she had become friends with the two women who ran a local beauty shop. When the opening of The Sunrise was nearing, it was arranged that they move their shop into the Hotel...For Savvas it was good business since it showed the inclusiveness of the hotel, using both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in all parts of the Hotel. For Aphroditi, it meant continuing her growing friendship with the women... The Turkish family is one of the three families that are spotlighted in the novel. What happens as they are, finally, the last Turkish family who had not left the island is both heartwarming and illustrative of the reality that hate really is only a learned response for strangers, but not for people who have become your friends...The third family we meet through Markos who has become an important second man in Savvas' Sunrise hotel. He was given total control of developing The Claire de Lune, the hotel's nightclub... The atmosphere in the club was so very different from the rest of the hotel, which Aphroditi has controlled and when she saw it for the first time, she hated it. Of course, the club setting had been designed for the night, for different lighting, and for the acoustics needed for the many forms of entertainment that would be provided.Most of all she hated it because it became the central money-making location and Savvas was so thrilled that he began to put more and more responsibility on Markos while he began to think what he was going to build with the money that Aphroditi's inheritance had brought to him!But the final indignity was when Savvas was so committed to his latest creation that he had more or less put Markos in charge, and required him to play host opposite Aphroditi at all formal functions at The Sunrise... Once again, the place of partnership that her wealth should have provided at The Sunrise,  had been ignored...now she had to suffer Markos and acknowledge her jealousy of his relationship to her husband and The Sunrise...This is not an easy book to read, although the author has created an outstanding family drama within the realities of a war zone... I wondered most whether the lives of the characters as presented would have been different if the coup had not proceeded... Markos in particular was loved by everybody, but readers begin to see another side of him as time goes on... Can you blame him? Maybe. But he had been working his head off taking on more and more responsibilities but Savvas had never rewarded him with a change of title to show his present scope of responsibilities, nor had he given him any increase in salary...When he was given the responsibility of acting as host to hostess Aphroditi, was he totally out to take advantage of her or did he really begin to care for her as a beloved woman and friend? For we will see what happens to Aphroditi after she has fallen deeply in love with Markos and faces an unexpected pregnancy...And while that was all happening, Markos had stayed with his family, the last Greek Cypriots to stay in Famagusta...ultimately joining with the last Turkish family to try to survive as the Soldiers invaded each home, stealing, killing...and more...Don't expect a good ending to the novel. Can it be anything other than the truth of the lives of those individuals who are affected by the devastation of war? The novel is provocative, intriguing, and epic in the breadth of the story itself. I was impressed by the author's obvious knowledge of the history and the setting as well as her ability to establish the tension and fear of characters as they are forced to hide or run for their lives, reacting to a totally unexpected attack, while trying to deal with the thousands of tourists who were visiting there and now caught in a place where no place and no people could really be totally trusted...An amazing story for your consideration, featuring both a historical tale of an important coup in 1974, as well as deep family drama! Do check it out!GABixlerReviewsBook Provided by Publisher","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX9YGFZOE1RNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062396099#wasThisHelpful","RX9YGFZOE1RNM","A134C9GVEU5TQE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A134C9GVEU5TQE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Back when Blue Moses first appeared on the scene, it was one of the must-have albums for young people turning on to jazz. I hadn't listened in a coon's age, but decided to add it to my CD collection when I saw that not only had it been remastered, but the price was right. Well, after a couple of listens, I still like it but it doesn't sound as great as I remember it. Maybe it's because I've evolved musically, but it doesn't pack that same stirring punch of yore.I notice that several people have knocked Creed Taylor and/or arranger Don Sebesky and they are much the same criticisms I have seen directed at some of their other work by both fans and artists. Like them or not, you have to give them credit for assembling a stable of some of the best musicians in jazz and making their work accessible to the general public. CTI was the ""gateway drug"" for a generation of jazz fans who are still listening and buying music today while hopefully expanding their musical horizons.On Blue Moses, I particularly enjoy the soaring musical explorations of Freddie Hubbard and Grover Washington, Jr. The CD is not long, just around 40 minutes of listening and it's already over, but there is a lot to enjoy. I particularly like Marrakesh Blues.The CD is housed in digipak form and comes with no extras. But the original artwork is attractive and every time you examine it, you will be reminded of the days when album art drew you to the mysteries within.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93IZGJ09AOAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057FWU3I#wasThisHelpful","R93IZGJ09AOAK","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I only first heard of Pendragon four or five years ago, but the more I hear the more I am impressed. Not of This World is a remarkable piece of work both lyrically and musically. Had this come out in the seventies, you would never be hearing the end of it on the so-called classic rock radio stations and it would have been hailed as one of the musical hallmarks of a generation. But it didn't, and so it (and the band) are left to be discovered by word of mouth.Much has already been said so I won't give it a song by song blow by blow. Suffice to say I like the album from start to finish. I have not yet found it possible to tire of listening to it on a fairly regular basis.This import version of the CD comes cased in a standard plastic jewel box and is accompanied by a very attractive booklet packed with pictures, artwork, album info, and the lyrics. Do be sure to read those as you listen for the first time. It will enhance your enjoyment immeasurably.Note on the import version: When I read the back of the case, I noted that it was meant for sale in Russia, the CIS, and the Baltics only. There are a couple of woofer ""pops"" in several places early in the CD, so I am going to buy the remastered version on the Madfish label to see if the same happens and if there are any other qualitative differences. Happy listening!Note: Bought and listened to the Madfish reissue. MUCH better quality...","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESHO0OBSH67H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000059RQP#wasThisHelpful","R1ESHO0OBSH67H","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Banks of Eden has been fairly uniformly praised and rightly so. It is the Flower Kings' most consistent album from start to finish in a long time. Even the bonus CD, though less proggy than the main disc, is quite enjoyable.What does the listener get? LOTS of tasty prog including a 25 minute opus to get things rolling. First-rate musicians, first-rate songwriting, you just couldn't ask for more. Though I like the entire album, my favorites are that epic Numbers, For Those About to Drown, Rising the Imperial, Fireghosts, and the beautiful instrumental Illuminati.The CDs are housed in a six-panel gatefold digipak and are accompanied by an attractive booklet containing artwork, pictures, pertinent album info, and the lyrics. Banks of Eden is a winner, make sure you own the special edition.Note: The order of the tracks on the bonus disc as listed on amazon is not their actual order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AMOCUUB4C0ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y57OD0#wasThisHelpful","R3AMOCUUB4C0ZT","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some years ago when I was replacing cassettes with CDs, Afro-Classic for some reason had not been remastered and was unavailable. Something made me think of Hubert Laws recently, so I looked this up to see if it had yet been remastered and, voila, here it was!OK, I don't like James Taylor's whiny delivery of Fire and Rain, but here Hubert Laws makes the music itself at least palatable. The real meat is in the dreamy renderings of two Bach pieces, one from Mozart, and a surprisingly astounding interpretation of The Theme From Love Story. This is so relaxing I could put it in the CD player and let it run through it's ever too brief 40 minutes over and over.With the CD comes a somewhat flimsy insert featuring basic album info and updated commentary on Laws' career. If you were allowed to own only one Hubert Laws recording, Afro-Classic should be your choice. It is truly a first-rate piece of work right in there with his work on Jim Hall's album Studio Trieste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2GAL781V1YD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ55N4#wasThisHelpful","RZ2GAL781V1YD","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have most if not all Glass Hammer recordings since Lex Rex and it surprises me that after all of the albums they've recorded most music store clerks give you a look like a cow pondering a new gate when you ask about them. I champion their music to friends and am in hearty agreement with those who consider them one of the best US prog bands. But I am not entirely delighted by Perilous, something seems to be missing, and that something is continuity. Now I know prog can take the listener all over the musical map so to speak, but I like a return to theme at the end of the musical journey. This album just does not offer that.There is lots of tasty organ and some medieval ambiance to go with the storyline and the artwork, my favorite portion of the CD is the interior section. But somehow overall, Perilous just doesn't satisfy the way many other Glass Hammer albums do.The CD is housed in a standard plastic jewel box and comes with an attractive insert containing album info, artwork and pictures, and those all-important lyrics.

"Having missed the last collaboration between Ray Manzarek and Roy Rogers, I am pleasantly surprised to hear how good this one is. Reviews are all over the board, but if you give this an honest listen and are not expecting some blues revival, you should find a lot to enjoy too.Is there are touch of the Doors? Well, yes there are a couple pieces that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Morrison Hotel or LA Woman. But no way is Translucent Blues a Doors redux. The recording starts out enjoyably enough, maybe even a little commercial in places, until it starts to gain traction on Kick. From there on to the finish, it's mostly great stuff. My favorites are Kick, Tension, New Dodge City Blues, Greenhouse Blues, and a pair of instrumentals: the suave, jazzy As You Leave and the rollicking An Organ, A Guitar, and a Chicken Wing. The duo's sidemen put in some great performances, particularly George Brooks on tenor saxophone.The CD comes packaged in a standard plastic jewel case and is accompanied by an attractive insert containing all pertinent album info, a few pics, and the lyrics.

"I had unfortunately never heard of Jan Lundgren until I recently heard him on a Richard Galliano recording. Needless to say, I was impressed so I sought out other works and decided to start with Together Again...at the Jazz Bakery because of one passionate and well-written review.If you hadn't noticed when looking at the track listing, every piece recorded here is a jazz standard. Some have been recorded commercially hundreds of times. Lundgren's trio handles them with skill and aplomb. For a live recording, the sound is great and without any perceivable flaws. Then why not five stars? Because nothing really stands out to grab the listener. You know you love the music, but you just can't pick out any particular moments that are memorable. For the most part, this is the kind of jazz you'd want to hear and expect to hear at a swank dinner concert.Together Again...features an astounding 70 minutes of supremely enjoyable music and an interesting, value-adding booklet that is more than engrossing, with producer Dick Bank's sometimes wisecracking introductions to each musician, his discography, and a rundown of the history of each song, along with pictures.

"It seems from reading the reviews that many people came to the music of Jim Hall organically as his career developed. I came to his music via his later work on the CTI label. I recently acquired a CTI remaster of Studio Trieste that had been long out of print and was so impressed with Hall's work that I sought out some of his back catalogue, choosing to start with Trio: The Complete Jazz Guitar because of uniformly high praise for it.The reason I haven't given this five stars is that though it swings flawlessly throughout, there is nothing that stands out. What are covered here are tunes considered standards and as such are de rigueur for any accomplished jazz trio. Picture yourself in an intimate setting, perhaps in a swank hotel at a dinner concert (up front, of course!), perhaps a quiet romantic evening at home, and that is where you might find music such as this most enjoyable.This release is said to be truest to the original, along with bonus tracks. You get a lot of music for the money, nearly an hour and twenty minutes worth. Plus, the CD comes with an informative booklet with the original liner notes, comments on this edition, a short biography of Jim Hall, and pertinent album info. If you like good mellow fifties-style jazz, you'll not be disappointed with this!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24ZP25BWCNDP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MAM06G#wasThisHelpful","R24ZP25BWCNDP1","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I see that an album has been released on ECM, I know to expect a certain level of quality in both the recording and in the packaging. So even though I had only heard one other Paolo Fresu recording and am only marginally familiar with Ralph Towner, I felt comfortable ordering Chiaroscuro without first hearing a single cut.How did that work out? Well, I find the music to be highly introspective and perfect for when the lights are low and you just want to relax. For those unfamiliar with Fresu, well he's not Herb Alpert. Think more along the lines of Tomasz Stanko or Miles Davis. And as for Towner, his play here reminds me somewhat of the post-shredder work of Al DiMeola when he made his own meditative musical excursions into the land of his ancestors.To me, Chiaroscuro has an even flow with no cut really standing out. Rather it ends much as it begins and leaves you wanting to hit replay over and over when the mood is right. It is accompanied by a protective sleeve like many other ECM recordings and a minimalist insert featuring pictures and bare bones album info. I like both musicians well enough to seek out other recordings of theirs and find out what I missed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z4VJ39DJ1MLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PW6J60#wasThisHelpful","R1Z4VJ39DJ1MLU","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been a fan of Richard Galliano, but for some reason had never heard neither of Paolo Fresu nor of Jan Lundgren. And were it not for YouTube, I may never have come across Mare Nostrum. I was recently posting a Richard Galliano cut to facebook from YouTube and noticed on the sidebar that someone had posted this to YouTube in it's entirety. So I listened, liked, and bought.Mare Nostrum is a very pleasant album that draws it's vibe from the musical heritages of the three musicians, two from the Mediterranean area and one from Scandinavia. It mostly works very well as no one dominates and all are able to demonstrate their virtuosity and their compatibility. My favorites are the title cut, Principessa, the Seagull, Chat Pitre, Valzer del Ritorno, and Para Jobim. There is a pleasing mix of moods and styles, so the listener should never be bored.The CD comes with an attractive booklet that explains the project and introduces the listener to each of the musicians, gives minimal but sufficient information on the music, and offers a few photos of the musicians. I like Mare Nostrum well enough to make me want to hear more of Lundgren and Fresu. It may be a journey to a new musical realm. Let's see how that works out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z138VBB617MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QXD5NA#wasThisHelpful","R1Z138VBB617MV","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While reading Negropedia, it was often hard to tell whether author Patrice Evans' stories and insights are serious, tongue-in-cheek or merely outrageously over the top. Smirks and snickers abound throughout, especially when Evans is dealing with stereotypical subjects.Those who live the urban life are probably acquainted with the humor and the thrust of much of what Evans talks about. White suburbanites like myself may find most useful discussions of Louis Farrakhan and Evans' classification of black entertainers.While Negropedia is not great literature, overall I was amused.

"In the liner notes of the six panel gatefold digipak that houses Savoy Brown's newest album Voodoo Moon, songwriter and guitarist Kim Simmonds is quoted as saying that he thinks the songs on this album are the best he's written since the early 70s. In that, he is absolutely right. I would go out on a limb and say that the collection of songs on Voodoo Moon are his best overall since Looking In, the fine album that marked a radically new direction for the band after the departure of Chris Youlden.On this new album are nine mostly hard charging rock tunes strongly tinged with a taste of the blues. The gritty voice of singer Joe Whiting adds a new dimension and the masterful guitar of Simmonds grabs your attention from start to finish. It's hard to pick what I like best after the blazing one, two, three punch that opens the album. Guess I'll go with the Trower-like Look at the Sun, the instrumental 24/7 and the rousing title cut.If you were ever a fan of the Savoy Brown of old and kind of fell away after the release of a series of weaker albums, it's time to listen again.

"There is nothing subtle about the approach of Black Bone Child to rock music. It's one speed, and that is full speed ahead! With the release of Alligator, the band follows the path they blazed on their debut album.There's nothing here I don't like, and there are a few songs I like quite a bit. My favorites are Be Your Man, Baby Baby, What I Know Ain't Right, This Disease, and Devil's Teeth. It clear that Donny James and Kenneth M have decent songwriting skills and the musicianship gets better as they mature.If you like hard charging, high energy rock and roll then Black Bone Child's Alligator fits the bill. The quality of the music here shows they avoided the dreaded sophomore slump. Unfortunately, the packaging is bare-bones and so the CD case provides only minimal information about the band and none at all about the music except for the song titles. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to buying and hopefully enjoying their third album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOTXR5O1O3RF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035VOS6S#wasThisHelpful","R3FOTXR5O1O3RF","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since Lee Hazlewood's death several years ago, there have been a number of reissues and compilations of various quality that have appeared on the market. I eagerly look for something I haven't yet heard and most eagerly await the remastering and reissue to CD of all of the Nancy and Lee albums. LHI Years: Singles Nudes & Backsides 1968-71 is a pleasant surprise for me because it contains quite a few very listenable pieces I haven't heard before as well as some I have heard and enjoyed many times.Of the ones I hadn't heard (or don't remember), my favorites are The Bed, the exquisite Bye Babe, the thought-provoking Trouble Maker, and the previously unreleased I Just Learned To Run. Of those I know, I like The Night Before (with Nicky Hopkins' swirling organ)and the moody What's More I Don't Need Her most. But I also enjoy the duet Leather and Lace, the gritty If It's Monday Morning, the jaunty Hey Cowboy, and the relentless Come On Home To Me. If I had to pick a cut I don't particularly like, I'd pick Nobody Like You. Otherwise, it's all good!The CD is very attractively packaged, from it's ""bound to be a cult classic"" cover to the fat booklet that features pictures, album info, and a very informative and touching tribute to Hazlewood by his Manager for Europe, Wyndham Wallace. If you are a Hazlewood fan who has been stung by a few reissues and unauthorized compilations, don't be afraid of this one. It's well worth owning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QO0U6DEMK3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079UWV5Q#wasThisHelpful","R4QO0U6DEMK3F","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thank heaven for sites like amazon and hard-working evangelists of progressive rock such as Greg Walker without whom finding albums this obscure but this good would be well-nigh impossible. I had never heard of No Name until a friend in Escondido urged me by phone to get this CD while I was in Utah browsing the deep prog rock inventory of Mr Walker. I took his suggestion, bought the CD, and was floored when I listened for the first time. Here is a band that is clearly on a level with Camel, IQ, and other similar progressive rock bands yet is undeservedly obscure. They are so far under the radar I couldn't find a single posting of their music on YouTube!Apparently, 20 Candles is a compilation of some of their best work, re-recorded for the occasion of the band's 20th anniversary. The music of these Luxembourgers is soaring, melodic, and ever so addicting.The best songs by far are the stunning First Night, the evocative Orient Express, and the rousing Battlefield. But the others are very listenable as well and grow on you as you play 20 Candles over and over.On this CD, No Name offers its listeners well over an hour of brilliantly crafted progressive rock. It is accompanied by a handsome booklet containing pictures, lyrics and album information. If they are this good, it's time to pick up some of their earlier albums as well!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23QB0MMKEC1DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002600NB8#wasThisHelpful","R23QB0MMKEC1DO","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is a given that youths are in need of a positive role model to help launch them into successful adulthood. In popular culture however, role models are often negative and destructive. Miles Dean's quest to ride a horse across the United States, visiting places along the way that are important to African Americans, was a personal journey. But in the end, it also serves as an inspiration for a generation of youths whose most visible ""heroes"" are sports stars and rap musicians. Digressions throughout the book touch on the stories of ordinary black men who overcame obstacles and followed their own bliss to the greatest extent possible through hard work and perseverance. That is important not just for black kids to read, but also for kids of other races who may harbor negative stereotypes of blacks.A Black Cowboy's Ride Across America is an easy read, essentially written to the level of a middle school student. Less print is devoted to the actual trip than to the sideshows along the way. I would like to have read more about Dean's thoughts and reflections as he faced everyday situations. Instead, we read about them only when there is some sort of emergency. In places, the story seems conflated with locations and distances confused. One instance is where the author says Dean passed the split of Interstates 10 and 20 after leaving the ancient store (now closed)in the West Texas hamlet of Kent. At Kent, he was more than 10 miles past that spot. Another is where he was crossing the Chocolate Mountains 81 miles from Los Angeles. I assure you, they are much farther from Los Angeles than that and the route along I-10 is not half as rough as author Lisa Winkler makes it out to be.Sometimes, the author seems to exaggerate the difficulties. While February and March temperatures in Southern New Mexico, Southern Arizona, and Southeastern California might reach the mid-90s, it is extremely unlikely to do so for days on end as the October through March period in that area is generally very pleasant and the coolest time of year.So while the story is inspirational, it is too weakly and haphazardly told to capture adult imaginations. I would recommend this book to a sixth or seventh grade class, particularly one comprised of inner-city youth who could see by reading this that there is another world out there to be seen and that they can be part of it if only they apply themselves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31H3MULI6YF9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468123920#wasThisHelpful","R31H3MULI6YF9K","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Until a couple of years ago, I had never heard of Snowy White in the context of solo artist. When a friend in Escondido introduced me to this several years ago, I was blown away and surely sorry for all the years I'd spent unaware of his huge talent.If you are new to the music of Snowy White, you may instantly be stricken by how his music is infused with the spirit of Peter Green. Many of White's songs are so evocative that you will think that you are hearing Green himself. Listen to Blues is the Road, No Faith Required, I Loved Another Woman (composed by Green), and Sweet Bluesmaker then you will hear what I mean. White recalls other artists too. In Love, Pain and Sorrow I hear echoes of Bob Welch. What I'm Searching For is something you might expect from Santana. Both Bob Welch and Chris Rea come to mind on Too Far Away.Besides those songs, all of which I enjoy, I like most of the rest of the album especially Long Distance Loving, Silence In the Valley, The Journey, Old Number 7, Angel Inside, and Loving Man.With Best of Snowy White, you get well over an hour and a half of great British blues. The CD set comes handsomely packaged and is accompanied by a fat booklet containing commentary by White about his career and notes about each song as well as the usual pertinent album information. If you are a blues/rock fan, you will enjoy this album as the gateway to the sounds of one of the finest blues musicians around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQPQX1JKPSL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UNSZIK#wasThisHelpful","RLQPQX1JKPSL4","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A frequent lament I hear from friends my age is that there is no good music being made today, as if somehow the heyday of everything worth listening to was recorded during the ten years roughly spanning the tumultuous years 1966-1975. My answer is always that there is more good music being made today than you have time to hear if you just know how to find it. Appointment With Mr Yeats is a perfect illustration of that. Here is an album that deserves to be heard at least once by everyone but it will likely fade as so many great albums do, heard only by the cognoscenti.Despite my rather wide musical interests, I had never heard of the Waterboys until a friend introduced me to this several months ago. I picked it up on his recommendation and after a few listens, was hooked for life. Most people of a certain level of education have at least heard of Yeats as one of the high priests of Irish letters, even if they have never read any of his work. This ambitious project adapts his poetry to music, often very powerful music, and what a thrilling combination that makes!My favorites are: The grand, spirited Hosting of the Shee; the majestic, theatrical News For the Delphic Oracle; the evocative White Birds; the mystical Before The World Was Made (previously touched upon by Van Morrison); and the political songs September 1913, An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, and Politics.The CD is packaged in a six-panel digipak and comes with a useful booklet containing the all-important lyrics and all pertinent album info. If hearing this doesn't cause you to make your own appointment with Mr Yeats, it will at least make you a confirmed fan of the Waterboys.

"Those accustomed to hearing Klaus Doldinger as a jazz-fusion pioneer are in for a big surprise when they put Shakin' the Blues on for the first time. For not only is this not jazz-fusion, it's not even really the blues promised in the title! If Shakin' the Blues sounds like a rip-roaring throwback to the best style of 60s jazz, that's because it is. It swings and smokes as Klaus just cooks. Think labels like Verve and Blue Note and you'll know what to expect here.I like the entire album, and like it more and more every time I listen to it. You just have to hear it to believe how hot this is. My favorite cut hand down is the stunning Delilah; but I also am stoked by Blues Toosy, which sets the pace for the album; the extended jam of Careless Love; the swinging Waltz of the Jive Cats; and another swinger, That Bluesy Sound. Most impressive to me is that Doldinger's compositional skills make the more traditional standards covered, with the exception of Delilah, seem weaker by comparison.Shakin' the Blues is a digitally remastered compilation assembled from from several albums Doldinger recorded with his jazz band in Germany in the mid-sixties. The players are all first-rate, especially evocative of the period is the Hammond organ of Ingfried Hoffman. Album info is scant, but the insert at least gives all the necessary information about who played what on which song and when the song was originally recorded. If you like the type of 60s jazz exemplified by the Verve and Blue Note labels, you are going to love Shakin' the Blues.

"Ever since the demise of the Third Reich, people around the world but especially in the West have searched for answers as to what made Hitler tick. Now I don't profess to know as I did not know him personally, but this documentary Understanding Hitler comes closest of any I have seen to the view that I have developed over my years of fascination with the subject: that is that people didn't follow Hitler because of his antipathy toward Jews and foreign (i.e. non-Western) minorities such as the Gypsies, but rather despite that aspect of his personality. They followed him because he offered them hope when everything seemed hopeless and because he best articulated a bright and heroic future for the nation.This two DVD set covers many areas: The development of Hitler's worldview in the context of the times; one of the best explanations of Mein Kampf that I have heard; a sample reading from the modern English translation of Mein Kampf; an assortment of propaganda films both light-hearted and very serious, plus a film on the Secret Life of Adolf Hitler that revolves mostly around social gatherings at the Eagle's Nest and his relationship with women, particularly Eva Braun.I give it only four stars because the main documentary makes a couple of very serious errors and glides over how Hitler came to discover the small political party which he subsequently dominated. Understanding Hitler does not make clear that it was the Bavarian Army he joined and not the Austrian Army. It fails to mention that he fled to Bavaria to avoid military service in his native Austria because he despised the multi-cultural and shambolic nature of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And as for joining the German Worker's Party, he wasn't particularly searching for a place to fit in but working as an army spy supposed to be keeping tabs on extremist groups that sprung up after the First World War when he stumbled upon a meeting of their's and was drawn to the party's philosophy. There are other errors, put it down to sloppy editing.Viewers might find interesting the section on Mein Kampf where it is explained how poorly translated earlier English editions  of Mein Kampf led to the generally held view that it is a poorly written and rambling book. Actually it isn't ""written"" at all, but taken as dictation from a series of soliloquies Hitler gave while pacing his prison cell and later at his home.Of the propaganda videos, my favorite is the one that shows a happy, ordered, and carefree lifestyle in Berlin under the Nazis. The best and rather chilling film, however, is the one that shows people with all sorts of disabilities and which makes a case for euthanasia chiefly because of the cost to the state of caring for them.The Secret Life of Hitler is interesting mainly because of insights given by associates of Hitler who survived the war and it's portrayal of Eva Braun as kind of a self-absorbed airhead.Overall, this set is well worth the small price paid and those interested in the subject should find it quite illuminating. No booklet is included, just two discs and the minimal information provided on the clamshell.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R62052ZS7EJW9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AUTC0G#wasThisHelpful","R62052ZS7EJW9","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the first reviewer, I vacillated between awarding A Mediterranean Odyssey four or five stars, but unlike that reviewer I decided on four because there is absolutely nothing new here. Yes, there is the virtuoso instrumentation, the enchanting vocals, and the expert manner is which Loreena McKennitt is always able to set the scene for the listener. But as a long-time fan, I just feel a sense of having been here before every time I listen. However, if you just need a go-to album for a road trip or just want to introduce someone to McKennitt's music, this box set is a perfect choice.Disc one, the Olive and the Cedar, is a compilation of songs from other albums that relate to the Mediterranean theme of the album. The entire side is good, but my favorites are: The Mystic's Dream, with it's quasi-religious vibe; the hypnotic Tango to Evora; the percussive Caravanserai; and the beautiful instrumental Sacred Shabbat.Disc two, From Istanbul to Athens, is comprised of recordings made from various concerts on her 2009 tour of the Eastern Mediterranean. My favorites are the evocative The Gates of Istanbul; Marco Polo; the percussive Caravanserai once again; the soaring Santiago; the enchanting Beneath A Phrygian Sky, and another superb rendition of Tango to Evora.A Mediterranean Odyssey is a great value as well, available at this time from an amazon partner for under ten dollars. The accompanying attractive booklet containing album information and lots of pictures from the tour only adds to the value. If you already have everything McKennitt issued previous to this you may consider passing this by but I think the addition of the live CD makes this an album worth owning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ELCT6FDBB8U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MTTZ6M#wasThisHelpful","R3ELCT6FDBB8U2","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Had a friend's daughter not used a tune by Bitter:Sweet as bumper music for her website, I might never have heard of them. The song she used was so intoxicating, I contacted her to find out the title. And as I find downloading lame and ephemeral, I looked the group up and took a chance on the entire album. And so? Well, not only is the voice of Shana Halligan alluring but the music is both interesting and quite different from the styles that usually attract me. She reminds me vaguely of Ambrosia Parsley, the delightful vocalist for Shivaree.Here's what I like best: the sultry Come Along With Me, the energetic The Bomb with it's interesting vocal changes, that incredibly intoxicating A Moment, the evocative Trouble, and the dreamy Everything. Two I don't care for are Waking Up and Love Revolution, mostly because of what a friend refers to as cheesy ""R2D2"" noises that randomly intrude. Some of the other songs are beset by such noises to a lesser degree. Might that be the Monte Nido Frog Choir listed in the credits or is it mere electronica?The couple who comprise Bitter:Sweet are backed by a shambolic orchestra that help make Drama at least a fun album. And no one can say that Halligan and Kiran Shahani are not talented songwriters and arrangers. This was released in 2008, I hope it's not the last we are going to hear of them.Drama is issued in digipak form and is accompanied by a flimsy booklet bearing all pertinent album info and the lyrics.

"Like the previous reviewer, I was hesitant to buy Lifelike at first because of the lack of album information. Now that I own it, I have found that it is just a potluck album, with no overarching theme or any kind of continuity. That being said, there are at least a few tunes to like here.On Disc one, I most enjoyed the funky Shirokko and the melodic, well-defined Guna Guna. The rest of the side I found rather weak, particularly Ostinato, which is too drawn out and pseudo-psychedelic. Disc two starts out well with Jadoo, a spirited mix of funk and big band elements. Sambukada is an exciting piece with a Latin touch Doldiger-style. Then Stormy Monday moves along just fine until Etta James kind of ruins it with repeated ""Lawd have mussy"" shouts. After that, the rest of the side is just OK.Jazz fans might be excited by guest appearances of Richard Tee and Herbie Mann, but I was unimpressed with the participation of Etta James and the Average White Band. Overall, Lifelike is not a bad album but its not one I would recommend. There are far too many good Passport albums available to have to settle for this mediocrity. Take my word for it and get a different live Passport album instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QOGXE1ORHBV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DJ7QBS#wasThisHelpful","R2QOGXE1ORHBV0","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those who are familiar with the biblical Revelations, the warnings of the coming of the Anti-Christ, and Armageddon to come will surely recognize a secular version of those prophesies in Pallas' powerful and electrifying XXV. This is a theme album on which Pallas and its new lead singer Paul Mackie thrusts the band to the forefront of the world of prog-metal along with bands like Pendragon, Opeth, and Pain of Salvation.I like the entire album immensely, but here's what I enjoy most: the stirring Falling Down, in which man's hubris has us heading for the fall; the driving, pounding Crash and Burn; the foreboding and memorable Monster; the bombastic Alien Messiah (as Anti-Christ) with his promises of glory if only we follow him; the dark final warning of Twenty Five Good Honest Men; the eerie, mesmerizing Violet Sky; and the haunting finality of The Unmakers Awake. An enjoyable DVD that features live excerpts from the album and a slide show is also provided. Very nice, but I wish that the entire album live could have been shown.XXV is packaged in a standard jewel case with the discs stacked, though easily removed. The accompanying booklet features lyrics, album info, and inspired artwork that fits the mood of the music. Pallas doesn't release many albums and this one is said to be the sequel of another theme album released twenty five years ago.

"Even though Pendragon have been around a long time, they haven't been on my horizon for long so I don't have that deep well of listening experience I can draw on to compare and contrast with previous work. But if their other work is anything like Passion, all I can say is that I have really been missing out on some great music. Simply said, Passion is a powerhouse, a real piece of work that should thrill all fans of great progressive music.Here's what I like best: The hard-driving, exciting title cut; the relentless, enticing Empathy which is sometimes evocative of Pain of Salvation; the chaotic Feeding Frenzy, and the spectacular Skara Brae. There is also an enjoyable ""progumentary"" DVD that is added as a bonus, but as is usual with these sort of things you will likely watch just once then go back to enjoying the great music you bought the CD to hear.The packaging is first-class and the booklet that accompanies the discs is filled with with all the information you'd expect including the lyrics which are interspersed with artwork that will surely add to pride of ownership.

"Paatos will never be accused of flooding the market with new material, in the twelve-something years they have been recording they have released only four full-length albums, an EP, and a live album. Breathing is their fourth, and it has been a long time coming.Those already familiar with Paatos' other work will be delighted to hear that singer Petronella Nettermalm sounds sexy as ever. My favorites are the simmering In That Room, the excellent title cut, the wistfully beautiful Precious, and the fast-paced Over and Out that harks back to their earlier work.The CD is simply but elegantly packaged in a six-panel gatefold digipak and comes with a equally elegant booklet that contains just a picture of the band and the lyrics. Other information is presented on the panels. Paatos is one of the finest Swedish bands on the scene today and you should find their music to be ultimately satisfying.

"It is generally a good idea to see a film before obtaining the soundtrack if only to understand the sequencing of the music. Most soundtracks are mere snippets of music and dialogue and Delusion is no different. I have yet been unable to see the film but bought the soundtrack anyway on the strength of its association with Barry Adamson.Here's what I like: the title track, with it's Spanish guitar licks; the eerie quasi-spiritual feel of Il Solitario; the Latin ambience of Fish Face; Go Johnny, a tense exciting piece that is pure Adamson; the humorous rendition of La Cucaracha; and Anita Lane's gutty, slatternly rendition of Lee Hazlewood's classic These Boots Are Made For Walking which is the soundtrack's only complete song.The Delusion soundtrack is not for everyone, but the mere fact that you are reading this shows some interest. I would think that it would appeal most to fans of Barry Adamson's musical vision. If you buy, I recommend that you listen when there are no distractions for maximum enjoyment, otherwise it will amount to disjointed background noise.

It is even a great go-to recording for the experienced listener having a hard time deciding whick FK CD to bring on a road trip.Every song is well chosen and delightful, but I particularly enjoy In the Eyes of the World, the re-recorded version of The Flower King, the re-recorded Stardust We Are, and the dynamic cover of Genesis' Cinema Show.This version is accompanied by an attractive booklet containing lots of pictures, pertinent album information, and the lyrics as well as an informational insert in Japanese. If you can't obtain this version, you'll miss out on Cinema Show but in return you'll get to hear something I didn't. But do obtain one of the versions however you can and you will be rewarded with some fine music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WHHLP2EDE514/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006341Q#wasThisHelpful","R2WHHLP2EDE514","A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This author has many crime novels in print. They are all competently written with interesting characters in sometimes unusual locations. The Jake Hines series is particularly interesting in that it follows a lone Mexican with a checkered past who ends up in a small city on the eastern border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. Over a period of years Jake Hines gets his life together, becomes a cop, a detective and now head of the investigations squad in Rutherford, Minnesota.Noontime Follies is a title with someone’s tongue firmly and cheekily implanted. And even though revealing the inner meaning of the title wouldn’t ruin the plot of the crimes herein, I think it’s more fun and more intriguing to suggest that readers who want an incisive crime novel about human relations and corporate maneuvering ought to read this one.This novel is, in part, about the corporate development of new genetically engineered food crops which may or may not provide substantial benefits to mankind in the form of better nutrition. The issues are several and do indeed address questions of ethics and morality. After all, mankind, since the beginning, so far as we know, has been trying to improve crop yields, both to enrich the tribe and provide adequate food beyond immediate needs.Some find that questionable, particularly as to motive, and may be provoked to unusual actions. Noontime Follies, raises some interesting questions along those lines as well as its more intimate plot lines. A worthwhile experience with a satisfactory conclusion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCFCZTX6T1DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XU6R3ZG#wasThisHelpful","RLCFCZTX6T1DJ","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More than one mystery intersect in another adventure from Kate Charles. She’s an experienced expat author living in England exploring the mysteries of faith, love, family and violence in her books. In this fourth Callie Anson novel, it is her circle of acquaintances who are involved in a variety of actions and decisions, old and new, that drive the story and its sometimes complicated relationships.Callie travels from London to Cambridge to attend a reunion of her classmates, graduates from theological seminary. She will have to confront both the scenes and at least one man with whom she was deeply emotionally involved during her time there: a man who unceremoniously dumped her in a shameful and hurtful way. Around her are arrayed classmates and older theologians who help Callie’s travel to emotional understanding. Meanwhile, the new love of her life, a London policeman who functions as a Family Liaison officer, becomes involved in the murder of a young man in Paddington Square. As intriguing as the convoluted relationships among the religious that are examined in this story are, the murder of a school boy with only a single tenuous link to the other plot, leads to examinations of working and absent parents, stresses in modern society and pressures of various kinds on law enforcement. Together, the development of these separate plot lines present a realistic picture of modern life.These ideas and more are nicely embodied in the characters brought to the page by the author. The messages are many perhaps too many, but the author’s delicate touch leaves them to the reader to accept or pass over. None is presented in such a way that one feels manipulated or into forced acceptance.Charles nicely places the action in several consummately English locations. No generics here. She’s been called a most English of writers and compared favorably to Agatha Christie in these aspects. All in all an excellent, calm and deliberate story that can leave a reader with considerable food for thought.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJH1KIFJVABT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKQ7SU0#wasThisHelpful","RJH1KIFJVABT1","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author John Talton hails from a multi-generational line of Arizonians. As such he is privy to the historical development of the state. In 1915 the US Census registered fewer than 7,000 residents. In 2015, more than seven million. Lots of changes in that time. Most of them make Talton unhappy. His unhappiness occasionally gets in the way of a powerful, nuanced and complicated tale of murder and mystery.Talton is a fine writer and you’ll realize it from the beginning. His sensitivity and understanding of more subtle pressure points in the relationship between Maricopa County Deputy Sheriff, David Mapstone and his wife, Lindsey, provide both complications and additional rhythm to this story.Yes, Mapstone is still in Phoenix, first as a private investigator after his friend and former boss, Sheriff Mike Peralta, is defeated in the most recent election. Almost nobody likes the new sheriff in town and Mapstone is suspicious when the man coerces Mapstone into regaining his job as a deputy. This is particularly odd because Peralta is on the run, hotly pursued by an assortment of law enforcement types for stealing a large consignment of unset diamonds he was supposed to be guarding. It’s also an interesting development because it has unforeseen consequences for the new sheriff.Nevertheless, and against his better judgement, Mapstone takes the badge and starts an investigation into a suspicious thirty-year-old death. Meanwhile, Peralta is still missing, Peralta’s wife is agitating Mapstone and vague accusations against Mapstone’s wife are clouding the picture.The writing is clean, the characters are well delineated and separate and the pace relentless. Talton has a fine sense of when to insert emotional scenes that are important to readers’ understanding of character motivations and to readers’ invitation to bond with the attitudes of the protagonist, not just in relation to the crimes involved, but to the ongoing changes in the landscape of Arizona. And these are changes that the author resignedly accepts but not willingly. In some ways the novel is a plea for a return to older, simpler values.Like others in the Mapstone series, the story winds up to a thrilling and tense solution. Its well worth the ride and as a bonus, offers a look at some troubling aspects of modern Arizona.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60U23Y2E6V0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204004#wasThisHelpful","R60U23Y2E6V0I","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know you are in the grasp of a master story-teller when the ground becomes unstable underfoot in the first four pages. Given her longevity and varied output in the crime fiction genre, this is not surprising. Nor is it unusual that you have to read the entire novel to learn the neat resolution of that first chapter.By turns clever, thoughtful, gut-wrenching and uplifting, this novel is very contemporary in its themes. The author’s long-time protagonist, Jane Lawless, now a licensed private investigator in Minneapolis, in addition to carefully overseeing the operation of her restaurant, faces complications at every hand, some of which are reflected in her sexual orientation. Yes, there are more and deeper examinations of gay and lesbian themes in this than readers will have encountered in earlier Lawless adventures. However, as always, Hart is tasteful and circumspect in her writing.Long-time buddy, the ever flamboyant Cordelia Thorn has purchased and is restoring an ancient, historic theater building in downtown Minneapolis. As is the case with many building that suffer several alterations, there are oddities in this building, as well as several tales relating to more turbulent and law-skirting times. Seeking to create yet another restoration of the old building leads Cordelia and Jane down dusty narrow stairways and through ancient locked doors.What crimes lie beyond those doors relate in surprising ways to a current case of murder that involves Jane and her father, Criminal Defense Attorney, Raymond Lawless, together with the family of a nationally known Country-Western singer and his inner circle and family.With prudent care and thoughtful reveals, Hart entices readers to keep reading and turning pages. Her ability to parcel out important facts, bit by bit, is of a high order. The entire story is brought together in a complete and eminently satisfactory manner after Jane and Cordelia sort out several mis-directions. A most enjoyable experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKSY3XC1P895K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250047692#wasThisHelpful","RKSY3XC1P895K","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leopold Blake is a bright, wealthy, ego-centric and occasionally oddly behaving entrepreneur. Among many enterprises he owns a security consulting firm. In this story, Blake is hired by the Director of the Louvre to examine their various security routines. Yes, the one in Paris. Blake discovers an important daVinci (no, not That one) has been stolen and a rather bad fake put in its place. Blake’s response is to rip the offending painting off the wall and get himself detained and handcuffed by the museum’s security forces.The plot now focuses on finding who stole the daVinci, why, and retrieving it. Complicating the plot are an assassin after Blake, a New York cop who may be Blake’s girlfriend, and a French restorer who works at the Louvre and is in love with the director. Somewhere offshore is a ship named Thanatos which apparently is tasked with hacking and maintaining surveillance over the world’s financial markets. And there is also a wealthy holding which is at risk of being sold to the wrong people.If all of this seems a bit unclear, that appears to be the purpose of the author. The pell-mell plot has a lot of loose ends or, blind alleys, if you prefer and the writing is riddled with clichés and sloppy writing. But the pace is so relentlessly swift, one tends to overlook some of the deficiencies. Found this to be both fun and teeth-grindingly frustrating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM7XRM1ZHYVPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYW9VHC#wasThisHelpful","RM7XRM1ZHYVPE","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cover copy calls this a work of intricacy, precision and psychological complexity. I cannot agree more emphatically. Yes, it's another in what one hopes is an endless line of Dalziel and Pascoe mysteries. And yes, it contains powerful, evocative writing.""Here four men labored with shovels, their faces wrapped with scarves, not for disguise but as barrier against the stench of the decaying bat droppings they disturbed, while high above them a sea of leathery bodies rippled and whispered uneasily as the sound of digging and the glow of bull-lamps drifted up to the natural vault.""Peter Pascoe's wife, Ellie, is hard at work on her book. Yes, she's hoping to be a published author one day. And then, abruptly, inexplicably, there is an abduction attempt on her. Though the attempt is thwarted by Ellie's nimble-mindedness, the act sets in motion a vast, complex investigation and a plot that ranges over wide spaces of the English coastal area and pits D&P against some very nasty characters. Adding to the complications are difficulties over jurisdictional questions affecting the National Interest.This is a complex story with a large cast of interesting characters and a strong sub-plot.

"Jack Higgins still has the touch. This is an absorbing, fast-paced thriller in the best sense of the word. The plot is current, and quite believable. Once again, ex-IRA terrorist Sean Dillon is teamed with Scotland Yard DCI Hannah Bernstein and her boss, Brigadier Charles Ferguson. He runs an elite intelligence unit responsible only to the Prime Minister of England. Apolitical, the unit has, inevitably, become an action unit as well.Ferguson enlists Dillon in an attempt to run down a mysterious group known as “January 30.” This is a group that has murdered a variety of people operating in the shadow world of international espionage and terrorism. January 30 appears to play no favorites, having been identified as killing former KGB agents, American diplomats and even Israelis. Now they plot to destroy the tenuous peace process taking hold in Northern Ireland. ANGEL OF DEATH, told in flashbacks and present-day action, carries the reader pell-mell from Ireland to England, to America, Beirut, and back. Along the way the reader is treated to imaginative convoluted twists and accommodations of the diplomatic games nations play, set against brutal and abrupt physical action. You’ll see Dillon the charmer with a gift of gab, Dillon the stone killer and Dillon the experienced, intelligent agent, provocateur.As always, Higgins characters are sharply drawn and always consistent.

"Irony, conspiracy, anger, abuse and police corruption, judiciously blended with persistent bad weather. What more can regular readers of British crime fiction expect or desire? Author Cutler is an experienced successful author with many solid novels to her credit so readers will expect and receive everything a well-conceived examination of a water-soaked community, West Mercia, in Northern England will entail.Two former cops with sterling records, Fran Harman and her husband, Mark Turner, now retired from the active police service are called north to help a newly conjoined police force in clearing out their old unsolved cases. In this instance, it’s the disappearance of a popular member of the community, married to an even better known footballer. Ten years earlier, Natalie Foreman, mother of two boys, and wife of star striker Phillip Foreman, disappeared, leaving behind in her sedan beside the roadway, one dead son. Her body and that of her other son, Hadrian, are never found. Foul weather hampered the search. Hence the case is still open.Fran and Mark are disconcerted to discover, upon arrival, per their contract, that there are forces arrayed against them, some blatant, others more subtle and thus more dangerous. They have to sort through a lot of stuff including personal attacks to solve the mystery.The writing is excellent, smooth and consistently logical. The opening prologue is like a sock in the gut. Character development is also excellent with some interesting and unusual characters, scenes are well-tended and the narrative is tightly secured.The novel moves well, although there are instances toward the end which seem a bit convenient and somewhat hurried. Still, a reader is left to contemplate a nicely presented turn of moral complication at the end. And a reader would ponder long over whether to move to reside in such a green and unpleasant land.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DYFPGV2UO3IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9W1QOO#wasThisHelpful","R3DYFPGV2UO3IR","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fascinating. Funny. Clever, and, at the end, rife with tension-filled risk. Today, most of us have some sense of the shorthand of text messaging. In the mid-1980’s that was a skill yet to be mastered. Digital technology and communication thereby gained was still only on the horizon for many people.But, as is true of so many inventions of the clever human intellect, there is almost always a potential for evil, as well as for good. Here we have a young man, Peter Talbot, by name, who has built upon a rock of a computer, a modest information service. Forces of both good and evil immediately discover ways to use Peter and his service for their own ends. The resulting expansion is making Peter a wealthy man, but it is also making him vulnerable to forces that first would use him and then destroy him. Will he win out in the end?Like many English crime novels, the story is heavily populated with quirky, unusual, and odd characters and ordinary folks who act in quirky and odd ways. Consider George, an old ex-paratrooper who is at odds with the world. When he saves Peter from undesirable attention, Peter offers him a job. A shadowy figure we are expected to accept at face value, apparently some sort of government spook, enjoins Peter to provide client information, some of whom are obviously on the wrong side of the law, prostitution and espionage appear in the mix. Young hackers or computer game developers wander in and out and then the American Mob show up.Readers will have already caught on to the odd style, often cheeky observations of the characters, the unusual and often abrupt short—hand style that cuts off potentially tedious descriptive passages. The author employs a sometimes wild narrative style that fits well with the story and the characters.There are some aspects of the book that may put readers off. Logical progression sometimes is let go by the boards in favor of a faster pace. Foregone conclusions and almost-obvious results crop up from time to time. Still, the characters are charming if mis-identified. Talbot, for example, is not a computer hacker, he’s a smart, up-coming young businessman. He’s also wise beyond his years, careful around murderers, fit enough to get out of tight scrapes and has a way with certain female characters.High tension, screaming car chases, a brief air-borne chase, guns and bombs all make this a delightful cyber-crime reading experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQW32AODEICGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSAYQ16#wasThisHelpful","RQW32AODEICGX","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a fan of Cat DeLuca from the beginning of the series. Her private investigations business, concentrating as she does on errant (mostly male) spouses, is aptly named Pants On Fire. She has two partners (Cleo) and a dog (Inga). The novel starts out with a routine case and looks intriguing enough, but then Cat is distracted when her running partner (Inga) finds a dead body in a neighborhood park.Things get messy from there on and in spite of often being surrounded by large men competent in the darker arts who have to protect her from numerous stumbles, wrong turns and the occasional homicidal maniac, she manages to once again survive and solve the riddle at the core of this story.I really liked earlier stories in this series but this seems to have descended into chaos. There are serious lapses in logical sequences. Fact checking and editing took the occasional day off. There are sections in which the story line wanders and I got the feeling the authors (the series is a collaboration of three Chicago-land sisters) had insisted on including every joke and snarky aside a sharp editor had cleaned out of earlier stories.The best part of the narrative, for me, are the two chapters detailing the long-delayed formal church wedding of Cat’s mother and father, attended, naturally, by several generations of DeLuca relatives.Still and all, most of the characters shambling through the pages have sufficient endearing qualities, or nasty proclivities to satisfy many mystery readers.

"Novel carries an unusual style of narration that is deep, thick and thoughtful. To achieve the psychological depth of the novel, the author has resorted to a slow-moving, textually impressive, and imprisoning sort of narrative. There is mystery here, almost from the first page. There is danger here lurking in the convoluted relationships that develop between a character “Alva” who may or may not be real, and a young and hedonistic girl.Alva apparently works in a gallery where he allows himself to be immersed, almost drowned, in the art on display. He is, we are led to believe, the product of the mind of an author. The author, female, sees her characters as a line of figures, waiting at her front door and across her yard. She will, she believes, bring them in, these insubstantial figures, give them depth, life, problems and solutions. She sees herself as a God-figure.But, Alva jumps the line. In the middle of the night he forces his ethereal presence into the narrator’s mind. It is just about the only human substantive act he successfully completes. The conflict this character initiates roils the water of the author/narrator’s existence which leads to this stylistically difficult, yet compelling novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UFII2PLZ8H7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGNR520#wasThisHelpful","R2UFII2PLZ8H7G","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bai Jaing is an interesting protagonist with an unusual background and a high potential. Unfortunately, she doesn’t get there in this novel. Unmarried, she believes herself to be a Buddhist but with tendencies toward violence as a solution. She hangs out in the near vicinity of extremely vicious people in San Francisco. Her family consists of two young girls, a Chinatown warlord lover whose mother watches over the kids when Bai is captured or off throwing knives at suitors, and a gay partner. Together, Bai and Lee run a sort of investigatory operation.Bai styles herself as a finder of missing people, apparently people who mostly don’t want to be found and resent it when they are located. Bai is a fetching, rapacious sexy and morally flexible woman who has the talent and street awareness to avoid being killed and yet manages to require being saved from death or great bodily harm a number of times by the men she associates with.The plot begins with a drug sting mounted by the San Francisco Police that goes wrong and a cop is killed. Even more important, it appears nearly a quarter million in cash and the equivalent in heroin goes missing. All of that fades inexplicably into the background as Bai and Lee are asked by a drunk cop to find a man for them. Whether the missing man has anything to do with the heist is unclear until the very end.In between episodes of violent escapes, Bai has to fend off marriage proposals from people she doesn’t care for, while keeping her peace with her mother. If some of this seems confusing, well, it is. The ability of a writer to inject some level of humor into scenes in a violent turbulent novel is tricky and requires exquisite timing. In this case not so much in evidence. Additionally, the author appears to believe that all Caucasian cops are drunks, slovenly or lazy.There are some very nicely done scenes and some well-laid out dialogue, but the narrative drags in many places and has the feeling at the end that the author felt a sudden need to wrap things up.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3ETV34OIWT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K9MJ2IA#wasThisHelpful","R3S3ETV34OIWT2","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A delightfully thoughtful and intimate treatise on the art and techniques of human kissing. One of the problems with most pornography is its common theme of aggression. Even when the participants are acting passionate toward each other, the only objective appears to be penetration and climax.Here is a delightfully written antidote. Kissing with one’s lover can be a delicate, subtle and intimately varied experience as the author illustrates. Here, the object is intimacy, emotional connection, joy and satisfaction not necessarily of the mind-blowing variety.There are a couple of clever links to relevant television sitcoms which I enjoyed. The short, well-organized pamphlet is discreetly illustrated with one anomaly (the dressed officer kissing the fully dressed lady’s fingers), and a few lapses. Drinking Champagne from your lover’s rounded belly if graced with an outie simply doesn’t work well. Minor caveats.Here is a well-considered piece of directional writing that will benefit most couples of any age.

"Another powerful and excellent offering from a superb writer and publisher. I won’t reveal the basis of this excellent political suspense novel because that would spoil the surprise. It’s a stunner and a real stick in the eye.Sean Duffy is an older, nearly burned-out, detective and something of an anomaly. He’s a Catholic copper in the Royal Ulster Constabulary of Northern Ireland. The RUC is an intensely protestant law enforcement agency and in the time this novel is set, the mid-eighties when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan ruled the western world, Duffy had his internal problems in addition to solving the murders and other crimes. Crimes of all sorts, large and small proliferated in Northern Ireland during this period.Duffy seconds a younger, less experienced, detective in their Belfast unit when a prominent couple is discovered executed in their loungers before the large television. Their son is missing. As the case develops, Duffy struggles with near despair over the level of violence and economic downturn in the country. He struggles as well with an attractive offer to move to England and join MI5, the British equivalent of the FBI. The job would entail far less action and more desk work.  Duffy is torn, not least because the offer comes from an attractive woman, the Gun Street Girl of the title.McKinty is a powerful writer in complete control of his medium. The novel thunders along amid rocks, bullets and political and emotionally fraught maneuvering by Duffy’s superiors. It is by turns, thoughtful, moody, precisely on target and exploding with action. The darkness is expertly leavened with humor of a conscious sort that only enlarges and enhances the fine characters and setting. It is amazing that McKinty hasn’t been swept up by one of the large publishers. A rare and outstanding effort.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R149T40RWWX1QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCJH8#wasThisHelpful","R149T40RWWX1QC","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It began on June 6, 1994. A significant anniversary date in American history. Fifty years earlier a generation of America’s youth was storming a beach at Omaha and Utah in the invasion of Fortress Europe. Normandy.In 1994, however, things were different. Louis Solomon, principal narrator of this James Gang adventure, picks up a pink telephone message slip. Solomon is a graduate of the Barrett college class of ’74. He has three close buddies, and the narrative of the novel pretty well synopsizes their lives. These lives, disparate as they are, are nicely handled in narrative chunks that relate to the main adventure and don’t slow it down. Contrarily, the lives and resulting talents of the quartet serve to enhance the results of the adventure.For many years a hefty statue of a woman of uncertain heritage graces the campus of Barrett College. Sirena of the title is removed from her pedestal, retrieved, decorated and redecorated as is the wont of rampaging underclassmen and women. Eventually, in 1959, she disappears for good. Years pass and in 1994 a wealthy graduate offers millions for her return, including a healthy reward for whoever shows up at that year’s reunion celebration with Sirena in tow.The four former roommates come together and decide to try to retrieve Sirena—the first hurdle, then get her to the college in New England in time—the second hurdle, and protect her from other alums who want the reward, and the glory.The writing is excellent, the characterizations are first rate and the situations range from understandable to off-the-wall zany. The timeline works, the dialogue is funny, trenchant, and the developments for all four make total sense. If things are just a tad slow at the very beginning, a little patience will result in a very enjoyable experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPIEDOO8EGN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCU8LCY#wasThisHelpful","R3SPIEDOO8EGN6","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sounds. They’re stuck in your head. A muzzle blast from a .38. Garfield’s rasp. Bogart’s lispy rhythm and Cagney’s high-pitched rants. The sea, restless, running past Key Largo punctuated by blasts of tommy guns echoing off the greasy walls of that Chicago garage on St. Valentine’s Day, so long ago. And of course you remember the looks, the swaying hips, the invitation to whistle from the women who graced and sometimes motivated the greed, the sex and the violence in the hard-boiled crime story.Well, here they all are, reborn in slinky, sly and quippy dialogue and crashing plot, pulsed by dangerous swinging saps, out of control thugs, cops and robbers. From the slimy Mr. Jupitor to the gunman with the roscoe in the dark doorway behind Jimmy Shin, the action never lets up and the dialogue races on.Here they are, eleven tales of the hard-boiled, urban warrior, stalking his targets down the soft summer ribbons of asphalt, and always with a smart retort, even as the pistol fires. Ben Solomon has got it just right.Richard Prather would be pleased, I think.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19FQ9LPV4TC5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIZ7IBI#wasThisHelpful","R19FQ9LPV4TC5N","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Murder, fraud and greed on a grand scale, clashes of culture and intriguing misunderstandings litter the well-trodden ground in this novel. The strong and vibrant writing helps draw the reader in to a world long hidden from western understanding. And even with the recent deluge of news focused on the wars in Iraq Afghanistan, and Pakistan, western knowledge is rooted as much in lack of understanding of Muslim and tribal mores. Dissecting the motives and the perpetrators of these crimes and the application of justices is extremely problematical.All of that requires a carefully constructed, well-written narrative with characters that speak to us even through the veil of poorly understood history and culture. And here it is. Add the setting, that mysterious –to Western sensibilities—culture of the Middle East, and one has the makings of an enthralling novel. And here it is!The writing is superb, the tension almost unrelenting and the incisive eye of this author is everywhere available. This is a fine novel and deserves every rave it will acquire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNJRFKP24YSIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKZ0R10#wasThisHelpful","RNJRFKP24YSIL","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author is a lawyer from Portsmouth, England. The novel is rooted in the legal arcana of the British legal system. In point of fact, the novel is a lengthy, detailed critique of that system and an examination of the sometimes extensive damage the system does to innocent, wrongly accused, citizens.Robert Abramsky is a very successful small town attorney who is faced with a client who started a specialized security firm. The security firm is absorbed into a much larger conglomerate and then unethically destroyed. Abramsky out-maneuvers the big firm and in turn destroys the vindictive man responsible. Readers will recognize that the tale will not end there.Lawyer Abramsky’s main opponent is a nasty, vindictive man with a long memory. Years later, he still seethes over the memory of his destruction, conveniently overlooking the fact that he was, in fact, the guilty party. He determines to destroy Robert Abramsky in a most hurtful way, by ruining his honest reputation as a lawyer and member of the community. Corruption takes many forms and this intriguing novel examines several.Although the pace of this overlong novel is almost as glacial as the legal system it addresses, the writing is strong enough and the plot is complicated enough to keep many readers engaged. In addition, the characterizations of many of the cast of dozens, is intriguing. Retribution fits its title nicely and the world-wide scope of the story plus the curiously intricate cyber security the author lays out all tends to keep one attention. Definitely not a soft summer beach read. Rather, a thoughtful careful examination of important elements of today’s society.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUSDR0JAQTAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FDTSI7U#wasThisHelpful","RUSDR0JAQTAU","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another intense, convoluted and complicated case for Moirah Dru and Richard Lake out of Atlanta, Georgia. Dru, a former cop, is the head of a PI firm that specializes in finding and protecting lost, damaged and at-risk children. Her lover and frequent partner is a lieutenant in the Atlanta PD.A three-year-old cold case, the murder of a sixteen-year-old girl engages Lake who in turn engages Dru to help him solve the murder of this wild teen-ager. The more they probe beneath the surface, the odder and more troubling facts suppositions and cross-currents bubble to the surface. The duo’s task is complicated by the association of some principals in the case with local motorcycle clubs and gangs. Soon, the coiling tentacles of the case engaged the FBI and other police agencies in other states.The novel is an intense and thoughtful look at motorcycle clubs and gangs, their motivations and rivalries. Locations range across multiple state and city jurisdictions and the author has made an effort to illuminate some of the restraints and difficulties encountered when law enforcement pursues cases across state and municipal boundaries. The contrasts between an upper-class private school with all its social niceties and the rough and tumble world of the biker are interesting.There are several incidents of violence and incipient head-breaking. They are well-handled on the page and will, I suggest, keep readers engaged. The pace of the novel is by no means pell-mell, but the tension is palpable, the characters genuine, the dialogue both pert and realistic. A very satisfying experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UFVX5G1PXSW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHZH1IO#wasThisHelpful","R3UFVX5G1PXSW7","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Second adventure novel by this author. Let’s say you are approaching the beginning of your middle years, and you have a reasonable if not very exciting job and you really aren’t thinking about adventure, certainly not with a capital A. I mean, you tend to go to Disneyland on your vacations. But you are single with no real attachments, certainly no romantic entanglements.You have a neighbor in the Corning, New York, apartment, a younger couple with almost unpronounceable names, who have moved to Corning from India. Sriram and Vidya are a lot of fun to socialize with and Jason Talley, our earnest protagonist, enjoys being with them, particularly since it appears that Srirham, an electronics designer, is on the verge of some big-time breakthrough in the computer field. One day, Srirham, in a oddly conspiratorial manner, importunes Jason to hold for him a package, a package Srirham plans to personally deliver to his mother soon, back home in India. Jason, of course, agrees. Wham! The very next day, Srirham and his lovely wife are found dead in what is considered to be a murder/suicide circumstance. So what does Jason do? Of course, he decides to deliver the package to Srirham’s mother, as a last gesture to his dead friend.And so the adventure begins. In no time at all, Jason is off on a package tour to India. There, he meets a girl and soon, the tour is somewhere back in the dust. Now, if you begin to suspect this is a pretty over-the-top novel, you would not be mistaken. Reality and realism are not strong suits for this author. But if you say, oh, well, I’m along for the ride, then you’ll be in good hands. Benoit is a pretty good writer and he infuses the book with a high level of energy, great pace, enough twists and misdirection to keep the reader guessing, and if you just suspend every trace of disbelief you’ll have a good time with this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAS3A4GZYVW32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590582527#wasThisHelpful","RAS3A4GZYVW32","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An outstanding debut novel. Rosenfelt’s writing is brisk, honest and takes the reader directly into the lives of these very real characters. Defense lawyer Andy Carpenter endures the sudden death of his father, a retired prosecutor in New Jersey. Prowling through the records of his dad’s estate shock follows shock when Carpenter discovers an estate worth 22 million dollars. Where the money came from is a mystery that Andy sets out to solve.Meanwhile, to honor his father’s memory, Andy pursues appeals and wins a retrial for a death row inmate his father had prosecuted years earlier. And then dangerous and mysterious events begin to wrap themselves around Andy Carpenter, events that seem to bring him ever closer to the ultimate resolution, his own demise. In spite of his sometimes misplaced wit, Carpenter struggles through his moral and real dilemmas to a logical and satisfying solution.There are one or two places where clichés intrude but they are minor. The tale is convoluted, full of puzzling contradictions and masterfully told. A real winner in the crime fiction genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LNZGEZ91QOH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446612537#wasThisHelpful","R11LNZGEZ91QOH","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the perks of reading in the Crime Fiction genre, is that most of the good authors one reads are producing at a fairly steady pace. It is possible, therefore, in one’s lifetime, to follow the development of an author. Assuming they do develop.Such an author is Harlan Coben. And “One False Move” is arguably his best book to date. It is certainly an excellent, engaging novel. Sports agent Myron Bolitar is hired to look after a star player in a women’s basketball league that is just getting under way. Initially it appears to be a fairly simple task. Then Myron discovers Brenda, the player, has been getting threats, and than an old nemesis of Myron’s is trying to acquire the star’s contract. After that, things get complicated. The more involved Myron gets, the more involved and complicated the situation becomes.The complexities include political aspirations, Myron’s family, Brenda’s family, Myron’s former basketball coach, and other significant relationships. The author’s sure hand with this complex tapestry attests to his maturity in a book filled with tension, energy and enthralling characters. Author Harlan Coben has plenty to say in his thoughtful, powerful way.

"As with many collections of short stories by Crime authors, this one is a mixed bag, quality wise. It contains several really nice, taut, economic stories which are entertaining, surprising and a pleasure to read. There are others which don’t quite measure up, although all of them are readable. The anthology was conceived as a way to provide some financial support for the popular co-owner of one of the best mystery books stores in the nation. Once Upon A Crime, the store for which the anthology is named, has been voted by readers of CrimeSpree magazine, the best independent mystery bookstore in the entire country. It is also a recipient of the Raven Award.I wish this anthology achieved that distinction. It comes close. The stories are widely varied by a motley collection of new and experienced crime writers. It is, as I have said, entertaining, but its greatest value may be in that it introduces readers to a range of writers and the quality of their work. Among the writers are several award winners of note, including William Kent Krueger, Reed Farrell Coleman, Max Allen Collins, Gary Phillips and David Housewright. It’s a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q764J7P5I4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932472851#wasThisHelpful","R29Q764J7P5I4W","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"M. D. Lake is a retired college professor who writes tidy campus-based mysteries for his own and others' amusement. Lake's series protagonist is a campus cop, Peggy O'Neil, who works at a major Midwestern university that is described in these books in a way that seems suspiciously like the University of Minnesota. One can imagine some of Lake's potential targets.Peggy O'Neil is a street-smart cop who's wicked sense of humor is tempered by her Minnesota nice. Her character is engaging, she acts as one would expect such a cop to act who is also burdened with a strong sense of justice. She and her friends are a lot of fun to read about and the book is intelligent and competently written.Once upon a Crime tells the interesting tale of a prominent Danish scholar, named Jens Aage Lindemann, who comes to campus to conduct a conference on a storyteller we've all heard of, named Hans Christian Andersen. Lindemann is a bit of a reprobate, an aging lecher who doesn't limit his predations to unmarried women, nor to women around his own age. Inevitably, someone takes offense at his actions and he's found with his head bashed in. The city police appear to be heading in the wrong direction and tenuous reputations are at stake. O'Neil, following her independent turn of mind, sails off to nab the killer.This puzzle has a fascinating if occasionally appalling cast of characters and if the pace lags in the belly of the book, the twists and surprises are ultimately satisfying. A good solid addition to the body of mystery literature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TC408ORERPDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380775204#wasThisHelpful","R1TC408ORERPDS","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Michael Norman writes in a straight-forward kind of abrupt style that can be off-putting. An almost endless march of short declarative sentences doesn’t allow for much rhythm or flexibility in approach. Nevertheless, the author has constructed a novel with an excellent foundation, logical development, interesting characters and a long-running, intense disagreement at the core of the story, a disagreement which is a real.To the small southern Utah community of Kanab comes a former Denver detective after the destruction of his marriage and his career. J.D. Books is hurting. He needs a job and he needs to recover. Through the probable intervention of his father, Kanab being the town of his youth, Books lands a job with the Bureau of Land management as the local representative of law enforcement. The town is divided among those who favor environmental concerns for preserving the natural wonders of the area, and others, who see the vast expanses of land as development potential.David Greenbriar leads an environmental alliance which, in spite of internal disagreements as to strategy, seems to be winning the local fight to protect the millions of acres of relatively unspoiled land against the desires of developers. Books is hardly settled into his doublewide mobile home when Greenbriar is murdered, shot once while camping in the wilderness. With some reluctance, Books BLM boss agrees to let him run the murder investigation, his experience being far broader than anyone in the small community. This decision puts Brooks into conflict with his family’s friends and his efforts to balance impartiality with finding the killer makes an interesting story.In the end, Norman’s straight ahead style, serves the story well and while twists and turns are not part of the picture, “On Dangerous Ground,” is a solid detective story with comfortable characters many readers will want to see again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2R0XLV0D7AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590586921#wasThisHelpful","R1H2R0XLV0D7AD","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keely Bennett teaches American Literature in high school and was the adviser to the yearbook club. Then her husband commits suicide in a rather messy way and he is found by the couple’s young son. After that, the story gets really dark and messy. I’ll admit right up front that I am put off by authors who feel they have to search for synonyms for “said” in order to make dramatic points and who use a lot of italics for the same reason. For those reasons, the impression I take away from this novel is perhaps more negative than it should be.Billed as a dark psychological thriller, author MacDonald, who certainly can write well, seems to take the easy path in many instances in a story with considerable potential, with surprising twists and a protagonist I found difficult to like. Keely Bennett makes obvious mistakes, seems unable to think for herself in many instances, and is ultimately present at the final resolution, rather than creating it. She’s very good at despair and hand-wringing. Her son, Dylan, on the other hand seemed the very essence of a modern teenager, beset by adults who neither understand nor listen to him, a boy with a mother one step from being institutionalized, supportive friends at school, yet possessed of keen insight and a willingness to act while his mother dithers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNU4DZ4WKUHTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC0SEQ#wasThisHelpful","RNU4DZ4WKUHTG","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another Kate Henry mystery. Henry is a wise-cracking, sometimes arrogant, yet nicely vulnerable sports reporter. She specializes in baseball, following the mythical Toronto Titans in spring training camp. Pretty routine stuff for this tough, experienced, baseball writer, you'd expect. Then another reporter, this one young, attractive and with something of a reputation for round-heeledness turns up dead on the beach and a Titan player is jailed for her murder.Naturally, Henry is pressed to take on the task of proving the accused is innocent. So far so good. What makes this novel noticeably better than average, is the skill and knowledge of the author. Gordon has created a feminine protagonist with a very particular view of her world. It's a view that blends humor, cynicism and a quick tongue with obvious knowledge of baseball. In fact, reporter Kate Henry has a good deal in common with Author Alison Gordon. This is all to the good.If you're a baseball fan, you'll likely enjoy this novel.

"How did I miss this one when it first came out? I know the author, been following the man’s writing career. He gave me a copy of this book. Still, I only recently got around to reading it. And discovered to my chagrin what I’ve been missing. Delayed a really fine read. Here is Chicago, in all its grit and insouciance, it’s rhythm and its nasty side.Chicago is part of Cook County, and they have a sheriff, a law enforcement presence, and all the problems an urban county can absorb. Comes now one Sergeant Francisco Leal, back after a drug bust gone bad, resulting in a grievous wound to his person. Leal, your basic resentful cynic, doesn’t enjoy busting bad guys to see them get off too lightly, and he isn’t always quiet about his feelings, even in front of the judge. Thus, “the Dark Gable Incident,” which gave Leal a certain cache, positive in some circles, but negative in many others.We get a really good look at the simmering anger that lies under Leal’s professional demeanor and now he has a new assignment. Along with two young, inexperienced detectives and another sergeant, Leal is assigned to a politically sensitive case that is so cold, the detective’s fingers get numb just paging through the files.Almost a year previously a major player, a judge Miriam Walker, went missing, was found dead some time later, and there were no arrests, no apparent motive, no leads.. A random victim, possibly of a carjacking? A very cold case. Now, elections are coming and the Sheriff is being beaten up over this still unsolved case. A team is assembled in an obvious political ploy, to re-examine the case and Leal is second in command, due primarily to his seniority. The team assembles with the initial understanding that there’s almost no upside to the situation.The characters are precisely drawn, their actions methodical and deliberate and logical. The action and the tension are low-keyed for a long time, but the writing is so fine, I was drawn inexorably to page after page until the climax exploded off the page.

"When Catherine Saylor decided to become a private investigator, she made a conscious decision to avoid the slugs and bottom feeders of society, those for whom violence was frequently a way of life. Instead, she chose the high road of corporate security, of white collar crime.Now however, she’s forced to confront a brutal killer who has framed her lover, Peter Harman. There is more to this story of the search for justice than first meets the readers’ eye. In what is to become almost a hallmark of Linda Grant’s writing, her protagonist must follow several threads in order to finally successfully solve this case.Hampering her efforts to clear Harman, P.I. Saylor has to cope with several overprotective associates, not the least intrusive of whom is her former husband, Dan Walker. If, at times, the author’s attempts to establish her protagonist as a capable, stand-up kind of person, get in the way of the pace, the story is interesting enough that we forgive these minor excesses.RANDOM ACCESS MURDER is a good story, well told.

"Although it received at standing ovation in 1984 at the Venice Film Festival, this is not one of Fellini's great works. It does satirically poke air out of the pre World War I upperclass society and raises all sorts of metaphorical questions about the place of the individual in that society. The music and the brief conflict between the passengers on the luxury liner and a group of Serbians plucked out of the water sets up the final confrontation between Italy and the Austro-Hungarian battleship.

"Way back in the nineteen-sixties, Lawrence Block was writing fiction. He's been doing that for some time now. Any lover of mystery fiction should be at least passingly familiar with Mathew Scudder, Block's recovering alcoholic, New York ex-cop, and free lance consultant.No Score is not Matt Scudder. It is a Chip Harrison mystery, written over twenty years ago, recently reissued and it is a tribute to this master writer how well it stands up. Oh, sure, you'll find some dated references, some gender-related attitudes that we've (mostly) grown beyond. Still, this is a fine, well-written story, and if the mystery is a little light, well, Chip Harrison's tribulations in his innocent if highly focused teen-aged attempts to score are delightful in their frivolity.As is always the case with a Block story, the characters are keenly observed, strange, wonderful and more often than not, very funny. The dialogue is right on and each scene is carefully drawn. At the same time, some of No Score's explicitness may be offensive. An enjoyable read, a quite different dimension of Lawrence Block, but not, perhaps to everyone's taste.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IGWFMULK3HXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GTLS4I#wasThisHelpful","R1IGWFMULK3HXQ","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Boy, can this author write. Hard, restless, muscular prose that drives the story relentlessly forward. Barbara Saranella is in full command of her work. Just as her hero, Munch Mancini is in control of her life—pretty much. She should be. Mancini is an unusual anti-hero—almost. She’s defied parental control, been on the street, run away, done drugs and knows an almost incredible array of those who regularly travel the mean streets of any large city, particularly Los Angeles, where this story takes place.Mancini is getting her life together, what with a regular job as an auto mechanic and her start-up limousine service. She’s managed to put together a deal to buy a house, and her relationship with her eight-year old daughter is improving every day. But then trouble arrives in the shape of long-time girlfriend Ellen Summers. Mancini believes in relationships, almost to a fault. So when Ellen’s mother and stepfather are murdered and Ellen, ex-druggie, ex-stripper ex-thief is released from jail, Munch is immediately and unwillingly swept up in a swirling cesspool of low-life thievery, gun-play and deadly attempts to find hidden boodle.There are clever twists, crackling blunt dialogue while Munch has some second thoughts about helping Ellen in what is becoming more and more evidently a criminal enterprise. She doesn’t want to become collateral damage. More importantly she doesn’t want any of this to touch her daughter, Asia. But Munch Mancini is not one to sit around wallowing in self-pity or wringing her hands worrying about whether she’s up to the challenges life is throwing at her. Get out there and do it sister! That’s her thing and let the chips—and bodies—fall where they may. I say bravo. One terrific novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M99CKWVZ977P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743213866#wasThisHelpful","R2M99CKWVZ977P","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some ways, I found this to be a difficult book to engage. I had to re-read the first 50 or so pages, to be sure I had certain relevant facts clear in my mind. But, upon reliving the first hundred pages or so, I was hooked.The novel is one of searching. Police are searching for a killer. The killer is searching for his daughter. And a lonely adopted woman, with little to go on, searches first for her birth mother, and then for family, possibly lost forever, in the unconcerned mists of a previous century. The solution to the several mysteries will determine who lives and who dies.With heartfelt care the author has set out to explore the uncertainties, the second-guessing, the frustrations, of researching adoption records, of locating long-missing family members, of issues of estrangement and the inexorable passage of time.Clearly, the author is most interested in the principal but fractured family of the Schlegel dynasty. Two brothers, building a successful business in Chicago, see their progress and their shared business stunningly shattered in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The resulting split between the brothers leads, in part, to the mystery of a missing Schlegel heir, a young woman so repressed by the society and her father that, at the end of the Nineteenth Century, she follows her brother’s lead and runs away from a small town in Northern Minnesota, to brawling Chicago.The novel relies on several coincidences, of timing and of actions which may be bothersome for some readers. However, the stories are so interesting, the characters so well drawn and well-thought out, so filled with emotional drama, that this reviewer, at least is willing to overlook those minor irritants. In the end, the novel is about relationships, good and bad, and it speaks in universal terms to anyone open to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PU20PBXO4TT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148953315X#wasThisHelpful","R3PU20PBXO4TT8","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Robert Timberg is an award-winning journalist. He brings impressive credentials to this project. Those credentials alone are enough to inspire a high measure of confidence in this book. It is a further measure of the trust one can place in this astounding work that author Timberg immediately addresses possible reader skepticism in the opening paragraph of the section in which he provides notes and explanations of his research.This is the intersected story of five graduates of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. The men are John McCain, Robert McFarlane, Oliver North, John Poindexter, and James Webb. This is a story of courage and honor, of lying and deception, of politics and statesmanship. This is a story of the lingering effects of Viet Nam on those who bled there, and on those who didn't go; and on the entire nation. This is truth.No toneless, apparently neutral history text, THE NIGHTINGALE'S SONG is so well-written, it is difficult to put it down. The book examines the role of Viet Nam in their lives, and in the connection of those five to the Iran-Contra Affair. In fiction we often talk of suspense, passion, pace. It's all here in this astonishingly well-written, mesmerizing chronicle. By turns wry, cynical, humorous, and insightful, Timberg, an Annapolis graduate and ex-marine himself, is able to provide an insiders view of the way in which our Navy goes about choosing and promoting its officers. The contribution to our understanding of the political, military, and emotional events of these recent decades through this book is immeasurable. And it rings of truth.Author Timberg has thoughtfully provided an extensive bibliography, a good index, a list of interviewees and copious research notes. A memorable book, likely destined to become a classic of its type.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NHONK7ODCIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684826739#wasThisHelpful","R9NHONK7ODCIZ","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More complications for poor Vicki Bliss. This is another outing for fans of the author and it delivers what has come to be expected. The premise, however, is a little hard to take.In order to get Vicki to Egypt in harm's way and smack in the center of a complex robbery caper, she must agree to become something of an Egyptologist in order to be inserted into a luxury cruise on the Nile River. Her purpose there is to observe and report to some intelligence agency in Germany, anything of interest regarding the whereabouts and activities of one or more master thieves.She's given little accurate information, makes several serious mistakes and misjudges any number of people. Her lover abruptly appears, with a bride Vicky knew nothing about and the bride's mother. Murder, mayhem and multiple maneuverings abound and at times it's difficult to keep the whole thing in focus.Produced with a good portion of tongue-in-cheek humor, Peters once again takes her characters and her readers on a complicated romp of near epic proportions. Consider that there is the river cruise, escape through the desert by car and jeep, a train-ride, more than one rescue of damosel from dreaded captors, an exotic locale, several bumbling folks, conspiracy inside conspiracy, and you get the idea. For myself, I would have preferred that Ph. D. Vicki Bliss had been smarter at times and more instrumental in the final fix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJPYPG5W40BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446602485#wasThisHelpful","R1YJPYPG5W40BW","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NIGHT JUDGEMENT AT SINOS AmaZby Jack Higginspb 1997 Berkley 289 pgs.ISBN 0-425-16199-4It’s been said before and I agree, Jack Higgins is a superb story-teller. What’s more, he has an apparently inexhaustible supply. This story was originally published in 1970 and it’s a measure of Higgins talent that it is still a cracking good novel more than twenty years later.The island of Sinos has become a prison for the holding of political prisoners of the then Greek military regime. Deep sea salvage diver Jack Savage, and former British commando is hired by a wealthy shipping czar to retrieve a certain gentleman from this impenetrable fortress called Sinos. Sounds simple enough doesn’t it? Not the task, that’s downright foolish. Sinos is heavily fortified and almost unapproachable. The idea seems straightforward enough, though, even for a man used to the labyrinthine plotting of the Middle East. Mr. Savage is wrong.As we have come to expect from Higgins, NIGHT JUDGEMENT AT SINOS is a small action in a wider movement of the struggle between good and evil, ethics and expediency, and as always is a well-plotted story that keeps the pages turning.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BAGRI75WFP9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VC3U4O#wasThisHelpful","R3BAGRI75WFP9S","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the seventh in the author’s excellent southwestern US crime series. It features two former members of a county sheriff’s department. In this one, a new sheriff has been elected. This is reflective of changing times in and around Phoenix, Arizona, which in real life it is all too apparent the author detests.He is also very unhappy with changes in the city of Phoenix. This unhappiness gets in the way of a smoothly organized, nicely flowing contest between the forces of evil and those on the side of the angels. Nevertheless, Talton’s talent as a conceptualizer of excellent plots and formidable characters is fully apparent as newly minted private investigators, Mike Peralta and cold case specialist David Mapstone, team up on their first case, the suspicious death of a young woman from Arizona who dies in a fall from a condo balcony in San Diego.There are a number of issues immediately apparent and Mapstone really wants nothing to do with San Diego. His first wife still lives in the area and he’s struggling to come to terms with his current wife’s absence.Part of Talton’s talent is his ability to gradually weave the personal elements of his characters past and present beings into the reality of the dangerous case Peralta and Mapstone face. The two principals are marvelously different in their backgrounds and their approaches to detection and law enforcement. The differences add materially to reader enjoyment of the novel. The author uses these differences effectively throughout this entertaining and satisfying novel.A copy of the novel was supplied to me at no cost by the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQY1K3U2BXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146420134X#wasThisHelpful","R2GQY1K3U2BXR","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sad. With the prestige of a strong tasteful press's reputation, one would expect better from any work, including a debut novel. The writing is problematical, the author's research is lacking in several important aspects and he is apparently unable to conceal his scorn for both the wealthy and the workers who live on the island. He has little patience for most other aspects of modern or historical American society.His murder victim is someone who, like Bernie Madoff, has managed to rip off nearly everyone he comes into contact with. He has zero redeeming characteristics. Unlike Madoff, he has alienated his entire family as well. There are a few people in the book you might want to hang out with for an afternoon beer, Chief of Police xxxx and his friend Fiona among them. Otherwise, if Axelrod is to be believed, the entire island, summer and winter is peopled by shallow, insipid careless people who squander natural beauty, sleep around and relentlessly steal from each other. But not in very interesting or clever ways.The plot is sufficient unto itself, and wraps up as it should. But the book is not entertaining, it depresses, and as such I cannot recommend it to any reader of crime fiction.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T44WPG40LFDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IFX58HY#wasThisHelpful","R2T44WPG40LFDM","A1GPD5JPCFSB9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPD5JPCFSB9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Karen Armstrong’s ST. PAUL: THE APOSTLE WE LOVE TO HATE is a fairly brief scholarly biography of the apostle Paul, the man to whom many of the Epistles in the Bible are attributed.  Armstrong’s work is quite frank.  She informs readers that some of the letters once thought to be Paul’s very likely are not; she points out that those letters that are more certainly Paul’s encourage equality and agape love, not the misogyny, anti-Semitism, and social elitism many see in some instances.  Also, when something about Paul is unknown, Armstrong frankly says so. Back matter lists seventeen pages of resources – the Bible and strong Bible scholarship – to support Armstrong’s claims.Even with all the scholarship, readers don’t have to be seminary students to read and understand this book.  Laypeople with some knowledge of Paul can read this and understand it, particularly if they're willing to read it at a ""study"" pace (my reason for four stars instead of five -- don't try to gulp this book down too quickly).  This work will help readers see the man said to be the first Christian writer in a new light, and thus see his writings in a new light.I would recommend this for Bible study classes or church libraries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ930A0HENC7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544617398#wasThisHelpful","RZ930A0HENC7K","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Do you like movies of the 1930’s, ‘40’s, and ‘50’s – or maybe even an old silent film from the 1920’s?  Then Adriana Trigiani’s ALL THE STARS IN THE HEAVENS is a novel you will enjoy.Yes, this a novel; it’s fictionalized.  But, closely following real events, it deals with real people from the Golden Age of Hollywood and all the power plays, adventure, and forbidden romance.  Loretta Young’s role seems to be the most prominent in this novel, but readers also see plenty of Clark Gable (of course, because of the maybe-not-so-secret-after-all romance between him and Young that resulted in the birth of their daughter), Spencer Tracy, David Niven, Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy, and many more prominent Hollywood people of that time.Readers begin and end with a frame story set on the autumn of 2000, where we meet Roxanne Chetta, the great-niece of Loretta Young’s assistant Alba and her scene painter husband Luca.  This framing is momentarily confusing, but it doesn’t take long to see where Trigiani is going.This novel kept me engaged throughout; I wanted to see what happened, or, if I knew, how Trigiani handles the particular event.

"Tracy Borman’s QUEEN OF THE CONQUEROR is a biography of Matilda, the wife of William the Conqueror.  Borman begins with Matilda’s defiant refusal of William’s proposal of marriage because of William’s illegitimacy, then her acceptance.  Readers see Matilda grow to become a very unusual queen for her time.  She was more than just a consort and producer of heirs; she actually ruled as regent many times when William was away.Because there are few primary resources about women of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Borman does have to rely on what resources she does know and deem trustworthy (and many good ones are listed in the back matter).  The front matter consists of genealogical tables for both William and Matilda and maps.  Besides the resources (notes and bibliography), there is an index in the back matter.Borman gives us a reasonably good physical picture of Matilda, based upon tapestries and drawings—a small but capable woman, and William as very large for a man of his times, and, at times, temperamental.Though the style is very readable, even for non-historians, this is a scholarly work.  I would recommend it as supplemental reading for a history class studying eleventh and twelfth century Europe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLXIB73AWO34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005OCYQZ4#wasThisHelpful","ROLXIB73AWO34","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TEXAS INGENUITY: LONE STAR INVENTIONS, INVENTORS, AND INNOVATORS takes readers from the beginnings of Texas (Sam Houston) to Texas food and restaurants (Dr Pepper, Whataburger, Chili’s)  to entertainment and music (Buddy Holly, Van Cliburn, Selena) to sports and athletics (Babe Didrickson, Bill Pickett, the Kilgore Rangerettes).Obviously this book covers a broad spectrum of people of Texas, including some transplants; there is even a mention of Mary Lou Retton (actually born in West Virginia, but moved to Houston to study gymnastics) and her Romanian coach Bela Karolyi. The style is very down to earth, perhaps at times a little too conversational (a little disconnected) in places.  It is readable for both its intended young audience and adults. Each segment tells where to find out more about the person being highlighted, cites good, scholarly references, and offers readers at least one Texas Tidbit.However, there are instances when Elliott needs a good copy editor.  I spotted several confused words and some typographical and punctuation errors.  (When discussing Anthony Lucas, on page 28, did Elliott perhaps mean Croatian/Romanian, not Roman?) In my eyes, this took the author’s credibility down considerably. Particularly if students will use this book, it must be free of errors like these.Entertaining? Yes.Good reference for students?  Yes, with another good “cleanup.”Who I am:  I hold degrees in English and library scienceHow I came to own my copy of this book:  I purchased it at an event for local authors at the Fort Worth library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNOPRWEMH4VP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933177292#wasThisHelpful","RNOPRWEMH4VP1","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first thing most people will notice when their printer arrives is that it is slightly larger than most printers.  It will take up a bit more desk space, but I believe it’s worth it.  The ink receptacles are very large, so there are fewer worries about running out of ink at a bad moment. Also, the ink levels are very visible from the right side.  It is very easy to fill these receptacles, but the instructions encourage the use of gloves and protection in case of spillage.We found the instructions for installation to be well-written and clear (high five there!), but new users MUST allow about two hours or maybe a bit more for installation.  The ink receptacles take about twenty minutes to prime, and, of course, software downloads take some time.  We had NO installation problems, but, as I point out, some steps do take a while.I also like the way the paper feeds from the back and is quite visible.  Users can quickly see how much paper is ready to go.The printing quality is very good for both text and photos.

The size is fairly generous for kitchen hand towels, and the “hand” (feel), apparent durability, and absorbency of the fabric are all good.As is my habit with all kitchen, bath, and bed linens, I washed them with chlorine bleach -- something my mother, a nurse, taught me to do when she taught me how to do laundry when I was a teen.

Griff knows that Evan knows about the yellow book, but the older man really wants nothing known at all about it.Readers see three points of view in this novel.  Some of the novel is told from Evan’s point of view, the present day, in a suburban Anytown in Canada; some of it is told from the viewpoint of two soldiers who were stranded on Kokoro-Jima during World War 2:  Derwood, an American, and Ohiro, a Japanese .  Some parts seems surreal, and the readers – and the characters involved – wonder whether they are dreaming or something worse.  The writing style and some calligraphy make it very clear to readers where and when they are and in whose head.This is a well-written novel that tells three young men’s tales – and readers will see whether or not the wall between Evan and his grandfather comes down or stays up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R1S3Q5LU97KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763669733#wasThisHelpful","R1R1S3Q5LU97KN","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three very promising students – Charlie, Georgia, and Alice arrive on the Harvard campus during what appears to be the fall semester of about 1997.  They come from varied and not-really-wealthy backgrounds, and sometimes “frenemies” would be a good word for their relationship, but they are there and ready for their college years.During their senior year, there is a murder on campus.  Julie Patel is found dead near her dormitory. The prime suspect is Rufus Storrow, a charismatic but seemingly eccentric faculty member.This novel shows the impact this murder had on these three students, not just at the time of the murder but ten years later, when the students from that class return for a memorial tribute to the slain student.This novel kept me engaged, but I didn’t really feel satisfied at the end.  It is a psychological thriller, not a mystery, and I was never really clear about who murdered Julie.  Also, I grant that college life can be all about experimentation with sex, alcohol, and drugs, but not all students are that way.I also wondered as I read why Kirman chose Harvard for her setting; she is a Yale/Columbia graduate, and Yale and Harvard, I understand, are bitter rivals.This is Kirman’s debut novel.  I see potential here, but this is perhaps a three-star piece of work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRTEI04ECKONG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139318#wasThisHelpful","RRTEI04ECKONG","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stephanie Smith’s 300 SANDWICHES is a mix of memoir and recipes.  Her boyfriend, referred to mostly as “E.” has promised her that he will marry her if she makes him three hundred sandwiches.The very idea that Smith would be willing to do such a thing could be off-putting to some readers; if E. really wanted to marry her, would he have her jump through hoops like that?  But I counter this by pointing out the price of the bridal ring set that Smith wants; many women would be happy with a more modest ring set.  So perhaps Smith is the winner there?  We’ll see.Smith also details other things going on in her life during the “three hundred sandwiches” period, in particular, her father’s terminal illness and her wish to have him escort her down the aisle to E.  Smith and E., like all couples, do have occasional quarrels, and sometimes readers might wonder whether Smith and E. might give up on the sandwiches – and the relationship.Though the narrative part has some strong points and some very weak points, the recipes that Smith shares are some that I like.  Though she lives in Brooklyn and would likely have fairly easy access to not-so-commonplace foods and ingredients, most of the ingredients in the sandwich recipes are available at most supermarkets.  I will look the recipes over again and try some.If you liked JULIE AND JULIA, this is a similar work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MLGNDOKMWELJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391607#wasThisHelpful","R3MLGNDOKMWELJ","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Consider the world of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD about twenty years later. Jean Louise (Scout) is in her twenties; Atticus is in his early seventies; Jem has died; Calpurnia has retired.  GO SET A WATCHMAN is set during the beginning of the Civil Rights movement.Jean Louise comes home to Alabama from New York City.  She learns a lot about her beloved father Atticus and isn’t happy about some of the things she learns about him.  Is Atticus really a bigoted anti-hero after all, or is he a product of his times?  As Jean Louise struggles with this question, readers must as well.The characters are consistent and well-developed; I can easily imagine the adult Jean Louise as the little Scout in MOCKINGBIRD.  The style of WATCHMAN is, of course, similar to that of MOCKINGBIRD, but told through an older Jean Louise’s eyes.  Readers will need to hang on a bit with the narrative; it isn’t linear but has flashbacks to Jean Louise’s and Jem’s high school days – and mischief they found during those days.Though this novel definitely kept me engaged, I must hold at a very high four stars because when I realized that Atticus was in his seventies with Jean Louise in her twenties, I thought, “What? That’s an awfully late fatherhood!”  The reasons for Atticus’s late start toward marriage and parenthood are mentioned during the course of the novel, but I still feel that it would have been even better if Atticus hadn’t been nearly fifty by the time he fathered Jem and Jean Louise.I would strongly recommend (re) reading MOCKINGBIRD before reading WATCHMAN, and I see both as classics.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R323I047WBXNRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062409859#wasThisHelpful","R323I047WBXNRN","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young marrieds Stan and Charmaine once had good jobs and good lives and were happy.  However, a severe downturn of the economy took from them almost everything they had.  They are jobless, living out of their car, and targets for roving gangs of young people in the same or worse straits.  They hear of the Positron Project and a place called Consilience that could give them hope.  But there are some major catches:• Media is highly censored in Consilience; residents can pick up only movies and TV from the 1950’s.• Residents live in homes similar to standard suburban cookie-cutter homes and must abide by strict rules.• Residents may never leave Consilience.• Residents of Consilience spend one month in the suburban type homes, then one month in the local prison, with the first of each month the date to change over.• During the time the residents of a home are in the prison, there are alternate residents; the families are never to meet each other.Considering what the outside world holds, these sacrifices don’t seem to be too much, but, for Stan and Charmaine, there are entanglements.  Both of them end up in grave danger.Though teenagers like dystopian works, this one, like Atwood’s THE HANDMAID’S TALE, is absolutely for adults or very sophisticated older teens.  Though it is very well-written and engaging, saying it is harsh is putting it mildly.  There are very harsh themes and incidents, even in the seemingly perfect Consilience world, and Stan’s language, especially, is peppered with the “f-bomb.”  I must hold at four stars simply as a warning about the extreme harshness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EHB6ESWX78BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385540353#wasThisHelpful","R2EHB6ESWX78BS","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a full set of fifteen pairs of straight bamboo knitting needles; sizes range from 0 (very fine, for knitted lacework) to 15 (very chunky).  There are no size 12’s but that size isn’t in frequent use.I already owned a similar full set of bamboo double pointed needles (five to the set) and really like them.  When I was working on a sweater with metal straight size 4 needles, I was almost fussing and ripping more than I was progressing with the sweater because metal is slippery and the sweater pattern has a lacy panel down the front. So my husband asked where I might get some better (less slippery) needles, weren’t my bamboo DPNs less slippery.  I ordered these and immediately transferred the work to the appropriate size of bamboo needles when the set arrived.  Things went much better after that – less slippage, more comfortable grip, much happier me.I have one concern and one technical complaint about these needles:  If you are working an intricate pattern with slip, slip, knit, or knit 2 (or 3) together with finer sizes of these needles, the bamboo needles will bend.  Try to be as gentle as possible; bamboo is a grass and might break.  Also, for straight needles, the size number would be much better on the bead at the end of the needle than on the shaft of the needle where it could fade.  (Mine now have the size marked on the bead.)Overall, though, I give these bamboo needles a very high 4 star rating. These are smooth but not slippery and have a good feel/grip.  Try them; your work will probably be a lot easier and more pleasant to do.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REB5L6J7SEVF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VNTHWM#wasThisHelpful","REB5L6J7SEVF4","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We recently adopted an Australian Shepherd-Border Collie mix said to be about 1.5 years old.  Anyone who knows these breeds at all knows that they are intelligent and physical, and absolutely must have plenty of physical and mental stimulation.  We remembered how much our very old dog (a Border Collie mix going on 14 years old) loved her Jolly Ball when she was younger, so I looked for one for the new dog.Similar balls for dogs at the local farm store had floss instead of a molded handle.  Dogs that play hard can fray the floss and harm themselves with the frayed thread.  This one with a molded handle is just the thing.Did the younger dog like her new ball?  Absolutely yes!  I tossed the ball once, and she knew exactly what to do; she shook it, ran with it, cuffed it with her paws, rolled around with it, the works!If you have a dog like ours – young, with a low boredom threshold, buy one of these for him/her.

"Francis, perhaps about ten to twelve years old, has few friends at school, partially because his interests are different from those of other boys his age.  Francis likes fashion.  He sews and designs clothing and owns dolls that he uses as models.Andi, the same age as Francis, is a short, stocky red-headed girl, the youngest in a houseful of brothers.  She is no girly-girl, doesn’t hesitate to stand up for herself or others, and has been in serious trouble at previous schools for doing so.  She feels that she has few friends because she isn’t tall and pretty.Roland, also a tween, is a chubby, non-athletic boy.  His mother offers him too much unhealthful food.  He, too, feels like an outcast.Tying this unlikely trio together is Jessica.  Only these three youngsters can see or hear Jessica because she is a ghost; she was about the same age as the other three youngsters when she died.  Readers are surprised to learn how Jessica died and why she remains as a ghost (a mission to complete before moving on).This book is for about ages nine through twelve, and it is very well-written and very sensitively written. I can definitely recommend it. However, because of the themes (bullying, depression, and other serious matters), young readers will probably benefit from an adult presence when reading this book.  This gives the opportunity for discussion this type of book requires.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JUHUB0HGROU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545851866#wasThisHelpful","R3JUHUB0HGROU8","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It feels softer than cotton terry, which may be a bonus for some dogs’ sensitive skin.

Then another friend, Georgina, who doesn’t seem to settle down anywhere, invites herself to join them.Hillary is a counselor.

"In Sweden, apparently near Stockholm, Elsa, almost eight years old, lives with her mother and her mother’s new partner in a multi-family building.  Her parents have divorced, but her father lives nearby.  Her mother and her mother’s new partner are expecting a child, whom the family refers to as Halfie.Elsa’s 77-year-old grandmother lives in the same building.  Elsa sees her granny as her one and only friend because other children don’t like her.  Elsa likes Harry Potter, Spiderman, and her granny’s stories about the Land of Almost Awake, and the other children bully her about this.  Elsa is an outcast because in some ways she is brilliant, and in other ways she is a fairly typical seven-year-old, even confusing “therapist” and “terrorist.”  Granny is – well – eccentric; she shoots paintballs at passersby from her balcony.Elsa does have one non-human friend – a large, black dog.  The dog, which Elsa calls a “wurse,” does, on occasion, show its affection toward Elsa, and, yes, defend her.Some of the other people in the building seem just as eccentric, in their own ways.  Britt-Marie wants to start a residents’ organization, similar to an HOA in the U.S., and has her own ideas about rules and the benefit of all.  Britt-Marie’s partner Kurt is constantly on the phone to someone in Germany about supposed business matters.  All the characters impress me as exactly how a seven-year-old might see such people.Elsa’s granny is diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Granny, upon her death, sends Elsa with a mission – to deliver letters of apology to many different people.  I’ll let readers be surprised about the very last letter among these, but I will say that the letters are just as eccentric as Granny.Backman does an excellent job with the setting.  He has an excellent way of reminding readers about the short daylight hours Sweden has during the winter, and people who have never been to Sweden can imagine the place and time.Some passages and quirks are a little confusing to readers, but if adult readers imagine how they must have felt and what they must have thought at Elsa’s age, they would remember that they were puzzled about the world around them, too.This is an enjoyable novel that helps adults remember what the world is like through a child’s eyes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OKFNM3BG9L3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501115065#wasThisHelpful","R1OKFNM3BG9L3S","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Allen Paul’s HONEY THE DIXIE DINGO DOG is a first-person (first-dog?) narrative from the viewpoint of Honey, a rescued Dixie Dingo dog.  This is a breed that is also called the Carolina dog or Old Yeller dog and is prevalent in the Carolinas and Georgia.Honey not only tells us her story – her survival in the wild, her rescue, and something else very important – but also the story of her ancestors.  These dogs worked with the Native Americans of this area until the Trail of Tears, when the Native Americans had to cross the Mississippi River to Oklahoma and the dogs could not go with them.  Those dogs had their own trail of tears back to the Carolinas and Georgia.This work is fiction based on fact and thorough research.  There is artwork and photography interspersed through this short work.This book is for all ages, but young, very sensitive readers may be disturbed by some violence, animal cruelty, and mild language.  For these readers, an adult may want to stand by, but I still rate it Highly Recommended and can assure readers that there isn’t anything any stronger here than in the novel or film OLD YELLER and that readers will learn about an exceptional dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26YZKO9ZTC3YM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K601IBY#wasThisHelpful","R26YZKO9ZTC3YM","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 4 inch Bora drill press vise works well. It clamps well due to the two (2) guide rods that keep the clamp jaws straight.  The jaws of the drill press vise do not jam when they are closed tight; the jaws of the vise will release when reasonable force is used.  The material of the drill press vise jaws is such that it does not mar whatever is being held in it.  The drill press vise has a handle that will pivot 90 degrees in both directions; this allows more force to be applied with the jaws of the vise. The drill press vise has two (2) long slots in the base, one on each side.  The slots can be used to secure the drill press vise to the drill press table; this is a very useful feature. On the top of the drill press vise at the rear there is a button that when pushed and held it releases the threaded rod; which is used to apply tension to the vise jaws, so the jaw of the vise can be moved in or out quickly.  When the button is released the threaded rod engages and it functions as it is designed to and it controls the tension of the vise jaws. The Bora 4 inch drill press vise is very useful for small to medium work, however the vise to small and light for large work.  Using the Bora 4 inch drill press vise for large work would be unsafe and potentially dangerous, but for small or medium work it is great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZNOIWH70WR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5XU07A#wasThisHelpful","RUZNOIWH70WR0","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, let me begin by saying that this is the first wireless router my household has ever dealt with; we are NOT experts with such things.  However, I chose this product because I thought it would be good to be able to use the Internet away from the big desktop computer when necessary.  Also, I must add that our internet service provider is a satellite system, and we live in rural (and I do mean rural!) Texas.Installation did not seem difficult.  My husband handled that; I heard few complaints of problems, and it didn’t take him long to do this.My trial usage was with a Surface notebook computer approximately fifteen feet from the main desktop computer.  I spent a few minutes visiting sites I frequent; it took slightly longer for sites to load than it would from the main desktop, but still not bad at all, and I suppose a slight bit slower can be expected.I do like that this router requires two security passwords:  one for the network itself and another for security.  I don’t know whether this is commonplace, but it probably is a good idea.I do believe that this router will serve us well during times when we cannot or do not wish to work from the desktop.  The apparent ease of installation and good performance make it a good choice for those like us who aren’t experts and want a reasonably priced router to free us from the desktop when necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T2E1F0IYZKJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KATWRIY#wasThisHelpful","R2T2E1F0IYZKJZ","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GOLDEN THRONE is Katia Fox’s third installment in a series set in the High Middle Ages.  Readers who have read THE COPPER SIGN and THE SILVER FALCON know the story of the sword smith Ellen and her son William.  THE GOLDEN THRONE tells the story of Guillaume Marechal, William’s father.As readers see in the earlier installments (and apparent by William’s birth), Guillaume and Ellen were lovers but, for many reasons, ended up loving and marrying other people.  Ellen wanted to make her life as a sword smith, a breaking of barriers especially for the time in which this series is set. Young William wishes to become a falconer. Guillaume wants only to become a knight and serve his king.  When he saves the queen’s life, he does get a position in the as a sword-fighting instructor for the prince.To that end, Guillaume endures intense training, goes to battle, earns the favor (and disfavor at times) of three different kings (Richard, Henry II, and John).  Yes, Guillaume seems vain and obnoxious at times, but sometimes the kings he serves were, too.  He still has feelings for Ellen but must marry Isabelle of Kilkenny.  He truly loves her, too, and they bear ten children together.  So Guillaume must deal with keeping his king and his family happy.This novel begins during Guillaume’s training in 1162 and closes with his death in May 1219.  Fox clearly shows Guillaume feeling his age as he grows older; he can’t ride horseback as long or as well as he did as a young man, and joints and muscles are more troublesome.  Fox bases this novel on historical fact, but does note that she takes some liberties with her own imagination.Though this novel can stand alone, readers will find it helpful to have read the first two.  Though ends are tied up (Guillaume’s death), there is still more to go on if Fox should choose to write more about the people of this time and place. The translation by Aubrey Botsford seems smooth and accurate.  Like the other two novels in the series, THE GOLDEN THRONE is rather long and dense, but I did not feel bogged down; in fact, I would like more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMJW3ZU7ELRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611090385#wasThisHelpful","RCMJW3ZU7ELRY","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE MOON SISTERS is a novel by Therese Walsh.  It tells the story of two sisters in small-town West Virginia.  Jazz Moon is the older sister and the practical one; she has just been hired for a new job in her town, something different from the family bakery.  Olivia Moon is a dreamy, imaginative one.  She has synesthesia; she hears colors, sees sounds, and tastes words.  Olivia does not see very well at all; her eyes are damaged from looking directly at the sun for too long.Both must face their mother’s death.  Practical Jazz is almost certain that the mother’s death was a suicide, but Olivia has many doubts about that.  Both want closure.  Olivia’s means of seeking closure is to take their mother’s ashes to a bog, the setting of their mother’s unfinished novel.  She is determined to go, but this is days before Jazz is to start her new job – and Olivia cannot go by herself.On this mission, they meet several train hoppers who could mean them help or harm.  Tensions between the two sisters mount.The structure of the segments of this novel follow the pattern of grief, from denial to acceptance; this structure helps readers better understand each segment.I would recommend this book for anyone who has lost a loved one and also has siblings, especially siblings who have such opposite personalities as Jazz and Olivia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RISLWO91UQOLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307461602#wasThisHelpful","RISLWO91UQOLS","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

At a school party, she tells a so-called friend of her status in confidence, but within an hour the news is all over the school.The other students bully and ostracize Rawl and even call her “PAIDS.”  The principal says she can do nothing to protect Rawl, and the school counselor tells Rawl to stop the “drama.”  Rawl is on the soccer team; the coach is glad to have her because her status may evoke fear in the opposing team.But this is not typical junior high school “drama,” and Rawl does deserve some sympathy and protection because of her status.  Things become so bad that Rawl has pseudo-seizures brought on by stress and even attempts to take her own life.Now, Rawl is a student at Ball State University studying molecular biology, with the hope of one day finding help for those like her.  She also gives presentation about bullying and HIV/AIDS.This memoir is well-written; I can easily imagine this young woman sitting down and talking with her audience.  I was engaged throughout and still want to know how she’s doing.  She gives some good facts about bullying and HIV/AIDS.  However, I wish she’d stated her resources for this information more clearly; indeed those who know about HIV/AIDS know that these facts are common knowledge with no citations necessary, but those who still fear those of this status would want to know where these facts came from and whether these resources would be trustworthy to that fearful audience.  With those thoughts in consideration, this would be a good resource for an anti-bullying or HIV/AIDS program in junior high school or high school health classes with many good talking points.Note about me:  I’m trained as a teacher/librarian.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AR1JQ6R66541/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062342517#wasThisHelpful","R3AR1JQ6R66541","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE ABYSS BEYOND DREAMS: CHRONICLE OF THE FALLERS by Peter F. Hamilton is set in the 3300’s in what seems like a very different – but very realistic, considering the time setting – story world.  Beings can be easily rejuvenated, giving them near-immortality.  They also have “tee-kay” (telekinesis) and can “fuzz” (become invisible to others.But this is not a perfect world.  These beings are dealing with Fallers, beings that can “eggsume” them – consume their bodies, and, apparently, their souls.  Technology presented in this novel impresses me as mixed; there is interplanetary travel, but there is also low-tech travel – horses and buggies.  The government in the main world readers visit in this novel is extremely corrupt.Slvasta, a captain in this world’s armed forces, sees this corruption and excessive bureaucracy and decides he must do something about it.  He also knows that something must be done about the Fallers; he was rescued just in time from a Faller “eggsumation” but lost an arm to this Faller. He and an unlikely group – including a seventeen-year-old girl who is escaping to avoid an arranged marriage – start creating cells to foment a revolution.This novel is long – 600+ pages – is arranged in several books, and is very dense.  There is some front matter in my advance copy that explains some of the story world’s history, but, as dense as this work is, more front matter introducing the characters and telling more about the story world, would have been very helpful.  Hardcore science fiction readers about age 16 and older will probably enjoy reading THE ABYSS BEYOND DREAMS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VUC58R8DTG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345547195#wasThisHelpful","R20VUC58R8DTG7","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE GUARDIAN HERD: STARFIRE is a middle grades (about ages 8-12) novel that tells the story of a young pegasus foal names Starfire.  He is growing up in the Sun Herd, one of the five herds of Anok, under the care of a foster mare.  He knows he has a great destiny; he could be a healer, or he could be a destroyer.  Neither he nor the other pegasi of the Five Herds knows which way his fate will go.  Because of fear among the other pegasi, Starfire might not even live beyond his first birthday.This novel is Jennifer Lynn Alvarez’s first novel, and even adult readers will be drawn into the storyline and the characters (mostly pegasi, but a few other animals).  An extensive list of characters in the front matter describes members, young and old, of each herd. The one caution I offer for very sensitive young readers:  there are violent fights among the animals, and some animals that readers do care about die.Overall verdict:  Five stars.

"My Oceanique bath rug has just arrived, and I must admit to mixed opinions about it.The good points?  The cream color and the simple horizontal pattern in the loft suit almost any bath décor.  It is washable cotton and does feel soft against bare feet.The bad points?  This rug is 17” by 24” – a little small, but that may be fine for smaller bathrooms.  Instructions indicate that it should be dried flat, not in the dryer.  Perhaps the worst bad point of all is that I felt little to no slip-resistant backing when I felt this rug and walked on it; that is a potential fall hazard.  For that reason, I would not recommend this bath rug for use in a home with elderly, disabled, or small children.Overall verdict:  A very low three stars; I would not have chosen this bath rug if I had seen it in a brick-and-mortar store rather than as a Vine selection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJSD9QIV28UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3FF7FA#wasThisHelpful","RJSD9QIV28UV","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a dystopian U.K. in the not too distant future, readers meet Kyla.  She is about sixteen years old, and she has been slated; all her memories have been erased.  She is just released from a long stay in a hospital, even learning to walk, talk, and feed herself again.  She has a different identity and has been placed with a new family.  This is punishment for a crime she has no memory of committing. Supposedly to keep unwanted emotions such as anger in check, the Slated must wear a bracelet that can cause them to have seizures or even die.  “Happy juice” is liberally administered. Slated youth are required to attend counseling sessions.Kyla resumes school and finds that she excels in the visual arts.  She can draw better with what she believes to be her non-dominant hand; people, including teachers, are openly taken away by the Lorders (police) and disappear. She learns things that don’t add up about the Slated; they may or may not have actually committed crimes.Because of violence and themes, I recommend this book for readers about age fourteen and older who are interested in dystopian fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OAB8QH1GW3ZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142425036#wasThisHelpful","R1OAB8QH1GW3ZO","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stacy Jay's PRINCESS OF THORNS takes the Grimm Brothers' SLEEPING BEAUTY a step farther and is intended for about age fourteen and up because of violence and very veiled sexuality.  (The sexuality is there, but it's veiled like fade-outs in older movies.)Aurora is the daughter of the awakened Sleeping Beauty.  When Aurora is seven years old, her mother dies in her arms. Aurora is gifted with her mother's fairy magic but is cursed never to love anyone except perhaps as one would love a sibling.  Aurora's brother Jor is captured by troops of the Ogre Queen, and Aurora must raise an army to rescue him.  When the main part of the story opens, she is a small but slightly round seventeen-year-old but with fairy powers and warrior training.Meanwhile, Prince Niklaas, also seventeen, must overcome his own curse.  He is the eleventh of his brothers, and, on his eighteenth birthday, faces the same fate his ten older brothers did - transformation to a swan.Aurora, disguised as Ror, a boy of about fourteen, seeks Niklaas's help to raise an army and rescue Jor.  Niklaas is persuaded to help this odd ""boy,"" and plot twists ensue.This story is told from three different viewpoints:  Aurora's (watch out, readers, she does call herself ""Ror"" to other characters for most of the story), Niklaas's, and, in a few chapters, the Ogre Queen's (watch out here, too; she tells her tale in the royal plural ""we."").  The voice of each viewpoint is distinctive and there are headings to alert readers who is telling his or her tale.Maps in the front matter introduce readers to the story world.I found this an enjoyable fantasy novel for teens and up taken from a well-known tale.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NDDLRRTS2JWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574322X#wasThisHelpful","R2NDDLRRTS2JWX","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is 1962 in Denver. Katharyn (usually known as Kitty) Miller, a single woman in her late 30’s, runs a bookstore called Sisters’ with her best friend Frieda.  Her life is not the norm for women her age in that time, but she happily lives in a duplex with her cat Aslan.  She was once in a serious relationship with a young doctor named Kevin, but things didn’t work out.  She tried running a personals ad years ago and arranged to meet a gentleman, but the gentleman, Lars Andersson, didn’t appear.  Later she finds out why.It is 1963 in Denver.  Katharyn Andersson has married Lars, whom she contacted eight years before in a personals ad.  They have a nice home and are the parents of triplets, two boys and a girl. One son is diagnosed as autistic.This novel goes back and forth between Kitty’s and Katharyn’s world, from one reality to another.  Kitty/Katharyn, as well as readers, wonder what she is doing in the other woman’s world and how the other manages.  Kitty, of course, struggles with the children, in particular the autistic son.Swanson gives a good backdrop of the times.  She adds details about the Cuban missile crisis and Kennedy, as well as the growth of Denver during that time.  This backdrop is important to the storyline because Kitty and Frieda must consider choices about their business as Denver changes.I found myself truly pulled into this novel and wondered throughout which world was a dream world and which was reality – and found the theme of life paths and choices intriguing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R100JF16RFUM0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333003#wasThisHelpful","R100JF16RFUM0H","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NEST tells the story of Naomi Orenstein of Cape Cod, in about 1972. Naomi is eleven years old and lives there with her dad, a psychiatrist; her mom, a dancer; and her sister Rachel, about two years older than Naomi.Naomi is an average eleven-year-old.  She has the typical love-hate relationship with school – sometimes a little more hate than love because of an uncertain-of-herself first-year teacher.  She quarrels with her sister and her friends at times.  She becomes friends with Joey, the boy across the street, whose family isn’t the best – and the youngsters do find mischief together.  One thing Naomi loves and understands is bird watching; she knows the birds of her area very well, to the point of having the nickname “Chirp.”Then Naomi’s mom becomes ill, and everything seems to fall apart for the whole Orenstein family. Responsibilities within the family change.This novel is very well-written, and I can recommend it for the appropriate age group with one provision:  Because of some of the thematic elements readers encounter, I would recommend that the intended readership (about ages nine through twelve) read it with an adult available to discuss these themes and how things have changed since the time this novel is set.Five stars, but adult presence advised.Who I am:  I hold degrees in English and library science.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y2B33SCFI10V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385386079#wasThisHelpful","R1Y2B33SCFI10V","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bread knife is very good, but it takes a bit of a learning curve if one has become accustomed to using a non-serrated knife to slice bread.  The first time I used this knife on my own homemade bread I felt as if it hacked the bread rather than sliced it, and the slice was much larger than I wanted.  Apparently, I was dealing with the lean to the left that other reviewers mentioned.  However, I obviously needed to accustom myself to a serrated knife, and a little practice remedied these problems.The grip is good – soft but not too soft.  A good grip is important to me because my hands are smallish and not very strong.Prospective buyers need to remember that, like most knives, this one really should be washed by hand, not in the dishwasher.Overall, with some practice, users will find this to be a good knife but not one that merits an excellent rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFLYOGWKOD36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13OF2#wasThisHelpful","R2YFLYOGWKOD36","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this collection of essays, Mikita Brottman endeavors to highlight twenty-six dogs from the arts, literature, and philosophy.  She does this in alphabetical order, starting with an introduction, then the story of a standard poodle named Atma, owned by Arthur Schopenhauer, and ending with a greyhound named Zemire, owned by Catherine the Great of Russia. Brottman intertwines information about these dogs with her own experiences with her French bulldog Grisby.There are citations in back matter for the resources Brottman uses in each chapter.This would impress readers as being very organized, and, in some ways, it is.  However, many of the individual essays seem to wander.  Brottman begins each essay with information about the dog she is highlighting, but then she meanders to information about another dog, then to information or an anecdote about Grisby, then perhaps to information about yet another dog, then back to the dog she intends to highlight.  Is she perhaps trying to emulate the way dogs meander when they're out for a walk, and how their interest goes from one thing to another?  Perhaps, but this doesn't work for me in writing.I also note one apparent error in fact.  When Brottman mentions the dog Bobby, a dog that legend says never left his owner's grave after his owner died, she incorrectly identifies Bobby as a Scottie, or Scottish terrier.  The legend gives Bobby's breeding as a Skye terrier.With all this in mind, I must say that overall I found this book to be interesting reading, but this advance copy shows a need for some stylistic and factual cleanup.  If Brottman will check her facts and reduce her meandering within the essays, dog lovers will find this an excellent read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H9O146Y3F225/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062304615#wasThisHelpful","R3H9O146Y3F225","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is college, particularly a four-year university, the best answer for every young person after high school, or are some young people better off making a different choice?  Why is post-secondary education so expensive?  Is it worthwhile for young people to graduate from a four-year university drowning in debt? What are the best colleges and majors for return-on-investment?These are the questions that Bennett and Wilezol attempt to answer in this book.  The authors impress me as very frank, but they seem to emphasize the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) or perhaps health care mindset over education (and, excuse me, I was appalled at one mention in the main text wondering why teachers needed a college education!), liberal arts, and humanities.  But there are people who simply don't have the mindset for STEM coursework - neither the talents nor the temperament -- and the authors offer very little to help these people.Though I think the content is very biased toward the STEM students, I did like the twelve hypothetical scenarios and the honest suggestions the authors made for each case.  The style throughout this book, but particularly in the ""verdicts"" for these scenarios, seems straightforward and honest, as if the authors were indeed sitting down with the person in each particular scenario.So, yes, this book is slanted toward the authors' viewpoints - political and otherwise.  Yes, they sometimes cite their own earlier works and works that show their slant.  However, in spite of the apparent imbalances, Bennett and Wilezol offer food for thought for young people and their families.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KUWWO5P9UCAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595552790#wasThisHelpful","R3KUWWO5P9UCAH","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Educators, especially those who have taught at the college level (two-year or four-year) can smile as they relive similar “aha moments” with Conway: the lesson apparently gone so wrong, the seemingly-difficult student, the seriously ill student, and more.This book’s back matter consists of a readers’ guide with discussion questions for each chapter that truly do give pause about what Conway has to say.This is not so much a book about HOW to teach, but it helps teachers consider WHY they teach.

"Samantha (Sam) McKenna is sixteen years old, the youngest of four siblings in a military family, and, on a dare from her older brother, has just enrolled in Denmark Military Academy.  She is about a year older than the typical beginning student at the Academy, and among the first of five girls to be admitted.Since Sam is a military brat herself, she knows that life at the Academy is hard, especially the first year.  Another older brother of Sam's is Cadet Colonel and cannot be seen as showing favoritism toward her.  A group of the other cadets don't want girls at DMA, so she and the other girls are treated especially harshly to try to wash them out - send them packing.  ""Smoke shows"" - extreme periods of push-ups, jumping jacks, high-knees and more, for hours, at all hours - are meant to break Sam and the other girls.  In addition, Sam uncovers information about a secret society involving past and current cadets that could have serious implications.  She also gets involved with forbidden romance and fraternization - in her own case and other students'.I am impressed by the military jargon and style in this novel.  The jargon is a combination of what ground and air forces (Army, Marines, Air Force) and sea forces (Navy and Coast Guard) use.  This style works, because the students may well be going into different branches of the military after graduation from DMA.I am also impressed with Sam's determination to survive not only Hell Week and her first semester, but also her determination to graduate as one of the first young women from DMA, in spite of the ""Old School"" attitude of past and present cadets and a family situation.I would recommend this novel for about tenth grade and older because there is some profanity, violence, and underage drinking that the adults in charge overlook.

"NO BOOK BUT THE WORLD is a novel about two siblings, Ava and Fred.  They grew up together on a “free school” without any formal lessons; they learned through play in the woods at their so-called free school, named Batter Hollow, and by teachable moments.Ava and Fred become close with another family who live on the free school grounds; Kitty is about Ava’s age; Dennis is older, but he eventually becomes Ava’s husband. Fred has some developmental differences that his parents refuse to have diagnosed; they simply see him as unique.Ava and Fred grow up and go their separate ways, and their parents die.  One day Ava gets word that Fred has been incarcerated; he’s accused of molesting and killing a twelve-year-old boy.  But did he do it?  Do his differences have anything to do with what he’s accused of doing? Would they be a defense, once properly diagnosed, or would they hurt his case?  How far should one sibling go to help another? There seem to be more questions than answers as Fred’s court appointed attorney studies the case and tries to build a defense.The story thread does go back and forth from the days that Ava, Kitty, and Fred played together all day at Batter Hollow  -- including arguments between Ava’s parents about how Ava and Fred should be educated --  to the present day in Perdu, where Fred is incarcerated, so readers need to pay attention. The pace of the “childhood” scenes in particular seems slow, but just consider that pace to be similar to long summer days that carry through year round at Batter Hollow.Readers expect the several sections of this novel to be in different literary points of view, but there is a surprise about that at the end – and this isn’t the only twist, either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF48HG8QLL1WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594486034#wasThisHelpful","RF48HG8QLL1WG","A2KGKNQHOK4C8A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KGKNQHOK4C8A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A pleasure to read about truckers in a positive note. It proves to be a hard job running your deceased Father's trucking company.  Especially when you only knew part of the business.  The clerical part of it.  Trying to deal with the sudden unexpected death of your father makes the job that much harder.  You cannot rest.  You ask a friend, a retired R.C.M.P. and a trucker to look into the death and find out why he died.  The surprise ending was not expected.

Mr. McDonald has written a story different than most mystery in that the main character is a Human Relations Manager in a Corporation.  As such he uses the skills he has developed over the years to size up people.  He has an employee that is doing some things against the company policies and has to call him in on the carpet.

"This is one of those cases where the book's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. Why? Well, as you may have guessed from my title, it's... yes, full of inside jokes.In many ways this makes for a fascinating read. The view from the trenches of the animation industry is often a surprising one. Sometimes it's _exactly_ what you'd expect: the take on Michael Eisner, for example. Other times it's completely different. The view that emerges of Uncle Walt himself is unlike anything I've heard before - from either his detractors or his admirers. And in still other cases  the author makes jokes about things that would never even have occurred to an outsider, not in a million years. Like the ""dress code"" at Pixar.But for this selfsame reason, I found it very hard to actually laugh at these jokes. They're just not of my world. My primary reaction to almost all of the cartoons in this book was more along the lines of ""Oh, that's interesting"". And then, often, I would smile to myself. But not laugh. Not even once.None of which is to say that I think the author is a bad cartoonist. I'm quite sure that many of his cartoons would not only have been a scream, but also very daring - for the audience for which they were originally intended. Which is to say, his fellow insiders.But for us, the outsiders?For us, it's more along the lines of an academic exercise. Or at least, it was for me.So should you buy this book? That depends on what you hope to get out of it. If you're motivated primarily by curiosity, if you're looking for that insider's view, then read no further: this book is for you. Buy it now.But if you're looking for something to actually make you laugh..?In my humble opinion, no.I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review.Theo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AI514T0S9DDN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1941500374#wasThisHelpful","R3AI514T0S9DDN","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a grown-up looking for something you can watch with the kids and maybe even enjoy yourself, you've definitely hit the mark. The only qualifier I'd insert here is that if you are considering this film as a parent, there are a few scenes towards the end that might be a little scary for some younger children. No blood or guts, you understand. Just... perhaps a little scary.Similarly, if you're a grown-up hard core animation fan like me who's followed the work of both Tim Burton and Neil Gaiman with great interest for decades, then again, this is a film you're going to want to see.But...While by no means a bad film, this doesn't quite catch either Burton or Gaiman at their absolute best. My main reservation here is that I feel the story gives itself away a little too easily, a little too early on. In previous reviews I've observed that if it's true that there are only a finite number of stories - stories that are told and retold again and yet again across the generations - then the real job of the storyteller is to disguise this fact. To somehow make us forget that we've heard it all before. Even if we ourselves must needs be - to varying degrees - complicit in that forgetfulness.For the adult viewer, this film doesn't quite pull that trick off. We're just a little too aware, almost from the very beginning, exactly which story this is, where our heroine is going to wind up, and exactly how she's going to get there.Provided you can live with that flaw, this is an amazing thing just to look at and to listen to. On a visual level it has the playfully Gothic charm of so much of Tim Burton's work. The sheer craftsmanship that's gone into creating the visual side of this film is incredible. Coraline was apparently created almost entirely using traditional stop motion techniques.Of course, especially when employing the more technically demanding forms of animation, one major risk that directors need to be aware of is the temptation to include shots that exist only to show off the animator's virtuosity. There are a few instances of this near the beginning of the film, although it gets better in that regard as it goes along. By the end, the animator's art is employed entirely in the service of the greater whole.The actors do a similarly superb job. Although I must admit that I feel that Keith David and John Hodgman both got shortchanged in the credits: French & Saunders bumped them down a notch out of deservedly higher billing - apparently by sheer weight of star power. I mean, I _like_ French & Saunders, but still...The titular character of Coraline herself is an especially impressive creation - the work of both the animators and an enormously talented (and still very young) Dakota Fanning. You can't help but wonder at the body of work that lies ahead of her in adulthood. Somehow she strikes me as someone with a little more going for her than just cuteness - someone who's likely to beat the child star curse and do amazing things as an adult actor.Finally, this is one of those films where the title and incidental music most definitely deserve special mention. Kudos to composer Bruno Coulais. Tim Burton has obviously long known the importance of this element of filmmaking; witness his 1989 version of Batman, which, courtesy of Danny Elfman, gave us one of film's most memorable and enduring riffs.In the end, I see this work as a kind of flawed masterpiece. I do wish that it didn't give itself away quite so easily. But there's still an enormous amount here that's worth seeing.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XMD1OF8C8K9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LAM7PI#wasThisHelpful","R1XMD1OF8C8K9T","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This animated series from the mid nineties still stands as one of Nickelodeon's better efforts. It's not on the same level as the first season of Ren & Stimpy, but it's got nothing to be embarrassed about either.The basic premise of the show is that there's an entire secret underground of monsters who live to scare humans. The show is centred around a group of three young monsters at a live-in academy where they've been sent to learn this skill. If that sounds like a rather prosy premise (and let's face it - it is), this is a show that nevertheless manages to make it work: mainly by virtue of its own densely grunge aesthetic. It may not be Ren & Stimpy, but it ain't Harry Potter neither.For serious film and animation buffs, there's a lot to take in. For example, in a recurring role as Simon The Monster Hunter, Jim Belushi reveals himself to be an extremely talented voice actor. Tim Curry does the same in his role as the bug-like monster Zimbo. For those more specifically interested in animation, Charlie Adler, arguably the pre-eminent voice actor of the era, appears in what is essentially the show's starring role as Ickis.Perhaps most interestingly, serious animation enthusiasts will notice a definite similarity in the music used in this series, and that of the adult animated series Aeon Flux. Not surprisingly, that's because the two share a common composer: Tim Blake. The unique sound he provides - a kind of absurdly operatic cacophony - contributes much to this show's twisted aesthetic.Like any cartoon from days gone by, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters will doubtless pick up a certain number of sales from pure nostalgia. Fair enough. But even from a strictly grown up perspective, it does have more going for it than that.It is a show you can watch for the first time as an adult, and still grow to love.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SLP8AD5FPPZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TVS3JC#wasThisHelpful","R3SLP8AD5FPPZP","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, I couldn't resist the Star Wars reference. And truthfully, there is a little Star Wars here. But what I love most about this film is that it reminded me what I love most about Marvel: that sense of a true Universe that comes along as part of the Marvel package. A rich and storied cosmos with history and depth and an ongoing continuity all of its own. A fantastic, larger than life realm where big personalities abound, and around any corner we might find people or things filled with electrifying energy; events pregnant with cosmic portent. A place where godlings walk among us, and every flame burns just that much brighter.Yes, I love the Marvel Universe. And we are deep, deep inside it in this film.The Star Wars thing... can be overstated. It's there, but the people who dwell too long upon it have not, I think, seen very much in the way of science fantasy. For example, one scene in this film reminded me of nothing so much as an old episode of Invader Zim. Specifically ""The Fry Cook What Came from All That Space"". And trust me: that's a good thing. As you might then guess, this is not a film that takes itself too seriously. That's another good thing. It is, quite simply, an enormous delight to watch. It's laugh out loud funny, but at the same time, a long long way from mere spoof or self-parody. It's more of a rollicking swashbuckler, but with spaceships and blaster pistols instead of tall ships and rapiers - and get down funkiness in place of rococo.Through most of this film I really thought I was going to give it five stars. However, I found the ending just a little weak. For that and that alone, I'm knocking it down to four.Nevertheless, if you're looking for a movie that's just plain fun, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this one.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13RCDUVAIRRX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBW0IUU#wasThisHelpful","R13RCDUVAIRRX7","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there's one thing Couteney Cox brings to her character, it's an immense likeability. Seriously, you just instantly like this woman. I'm sure Sally Field would be proud. In fact, you like all of the characters. They're all soft and cuddly, likeable people. No sharp edges anywhere. Except perhaps in the aptly named ""Barb"", who's brought in for a few seconds here and there as comic relief. It's like dwelling in a universe of stuffed toys: every plushie's fantasy.But I ask you: is that enough? Because this show is SO gosh-darned likeable, you really want it to be smart too. And edgy. Unfortunately it isn't even remotely either one of those things. In fact, despite the ""adult themes"", it's got to be the farthest thing from a truly grown up show I've seen in a long time.Take Grayson, our heroine's across-the-cul-de-sac neighbor. Within literally three seconds of meeting him, we know he's her real series-spanning love interest: Dylan to her Brenda; Sam to her Dianne. And unless this is the first TV show we've ever seen (and I do mean EVER) we also instantly know that it's going to take as many seasons as the writers can manage to string this thing out for for these two people to really get together properly and make it work. At the same time, we also just as instantly know that there'll be many near misses and a few ill-fated false starts along the way. And of course, once they do get properly together the writers will have to break them up again, because a stable, mature relationship doesn't make for good television. Seriously, all this is instantly obvious within three seconds.My Little Pony is edgier than this. WAY edgier in fact. Come to think of it, the latest incarnation of that particular franchise actually is kinda edgy in its own sweet way. But... you get my point. For edginess, go to My Little Pony. Not Cougar Town.PROS: If your ultimate fantasy is to live in a universe of cuddly stuffed toys, then you've just come home.CONS: You may already have seen the Care Bears.(Seriously, if they gave those fuzzy little guys functioning genitalia and allowed them to do their thinking with them just occasionally, well, that's Cougar Town.)Theo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVLAFM4FZ0SVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SQVI54#wasThisHelpful","RVLAFM4FZ0SVF","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For anyone with an interest in the paranormal, visionary experiences, or just pop culture, I'd definitely rate this one as a must read. It tells - in some detail - the story of a life I was hitherto unaware of. Before learning of this book, to me the ""dero"" were just monsters in an old edition of Dungeons & Dragons. And ""Ray Palmer"" was just the secret identity of the silver-age Atom: a DC superhero who I now know was named in homage to this real life Ray Palmer.Palmer's professional life began in the science fiction pulps of the 1930's and 40's, and ended with him editing no-less pulpy publications dealing with UFO's and general paranormal phenomena. To be completely honest, in some ways I find this journey a little sad. It seems to me that he started out in a rather fun place, and ended up devoting much of his life to the purely and simply crackpot. While I do believe that paranormal phenomena can be the subject of legitimate and serious inquiry, it is very hard to buy into the idea that Ray Palmer was ever engaged in such.To what extent Palmer himself believed in what he was publishing is forever an open question.Nevertheless, this is a genuinely interesting book. I would especially recommend it to anyone with an interest in the current crop of fringe conspiracy theories - David Icke's reptilians in particular. Reading this book and comparing Shaver's dero with Icke's reptilians will, I think, afford the reader a deeper appreciation of the nature of the current phenomena. One can't help but wonder who will succeed Icke in another twenty years or so, and what shape the next generation of monsters will take.This book is also rather interesting for the questions it raises, and perhaps implicitly answers, about the nature of the visionary experience. It has been said that tribal cultures turn their schizophrenics into functioning members of society by making them into shamans. Palmer, I think, performed this service for one such individual.To be clear, I am not suggesting this as a universal theory of shamanism, psychic phenomena, or paranormal experiences. Many people engaged in such pursuits or reporting such experiences are quite obviously not schizophrenic. Nevertheless, this biography may perhaps serve double-duty as fable, warning us all of the dangers of excessive literalism in our interpretation of these experiences. Of being too quick to take things at face value.Interestingly, the author suggests that Palmer himself could have been prone to this kind of overly literal thinking.

"For anyone with an interest in the paranormal, visionary experiences, or just pop culture, I'd definitely rate this one as a must read. It tells - in some detail - the story of a life I was hitherto unaware of. Before learning of this book, to me the ""dero"" were just monsters in an old edition of Dungeons & Dragons. And ""Ray Palmer"" was just the secret identity of the silver-age Atom: a DC superhero who I now know was named in homage to this real life Ray Palmer.Palmer's professional life began in the science fiction pulps of the 1930's and 40's, and ended with him editing no-less pulpy publications dealing with UFO's and general paranormal phenomena. To be completely honest, in some ways I find this journey a little sad. It seems to me that he started out in a rather fun place, and ended up devoting much of his life to the purely and simply crackpot. While I do believe that paranormal phenomena can be the subject of legitimate and serious inquiry, it is very hard to buy into the idea that Ray Palmer was ever engaged in such.To what extent Palmer himself believed in what he was publishing is forever an open question.Nevertheless, this is a genuinely interesting book. I would especially recommend it to anyone with an interest in the current crop of fringe conspiracy theories - David Icke's reptilians in particular. Reading this book and comparing Shaver's dero with Icke's reptilians will, I think, afford the reader a deeper appreciation of the nature of the current phenomena. One can't help but wonder who will succeed Icke in another twenty years or so, and what shape the next generation of monsters will take.This book is also rather interesting for the questions it raises, and perhaps implicitly answers, about the nature of the visionary experience. It has been said that tribal cultures turn their schizophrenics into functioning members of society by making them into shamans. Palmer, I think, performed this service for one such individual.To be clear, I am not suggesting this as a universal theory of shamanism, psychic phenomena, or paranormal experiences. Many people engaged in such pursuits or reporting such experiences are quite obviously not schizophrenic. Nevertheless, this biography may perhaps serve double-duty as fable, warning us all of the dangers of excessive literalism in our interpretation of these experiences. Of being too quick to take things at face value.Interestingly, the author suggests that Palmer himself could have been prone to this kind of overly literal thinking. By way of evidence he offers up the following quote from Palmer: ""Even Rod Sterling must suspect there is a Twilight Zone, or he would not write of it"". Though perhaps, in this particularly telling line, there are deeper clues as to the true nature of Ray Palmer's world view, and how he regarded his own literary career.Perhaps to him, flying saucers, the Hollow Earth, and the shining world of tomorrow depicted in the earliest of the pulps were all part of the same continuum: a transmundane domain of both wonder and horror, seances and superscience, beckoning us all to come explore.

"This didn't grab me the first time I saw it. But somehow I wound up giving it a second chance, and I'm glad I did.Perhaps the reason why it didn't appeal at first is that it possesses neither the high fantasy of the more overtly fantastic superhero tales, nor the gritty realism of so many noir offerings. This show exists in a space all its own, and it took me a couple of takes to adjust.Make no mistake: although there's no-one flying around in a cape, judged by the standards of the real world, this show is utterly absurd. I do find myself thinking, from time to time, of a ""bit"" I once saw a standup comedian do, comparing Bruce Wayne to Ross Perot. It's also the kind of show where you quickly learn to accept that the extras are never going to learn to shoot straight - or if they do, it will only be at each other. But as you start to get into it, you somehow find yourself accepting the show's own reality and terms of reference. And even when the necessary willing suspension of disbelief does crack (which occasionally it does) that's all part of the fun.In fact, one of the things I enjoy most about this show is the way that, at the end of an action-packed, cliffhanger scene, the music rises up to a such a crescendo of suspense that it's almost impossible not to take a step back and just burst out laughing. Angel (the Buffy spinoff) often ended scenes in exactly the same way, and pulled off such moments magnificently. Arrow manages the trick almost as well. Both shows have that same ability to confront the audience with absurdity while keeping their own gaze steady and unwavering: playing it straight, never giving us that knowing wink. If we laugh, we laugh on our own. There's no canned track to accompany us.Not that I want to give you the impression that this show is entirely ""comic book"". Or at least, what most people who don't read comic books would think of as ""comic book"". This version of Oliver Queen doesn't shoot arrows with boxing gloves on the end that knock crooks out. His arrows are razor sharp, and there are plenty of times when he is quite willing to use them to put people in the ground. There is at least enough gritty realism for that.There are shows in the superhero genre that I encourage even friends with no pre-existing interest in the genre to watch. Shows that I believe are good enough and smart enough to convince any fundamentally open minded person that this much maligned genre can be, and sometimes is, home to intelligent, thoughtful offerings.Arrow does not rise to that level. Not quite. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Angel. Or Justice League Unlimited for that matter. But for anyone who does already love the spandex set, I would say that this is a highly original reinvention of a long established character. One that, to its credit, is also very much aware of that character's history - most especially as a voice of social and political protest.And hey, if you just want to watch the world's first parkour superhero run around and leap through the air a lot while he smacks down some baddies, that's fine too.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3235UUL63LO4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGI086Q#wasThisHelpful","R3235UUL63LO4P","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My relatively tepid response to this chocolate (as seen in this review's title) is perhaps unfairly influenced by the fact that my introduction to Taza was Taza Chocolate Mexicano Chocolate Disc, Guajillo Chili, 2.7 Ounce. Now that was AMAZING. Superlatives fail me. It's definitely right up there on the list of things to try before you bite the big one and go join the choir invisible. Or... you know. Just rot in the ground. Whatever.This one... Well, enjoyment-wise, once again I refer you to this review's title: Good But Not Great. Although I'm currently (even as I type these very words) eating some with almonds, and I have to say it's a pretty good combination. So perhaps the caveat I should have introduced was ""eat with almonds"" - or at least with some kind of accompaniment. It's only so-so when eaten alone. It does have the same unusual, almost cookie-like texture as the Guajillo Chilli disks, but the flavor isn't quite up there. Once again, I keep coming back to that title: good, but not great.The saving grace, the thing that decided it for me when I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars, is that if you're looking for a healthy chocolate (according to some studies, a small daily dose of dark chocolate can more than halve your risk of heart attack), I suspect this may be about as good as you're going to find. Made with only two ingredients - organic cacao and organic cane sugar - it's also 70% cacao, and stoneground at that.There is the emerging issue of cadmium in chocolate, which you may want to do some reading about online yourself. I'm not entirely sure if it's clear yet where or how the heavy metals get into chocolate: if it's during processing, then I'd say that with organic stoneground cacao, you're pretty safe. But if it's directly from the soil and concentrated into the beans themselves, then obviously not so much. If that's the case, then it's really a matter of finding cacao grown in low cadmium soils, and truth be told I'm not sure how Mexico fares on that front.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KGPFM9RW5U2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LGOPXE#wasThisHelpful","R1KGPFM9RW5U2X","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was so miffed when I saw the title I'd planned to use - ""Wow!"" - had already been taken. And by the most helpful review too!All I can do at this point is acknowledge that I completely agree with the sentiment. This has to be one of the most amazing - and surprising - chocolate experiences I've ever had. I'm not sure if it's the stoneground cacao itself or the otherwise minimal processing, but this chocolate has the most unusual texture I've ever encountered. It's gritty, but in a wonderful way. Almost cookie-like. Simultaneously rich and sugary, and the chilli works amazingly well too. And those are the only ingredients: cacao, cane sugar, and chilli powder. All organic. Health conscious consumers who want their heart to enjoy the benefits of dark chocolate will be pleased to see this is completely dairy free.The only down-side is that it's way too high in sugar to be a true chocolate health-food. The company's website lists it as having 21 gm of sugar per 38 gm serve (two serves per packet). That makes it 55% sugar, which is not so great. Meaning that in my case at least, this will have to be an occasional treat rather than a daily staple.Still, I can't wait to try their Taza Chocolate Mexicano Chocolate Disc, Cacao Puro, 2.7 Ounce product.

"Okay, at first I admit I was delighted: finally a Bible for princesses!

Once again this crucial aspect of God's teachings has been hidden away in the fine print, with no special attention drawn to it. I am appalled that this, supposedly a Bible made specifically to address the spiritual needs of princesses, does not put such vital information front and center.I can only hope that any princess unfortunate enough to have this as her only Bible will at least be lucky enough to have brothers who will sell her into slavery (Genesis 37:28).Only in this way may she atone for her sartorial sins and be spared the eternal fires of Hell.Theo.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2EQZLDWCSTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052910900X#wasThisHelpful","R3O2EQZLDWCSTY","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The paleo diet has been the subject of serious research in recent years, and so far the results look pretty good. While not yet as extensively investigated as the Mediterranean diet, paleo is not just some wacky fad. This is an approach that, at the very least, is worth exploring and looking into.On a further positive note, this ""book"" is short, clear, and to the point. You can easily read it in the time it might otherwise take you to eat your lunch - paleo or not. While some folks might complain that they're not getting a ""real"" book, personally I consider the length (or lack thereof) a major plus. Far too many diet books could easily have been one tenth their actual size if only the author had not been obliged to churn out enough pointless verbiage to make their book the same size as all the other books on the shelf at Borders.Well... in this brave new world we live in, that's not the case any more.But anyway, having checked out the other reviews, I can honestly say I have no idea what the reviewers who slammed this author's style were talking about. Yes, there were the occasional minor errors that one so often finds in self published material. But overall I found his writing to be both simple and straightforward. This book is not poorly written.So far so good, right? Unfortunately there were some fairly serious negatives that would prevent me from recommending this.First, that whole ""Athlete"" angle seems to be nothing more than a gimmick that's been very poorly tacked on to a short booklet that otherwise does little more than summarize the basic rules of the paleo diet. Readers should also be aware that even within the paleo community, many would regard some aspects of this book's approach as highly controversial. For example, in directing readers to eat meat protein with every meal, to restrict their intake of fruit and nuts, and perhaps most of all, in its claim that carbohydrates are not an essential macronutrient.Second, when we do get onto athlete-specific information, the author pretty well immediately contradicts the basic paleo principles he's elsewhere laid out. In particular, I'm referring to the fact that his recommended post-workout meal includes a whey protein shake, despite the fact that dairy is specifically forbidden on the paleo diet! It's true that this author suggests 3 cheat meals per week, but I can only wonder: is every post workout meal intended to be a cheat meal? What if you workout more than three times per week? Is it possible to have a cheat meal _other_ than a whey protein shake? Then there's the fact that he specifically recommends that all cheat meals for the week be eaten within a 36 hour period...The book's discussion of carbohydrates is similarly inconsistent. While at some points we are told we are allowed to eat sweet potatoes and fruit, in the book's final summary of the paleo diet, we are simply admonished ""Eliminate Carbs"". Bizarrely, just two lines later, this is followed by the rule that we are allowed a maximum of 1 serving of fruit per day.Unsurprisingly, analysis is also not this author's strong point. There is no attempt at all to come to grips with more mainstream medical findings or recommendations such as that high levels of meat consumption are associated with higher rates of mortality; or that we should all eat at least two servings of fruit per day.Finally, none of this book's claims are referenced in any way. None. Nada. Zip. Literally everything is left at the level of raw assertion. This is particularly problematic in the author's repeated (and completely bald) assertion that gluten is indigestible.Really? I'm not convinced. It's certainly true that people with celiac disease need to avoid the stuff. But totally indigestible for everyone? I did some searching myself after finishing this short book, including on the medical database pubmed. And while a case can be made that avoiding gluten could be more broadly beneficial (even for those of us without celiac disease), I could not find anything to back up the claim that gluten is indigestible. Hey, if I'm wrong about this, by all means leave a comment on this review correcting me.But peer reviewed evidence based research only, please.Theo.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX1BHYYH2GF20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPZE5JQ#wasThisHelpful","RX1BHYYH2GF20","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second novel I've read by Jim Bernheimer - the first being Confessions of a D-List Supervillain. In both cases I'd have to say that if there's one thing Bernheimer knows how to do, it's tell a story that grabs you by the throat and takes you on a thrilling adventure ride from beginning to end.In many ways I'd consider him a modern successor to the writers of the golden age of pulp. He's not an Arthur C. Clark or Kim Stanley Robinson, intent on taking you through a meticulously thought out course of scientific and technological development. Bernheimer is all about the story. And I have to say I've enjoyed his stories immensely.That said, I would also like to add that his stories are not entirely without that something deeper that all good science fiction must possess. It has often been said that all stories about the future are really about the present. While I wouldn't accept that as an absolute, Prime Suspects can certainly be read as a critique of this second gilded age we seem to be living in. There is enough here to leave you wondering about many of the things you've encountered - things both said and unsaid. And there's certainly plenty of room left open for a sequel. I'd be genuinely interested to see how Bernheimer would explore the deeper basis to society he's created here, should he choose to do so.On the technological front, my only quibble is that I would've thought that for a society with the biotech to create not only clones, but clones that emerge as fully functioning adults with all the memories and skills of the donor, creating mere replacement organs (such as, say, a heart, a kidney, or a uterus) would be child's play. But... it's not like this was an important plot point, and it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the story.I did receive a free electronic copy of this work for reviewing purposes. But that said, if the author did write that sequel I suggested earlier, I'd have no hesitation at all in buying it with my own money.Theo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30DP12TAKBHE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090A4MLY#wasThisHelpful","R30DP12TAKBHE4","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought I'd give a bad review to a Monty Python piece. The sad part is, those of us who felt the need to give a poor review to this thing are nevertheless Python fans too. But... here goes.Opinion here on Amazon is divided on whether you need to watch or read something all the way through to review it. I'm of the view that if if you gave something an honest attempt but just couldn't make it to the end (or in this case, really didn't want to) it's okay to say so. I tried to watch this a few times. In the end, I made it about halfway through before finally giving up.To be fair, this was... not bad as such. It made me smile often. Chuckle occasionally. But the experience was a long, long way from what it was like to watch the originals. I say ""originals"" because almost none of what you'll see here is new. All the old familiar sketches are trotted out. With just the occasional tweak here or there to a punch line. The only truly funny part - the only part with all the savage irreverence of old - was, ironically enough, when they went off on a complete tangent with a short video insert featuring Profs Brian Cox and Stephen Hawking. It made me wish they'd had the guts to do the unthinkable and hit us with a show of all-new material. I even fast-forwarded through the rest of the show to see if there was indeed any more.But... there wasn't. Instead they went down the safe and obvious route and pandered to the fans. So what we have here is kind of like (well, almost exactly like) watching a band of aging rockers put on a show doing all their old hits from decades past. If you do have the chance to see the show live and you don't happen to have a handy time machine lying around, then yeah, sure, why not. But if you're going to buy a recorded version anyway, you're better off by far if you get them in their heyday.Same deal here.The youthful energy just isn't there anymore. The performances are all lacking what I can only describe as a certain ""tightness"". You can see these people have gone through these motions, have read these lines, enough for one lifetime. Dead Parrot anyone? Or perhaps an Albatross?No thanks.The Terry Gilliam of today is a great director, not a great Gumby.

"DC's Animated offerings have long boasted universally high production values and a general level of finish that can only be described as superb. On a deeper level, however, the quality of their output has varied enormously. At its best, their material easily holds its own against even the most intelligent programming made for ""grown up"" TV. But there have also been rather disappointing efforts that, as much as it pains me to say so, really were just for kids.This one starts off extremely well. The story is set in the mid 20th century, with cold war paranoia at its height. Even superheroes are not immune, and as a result we find ourselves entering into a complex and compelling world with real murkiness in its shadows. Conflicts simmer and seethe beneath the surface, threatening to erupt at any moment. Much is merely suggested or hinted at. I was especially impressed by how well the writers, actors, and animators were together able to create a sense of depth across such a wide array of characters.The film is also remarkable for its departure from the canonical style of drawing first laid down by Bruce Timm in Batman: The Animated Series. In its place we encounter a visual language that is very clearly intended to pay homage to the commercial art and architecture, and most especially the comic books, of the era in which The New Frontier itself is set. True, some of the Googie we find in the Las Vegas scenes has probably been misplaced by about a decade. But seriously, who cares? When something works as well as this does, I think we can forgive such minor acts of artistic license. As much as I admire that ""canonical"" style I mentioned earlier, what this film brought us was an amazing creation in its own right. So for quite a while I found it an extremely impressive piece of work. Up until about two thirds of the way through, I really thought it was going to be one of the great ones.Unfortunately...At a certain point the writers lost their way. I don't know whether they just plain lost their nerve, or if they truly did not know how to meaningfully resolve the conflicts they'd set in motion. Perhaps they just didn't have the stones of Alan Moore. But however you might choose to explain it, let's just say that at a certain point things got real simple and stayed that way.A profound disappointment.Theo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJV93OKK9C547/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014WEFI6#wasThisHelpful","RJV93OKK9C547","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This film brings back a depth that's long been lacking in DC Animated productions - particularly in their one off feature films. Older fans might almost consider this work a very welcome blast from the past - a return to the halcyon days of Justice League Unlimited. I wouldn't quite say The Flashpoint Paradox shares the moral depth of that show at its absolute best. But it does come very close.The film diverges far more markedly from that older material in just how dark it is prepared to get, and in just how far it is prepared to go. Stories set in alternate worlds have always granted writers permission to explore vastly more extreme events and outcomes than would be allowed in the proprietor's canonical universe. On home turf creators must always labor under the commercial requirement to keep all the main pieces of intellectual property intact. And let's face it: it's tough to create the illusion that anything is ever really at stake when characters and their worlds always seem ultimately to return to the manufacturer's default settings. But if there's one thing I can virtually guarantee about The Flashpoint Paradox, it's that it will take you places you never even imagined DC would go.I'd also like to add that this film has an exceptionally strong soundtrack, courtesy of composer Frederick Wiedmann. We're all used to seeing DCAU features with amazing production values, but this score is another step up yet again. Like the film itself, it's of an entirely different order to anything we've experienced in a long while. I very much hope we'll be hearing more from Wiedmann in the future.There are only two reservations I would express about this film.First, this is NOT something you want to be showing to young children. It just isn't, okay? This is by far the darkest and most violent piece of animation I have ever seen from DC - or Marvel either for that matter. It's an awesome piece of filmmaking for the older fans for whom it is clearly intended. But it's not something you want to park the kids in front of.That said, taking the film on its own terms, my only real reservation is as to the fundamental premise on which this film's alternate reality turns. It's all a bit wobbly; or at least, it seems so to me. This is a great pity, because Flashpoint is such an amazing piece of work on every other level. So it's all the more sad to see the writers letting themselves down in their fundamental concept. If they'd taken just a little more care and effort to line all the dots up logically, they could've spared a very good film an embarrassment it didn't need to have.But even with such reservations, my final verdict is that this is still far and away the best animated feature length film I've seen from DC in a long time. If you have any interest in the genre at all, SEE IT.Theo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12I6U024JDJD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8ATK0Y#wasThisHelpful","R12I6U024JDJD1","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have any knowledge of science fiction at all, it is very, very unlikely that you will learn a single new thing by watching this series. It seems to have been made by people who either knew no more than your average fan (or even, dare I say, a slightly below average fan), or alternatively, by people who made a cynical choice to focus exclusively on material that already came prepackaged with a built in fan-base.Each episode follows a simple formula. Episodes start with a nod to the progenitors of the genre: writers like Verne and Wells. Following that, there is a brief stopover with some classic films from the 1950's. Thereafter, aside from maybe a few old Dr. Who or Star Trek episodes from the 60's, things focus almost exclusively on big budget studio films made from the 1970's onwards, with perhaps a hit television series or two from somewhere in the same period thrown in. The first half of the 20th century is excluded almost entirely, and there's precious little about written works of science fiction from any era - unless, that is, they also got made into movies.The makers of this series further insult the intelligence of their audience by taking an almost wholly uncritical attitude to literally every work featured. The only time even the mildest disparaging remark is allowed to be uttered is when it's to point out what a great leap forward a particular work was over that which preceded it. Beyond that, what little analysis there is stays on the level of, say, pointing out the link between Godzilla and fears of nuclear weaponry; or between real world distrust of big government and the X-Files. The sole and lonely exception to this, and in fact the only real point of interest in the entire series, was when it spent about a minute discussing the parallels between the story of Christ and that of Robocop.Sometimes this show just gets things flat out wrong - and we're not talking about particularly obscure factoids here either. For example, it tells us that the 1970's introduced us to the idea that we might not need to look to the skies with fear, as the aliens might be benevolent: witness Spielberg's 1977 blockbuster Close Encounters of The Third Kind. Really? Ever hear of a 1968 film called 2001: A Space Odyssey, made by Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick (which even appears in another episode of this very program)? Or how about the ""Cosmic Trilogy"" of C.S. Lewis, first published in the 1930's and 40's? Or even, arguably, The Day The Earth Stood Still, released in 1951. The list goes on and on.Ultimately I can only wonder who they thought they were making this series for. With a title like ""THE REAL history of science fiction"" (my emphasis), I was expecting to get some inside scoop previously unknown to me - and indeed, to the world at large. But even setting aside any unrealistically high expectations created by the title, it is very difficult to imagine any audience this series would be suitable for. I just can't imagine anyone having enough interest in science fiction to sit through this, and yet so little knowledge of it that anything here would constitute news for them. Well... maybe someone still in childhood or early adolescence who's just discovering the genre. But even they (or perhaps, especially they) deserve better: something that acknowledges the influence of books (and *gasp* short stories) that didn't get made into movies, dares to go off the beaten track once in a while, puts a little more effort into fact-checking, and examines its chosen subject matter with at least an occasional note of criticism.If you are interested in science fiction and would like to hear things that you might not have heard before, I hope you won't mind me mentioning a book that recently gave me a great deal of pleasure: The Man from Mars: Ray Palmer's Amazing Pulp Journey by Fred Nadis.It was everything this series is not.Theo.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OJN3J8M68QDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTKJS3M#wasThisHelpful","R2OJN3J8M68QDX","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first Iron Man movie was great. The second, at the very least, was good. This was the kind of film where the screenwriters (or someone in the development process) felt the need to give the hero a cute kid as a sidekick.Are you beginning to get that sinking feeling?I can summarize this film quite easily. And I think I can do so without giving away anything that could reasonably be considered a spoiler:Hero starts off superficially on top of the world after previous triumphs. Yet not without inner demons gnawing upon his soul (c'mon people - this is Tony Stark). So he gets into some real trouble and has to go away and find himself. Then, in the end, we have a climactic final battle. Oh yeah, and there's an evil conspiracy that needs to be uncovered.Speaking of which, this movie did have a political subtext relating to events in the real world. But not the kind of subtext you get to feel clever for having deciphered. More the kind that leaves you with an aching skull after having been hit over the head so hard.Finally - and I realize not everyone will consider this a fair criticism of a movie based on a comic book - there was absolutely no sense at all in why the baddies' superpowers worked the way they did. None. There's a spare slot in the human brain/genetic code, so therefore... well, you'll get to see. I can't help but wonder if this was all conceived as nothing more than a series of cool special effects.Robert Downey Jr.'s rendering of Tony Stark is as good as it ever was. But the point is, for it to be worth making that third movie, there needs to be _more_. And in this case, there just wasn't.I watched this movie at home. About 15 minutes before the end, just as the climactic final battle was getting underway, I was feeling pretty sleepy. So I went to sleep. I finished off the film the next day, but only because I'd already decided I wanted to review it on Amazon.Theo.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHXP0F1R6C39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUO72#wasThisHelpful","R3DHXP0F1R6C39","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tau Zero deals with an expedition of human interstellar explorers accidentally sent on an eonic journey through the cosmos, courtesy of the time dilating effects of near-light space travel. This is serious hard science fiction, with no fantastic leaps of superscience assumed. Purists of today may quibble that some of the science has been re-written since 1970 when the book was first published. But by the standards of its own day, this was as realistic as things got. Indeed, the vessel in which our travelers make their epic journey bears more than a passing similarity to the interstellar ramjet described by Carl Sagan in his television series Cosmos, first screened a decade later. If you're reading this review on Amazon.com or Amazon.co.uk, I'll include a link to a YouTube clip in which Sagan describes that ship in the comments section below.What prevents Tau Zero from being a 5 star book for me is the lack of psychological depth in the characters. Although Anderson himself would've been just 15 at the time of the Pearl Harbor attacks, throughout this book one can't help but hear the voice of that cohort of science fiction writers for whom World War II was the defining event of their generation: a group of authors who, as a whole, seemed more interested in giving expression to a single provocative idea than in exploring the inner workings of the characters who lived it out.With that in mind, one also can't help but compare this work to that of other science fiction writers publishing at around the same time. J.G. Ballard, although only four years younger on the calendar, is a generation removed in his fundamental approach. It's also impossible to avoid comparing this book to The Forever War - published just 5 years later and grounded in very similar science, but again, generationally removed in its subtlety of human portraiture. It is tempting, if perhaps a little harsh, to say that Tau Zero reads like a story about stick figures by comparison.Nevertheless, for all its limitations, this is a novel that any serious fan of science fiction must read.

"From the early nineties to the mid noughties, the original DC Animated Universe (or DCAU), brought us some truly outstanding work. I'm thinking here of shows like Batman: The Animated Series, Mask of The Phantasm, Justice League, and of course, Justice League Unlimited.This offering isn't quite up to the standard of that earlier epoch at its absolute best. But it is at least as good as the original DCAU Superman: The Animated Series, and it's certainly a noticeable improvement on any of the feature length animated productions DC has been offering us lately. There's significantly more depth to the characters than we've seen in quite a while, even if at times the psychological aspects feel a little tacked on.It hardly needs be said that the music, visuals, and general production values are superb. But then, that's something we've simply come to expect from Warner Bros/DC collaborations.Another area though where more mature viewers may feel the film is a bit wanting is in the lack of moral depth. This is, ultimately, a story with a baddie who is purely and simply bad, and who needs to be smacked down hard. Superman: Unbound does not even attempt to approach the depth of more complex and nuanced works such as Justice League Unlimited or Mask of The Phantasm; or, on a more recent note, Young Justice.Those are all superhero cartoons I would encourage even grown-ups with no preexisting interest in the genre to watch and consider. I believe they're good enough to convince any fundamentally open minded person that superhero cartoons can be, and sometimes are, intelligent and thoughtful works.Superman: Unbound does not achieve that standard.It is, on the other hand, a film I would unhesitatingly recommend to any fan who does already love the genre. It is also the best feature-length animated offering I've seen from DC in a quite while, and it is a lot of fun.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141RON84J2CE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBAQD8G#wasThisHelpful","R141RON84J2CE6","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...yet bizarrely, that's a good thing. This opera is a dense melange of influences that have somehow been made to work together as a coherent whole. But it's more than just coherent: it's compelling.The work can most succinctly be described as a black farce. Yet farce though it may be, don't imagine for one moment that it doesn't take itself seriously. Far from it. Its makers clearly regard the detritus floating down our cultural sewers as an entirely fitting subject for serious scrutiny. They also do not allow us to forget that as appalling as so much about Anna Nicole undoubtedly was, she was still a human being, and a strangely sympathetic, even likeable one at that. And this opera does not go light on the horror of her final days. Thus, as the work seethes and surges towards its inevitable conclusion, we too find ourselves sucked down in this tragicomic descent into Hell - heavy on the tragedy.It also needs to be said that this is an opera concerned with more than just the tragedies of a single human life. It would, I think, be doing the work an injustice to try to assign it a simple message in the same way that we might to an after school special. At the same time, it would also be safe to say that the Anna Nicole we find in this opera is more than just a crass fool who made bad choices. She is very much the victim of a particular kind of vision of the ""American Dream"". I certainly don't want to suggest that she is relieved of all personal responsibility. There are layers here. We could just as easily view this work as an almost literally Shakespearian tragedy, for it is very much the tale of a character destroyed by her own flaws.Musically, it is at once apparent that there are a range of 20th century influences. As the title I gave my review suggests, there are passages that are deeply minimalist, and which seem to me to be more specifically influenced by the music of Phillip Glass. I'm thinking here particularly of the fusion of jazz and ""contemporary classical"" minimalist elements. However, there are other times where the influences are more primal and less structured; or at least, less overtly so. In many of the opera's blackest moments we descend much further back into the preceding century. What we find in such passages is far more Stravinsky than Glass. On the jazz side, I have also heard it claimed that Turnage has been heavily influenced by the music of Miles Davis. I confess that this was not at once aparent to me on my own, but now, having had the dots connected for me, in retrospect I would have to admit that it does make perfect sense.I don't mean to suggest, however, that Turnage is merely aping or quoting these other composers. Rather, it is his ability to at least semi-digest this complex cultural brew before regurgitating it to us that gives this work its curious power. The blend is certainly not seamless. Nor, I think, does it try to be. Turnage is more like a DJ at the turntables of a nightclub, sampling the tropes of the preceding century to create a dub uniquely his own.Others more knowledgeable than I have written extensively on the merits of the various performances, so I shall not attempt to say much here. I will say Eva-Maria Westbroek, who performs in the title role, has a great deal resting on her shoulders. It would be wrong to depict this opera as a one-woman show - it isn't - but it is a good deal closer to it than any other opera I have seen. Eva-Maria, as both an actor and a singer, carries this burden lightly, and delivers a performance that is by turns grotesque, hilarious, and deeply moving. Even, at times, all three at once.Much like the life of Anna Nicole herself.Theo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVGDR95J1OOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I07KL7C#wasThisHelpful","R2VVGDR95J1OOK","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first impulse is to say that the trouble with Wizzil is that it was written by someone who didn't actually understand what a story was. The trouble for me is that Wizzil was written by William Steig; an otherwise enormously talented children's author. So all I can say is that we all bomb occasionally, and in my personal opinion Steig's gift has deserted him here.The fundamental problem with Wizzil is that all the major events in the story unfold in a deus ex machina (""God in the machine"") kind of way. The tale kicks off when Wizzil, a wicked witch, simply decides to start tormenting an innocent family who have done nothing whatsoever to trigger this assault. A series of torments ensue. The victims have no real way of recognizing who or what is behind their woes; or of fending off their tormentor even if they did. The family's misfortunes then come to an equally abrupt end when the witch is herself hit by a wholly external and hitherto unmentioned force: a magical river just washes away her wickedness, causing her to become good.Of course, real life does very often work in exactly this way. No, I'm not talking about evil witches or magical rivers. But sometimes you do just wake up one day and discover that you have cancer. Or that you've gone into remission. Sometimes life is just a series of events with no rhyme or reason to it at all.But a story?In my view stories have at least some kind of internal logic that on some level is involved in determining the outcome. Characters interact with their environment and with each other, and as a result things happen. Maybe all the characters can do is determine what attitude they'll take to the events that life throws at them; but then, that can be a story in itself. Indeed, one of Steig's own works, Sylvester and the Magic Pebble, provides us with a wonderful example of just how compelling even a children's picture book can be when the action is taking place on this psychological level.But a story with no internal logic whatsoever - just a series of events that are visited upon the characters from above - isn't really a story at all. It's... well, it's just a series of events. But far more importantly, it's also going to be profoundly unsatisfying for both adults and children alike. Just as this book is. I find that I can't help but think of the famous phrase from MacBeth: ""Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"".I also find that I can't help but come back to my own, doubtless far more humble turn of phrase:As stories go, this isn't one.Theo.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBGIO7IARIQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2877673405#wasThisHelpful","R2QBGIO7IARIQU","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently I watched (and reviewed) How to Make Money Selling Drugs. In that case a deliberately provocative title was used merely as an attempt to attract a wider audience for what was in reality a polemical piece against the failed policy of prohibition.By contrast, I strongly suspect this film would be far more useful to anyone genuinely seeking instruction in such matters. It documents what went on inside the Miami drug trade in exquisite and unflinching detail - at least during the ""Miami Vice"" era of the 1970's through to about the mid 80's. The fast pace of the film not only makes for great storytelling: it also means an incredible amount of information is packed into a relatively short time-frame. As a result, this is a work that easily withstands repeated viewing. Indeed, it virtually demands it.Cocaine Cowboys has been criticized as being exploitative, and as lacking in real analysis of the wider social impacts. Surprisingly, such criticisms appear even in the product description here on Amazon. Personally, I don't think either criticism is fair. It is true that parents need to be aware that the R rating is there for a reason. Many extremely brutal still-shots in particular appear in this film. It does not skimp on the graphic reality of what happens when you shoot and kill people. But for the adult audience for which it is intended, the film is no more gruesome than it needs to be to honestly portray the events with which it is concerned. Nor more redolent with excess than to portray with equal honesty the milieu in which they occurred.As for the lack of analysis, that's like criticizing a horse for not being a camel. This is a documentary of the old school: it just tells you its story in as neutral a way as possible, and leaves you to form your own judgements. Yes, it is sensational to watch. But don't let that fool you. In its own way this is an extremely rigorous example of the documentary filmmaker's craft.None of which is to say that its creators aren't perfectly aware of the pop cultural context of their work. Of course they are! As a kind of knowing wink to the audience, Jan Hammer, famous for providing the music for Miami Vice, also provides the music for this work. He does a great job, too. His music alludes skilfully to the cocaine cowboys era without ever coming across as merely dated or self-referential. I think it would work perfectly well as straight background music even for those oblivious to the irony of his being chosen for this film.Finally, I would add that this is one case where I would definitely recommend buying the DVD. The generous extras add an enormous amount of additional information, and even include a short bonus documentary  ""Hustlin' With The Godmother: The Charles Crosby Story"". This picks up the life of the ""Godmother"" (Griselda Blanco) where the main feature leaves off.In the end, this is a film that enthralls and informs, but does not judge. It just lays everything out for us, as dispassionately as possible. What we make of it all is up to us.If I myself were to draw any inferences from what I have been shown, they would simply be these:I am quite certain that the flow of product continues unabated. It's just that by the time the 80's drew to a close, those at the top of the food chain had learned that what works well in Columbia does not work in the US. Daily machine-gun battles in the streets and malls of Miami are not good for business.And these people are powerful enough to enforce their interests.Theo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSG6UIHJXWXOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KLQUUS#wasThisHelpful","RSG6UIHJXWXOP","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let's begin with the basics: this is not a literal ""how to"" guide. The intentionally provocative title is meant as satire, and is an attempt to package polemic in a form that will attract an audience not normally disposed to watching serious documentaries. All this the director quite openly admits in the commentary.Will his approach achieve that aim? Honestly, I doubt it. It's hard to see this film attracting anything other than the standard audience for left-leaning films that bridge the gap between activism and journalism. Not least of all because beyond a certain point all pretense at instructing the viewer in the film's ostensive subject is dropped: the director just concentrates on pitching us his message. As a result, in its presentation at least, this film is about as convincing as a middle aged vicar who's decided that he's going to rap to the local teenagers about Jesus.Word to your virgin mother.Or perhaps I should just say ""Keep it real, yo"". Although I am reliably informed that rappers don't say that anymore either.None of which means that underlying all this, there isn't a good documentary. Actually, there rather is. Once you get past its utterly unconvincing attempts to wrap itself in a kind of Grand Theft Auto street-cool, you'll find an intelligent, well researched film with important things to say. Although its underlying message is far from new, and has in fact been quite admirably summed up by Homer Simpson:""Prohibition? They tried that in the movies and it didn't work.""To its credit, this film does do a devastating job of laying bare the real human cost of prohibition and the war on drugs. Of a ""justice system"" beholden to nothing more than maintaining the status quo and all its subsidiary interests: commercial, political, and bureaucratic. A system that, as a result, is now ruining lives on an industrial scale.Throughout much of the earlier part of the film, the part that really did deal with the escapades of various entry-level drug dealers on their journey through the ranks, I found myself laughing and chuckling away many times - nihilistic SOB that I am.But after the justice system got involved, even I could no longer laugh.And that, of course, is the real point of this movie.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KIHY2VNTQJQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGNC45W#wasThisHelpful","R1KIHY2VNTQJQH","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This film teaches two objects lessons: no number of clever one-liners can carry a film unaided, and a formula that will sustain a half hour TV-show can easily collapse under the weight of a full-length movie.Yes, the one-liners are often very witty. Yes, the actors deliver them well. In fact, as has been widely commented upon, Hank Azaria's performance as Gargamel is far and away the best thing about this film.But seriously, that's it.It has often been claimed that at the core, there are really only a very small number of stories. Stories that we tell and retell over and over again across the generations, with only relatively minor cosmetic changes upon each retelling. Endless variations on a few core themes.If that's true, then the real job of the storyteller is to disguise this fact. The simple truth is, these storytellers did a lousy job of disguising it. The setbacks, the heartwarming moments, the climactic final battle: all come across as unbearably obvious and clichéd. Everything and everyone we encounter is utterly and completely one-dimensional. I really mean that, by the way.

"I can sum up what's wrong with this work very easily: it's the kind of film where characters do, say, and feel things because the script says they do. The most egregious example of this is the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane Foster. It's just sort of plopped in our laps that these two characters who've only just met are now madly in love.Are they? Well gee. How about that, huh?There are also problems with the visual design of the film. I'm particularly thinking here of the sets and costuming. To be fair, they started out with the right idea, taking their cues directly from Jack Kirby's original work on the Marvel comic book version of Thor. But while the idea may have been great, the execution was profoundly uninspired. Just as any mediocre art student can ""copy"" van Gogh's style up to a point, these people have copied Kirby... up to a point. But that spark of something exceptional that allowed Kirby to truly add to the visual language of our culture - it's just not there. The electrifying energy and well-nigh cosmic sense of portent that were such hallmarks of Kirby's work are nowhere to be found. In this film Loki's helm looks like exactly what it is: a chunk of plastic.In the end, I'd have to say that what's really wrong with the film is the same thing that's wrong with most superhero films: even though they hired a bunch of A-listers to pull it off, having been hired these people did not apparently see any real need to take what they were doing especially seriously. It's not that they produced a campy farce. It's more that they very obviously didn't feel the need to bring their own A-games to bear. After all, it's only a superhero movie. A summer blockbuster. `Nuff said.To be fair, for the most part the fault lies not so much with the actors as with the writers and director (although in exception to this, I'm not entirely sure that Anthony Hopkins was even awake for much of the filming). But getting back to those behind the camera, it's quite plain for all to see that these people just didn't care that much about what they were doing.As a result, just...Meh.Theo.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DFKIS9C26WZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H9B44A#wasThisHelpful","R3DFKIS9C26WZS","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If there's one thing that stands out about this film, it's its sheer intensity. Mifune Toshiro practically chews the scenery in the lead. The incidental music is unbelievably, almost electrifyingly dramatic. The low howl of the wind alone sounds like something straight out of Eraserhead.The cinematography is so stark and laid bare as to practically scream at the audience from beginning to end. We're all used to seeing black and white photography used to express the stylish and refined, as in the mode of a Humphrey Bogart or Bette Davis melodrama. But what Kurosawa crafts here, particularly in the wilderness scenes, is so utterly primeval that I can only compare its vision to the original King Kong. It's incredible what the brush of a true master can paint with only black and white.As you might expect, my only reservations about this movie are as to whether it's almost _too_ intense. Is it a masterpiece, or is it just over the top?Perhaps the very fact that we find ourselves asking such questions says more about the way we are used to seeing - and thinking about - Shakespeare than anything else. Throne of Blood is the ultimate antidote to ""reverential"" productions of the bard. It's a stark, brutal, no-holds-barred take on betrayal, murder, and ultimately madness. Paradoxically, I find myself wondering if for all its oriental trappings, it might not be the closest any of us will get to seeing how the Elizabethans themselves would've performed Shakespeare.One final thought: clearly set in Japan's ""Sengoku"" or ""Warring States"" period, perhaps the most dystopian element of the film is the sense it gives that it is offering us just one small window into this bleak and horrifying age. In this, Kurosawa is clearly making a break with Shakespeare's original vision of Macbeth, which in the end resolves itself into an orderly, governed universe.Throne of Blood offers no such solace. Rather, we are left in the end with the feeling that at any time the camera could have pulled back and shown us a whole world of murder and betrayal. An entire age of empty slaughter and pointless death, driven on by nothing more than blind, lurching panic and grasping greed.Or, in the words of Macbeth himself:And pity, like a naked new-born babe,Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsedUpon the sightless couriers of the air,Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,That tears shall drown the wind.

"This is a deeply flawed film. But still, I think, an underrated one. A film probably not _quite_ fully deserving of its profoundly unimpressive box office numbers and many critical pannings.The best thing about this movie are its visuals. Here, it's utterly electrifying and completely true to the original comic book vision. On this level it also benefits enormously from taking itself entirely seriously, a strength that unfortunately does not flow through into too many other aspects of the work.The problems, you see, are in the writing.It has been said that at the heart of all stories there is only one story: the hero's journey to find him or her self. That's what we get here. The trouble is, this hero's inner quest is utterly banal. The lessons learned are about as deep and interesting as those to be found in the latest disposable self-help paperback chock full of dime-store psychobabble. Or even, dare I say it, penny arcade psychobabble.Incidentally, while we're on the subject of character, to be completely fair, even though the leading man and lady seem to have been chosen mainly on the basis of their looks, both do at least a credible job of standing up and reading their lines. Of course, we're still left with the problem that those lines suck, but yes, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively both put in a solid if unremarkable showing. The only really noteworthy performance is by Mark Strong as Sinestro. What's truly impressive here is that we do get to see the well-intentioned man that Sinestro starts out as, while just subtly hinting at the tragic flaws that will ultimately lead to his damnation.Strong's work aside, the best performances in this film are by those who are merely lending their voices to various CGI creations. This includes Geoffry Rush who provides the voice of Tomar-Re, and Michael Duncan in the role of Kilowog. The only other actor I'd like to pick out by name is Clancy Brown, who provides the voice of Paralax. While best known for his role as the Kurgan in the original Highlander, he's also had a very successful voice acting career. In Bruce Timm's original DC Animiated Universe, Brown owned Lex Luthor like Kevin Conroy owned Batman, although sadly, he never seemed to receive the same level of recognition for doing so. While hardly used to his fullest potential in this film, he is at least worthy of an honorable mention.Fundamentally, I would have to say that the problem with this work is that the director and screenwriters didn't take what they were doing even the tiniest bit seriously. I'd hazard a guess to say that these are not people who watch - or read - anything in the superhero genre in their off-hours. So on the most fundamental level, what I really think was lacking here was any respect at all for the source material.When someone like Frank Miller comes along and thinks seriously about who his characters are and why they do the things they do, it shows. Similarly so on the acting front when people like Christian Bale and Kevin Conroy portray the Bat. But when someone comes along and says ""Hey, let's do a summer blockbuster - we'll make tons of money!"", that also shows. Because frankly, that's the kind of thinking that shines through in this mediocrity.It doesn't completely suck. I suspect that somewhere, far behind the scenes, deep in the CGI department, there were some geek true believers who sincerely loved the Green Lantern mythos.Unfortunately, their work is very close to being the only thing in this movie that's worth watching.Theo.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15NQ8OBBM1BQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LJITS0#wasThisHelpful","R15NQ8OBBM1BQ6","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ironically named ""Regular Show"" deals with the adventures of two young adult slackers whose main aim in life seems to be coasting through their jobs as park groundskeepers while doing as little actual work as possible. Given that this is a cartoon, it isn't terribly surprising that these characters are anthropomorphic animals: the central pair are Mordecai, a blue-jay, and Rigby, a racoon. However, once we depart from that launching point things grow progressively more strange. For example, their boss at the park is Benson: a walking, talking gumball machine. Occasionally we even get to hear the gumballs rattling around inside this decidedly sour personality! Nevertheless, ordinary humans too are also often found wandering through this rather odd universe.The stories generally start out with Mordecai and Rigby facing a relatively mundane problem, such as wanting to slack off work and go play video games. However, things quickly spiral into surreal, and potentially even apocalyptic madness. If this series has a flaw, it is that many of the episodes can be a bit formulaic in this regard. That said, they are certainly no more formulaic than most shows on television, and in any event, it would probably be fair to say that this formulaic quality only stands out because the show really is so original and exceptional on just about every other level.The artwork in Regular Show is also rather interesting. In many ways it quite clearly takes its cues from some of the better quality, hipper animation from the early 1970's. We're not quite talking Fritz the Cat here, but we're also light-years away from the old Hanna Barbera stuff. On a purely visual level it actually bears more than a passing similarity to many of the very early original animated segments used in Sesame Street. Sesame Street aside, for many viewers the most familiar reference point will be the old 1990's Nicktoon Hey Arnold!, which likewise clearly alluded to this same artistic linage. The style of art in Regular Show is very similar to that found in Hey Arnold!, except that in Regular Show the colors tend to be lighter, the coloring more solid, and the overall composition less dense. Of course, this lighter, more spacious composition is entirely fitting for a cartoon set largely in parkland rather than urban sprawl.What's also interesting about this show is that contrasted against the 1970's influenced artwork, many of the technological and pop cultural references within the show are drawn from the 1980's. For example, audio and VHS cassettes feature prominently, and in one episode we even get to revisit the New Kids on the Block. The video games Mordecai and Rigby are forever so focused upon also tend to have a decidedly 1980's feel to them. If you're a mature viewer, I think you'll find that it's a show that repackages and reimagines many of your old memories, often in quite surprising ways.If you have any interest in animation at all, you HAVE to check out this show.Theo.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ON6DHFSKHQBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009XSZVDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3ON6DHFSKHQBG","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the exception of very brief and perfunctory moments of exposition, this film is little more than one long action sequence. It's entertaining enough in a frothy sort of way, but that's about as much as you can say of it. Some might consider it horror, but for myself I would rather say that it's more of a pure action film that just happens to be set in a horror-themed landscape.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale both deliver the goods in their respective roles. While hardly performing Shakespeare, they do what's required to make their characters work. My only real complaint on the acting front is that Richard Roxburgh wasn't really up to the task of portraying Count Dracula. This is a role that positively demands that magnetism and presence be oozing from every pore. What we get instead is a rather wishy-washy sort of chap.In the end, I can only say that the title I gave this review - ""Little More Than One Long Action Sequence"" - sums up my take on this movie. At times I almost felt as if I were just watching a video game, albeit one with really cool graphics.It's light entertainment with a High Gothic aesthetic. But it's nothing more than that.Theo.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MEQ6KBGMZH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HML6Y8#wasThisHelpful","R11MEQ6KBGMZH1","A2VUD4SPJO4V33","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUD4SPJO4V33?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:47 MinsWe are very happy with this cage but I wish the door had easier access for a rabbit. It is a bit too high. This would be great for guinea pigs and small rabbits as a overnight cage. I would not use this full time for a medium to large rabbit as it is not big enough.Update 10/30/15I really wish I had bought this cage sooner! I had our rabbit in a very large dog cage and it was so hard to get in to clean it. I LOVE the lift up top to get inside. The cabelas bin is working awesome in this as a litter box. I had originally planned to build a ramp but my rabbit is going in and out fine. I added a bath mat to give a softer place to lay down. My bun loves laying up on the shelf. He is 6lbs and fits fine up there and just fits into the cave area but hardly goes in there. Can't recommend this enough for rabbits that also get run around time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TIKY6JRF0MLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BNE1YA#wasThisHelpful","R2TIKY6JRF0MLA","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasted my money on this product. I have a carpet runner and a tile section in my home that smells when it is damp. My dog is incontinent and sometimes leaks so I am constantly cleaning the floors and trying different products. Anyway, I used the Angry Orange on the runner with a carpet cleaner on the top AND BOTTOM of the carpet. I went over and over the area that she leaked. The smell of this stuff is very strong. Strong enough that I would not use it in my bedroom the same day I wanted to sleep in there. The smell takes awhile to disappear but when it does the smell is still there. I waited a few days and did the sniff test and I could still smell dog. I also tried this product on the tile floor and literally soaked the grout. After the smell went away I can still smell the doggy smell. It just does not work. I need to stick with the enzyme type products. Even Odor Ban from Home Depot worked better than this (not enzyme but good disinfectant and odor control).","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JDCC7KITW3ZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OI20SXA#wasThisHelpful","R3JDCC7KITW3ZE","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 5:04 MinsI bought 2 of these vanities but in the single sink model. I am sure the finish is the same so I wanted to post the video here so you can see what you are getting. The vanity is heavy, the top is very nice, I love the square sinks but the finish is pretty bad. One of the 2 cabinets is much worse than the other. The ""paint"" is too heavy in some places and it collected in the corners of the drawers and trim and I just know it is going to chip over time. So not only is it not a pretty look, I do not believe it will hold up. The cabinet may be made of wood (seems very soft) but all the trim is not. The trim material is like a pressed cardboard. It is NOT going to stand very well against bumps. The soft close hardware is pretty bad. The drawers are very difficult to open. You really have to tug on them. It has to be the worst functioning soft close drawer I have ever used. The drawers are not dove tail which I can live with. If they just took a little more time on the finish this would be an AMAZING piece.

I actually have the one now hanging on the wall next to the bunny litter box since he seems to think he needs to pee by it I figure that will encourage the box usage.

"I am using these in my 10lb indoor rabbit pen just incase he has an accident. While he was litter training he would have 1 accident a day so these pads were amazing to keep the mess contained and they wash really well (I hang dry most of the time though). Only one time did the pad leak and that was when the bunny peed near the corner (they pee a surprisingly large amount just a couple times a day just for reference). If the accident is farther inward on the pad it has no issue containing it as it absorbs away from the impact spot in all directions and keeps the moisture in the pad.I don't know if I would use one of these exclusively to protect an expensive mattress. I did consider getting a large one to use on my potty training sons bed but I would still put those cheap plastic liners underneath just in case. When is came down to it I can get the ""Wet-Stop Twin Waterproof Mattress Cover"" which I have used many times before and it works really well and covers the entire bed for just a few dollars more than the large whelp pad.In all I think this is a great product and it does work well however if the accident is near the edge it may leak so I would get one much larger then you think you need especially if it is going on a bed and may move around under the sheets. If you are using this for a small dog or new puppy this is such a great option vs. the disposable puppy pads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17NFBVIGVGNSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AY7GIC#wasThisHelpful","R17NFBVIGVGNSZ","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product for free from BzzAgent and was asked to provide honest feedback. My son who is 4 was so excited when this arrived and could not wait to play it. We popped in the bot and started to play and although the graphic quality is not horrible it is not the best either. My son is used to playing games on the Wii so the difference in quality is significant. That being said the games are short but fun. He really enjoys playing this for short periods of time. It is a bit repetitive but holds his interest long enough for me to get some chores done. I find he had no trouble using the controller although it is not 100% responsive all the time. The game requires batteries and cannot be plugged in. On one hand it is a bit of pain to have to use batteries but on the other hand the game is small and since it does not require an outlet we can bring it in the van for play on the go with our dvd player. In all I would say the game is fun and great for those around 4yrs old however the price may be a bit high for what you get. If your child has not experienced video game systems yet then I would definitely give this a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H3QHVA3RHYAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWNUHA8#wasThisHelpful","R3H3QHVA3RHYAP","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have 12 of these in my house. I expected at least one to have a defect but all 12 worked perfectly! I even dragged one of them off the counter by mistake and it fell to the tile floor and the bulb smashed but the light is still working just fine. I looked at all the different window light options and at first wanted the LED battery ones but after looking at all the ones available decided not to get them for the below reasons.1. From all the reviews I have seen the LED bulbs either come in organge (think halloween orange) or white (LED super bright harsh white). I did not want orange lights. These plug in look so much nicer and the light color is closer to an actual flame coloring. This was probably the most important difference for me. I did not want halloween orange lights.2. From all the reviews it appears the battery lights are not as bright. I live on .5 acre and am set away from the road. My neighbor across the street who is at least 300 ft away from me commented on how nice and bright the lights are.3. I thought that battery ones would be easier but after researching it I found that is not exactly the case. It seems most of the LED have timers but you have to set the timer based on when the light is initially on. People commented that they would have them all set (if you have a lot you need to work quick to set them all together as they have to be set individually). Once it came time to change batteries you have to try to get the new lights in sync with the old ones. With these plug in lights they have a light sensor and automatically come on when it is dark and turn off when it is light.4. Some people commented on the batteries in the LED's only lasting 1-2 months for the AA and 3-4 months for the C kind. I did not want to bother with having to change batteries since I am running 12 lights. I like that I just plug it in and leave it.5. I thought it would be cheaper to use the batteries but after calculating the cost I found it would cost me $3.00 to run all 12 lights 12hrs a day for a month. It would cost me around $9.00 to run the LED's (assuming the 2 C batteries in each would last 4 months). So it was cheaper for me to get the plug in ones.So in review: If you are looking at these vs. LED-The color of these are much nicer unless you are going for that LED bright white or orange-They are brighter (according to folks who own LED battery ones)-They are easy, plug it in and forget it!-They may be cheaper depending on your electricity rate and what cost you can get batteriesObviously I have not owned the battery led but went through every model I could find and looked at every review (both good and bad) and this is the information I found.Overall I love these and am VERY happy with my purchase. I will probably leave them on all winter as I love the way they look. They are bright so if you need complete darkness while you sleep they might not be for you. I have them in my bedroom and my sons and we have no issue with them on while sleeping. Yes, they are light weight but I just added a little bit of masking tape to the base and they sit fine.UPDATE: My neighbor got battery LED ones this year and standing on the street looking at them side by side mine are much brighter. Still very happy with these although I do seem to lose 1 each year. When I pull them out in November 1 will be nonfunctioning. Considering the price I am still very happy and just replace the broken ones. If you plan to put these in your bedroom be warned they are on the bright side. They are nightlight bright. We just close our curtain (making sure the curtain is not touching the bulb).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3677CPJPNSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001144YXI#wasThisHelpful","R1F3677CPJPNSW","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my son who at the time was just 3yrs old. The fast speed was too quick at first but it did not take him long to start using it. My daughter who is almost 6 loves it as well. We use it on the road and on the grass (hills as well). My son will get stuck about once a week on it but usually he is going up a hill and stopped at the bottom. If he does not stop it goes up hills pretty well. Holds the charge for a week with regular use. Very easy to recharge the battery. Overall I am very happy with this and would purchase it again.Good for ages: 3yrs - 6yrs (I am sure a 7-8yr old would have no trouble with it)Pros:-large enough for kids to use it for a few years-Slow and fast speeds as well as reverse. Simply click the button to back up.-pretty good turning radius compared to the power wheels pickup truck we own-battery life is pretty good, kids get a lot of use out of the charge-lots of fun! goes well on grass (even with hills)Cons:-wheels are pretty loud on the road which is typical with plastic wheels but because of the big tread these seem really loud. I have to remind my kids to stick close because if they get too far ahead the wheels are so loud they cannot hear me yelling. Also, hard to hear cars approaching from behind with the wheel noise.Not an issue on dirt/grass.UPDATE: It is now 9/25/2014 and this thing is still charging and running like a champ. It gets a lot of use and the back wheels are cracked (well one has a large hole actually) but it still plugs along.

I am 5'8'' so I just lift the basket up and over the gate but since it is so high someone shorter may have issues with that.

"My kids are 18mo, 3 yrs and 5yrs old. They all LOVE this book. We actually picked it up at a garage sale and the mouse was missing but the back cover gives a template for making a new mouse which is really great! I decided to give this as Christmas gifts this year for those who have young children. The story is about a mouse trying to find food in the house and he slips through slits in the pages to get from one area to another. My 5yr old always wants to work the mous and usually is able to do it just fine on her own. Some of the slots are easier than others but all in all she really enjoys it. The content of the book is fine for someone who is concerned with that. Nothing that would make you cringe like other childrens books. Great buy, worth the price in my opinion. I have heard that this one is better then the squirell book.Good for ages 1-7Pros:-Very cute, kids will LOVE it.-Different from any other book we have-Gets the kids interacting with the story while moving the mouse around-Easy to make a new mouse when it gets lostCons:-Can’t  think of any!

"These look nice however they do not absorb water. The water sits in a puddle on top of the wood. They hold the water ok however I was expecting them to absorb it not just let it sit on the surface. So far I have only used it with a plastic cup but I imagine because the glass is sitting in the water you have a good chance of drips when you pick up the glass. I had the stone ones and they absorbed the water much better. The other issue is these will fit the standard dinner glass however I tend to use a wider beer mug type glass (with a handle) and the glass will not fit on these because of the lip. Also, these do not have a soft bottom (felt/cork) like others I had. It is all wood so I am concerned they may scratch my tables.

I have two sets so I can easily compare them and the way they were packaged. I contacted the seller about my missing part and my concern that the one panel looks damaged. He kept saying they would sent me the missing pole and that I have a yr warrenty on the lights so if they stop working to call them and they will send me a new set. I told him I wanted a product that was in new condition right from the start and could they just take back the damaged looking one and send me a new set but they refused. My concern is the casing does not seem tight and I think these things are going to stop working as soon as some water gets in there. Also I have no idea if this thing is used as the protective film is missing the panel is scratched up. I am going to hang these so I really don't feel like putting them up only to take them back down in a couple weeks. I am a bit annoyed that they would not just replace the one set. Anyway, the lights appear to be pretty bright considering they lit up right out of the box. Hopefully these things truly have a yr warrenty...guess I need to confirm that now before I get stuck with a dead product. Customer service is NOT GOOD....UPDATE: I changed this to 5 stars because I am just now having to order a new set as one set just stopped working. I ordered 2 sets originally May 2012. I live in Northern NJ and they have been wrapped around a arbor since then through summer and winters (solar portion buried under snow). The one set is still going strong and the other just finally died. It was the one that I was concerned about to begin with but honestly I never expected either set to last this long under NJ weather. Money well spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2981OH1UJF8UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FTGVDW#wasThisHelpful","R2981OH1UJF8UW","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not sure why the other person had such a horrible experience with their Aosom. I bought mine 3/2010 and the trampoline mat and frame are holding up great. We leave ours fully assembled year round and we live in Norther NJ so we get hot summers (sitting in full sun) and snowy winters. The pad is not holding up well however we did leave it sitting out for 2 winters. The plastic is cracking and the skirt was never really long enough to keep it from creeping up. I felt like I was pushing the skirt down more then I would like. The net also needs to be replaced this year as we tore a hole in it while shoveling 10 inches of snow off the mat. The springs, frame and mat all seem to be holding up really well. I would not expect to get 3 years out of the netting or pad but I think that is a fair timeframe. My three younger kids (under 5) and myself (160lbs) use it all the time. We had a few parties and had multiple teenagers on it at once. I am VERY happy with our trampoline. I wish the outer spring mat and net would have held up better but I understand if you leave them out year round they don't last long. I would purchase again.UPDATE - 2/15/2015This trampoline is still going strong. The replacement outer mat/net is holding up well. The net did get a few small holes but I use fishing line and sew it back together which gets me at least another year out of it. Considering we bought it in 2010 and leave it up year round in full sun and snow I am very impressed. The frame, springs and trampoline mat are all holding up very well. I would absolutely buy this again. Best money spent!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27KASTZ0WGIR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037FYM3G#wasThisHelpful","R27KASTZ0WGIR4","AEIV8NDUIATRU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEIV8NDUIATRU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved the book and love the movie.  It's rare that a movie really reflects the book well, this one does.  I watched this with my teenage daughters and they loved it as well.  The early civil rights movement from the perspective of maids in Mississippi is very unique.  We talked a lot once the movie was over and my kids were shocked that this sort of treatment of people took place not so long ago.  Anything that keeps the conversations going is worth my time to watch.  Helping my kids understand the world they live and why certain things are considered a big deal is important.  They are growing up well after the events in the story and are sometimes confused by racial divides.  There is good in that because that means it's not as prevalent today but understanding our history is essential to avoid repeating it's ugly parts.  This is a great way to glean a fresh perspective on a recent time period in our country.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17HL9HCKVUN3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006IGZWB2#wasThisHelpful","R17HL9HCKVUN3D","A3HLAMP842AMWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HLAMP842AMWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have 2 bedrooms that are really hot in the summer.  I bought one of these to try a few years ago and was very happy with the results.  One reviewer suggested removing the fan cover on the underside to increase airflow.  We did that modification and it made a huge difference, it also reduced the amount of noise the unit produced.  I understand why it's covered but having that extra grate for the air to run through does reduce the overall airflow.  The lights on the unit bothered one of my kids so I just stuck a piece of duct tape on it.

"I was skeptical of the reviews because they were all written in May 2014 and were all raving about this thing.  I decided to buy it because I like the look.  My first impression, it looks cheap, not something I want in my living room.  With that said, I filled it with  water and some orange essential oil and it definitely diffuses the oil.  The light is weird to me and I won't use that feature, maybe if I end up putting it in a kids room for night light.  I will update.  There is just one big reservoir for the oil and water that is connected to the motor so cleaning will be a pain.  You can't submerge it, just wipe out.  This also means the oil sits on plastic not ceramic, which for a lot of people is a concern.  For the price, go with something else.

It allows us to bring his Legos and some other toys and provide a place for him to play that contains the Lego so I'm not freaking out about losing them.  We use it at least once a week on the go and often around the house to keep the tiny pieces from getting lost in the carpet.  This size is just right. Not so big that it's cumbersome and not so small that you're limited with what you bring.  We do also have the small layngo for dinners out or places that wouldn't have the space for this mat.

"These are just what you'd expect. Thick soled, fluffy, soft slippers.  I needed something to wear for the warmer months around the house and these are great.  They would be 5 stars for sure if there just wasn't that annoying embroidered acorn on the heel.  I will never understand why shoe companies do that.  For one, you can't see the logo. Secondly, it's like having a pebble in your shoe.  I asked my daughters to try the slippers to see if it was just me being overly sensitive and they both made the same comment.  So I took a seam ripper and removed the cute little acorn embroidery from the heel and these are perfect!  If anyone from Acorn reads these reviews, I suggest placing the logo on the part that goes across the top of the foot where it can be seen and allow your customers to be perfectly comfortable.  I would recommend these with the caveat that the stitching across the heel may annoy you but there is an easy solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0YZTIT4JDO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009411Q5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1D0YZTIT4JDO6","A3HLAMP842AMWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HLAMP842AMWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really really wanted to love this vacuum cleaner. I have spent so much time on the phone with Dyson customer service having parts replaced. The only original part I have now is the motor which must be the underlying problem.  The brush head is always getting jammed and needing to be cleaned making this a high maintenance vacuum.  I could live with that.  I battery stopped holding a charge, got a replacement, I could live with that.  The big problem is the cleaning power.  I keep it in our kitchen hoping for quick pick up after meals and general ""sweeping"" chores on a wood floor.  This thing can't pick up crumbs! I use the roller head to go over the floor first, then attach the narrow end to get under cabinets and around baseboards.  Still a ton of stuff left.  I've given up and now just sweep.  My $40 dust buster did a far superior job.  I thought I would be upgrading with all the Dyson hype. If I liked this one, I was going to upgrade our household vacuum for a Dyson. Now, not a chance!  If it can't keep up with basic daily pick up, there is no way I'd trust this company to produce a vacuum that could keep up with weekly deep cleaning of the house.  Save your money, look elsewhere.  All you'll get here is a cool looking wall decoration that makes noise around your home.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RETPM576XNAEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GN8UYA#wasThisHelpful","RETPM576XNAEK","A3HLAMP842AMWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HLAMP842AMWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I wore these it was 5 degrees outside and it had just snowed an inch or so. I wore these with a pair of medium weight socks and was very happy with the fit and comfort.  A bit stiff around the heel but not bad.  I was excited to have dry feet and was prepared to write a raving review.  Then I wore them the next day.  My feet were not only cold, they were soaked! It wasn't raining and the snow I walked in was only an inch deep so it wasn't coming in the top of the shoe.  I tried one more time and noticed the same thing.  I called UGG and was told I could return them for ""warranty inspection"".  That means I would have to pay to ship them to UGG for them to decide whether or not to replace them or return them to me.  Totally up to them.  That is, in my opinion, terrible customer service!!  If I went into LLBean to return a shoe that leaked, they would just give me new shoes on the spot. No questions asked!  I returned these to Amazon (thank you Amazon for your amazing customer service!) and did go to L.L. Bean and bought a pair of bean boots instead.  Not as cute but definitely stay dry and the customer service is amazing!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QJBAS055CL9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004A8TRXY#wasThisHelpful","R3QJBAS055CL9C","A3HLAMP842AMWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HLAMP842AMWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked the idea of this after being a loyal ""Gentle Leader"" user.  I didn't like that with the G.L., some people thought it was a muzzle and assumed our dog was aggressive. We lost our gentle leader and decided to try this.  It work well at first but I found that every time I wanted to use it, I had to readjust the straps because they constantly loosen up.

I love the introductions and have learned so much about the culture and background in the bible that I just didn't know.

The DVD is nice but we prefer the book.  We've watched it but just in short stints as it doesn't hole my kids attention as well.  None the less, a nice set.

"I got these for my daughter who asked about changing the light when she read.  I like these as a way to play around with the proper colors to use for filters.  The only draw back is that they are glossy which in itself, could cause eye strain.  For the price, you get to test some colors and combinations to see what works for you.  We then purchased 2 filters through Irlen.  The Irlen filters are matte finish and easier on the eyes.  They are more expensive but if you figure out what color works best first, you can just purchase what you need.

We have a large rug in our family room and 4 kids are constantly running around the room. With this mat the rug does not budge!  I didn't find it as plush as other reviewers and would love for it to be a bit more so to make the carpet more comfortable but it's not a big deal.  The quality of the mat is excellent. Solid rubber backing, well made felt composition.  No shedding or fluff coming off.  I used the scraps to under the carpet in our entry way and that rug is finally staying in place!

"It seems that every year I'm buying a new mat for the kitchen sink.  I've had some that kept slipping away, some that collected all the dust in the house, some that just got too many stains.  I was skeptical about spending so much on a mat but took a chance and trusted the reviews.  I ordered this in Cinnamon hoping for a slightly more red color than I got.  The color is fine, it's brown but nice enough.  I laid it out and left it overnight to ""unroll"" a bit more.  Here's what I love, it disappears in the kitchen.  I mean you forget it's there.  I don't spend time pushing it back in place or always having to vacuum it.  If it gets spilled on, I wipe it up and voila!, good as new.  It is very comfortable to stand on, it's not like a day at the spa or anything but I notice that I don't have any discomfort.  My feet don't get sore or tired and I don't find myself shifting my weight from foot to foot trying to stay at ease.  In my opinion, it's well worth the investment.  It comes with a 7 year warranty which to me means that it should last at least that long.  It seems well made so I expect it will last at least that long.  That's less than $10 per year which is already less than I've been spending on all my cheapo mats.  I would love to see it in more vibrant colors but the fact that it just blends into the kitchen is growing on me.  It's nice not notice it because to me, it means that it's not having the same problems we've had with lesser quality mats.  If you're on the fence, I can confidently suggest you go ahead and try it.  I am, in fact, ordering a 2nd to place in the laundry room which is where I spend the rest of my time once the dishes are done.  ;)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35B76UXNAIOUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BYRDK2#wasThisHelpful","R35B76UXNAIOUA","A3HLAMP842AMWI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HLAMP842AMWI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, my iPhone did have extra room and did slide around but I wasn't concerned about it falling out because the closure is wide. The only way it would fall out would be if the magnetic snap closure didn't close. The reason I returned this was because it just didn't have a great way to keep all my cards and cash.  I had to fold my cash small and double up my cards.  Not a huge deal except that I couldn't find what I needed easily.  If you don't have many cards and don't tend to carry cash, this is a great option.  Beautiful color.  Wish it was just a bit more practical.

"Since I was six years old I have been plagued with migraines; horrible heart pounding agony, and when I was six no one believed me, my mother said I was too young to get headaches. So I treated myself with a washcloth soaked in cold water on my forehead and a mental exercise in which I visualized the top of my head being removed and my brain taken out and soothed in cool water. Yes, I know it sounds wacky, but it was all I had and it did alleviate some of the pain. then I got Excedrin in my teens and never had a bad headache again; these pills are amazing, literally 5 minutes and I take one the headache vanishes. heaven. At the first sign of one coming on I attack it with one Excedrin. Fabulous.

"SUPERB film! ONLY Gloria Swanson could possibly have portrayed Norma Desmond, she WAS Norma Desmond, the line between role and actress disappeared when she appeared for the first time in the film. Such a great beginning, Holden face down in her pool narrating how he got there and what had transpired before that led to this watery end. The monkey funeral and the appearance of Von Stroheim as the butler were appropriately bizarre and eerie. The house itself, used for the film, has a history almost as compelling as the movie it was used for:http://wilshireboulevardhouses.blogspot.com/2013/02/641-south-irving-boulevard-please-see.htmlThe story is unbearably tragically sad; poor Norma, so lonely so lost so rejected, then having William Holden just appear on her doorstep truly seemed like salvation for her. He stayed with her allowing her to treat him like a sort of living Ken doll, a plaything to dress up lavish money on, then to fall in love with, when the dynamic changed, so did the uneasy nature of their relationship. You feel sorry for both of them but sorrier for Norma (at least I did).I was blessed to have not only met her at a party but to spend time sitting next to her with the party swirling around us and have her do the entire staircase scene for me, hand gestures and all; I was MESMERIZED. When she finished she looked at me and said ""I suppose all your friends think I'm crazy"" to which I replied ""Oh no, Miss Swanson, not at all, they ADMIRE you!"" and that was true.The setting for all this was in the house that Douglas Fairbanks Sr. built in 1919 (the date carved into the enormous fireplace) and the ceilings were so high and the room so vast the only curtains that could be used to cover the windows were theater curtains. There was also a passage from the basement/wine cellar that, when traveled through to the other end, came up at Pickfair, Mary Pickford's house, so they could visit each other secretly.This is a REAL Hollywood gem, a masterpiece, not one single flaw, and it is just as riveting every time you see it as it was the first time, it holds up beautifully through repeated viewings.""I AM big, it's the PICTURES that got small.""Indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISTYQAQ15221/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBB89C#wasThisHelpful","R3ISTYQAQ15221","A27NTH2Y9DAR31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27NTH2Y9DAR31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The killer's last words to his victims; a mother and her daughters. This book is so sad and so inexplicable as all stranger murders are; why kill people you never met don't know and have no interaction with? Murder is bad enough but at least with crimes of passion (so called) you can grasp the feelings and the motive while not approving of them, of course; but this. This is evil beyond evil, this rage and cruelty expended on totally innocent helpless victims.

"From when I was growing up in the 1950s I have adored mustard and tried new mustards whenever available to me. We moved to Europe for a few years and when there I found a fabulous mustard in a tube. Grey Poupon is almost identical to that one, if you're curious. Anyway, I also love Gulden's, French's, Grey Poupon, etc. and I assumed French's was the only yellow mustard around. Then I found Heinz. Oh My God, my search was over; this is THE best mustard EVER!

"This entire book is based on a lie; this woman is not now, nor ever has been, a ""warrior."" She went to Africa, and visited the Maasai for a few weeks, ate goat, drank blood, threw up then flew home to go back to her Prada shopping and her Beemer. This is all fake and she is using the noble Maasai to promote her self serving egocentric diary about her experiences with them. This is a travesty, a disgrace, and horrifying in very sense of the word. It is hideously insulting to a brave tribe of real warriors who were used as book fodder for this spoiled rich b*tch who has no regard for these people beyond using them for her own selfish greedy purpose.She PLAYED at being a ""warrior"" she never was, nor does she have any conception about what the word means. But hey, time to go shopping for more Prada! Wow.""But she never went without her Chanel Red Dragon lipstick to carry her through the hard times.""""As part of her training she was asked to suffocate a goat but she is unable to finish it off.""""Instead the men cut its jugular and hand her a cup of blood squeezed from its body - considered a delicacy by the Maasai.Mindy writes: `The blood was still warm as it slid down my throat. I furrowed my brow, curled my toes, clenched my butt, and continued to drink, while holding back the vomit.`It took every ounce of my being to hold back the bloody throw-up. It felt like drinking warm whole milk, which I've always refused to do not only because of the obscene amount of calories - but also because I have always had an aversion to thick liquid substances'.""She couldn't stop herself and fell to her knees, buried her face in the tall grass and vomited it back up again.""""She tells in the book how she found an inner courage she did not realize she possessed, which showed itself when they encountered an angry 600lbs buffalo in a field.""Mindy writes: `I screamed as the snorting, slobbering, raging buffalo charged in my direction. Then Lanet's (one of the Maasai) teaching replayed itself in my head: ""If the enemy is stronger than you, you must attack first"", and that is what I did.`Grunting and howling and with a quick request to the powers above, I released my spear. As it rocketed through the air the other Maasai released their spears but mind landed first, on the very edge of the buffalo's right butt cheek'.Her spear did little damage but her bravery won the respect of the other Maasai, who killed the buffalo.""Come ON! Are you KIDDING me???? Good GOD! How embarrassing is this????""After returning from her adventure Mindy enrolled at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Under the laws of the tribe, even though Mindy lives in the U.S. she is bound to return and fight for them if there is a war, sing and dance at all weddings and protect the community if there is an animal invasion.She has every intention of doing so.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21JJK2VDOI0XL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762786035#wasThisHelpful","R21JJK2VDOI0XL","A27NTH2Y9DAR31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27NTH2Y9DAR31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh how I LOVED this book; ex (but not really ex) Marines, art, diamonds and the Russian Mafia, how can you go wrong? Juggling all these stories and keeping the balls in the air has always been done successfully by Patterson, but in this book, his skills are just off the charts. The best and most complicated characters, all the story lines and how well they connect, the love and loyalties that support the good guys and the bad boys fatal choices hang them in the end just the way stories (and life) should be. Fantastic and totally believable villains and even more believable heroes make this book a real stunner. Set against a background of exotic locales throughout Europe, the chases to recover the stolen diamonds, the love of the hero and his lady friend are just perfect and perfectly satisfying. I won't admit to how many times I've read and re-read this book, but let's say it is a permanent fixture on my nightstand. I NEVER tire of reading it.

"I got this feeling of absolute evil while reading this book, yet I could not stop reading it. Like looking at a grisly accident and unable to avert your eyes. I remember the care of poor Mark Kilroy, a hapless medical student on Spring Break partying with friends in Matamoros Mexico. BAD idea. I remember seeing a photo of him SO handsome, poor poor guy!SPOILER!!!Then I remember seeing a photo of Sara Aldrete wearing a NECKLACE made from Kilroy's SPINAL CORD!!!! The story re: Constanzo, AKA El Padrino, the godfather, is chilling as we read about the making of a monster from childhood courtesy of his mother who makes Satan look almost normal. This woman is off the rails. Constanzo did have powers, no doubt about that. He was charismatic and very handsome and so disturbed and so dangerous. Many who crossed his oath met horrible deaths during witchcraft rituals incorporating Santeria practices. Constanzo wanted more power so he gave orders to he followers to bring hiom a young student, fresh, white and blond, which they did, abducting a terror stricken Kilroy off the streets. His death was so grisly you won't believe your eyes and the horrifying depths some people will sink to in order for them to get what they want.This the story of pure vicious evil, it upset me so much I ended up giving it to the library, I wanted it out of my house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CZPDVLHRU6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=052524946X#wasThisHelpful","R13CZPDVLHRU6Y","A27NTH2Y9DAR31","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27NTH2Y9DAR31?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an excellent introduction to the contributions African American Women made in the opening of the Old West. Wagner profiles 10 women of indomitable courage who went through whatever it required to get where they wanted to get.I am a bit disappointed there were no stories of African American women who helped settle the Inland Empire of Oregon, Washington, & Idaho – but that's probably due to the fact there were none. Those who came went on to Portland or Seattle.I think my favorite character, and she was, indeed, a character was Mary Fields, aka Stagecoach Mary, though it's difficult to pick a favorite.Ms. Wagner did her research, and told each story with care and attention to detail, without bogging the story down in nothing but facts. This book should be in every history class in every high school in the country. Not just in the class, but taught.I look forward to reading Wagner's book, It Happened on the Underground Railroad. If I have to find a negative remark about this book, it is only that it was too short. I would like to have read a great deal more about many of these women. Oh, wait, I can do that, can't I? ;-)If you're a history buff, as I am, I heartily recommend this book. Job well done, Ms. Wagner.

"If you are a fan of history, especially that of the opening of the Oregon Country to pioneers, I think these books (there are two Volumes) should be at the top of your ""must read"" list. Drury is the undisputed authority on the Whitmans and the early members of the Oregon Mission Board who came here (the Spaldings, Eells, Walkers). The Rangers at the Whitman Mission National Historic Site use Drury as their authority and bible. I now understand why.When I picked Volume I up, and began to read, my eyes began to quickly glaze over. It began as a very dense history book. However, by page 3 or so, I was hooked. Yes, it is dense, yes, it is packed with facts and tidbits and many items of interest, and yes I found myself resenting the times I had to put the books down. When I finished Volume I, I immediately picked up Volume II and began reading.Volume I contains more information about Narcissa, which is what I was after, but Volume II contains more information about the mission in general and Marcus. The primary focus of these two volumes is, of course, Narcissa and Marcus; however, due to the nature of history, many other people entered the narrative from the Rev. Henry H. Spalding, a rejected suitor of Narcissa, the Indians who invited the Missionaries to come and teach them, to the metis, Joe Lewis the primary instigator of the uprising in which the Whitmans and others were killed.The only complaint I have about the books, and believe me I had to dig to find one, is the quality of the maps and drawings. I know they were copies of the originals, which weren't all that great to begin with, but they were small. It would have been nice had they at least been full page instead of 80% or whatever. Keep a magnifier handy when reading.Drury was not only an Historian of merit, but also a minister, a terrific author, and he was able to bring the characters not just to life on the page, but to give us insights into their actions, and thinking.Highly recommend these two books!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTQS011C6LP2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005072GVY#wasThisHelpful","RTQS011C6LP2P","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I took a poetry workshop from Ms. Austen, our Washington State Poet Laureate. What a delightful two hours. After, I bought her book, curious to read her work, which was not used in the workshop.She mentioned some personal life stories during the workshop, and this book tells a little about them. Many people I know read a book of poetry willy-nilly, they enjoy picking up the book and opening it to a poem. I tend to start at the beginning and read to the end. The beginning tells us it is in memory of her brother, who died too young at 37 years of age. I read the first three poems and stopped. The third poem is ""What Is Known"" – for her brother, Michael – just blew my socks off. She has several poems in this book with the same title, and they are very, very powerful.This is not a book of lightness and humor; it is a book of delicately written pain, and sorrow. It explores life in all its meanings – and every reader will read their own poems, their own stories, into these words.While it is not a book of lightness and humor, it is yet filled with light, and touches of humor. These poems will go directly to your heart; they will allow your soul to soar. I read the complete book in a matter of 3 or 4 sittings. I have since gone back to several of the poems to read again, and sometimes yet again, to read, to absorb, to marvel at the beautiful writing, and then to lay aside only to pick it up again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2HM6KWP8WIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0911287647#wasThisHelpful","R2E2HM6KWP8WIW","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a package of these puppy pads in return for an honest review.I have a small dog, who seems to get lost in the grass, and much prefers puppy pads to going outside--especially in inclement weather. When I received these, and first started putting them down for her, I think the texture was just a bit different than the pads she was used to -- she would use these pads, but only at the edge. Fortunately, that was enough. After 3 or 4 days, she started using them in the center. When I put one of the other pads next to one of these, she didn't seem to care which she used.The pads and the plastic backing are both white; however, California Pet Supply was kind enough (smart enough?) to print a design on the back of the plastic so there is no confusion as to which side goes down and which side goes up ;-) (I've had that problem with all white pads!)These pads are a good product for either the puppy in your house, or the small, very spoiled dog who prefers them to cold, wet, and spikey grass!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HEHHQ79WBBDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX93S52#wasThisHelpful","R2HEHHQ79WBBDF","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read this book shortly after it came out in 1981, and I loved it. I've never forgotten it, have loaned my copy out, and replaced it, at least 4 times. I recently bought the New Edition, which contains additional information, and am so glad I did.In rereading the book, I realized I had remembered certain scenes accurately – and some that didn't exist at all ;-).Lalu Nathoy/Polly Bemis was a real woman who was sold by her father to bandits, smuggled into the US and, as the slave she was, found her way from San Francisco to Portland to Warrens, Idaho where her owner used her in his saloon as a 'bar girl' and where she became known as Polly.Little is known of her life in China, and McCunn does a marvelous job of conveying the 'what might have happened.' Girls had little to no value in China, except to marry into a higher level of society if at all possible, thereby bringing some monetary relief to her family. To this end, many first born girls of even peasant families, had their feet bound. Lalu's feet were bound, and then unbound when she was needed to work in the fields to help her father. Although her feet never returned to 'normal' she was able to walk long distances and do field work on them.Bandits came to her village, and she was stolen. The leader gave her father two bags of seed, thereby changing it from a theft to a sale. Lalu began her journey to probably Shanghai where she was smuggled aboard a ship bound to San Francisco. From there, she went north until eventually reaching Warrens, Idaho, as the slave of Hong King. There is a myth about gaining her freedom, the truth as we know it is that no one knows how she ended up free. We do know she married her benefactor, Charlie Bemis, and lived many years in the Salmon River area.I think McCunn did a tremendous job showing the cultures of China and pioneer Idaho in this book. Yes, there were areas I would have liked to see expanded, and undoubtedly as you read it, there will be areas you wish were in more depth, but over all, this is a fascinating, and accessible story. I highly recommend it for anyone with an interest in our history, or the history of the Chinese in our country.

"I think the title is somewhat misleading, it wasn't just good old Genghis who changed the world, but his sons and grandsons. And change it they did, without a doubt. Did they change it as much as stated in this book? I don't know. I also don't know enough to put forth an intelligent argument for or against.What I do think is this should have been written as two books, Volume I on Genghis (who dies fairly early in this book) and Volume II on the rest of the crowd. I have read a few books on Genghis, and while this book does bring to light some heretofore-unknown tidbits, it doesn't tell nearly as much as I'd hoped, especially from Weatherford. I've also read a couple of books about Kublai, and again, this book seemed to gloss over some fascinating areas. Two books, each in the 400-500 page range would have been a treat most rare.I won't get into the ""who invented noodles first"" – Mongols or Europeans argument? From what I've read just about all agricultural communities that grew wheat or a similar grain, came up with a form of noodles. And also, from what I've read, the Mongols had a real antipathy toward blood and raw meat, and I can't help but wonder about them placing meat between them and their horses to tenderize it. Between the horse and the saddle would seem to be a. unbalancing, and b. too iffy to rub sores on the horse. I believe they did put milk in bags tied to their saddles to beat it into butter or yogurt, or at least fermenting it. I can picture them doing the same with the meat to tenderize it, but cooking it later.I absolutely loved the parts where Weatherford talked about having been there, seeing the places, being with the locals who explained various things to him, such as why horses would go in this direction, how to tell if the ice is thick enough to ride across, etc. I also appreciated the maps. Really appreciated the maps!All in all, if you're interested in Genghis Khan, read this book. But don't stop when you put the book down. Try some of John Man's books; he, too, has been there. This book is easily read, it is not a textbook, it is very accessible to the average person, and the history buff will, I'm sure, enjoy it. I did. There are several excellent books out there about Genghis, and this is a good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M1YF4I5VX7WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0609809644#wasThisHelpful","R1M1YF4I5VX7WE","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a discount on this product in return for my honest review.The most difficult thing about this opener was getting it out of the foam packaging! I was skeptical, as I have small hands, that are somewhat arthritic, but using this opener was a breeze! The directions are printed on the box, they are clear, concise, and easy to follow. The foil cutter works with minimal pressure. Even removing the cork from the appliance is a snap!I have more corkscrews around my kitchen than I care to admit. This is the one I will keep, and use.

"A firm believer in the adage that if it seems to good to be true, it usually is, I carefully paid attention to the packaging of my NuWave when it arrived so I could put it back in the box to return it. The oven sits on my counter, the box is in the recycle bin. I have cooked a whole chicken (juicy, delicious) thick pork chops (same), steak, and chicken pieces. Today I'm going to try an apple crisp. And some spuds. I have no doubt they will turn out excellent. I have noticed I need to cut the time down a wee bit, but with any oven, one must use it to discover it's idiosyncrasies, some cook hot, some cook cool.I bought this oven because my house is for sale, and I want to keep the stove spotless, and because I wanted to get away from fried foods (the easiest) and because bending over to get things into/out of the oven is not convenient. Other than boiling noodles I can't think of a thing my stove does this little counter top oven doesn't do better, faster, and probably cheaper.

"The Mountain Men were my childhood heroes. While other girls dreamed of princes and castles and unicorns or horses, I dreamed of living in the forest, trapping beaver, evading unfriendly Indians (though I was sure I'd be welcome by all). While my friends took riding lessons, I roamed the woods. I dreamed of being John Colter, Hugh Glass, or Sacagawea (at that time, I had no idea Marie Dorion even existed).Now that I've reached an age where wandering the woods, and living in childhood dreams, are not practical, I do my dreaming in history books. Because I grew up in Portland, Oregon, and spent a great deal of time in the Oregon Historical Society Museum, it is only natural that I have an affinity toward books about the opening of The Oregon Country.The Perilous West: Seven Amazing Explorers and the Founding of the Oregon Trail by Larry E. Morris tells the stories of Ramsay Crooks, Robert McClellan, John Hoback, Jacob Reszner, Edward Robinson, Pierre Dorion, and Marie Dorion. Although the book focuses on these seven people, it is also about the journey of the Wilson Price Hunt expedition or as they were known, the Astorians as they traveled from St. Louis, Missouri to Astoria, Oregon.The narrative does not stop with the arrival at Astoria, but continues on until the stories of the seven are told, with many other stories woven into the fabric of their lives to bring life and color to those seven. Those people were a hardy lot. And their stories are of courage beyond imagining.While this book was, I am fairly certain, written for the academic, it is also easily accessible to the casual reader, or history buff. It offers an excellent opportunity to read about the opening of the West after the time of Lewis and Clark, the perils these people faced, and overcame. Usually overcame.I would have liked to have maps scattered throughout the book. I am fairly conversant in the geography of the areas he wrote about, but maps would have been helpful. Just simple line drawings. And I would have loved to have found footnotes instead of endnotes. Put the bibliography in endnotes, but the interesting facts in footnotes.I have not read any of his other books. Fortunately, that situation is easily corrected. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the Oregon Country. If his other books are as well researched as this one, and as well written, and I see no reason to think otherwise, they will be well worth my time and money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCX16YY7Q7SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144221113X#wasThisHelpful","R3DCX16YY7Q7SV","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was furnished a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I read fiction for one reason – to escape my own reality, and this book certainly took me out of my reality into one of space travel, multiverses, and obsession. It is a different take on the boy meets girl, boy falls in love, girl leaves type of story.Jack survives the upheavals, works for a new lord, sees the lord's daughter, Rachel, and falls in love. He quite literally stalks her. She notices, and one night seduces him. His fantasies and dreams take flight—he's in love, and he's sure she's in love with him. Puppy love at its best. They will marry, have a family, he will inherit from her father, and all is well in his world until the next day when he's fired for no apparent reason and not allowed on the property again.The book opens on a space ship, just before landing on a new planet to be colonized, and one is led to believe this will be a rollicking space opera. Soon, we realize our hero is not. After a year or so on this bleak planet, and dreams he can't quite understand, Jack and a few others return to Earth. Jack goes to the place where all his memories are stored, retrieves them, and goes to his palatial home, modeled after Hatshepsut's mausoleum. He discovers he is wealthy beyond measure (no more young serf is he), and that he longs to find his one, only, true love—Rachel.With help from his multi friend (an alien from the multiverse), Jack learns to travel both mentally, and physically, looking for his true love, for surely, there is another Rachel, somewhere, that he can love and be loved by, if only he can find her. Nothing will get in the way of his obsession or its hoped-for conclusion. Not when he meets Rachel as she is, and she has no memory of him, none at all and he doesn't like the woman she became; not when he goes back in time and discovers the reason of his firing; nothing, not even death will stop his search.This book is well-written, and an excellent, well-crafted story. For me, it became a tad tedious during the second half, hence 4 stars not 5. I wanted Jack to grow up (after all, he was 700 years old by then), put his big boy boxers on and get a life. But that would have been my story, not Jack's. And Jack suffers the worst of all possible ailments. He is obsessed, obsessed by a love that never existed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R302M591ZMKCID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=9187585359#wasThisHelpful","R302M591ZMKCID","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a gift, by a person who knew I loved poetry, but had no idea about my passion for poetry in two languages! I keep hoping someday I will learn a second language, and how better than by reading poetry? How better than by reading Hablando A La Vez??I don't know which is my favorite poem, but I keep going back to A Poem for Lorca. All of these poems speak to me, some just a little more insistently than others.There are poems about the town of Caguas, where the author was raised, Sundays with her father at the racetrack, and poems trying to explain the word 'heritage' to her daughter.There is love in these poems, there is loss, there is grief, and there are smiles. Some of the poems reminded me of one of my favorite writers, John Phillip Santos. The whole book is honest and strong. This is a book I will keep on my poetry shelf, and read often. Then, again, I may keep it by my bed where I can reach it on those nights I can't sleep and wish to talk with a friend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EBI4FJ9XUICO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098959243X#wasThisHelpful","R3EBI4FJ9XUICO","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm really giving these marvelous bottles a 4.5 rating. The -.5 is because there is no string attached to the lid and loop so the top doesn't get dropped or lost. Otherwise, they are wonderful. The sleeve helps keep the water cool, as well as makes holding the bottle a little safer so it won't slip out of one's hands. I love how the water tastes out of these bottles -- like water ;-) They fit in the cup holder of my car very nicely, and a long straw makes them perfect to drink from while driving. They feel well-made, come by twos, each with a different color sleeve, so you can tell them apart.

"Eliza Spalding Warren was a young girl of ten years, newly arrived at the Whitman mission from her home in Lapwai where her parents were missionaries to the Nez Perce, and where she grew up playing with children of The People, and loved and was loved in return, by The People. Shortly after her arrival at the Whitman's mission, a few of the Cayuse, cousins of the Nez Perce, attacked and killed several people, including the Whitmans. Young Eliza was the only one who spoke fluent Sahaptin and was called upon by both the Cayuse and the whites to act as interpreter. The nightmare of those days as a captive, of not knowing if she would live, if her parents lived, if her siblings lived, of being treated roughly by people she didn't know but had been raised to respect and even to love, affected her for the rest of her life.Ms. Kirkpatrick, a lover of history of the Oregon Country and it's people, took the facts as she found them, filled in the gaps as she could, and wove a delightful story of a young girl who suffers from what today we'd call PTSD, as this child matures, marries against her father's will, questions herself, and eventually questions her memories of that fateful time and place known as Waiilatpu. As young Eliza says in one place, ""I had returned to a time, a reunion, that didn't happen where I'd thought. I was discovering that the past I remembered wasn't always the past that was.""Because Eliza's parents were missionaries (Henry Harmon and Eliza Hart Spalding) there is much mention of faith in this book. It is necessary to the story, and beautifully done. Faith was important to those people who made the perilous journey across the mountains and deserts to a vast, unknown, and often unwelcoming, country called Oregon. Young Eliza is credited with being the first white child born and raised in the Oregon Country. Alice Clarissa was born first, but did not live. (Marie and Pierre Dorion's child, considered white at the time, was born even earlier, but again, did not live.)This is an excellent book by an excellent author who knows how to weave a story into a gorgeous tapestry. I highly recommend this to any lover of history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XTRLIKDQ3VX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800722329#wasThisHelpful","R3XTRLIKDQ3VX","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read fantasy for escape, and once again, Ms. Marley has given me a great escape. I enjoyed reading about the Magdalenes, and like another reviewer, wondered why they clung to the celibacy idea; however, if they were trying to be accepted, it's understandable. It was hard enough just getting female priests accepted. One step at a time.The protagonist is Mother Isabel Burke, a priest with faults. Serious faults with which she must cope. She is, alas, very, very human. And that humanness comes out when she is assigned as guardian to child from another planet. It comes out when she again meets the man she loves. It comes out as she deals with people. Mostly, Mother Burke is filled with love.To help protect her young charge, she returns with Oa to her home planet, from which she was kidnapped, to unravel the secret of the anchen and to help them become persons if they so desire.Although the protagonist is a Priest, this is not a religious book. It is a great adventure in which the religion of the protagonist plays a role, and helps solve the riddle.Like another reviewer, I hope we see more books about Mother Burke, and Jin-Li Chung (nice to meet an old from again from Irustan).A fun read.

"I knew the Europeans changed the land when they arrived, and not always for the good, but this is the first time I've read such a detailed book as to how and why they made the changes. And how those changed affected the land, the flora, the fauna, and those people living on it.Yes, I suppose it might be a little dry here and there for those who are more interested in fantasy than history. I read it because I found the book in a box of books, and it looked interesting. I was not disappointed. This is a book that will go back on the shelf, and be pulled out often as reference, or just to reread again.Truly, I'd like to find a book like this about how the Europeans changed the Pacific Northwest and Inland Empire.

"I finished reading Wakeworld  and immediately picked up The Nothing. Almost a 1-sit read. I think it was a 2 –sit read due to work calling ;-)The Nothing closes the trilogy begun with Between, and though this story is now satisfactorily and happily ended, the ending leaves it open for another adventure as soon as the heroine and her companions are rested enough to take it on.Vivian and Zee must overcome some serious problems, both for the Dreamworlds, which are dying, and themselves. If the Dreamworlds die, people will be unable to dream, and they will die. Vivian must reconcile her three personas—Dreamshifter, Dragon, and Sorceress in order to save the day. But, if she shifts to Dragon one more time, she will die, thanks to a wound by dragonstone when Zee threw the knife at her.People live in Dreamworld, and people die in Dreamworld, and people make sacrifices in Dreamworld for those they love just as they do in our world, Wakeworld. Having said that, I will say the ending is more than satisfactory.Seldom do I read a series that MUST be read in order, but this is one of them. While you may be able to read them out of sync, it will be ever so much easier if you start at the beginning of the story and read through to the end. Not only will the worlds make better sense, so will the characters. We have the marvelous opportunity to see them change, grow, learn, and in many cases become people I wish were real and I could meet. A well-written and skillfully produced series of books. My world is better for having read them.And, yes, Poe is in this book, too. He's so marvelous. He's one of the characters I'd love to know. If Vivian ever needs a penguin sitter, I'm her gal.

I was not disappointed.I had forgotten Poe, the penguin, and was delighted to find he plays a major supporting role in Wakeworld. New characters are introduced in this book, Weston and his sister, Grace, both of whom play pivotal roles. Weston is a Dreamshifter who has fought it all his life, to great pain and loss.Weston and Vivian so not start off as best buds, but they realize they must work together to save Dreamworld, and with time, they become good friends. And when Zee nearly kills Vivian, well, he and Weston have, shall we say, words?I absolutely love the worlds Ms. Shafer has built. I would read the books just for the worlds, however, she's peopled them with such fun characters, I get to enjoy the worlds and their populations.If you're a lover of fantasy, and new and exciting worlds, you'll enjoy this series.

"I received an ARC of this novel in exchange for my honest review.I have read several of Ms. McLean's books, all of which are fantasy and romance. I do not read romance, and yet, I jumped at the opportunity to read Hearts Akilter. She does not write the usual romance (think Harlequin), hers are fun, light hearted, and just a little, well, off kilter.This story takes place on Kifel Space Station, and the main characters are Henry, a medical robot having a heart attack (I know, robots don't have hearts, but still…), Marlee, his human friend and confidante who is a maintenance tech, and Deacon Black an expert bomb builder and defuser.Henry can do things he shouldn't be able to do, like remove his chest plates. He does this so Marlee can see what's wrong since he doesn't have a heart, or nerves, so why is he sure he's having a heart attack? As Spock would say, ""it isn't logical."" Imagine her surprise when she discovers he's not having a heart attack but a bomb has been placed in him, where his heart would be if he had one, and one of the wires isn't properly connected, and it's shorting out now and then. She knows nothing about bombs, but puts in a temporary fix while trying to figure out who put the bomb there, and why, and how to get rid of it before Henry explodes.Enter Deacon Black, on Kifel to teach a class to the bomb squad—and avoid an assassin. Marlee hijacks him to help with Henry, and they neutralize the bomb, and tell Henry to go about his business until they can figure out who put it there—and why. Both suspects are high ranking individuals with impeccable records.Is it possible to have a romance with a man, a woman, and a robot? Well, yes. Yes it is, and Ms. McLean carries it off beautifully, with the right amount of suspense, and a lot of humor.

"I bought, and read, Jaguar many years ago, probably around 1990 when it first came out. I loved it, lost it, but never forgot it. So, I recently bought another copy, and read it again for the first time.While I did not forget the book, or the basic premise, I did forget a lot of the story, and enjoyed reading it again. Mr. Ransom is also a poet of some renown, and the poetry he so loves, come through in his prose. There were times when I stopped, and savored a sentence just for the feel of it in my mouth as I read it aloud.Great literature? Probably not, but a heckuva good read! Mr. Ransom is a great teller of stories.There are four main characters with a couple of pretty important supporting characters. The four main ones are children who have been abused in one form or another during their lives, a boy and girl on this side of the veil, and a boy and girl on the other.They meet through dreams, become friends, and together, fight the Jaguar, who would destroy them all. The fight is, literally, a fight to the death—and a fight to save their worlds and their sanity.The topics of dreaming, of abuse, of parallel worlds are come to play.I enjoyed this book the first time I read it and if possible, I enjoyed it even more this second time through.

"The more I know of Ms. Briggs werewolves, the more convinced I am I rather like them. Well, most of them.Ms. Briggs does a marvelous job of world building in her books, her characters are believable, and how the humans react to the were, the fae, etc. is also believable.This exciting book takes place in Boston, and Anna, the Omega mate to Charles, the Alpha and son/enforcer of the Marrock is coming into her own. She trusts Charles, and she learns to use her Omega and pack magic. Anna, like a 'real' person, may never totally trust after all the abuse she's been through, but she works at it, and receives a great deal of support from Charles, and even her father in law, Bran, the Marrock.There are some cross-over comments and plot lines between this book and River Marked ( a Mercy Thompson book) that might be a bit of a spoiler. I'm not sure, as I read River Marked before I read this one, and enjoyed the references.This time Charles and Anna are helping the FBI find a serial killer, who turns out to be much older than originally thought.

"This is the second in the series. The Alpha and Omega series is about werewolves, but is not part of the Mercy Thompson books, though some of the characters cross over from one series to the other.The primary characters in this series are Charles Cornick, Alpha, the son and enforcer of the chief American werewolves and his new mate, Anna Latham, Omega. Turned werewolf against her will, never taught what to expect, and abused by her pack, she remains somewhat suspicious of Charles.This book takes place in Seattle, when the head werewolves from the world are gathered at a conclave to discuss their 'coming out.' Murder and mayhem happens, as only Ms. Briggs and her various packs of werewolves, can make it happen.A fun read. Especially if you like Seattle and werewolves. I happen to like both. A knowledge of Seattle is not necessary to enjoy the book, any more than being on first name basis with a werewolf is necessary (but it helps).Grab a glass of your favorite libation, find a comfy hammock, and settle back to enjoy a great story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U2XMY5SFPMC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044101738X#wasThisHelpful","R3U2XMY5SFPMC7","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free holder in exchange for an honest review. I feel badly that it's taken me so long to get the review posted, however, that is probably a good thing. Longer test time.My dash is textured, and an earlier (non-Getron) holder didn't hold. While I found this one a tad difficult (arthritic hands) to get mine where I wanted it, it's there, and it works marvelously!Although I'm not in the great southwest desert, I am in the Washington State desert, and my car is parked outside, often in the sun. My Getron holder is as stuck today as when I put it in my car!I have a Samsung S5, and am very happy with this holder.

"Oh my goodness gracious! While Murder of Crows was a slightly slower read, which for me at the time was perfect, Vision in Silver jerked me back onto the roller coaster from which I could not get off!Foolish lady that I am, thinking it would be more like Murder of Crows, I started it at night, and read until I couldn't read any more. Then had a hard time going to sleep because I really, really wanted to know what came next! After I finished doing what had to be done the next day, I found out what came next! Unfortunately, too soon, it was The End.I don't want to tell too much of what happens, because I don't want to spoil anything for you, but Simon blows a gasket, the Cassandra sangue are freed, but to what? They have been bred and trained to do one thing and one thing only. They are ill equipped to handle freedom and the information overload that comes with it. The Humans First, Last, and Always people want them returned to benevolent ownership. The Others want them to learn to be free.The vampires have a larger role in this book, and humans are making inroads into The Courtyard, which has the Others somewhat confused as humans are 'clever meat' and prey, except when they're not and are friends and allies and to be protected.Once again, the humans prove they have short memories—and large egos. They wish to make demands of their landlords, the Others, who own the land on which they live, the raw materials used in manufacturing, and, quite literally, the air they breathe. In fact, those short sighted, ego maniacs, wish to exterminate the Others. Not a war I'd choose to fight!The Others are shifters, but unlike most stories they do not go from human to Other, they go from Other to human, and mostly they don't like it. They only do it in order to communicate and work with humans, and to maintain control. While in human form they still think like their primary self, whether Crow or Wolf or Vampire. But, with the help of the human pack that has formed in the Courtyard, they are beginning to learn how humans think, and all the strange terms we use, such as that kids are small humans (not prey) and not small goats (prey). While there is tension galore in this book, there is also humor.The book has a satisfactory ending even if it came too soon; however, there are a couple of 'loose' ends that I hope will be resolved in book four. The only problem with this book is, I've read it, and now I shall have to wait forever (it will seem like it) for the next in the series.Note to Ms. Bishop: Please add one more page at the very beginning, giving us the correct spelling of the various forms of the Others.

"Having read the second in The Others series, I stand by my first impression that this is one of the finest worlds ever crafted. And some of the most interesting characters.This book takes up at the end of Written in Red. We already know everyone (there is a 'short history' at the beginning in case you haven't read Written in Red). I believe this could be a stand alone book, and any reader familiar with the genre should be able to read this one, and then pick up Written In Red and make the time shift with little to know problem. Though they read better if read in order.Someone is after the Crows, and when humans start a war on the Others, there can only be one outcome. A new group has formed, the Humans, First, Last, and Always. It does not bode well for anyone. Unless Meg and the Others at Lakeside Courtyard can gather enough information to stop it before it goes any farther.Perhaps because I knew the world, and the characters, I found I could, indeed, put this book down, and read just a few chapters at a time. Frankly, I was grateful for that, as I had too much to do to devote an entire day to reading it ;-)However, that's not to say I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the first, and I truly look forward to picking up the next in the series and reading it. I rather enjoy reading a book where I already know the main characters. I can spend more time on the story, and less on getting to know my new neighbors.We do meet some new people, the Intuit. They are not prophets like the Cassandra sangue, but they get feelings about things, and have learned to interpret those. They live in small communities and are closer to the Others than they are to other humans.How human is Simon becoming? Will he become too human?While this book may be a bit slower in the reading, it is a very enjoyable read, and I have a feeling it's a great set-up for the next book. Fortunately, both the first and second books have both beginnings and endings, which is one reason I think they can be read out of order.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IVL7WYPU7OL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMCJRD4#wasThisHelpful","R36IVL7WYPU7OL","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most original stories I've read in a long time. Ms. Stiefvater has developed a world that is both fascinating, and somewhat terrifying. The isle of Thisby, surrounded by a dark and violent sea, is where the water horses, the capaill uisce, come to land. They are beautiful, strong, fast, and fierce. If captured, they can be trained to race in the big race on 1 November—a day someone will die. What they want, more than anything, is the sea—and to kill and eat their rider.This story is told through two points of view—that of Puck, the first girl to enter the race and on an island pony instead of a capall uisce, and the young man, Sean and his beloved water horse, Corr. (note: capaill uisce is the plural)Puck, along with her two brothers, are orphans, and she enters the race as the only means of getting enough money at one time, to pay off the only home she has ever known, or face eviction. She is not wanted on the beach of sand where the race will be held. The race is dangerous, and it is a man's game, and no upstart girl is going to buck tradition.Sean is the odds on favorite to win the race. Riding Corr, the water horse of his employer for the last four years, he has won. He wants to buy Corr, but his owner refuses. He wants to win the race and enough money to make the purchase, against all odds. He has warned Puck to keep herself and her 'pony' off the beach.None of the capaill uisce turn into nice, loving horses, or charming dark-eyed men. They want meat and blood, and humans qualify. They want the sea, and any rider who thwarts their return, faces death. Puck faces not only her death, but also the prospect that her beloved Dove will also die. But home is worth dying for.Thisby is a world rich in atmosphere and characters. The people live on a hard land, and are somewhat taciturn. The reader will get to know them not so much through their words, but the eyes of those who see them. Salt spray covers everything, the clouds hang low in the sky, blood soaks the sands, and never, ever, run from a capall uisce, for they are predators at the top of the food chain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEB2WPGXW3J4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545224918#wasThisHelpful","R2BEB2WPGXW3J4","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a marvelous memoir of not just a woman in the military, but the first woman to command an Officer's Club in Thailand, during the Vietnam war. There are many photos, to help bring you, and that portion of history, ever closer.If you were there, this book will bring back lots of memories and probably more humorous ones than not, though there will be a few sobering moments, I'm sure.If you weren't there, it's a must read. Not only a fair description of what it was like through the eyes of a woman, but a good perspective on what war really is—and isn't.Fighter pilots are a breed apart, and she has done a marvelous job of describing them—from their egos to their complex natures. She wrote a book about real people, in a real war, and always remembered that discretion is often the better part of valor.Well done, Ma'am, well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LXY1UIDUVLI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008LO9C2O#wasThisHelpful","R1LXY1UIDUVLI7","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Myri's mother died when Myri was three, her father, a trucker, died a year before the story takes place. He left her the home, the land, and an old pickup truck he told her was worth its weight in gold. He left her no money, and she worked two jobs just to make ends meet.But, Myri is different. Her hands often burn for no reason, and whatever she reaches for flies to them. She sees Ruby, a spirit who shows up when people die, to help them make the transition from life to death. She sees the life force of people, and she sees it go from colorful to black when they die.She wants to go to culinary school but due to weather and other happenings arrives too late to be allowed to take the test. She really needs to find a way to support herself besides working in the hardware store part time, or at the winery part time. At the winery, she finds herself helping in a very odd and strange wedding, and then is given a week-end at the ocean, where even more strangeness happens.Myri, like her writer, lives in Kennewick, Washington. The places Ms. Roop writes about are real, whether in Kennewick, Walla Walla, or the ocean.Myri's Hands is a great read. My biggest complaint is it's too short. I want more of Myri, her hands, her life. I think this is a delightful book, and the first, I hope, of a series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A20PHYYK4MPY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJD2XQ2#wasThisHelpful","R3A20PHYYK4MPY","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh, how I wish I'd had this book when I was in elementary school! What a great read for anyone young, or just young at heart! I had a hard time putting it down.Thirteenth Child is the first of a trilogy, Frontier Magic, and takes place in an alternate United States during frontier times. Magic is common, and at times wild and free.Eff (her name is Francine, but she prefers Eff) was the first born of a set of twins, the second born, her brother Lan, was the seventh son of a seventh son. As a double 7 his magic would be great. Eff, however, was the thirteenth child. As great as Lan was predicted to be, her aunts and uncles, predicted Eff would be as evil. Lan grew to be filled with confidence and Eff grew so little self-esteem it barely existed.Fortunately, her parents weren't buying that nonsense, and moved the family to the edge of the frontier. Across the river was wild land, filled with steam dragons (well, a few), mammoths, and all sorts of magical and mundane creatures. Only a Great Spell, mid-river, kept the folk on the eastern shores safe. When people took land grants and ventured into the frontier, they almost always took a couple of magicians with them in order to keep them warded and safe.All went well, until it didn't. While the family was 'back home' to attend the wedding of one of Eff's older sisters, another sister left at home to come with Father at the last minute  eloped with a Rationalist Rationalists do not believe in magic and will not allow it in their homestead. It was difficult, but they eventually got their land grant and set up a town on the frontier with no magic. The aunts and uncles blamed Eff for the elopement. The aunts and uncles blamed Eff when the other marriage for which they were gathered went off as planned instead of being postponed. Eff was the thirteenth child, and the scapegoat.Eff's magic keeps materializing at the wrong times, and she fears she'll cause the doom and gloom her aunts and uncles predict. She tries to hide her status, and her magic from her friends on the frontier.A plague of beetles and grubs attacked the frontier towns and farms, destroying all the crops, in every town except where the Rationalists live. The whole frontier is thrown into chaos, not just Eff's family. Can Eff survive being the thirteenth child? Can the plague be stopped? Can Eff learn to use her magic in time? Can you resist reading this marvelous book?","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8ITF608TUGV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545033454#wasThisHelpful","RG8ITF608TUGV","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He's a Private Eye with an edge, except that technology doesn't do well around Harry. Something about his electric personality that shorts too many circuits.Harry is fighting for his life, searching for a missing person, helping the cops solve a gruesome murder, is living under the threat of death by the Sword of Doom if he practices magic against the rules, and someone, an unknown wizard who is very powerful, wants him dead. A wizard's life is never dull. Oh, and did I mention he's broke.

"This is one of, if not the, absolutely best worlds ever crafted! I made the mistake of starting this book at night, planning on reading a couple of chapters before turning the light out. I turned the light out when my eyes burned so much they could no longer focus. The next day, I promised myself I would get my work done before picking up the book. Yeah. Right. Something about promises…. I literally read all day, taking time out for sustenance and, uh, personal stuff. I read until my eyes burned and I could no longer focus, and there were about 50 pages to go. I got up the next morning, knowing I had appointments I had to keep — but finished the book before I left the house. Yes. It's that compelling. If you have a spouse and or children who demand you pay attention to them, I suggest you take this book, and go away to a nice hotel for a couple of days and read without interruption! Leave bread, milk, and peanut butter when they can find them. They'll be fine ;-)The Others are shape shifters that go from Other to human, not vice versa. They are the terra indigene, and control the planet. They consider humans as prey, or meat. As long as the humans abide by the rules, they are fine. The humans keep forgetting their place in the society.Meg is a Cassandra sangue Blood Prophet who has escaped her owner. She finds herself at a conclave of Others, starving, scared, nearly frozen, and applies for a job. Simon is not only Other, he is the head of the conclave (which includes lots of fun characters) and is a wolf. There is something about Meg that intrigues him, not the least of which is she doesn't smell like prey. She applies for a job, and is hired. Her owner/controller can't get to her on the reservation where the Others live, there are signs that say Human Law Does Not Apply. She is safe.

"It's been several years since I read Blood of the Lamb, and didn't realize there was a sequel to it until recently. I think The Reckoning can be read as a stand alone, but it will probably make more sense if you read Blood of the Lamb first.Peter Carenza is a young priest, who through a series of events and ""miracles"" becomes Pope at an early age when the Pope suddenly dies in Peter's arms. Peter can do good, but also has the power to do evil, which he has done.What I don't remember reading in this book, is the story of how Peter came to be. A small cadre of Cardinals extracted DNA from the Shroud of Turin, found a young, innocent, and virginal nun and convinced her she must carry the baby, which was then given to an orphanage. The Cardinals followed Peter as he grew, influencing him to become a priest, who on his 33d birthday began to perform miracles.When Peter becomes Pope, he immediately begins a process to bring the Church into the current times. He decides to reinstate the marriage of priests, and plans to set the example by marrying the love of his life—who does not necessarily love him back.The Cardinals who created him wanted to help God with the long-awaited Second Coming. Did they succeed?  This book is more complex than I remember the first one, and the characters are more developed. Many interesting people are introduced who propel the story along until we reach the satisfactory end of the book. It's also an interesting insight into how the Church may or may not actually be run.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PXX50BA7ZR3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GC3YQD6#wasThisHelpful","R1PXX50BA7ZR3L","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book a couple of times, in its rougher iterations, and am very impressed with the changes Ms. Pevato made. She listened to the suggestions her readers made, took the ones that were helpful, and discarded the ones that weren't, and ended up with a  well crafted book.The story flowed from the snowy beginning through to the end. It was logical, as logical as teen witches and generations old witch hunters can be, and the ending left me wanting more. Fortunately, she has two more novels planned, and with any kind of luck will get Book Two finished, polished, and published before I forget Book One ;-) .Pay attention to the chapter headings, as the POV shifts between the protagonist and the antagonist. Although it's usually easy to spot within the first paragraph, it's nice to have that heads up.The characters are well developed, and the world in which they live, play, and work is equally well developed and believable. The imagery is beautiful, and I found myself wanting a blanket as I read. (It takes place in an alpine village in the winter, and I was cold.) I truly cared about some of the characters, and others, well—I wasn't supposed to like them.One of the joys of Young Adult/Teen fiction is there is no gratuitous sex or violence, and for that reason, many adults take great delight in reading books written for younger folk. I truly hope adults wanting a good story will pick this book up and read it. And for the teens out there looking for a good paranormal not filled with horny werewolves and vampires, this is the one for you!A unique story, and a fun read. Thank you, P. M.

"I was furnished a copy of this book for an honest review.Mysteries are not my genre of choice, and when I was asked to read Cold, Hard, News I agreed, without much enthusiasm. I ended up reading it in a day!The first thing I like about this book is the locale — Maine. A part of the country I've never visited. The second thing I like about this book is the protagonist, Bernie, a 40-something single woman who recently bought the little weekly newspaper where she was hired as a reporter when she first graduated from college. She had been gone a long time, and now that she's back to this little town, she's learning how difficult it can be to be from 'away' and come to live in a small cliquish town. She is not only the owner, but also the main reporter, and she has to be careful of what she prints as news — or earn the enmity of the locals, and lose their support. And Bernie has ADHD.Pete, the new Chief of Police, is also from away. He was a homicide cop in Philadelphia and came to Redimere as the new chief. An outsider, he isn't exactly trusted, and has earned the enmity of at least one of his cops who thought the job should have gone to him.The book starts off with the discovery of a body. Stanley has spent the winter buried in a snowdrift while the town thought he was at a cousin's in North Carolina. The ME rules the death as 'undetermined.' The townsfolk classify it as accidental, but little things keep niggling at the back of Bernie's skull.In the last two years, there have been deaths that have all been called accidents, but they, in true mystery form, are somehow connected. I had a couple figured out, but I had a couple figured out wrong, too.I really enjoyed reading a story with a strong woman protagonist, and one who, though she has a medical/psychological condition, chose not to use it as an excuse, but to live and work with it. It was interesting to see how she did it, and the book gave me a much better understanding of ADHD, what it is, how it affects people, and why my nephew is the way he is.This is a stand-alone book, but I hope it's the first of many Bernie and Pete stories!Buy this book.

"Let's get the legalities over with right up front—I was furnished a copy of this book for an honest review.I love short stories, especially SF/F and when asked to read and review this collection, I jumped at the offer. The anthology contains 26 short stories, of which I enjoyed all but two — which is really pretty good. And, no, I'm not going to tell you which two I didn't care for, because they might turn out to be your favorites.Totally unfamiliar with the authors, I wasn't sure what to expect, but thought the adventure would be fun. It was. By the time I was half-way through the second story, The Rats, I was hooked. If they could keep the momentum up, it would be a 5 Star book. They could, and they did. And I was already telling friends to buy the book.A few of the stories were predictable, all of the stories were well written, and worth the read. Some stories had a poignancy to them, some made me chuckle out loud. I absolutely love Keep Fighting Until the Machines Fall Asleep, and The Rats.If you like Science Fiction, and want to read some of the 'new, up and coming authors' out of Sweden, I think you will enjoy this collection. As has been said, Science Fiction and Fantasy play well together. Often, they allow Horror to come in and play, too, but not for long, just enough to add some peppery influence to the spicy mixture.The only things these stories have in common is they are all well written and they reside between the covers of the same book. This is not a themed book, so I can guarantee you won't get bored. Also, there are no dragons, no were wolves, and no vampires. There are just 26 well-written stories, some of which take place on other planets, some in other times, and all in your imagination.I won't compare these authors to American authors, because, frankly, there is no comparison. Different styles, different cultures, and very different stories. I don't think any of the stories will give you nightmares should you read in bed before turning out the light, but they may give you food for thought as you cross that precipice into the little death.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW15TJCQS9P79/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VZY8PHK#wasThisHelpful","RW15TJCQS9P79","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting book about dinosaurs. Ms. Rose begins with some interesting facts about fossils, anatomy, diet, etc. Then she goes into each dinosaur, alphabetically. You need only click on the dinosaur in the Table of Contents to go straight to the page.She explains how it was named, where it came from, and what it was. Each entry begins with a color picture that, if double clicked, is enlarged. The art is fantastic.The entries are short, and informative; however, the switches from past tense to present tense are a little confusing. Explaining where and when they lived is good; telling us they live and eat and breathe here or there as if in the present day, might confuse some children.Recommended with tense reservations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R158Y5B56EWSHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV7ATN6#wasThisHelpful","R158Y5B56EWSHZ","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book on rabbits is no exception. She explains the difference between rabbits and hares. She tells how rabbits communicate. And she finishes the book with Funny Bunny Facts—one of my favorite pages ;-)Do you know that pet rabbits can be trained to do tricks?Do you know that the only part of a rabbit that sweats are its feet?Do you know 'bunny talk'? Read her book and you'll learn how they communicate.A delightful book, and highly recommended—for both the child in your life, and the adult who will have fun reading it, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22J9MLAC54RVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFH8M54#wasThisHelpful","R22J9MLAC54RVO","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again Emma Child has written a most delightful and educational book. It is a perfect book to give the child in your life, and one that adults will enjoy reading to that child as often as requested.Child tells about different whales, where they live, what they eat, how they sing. And one of the best parts of the book is toward the end, where she gives a list of Fun Facts. Those are great facts for children to know, as well as adults.Did you know whales don't chew their food? They swallow it whole.Did you know the Blue Whales' tongue can weigh as much as an elephant?She even has a bit about the Orca, which as she explains, is a dolphin not a whale. But that's okay, they are beautiful. (They are also called Killer Whales by fishermen, not because they kill people, but salmon.)These are great books for your child's collection. Fun to read, beautiful photos, and useful information. I heartily recommend all of her books!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8786RPRS11R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XFSOJK6#wasThisHelpful","R8786RPRS11R3","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best biography I've read in years. MATTIE is beautifully written and carefully researched. Mattie was Ann Rohrer's maternal grandmother and Ms. Rohrer had access to the journals not only of Mattie, but also of others in the family and many of those who lived in Colonia Juarez at the time. This is both a compelling read and history come alive.Ms. Rohrer did her research, and wrote a compelling story of her grandmother, Martha Ann ""Mattie"" Sevey Wood. Using journals and diaries, as well as other sources, to draw from, Ms. Rohrer did a good job of making the characters as alive in the book as they were once upon the earth.This book brings us closer to the time of the LDS colonies in Mexico, and Colonia Juarez in particular. This is where Mitt Romney's grandfather was President. A coming of age story set in a time of great adventure, and turbulence, MATTIE covers the time between 1902 and 1917 as she comes of age, moves to the States, falls in love with the wrong man—more than once—and eventually return to her roots to marry the man she didn't know she loved. I strongly suggest you not start this book unless you have time to finish it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38G5YYKPTO7LF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462111114#wasThisHelpful","R38G5YYKPTO7LF","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It will be a long wait until Book #3, Shapeshifter, is out!Book 1 in the series was Jazz's book. This book is her brother's book. It's all about Mal, and how he was able to manipulate the system so that when he turned, he became Wolf. What he didn't count on were all of the consequences.Within a couple of weeks, he was taken by the Prime Alpha, to his new home, his new family, and not allowed contact with his birth family. Normal for those born into the Pack, but not for someone who knew and loved his family.As a new Wolf, he lived on the compound, was watched, scrutinized, educated, and eventually, mated with Asia. All wolves are scientists, and his education leads to that end.While accompanying his mate to one of the Turning Houses, where those were who are not lucky enough to have their own space must go for their 3 days of animalhood, he sees his sister, Celia. The sister he blamed himself for killing. The sister he loved and missed. And she is one of the 'half souled' — alive, but not in her body, due to the overdose of drugs she took years ago. The drugs that her little brother got for her so she could miss a Turn and meet her favorite author.Mal vows to rescue her, with or without his mate's help.Wolves are, if nothing else, loyal. Extremely loyal, and by the time Mal and Asia get into serious trouble, they are in love, and have a cub on the way. They are not only mated, but bonded, and loyal to each other. This loyalty, and the Law of the Pack, come into play, in a somewhat surprising way.This was a one-sit read. Literally. I enjoyed it so much that I skipped housework and read the book. Take your book, find a 'cave' to crawl into where you can read undisturbed and in comfort, and run with the wolves, at least for a while.Another great book by Alma Alexander!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOZY3COPM5UM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDR9HKK#wasThisHelpful","R3FOZY3COPM5UM","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a hard time putting it down. Yes, it's YA, but it is suitable for any adult who enjoys a good fantasy about Weres. It's not filled with teen angst, or lust, or horny were-wolves, it's about a family of Randoms.Like all weres, Randoms change with the full moon, usually starting about age 15, but they don't necessarily become true within a family. The first time they change, they change on the last warm-blooded animal they see as they change. Jazz's father is a cat, her mother a chicken. Jazz's sister, Celia was a cat, and Jazz? Well, she's a surprise. A true Random. A Wild Card in the mix.Celia and Mal were youngsters when their family is forced to leave the Old Country and come to the New Country. As Shape-shifters, they were forced into being second class citizens, they were ostracized and during the three days of the full moon cycle, they were locked away, either in Turning Houses or in state approved rooms in their own homes where they turned from human to whatever.Celia, the oldest child, spoke with an accent, was quiet, intelligent, and gangly. She was bullied, not only by her peers, but by her teachers. The bullying and resulting emotional upheaval forced her to change, in public, in full view of everyone, which made the bullying worse. She dies before graduation, forced into it by one of her teachers.Mal, younger, becomes angry and sullen, and Jazz, the baby, born in the New Country, is pulled out of school, and taught at home. She is protected from everyone. Her parents guard her, determined she will not be taken from them as Celia was.Slightly before she changes for the first time, she finds Celia's diaries, and makes some startling discoveries that neither her parents nor her sullen older brother know. When she changes into something impossible, the family is thrown into fits, and it comes out that she knows about the death, and it was not suicide, as her parents thought, but accidental.This story is a great story about teens who are ""different"" and coming of age, dealing with that difference, be it skin color, accent, or whatever. It's a good story on the damage that bullying causes, and how many students who are bullied do not report it, and why. And it's not always peers who do the bullying. It's about how people are turned into second class citizens, often with their agreement, though not their approval.Alma Alexander has written a marvelous story, and frankly, I'm delighted that Wolf, #2 in the series is out, but I'm not gonna be happy when I finish it and have to wait for #3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FP45HF46CW3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPBFQN6#wasThisHelpful","R2FP45HF46CW3K","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(I apologize)This story takes place down on the Columbia River somewhere on the Washington side of Biggs, Oregon.

And each time I read until my eyes burn, and will no longer focus on the words and it's waaaaay past time to put the light out.But, this time, I was sure, would be different. It wasn't.Christy moves into Adam's house in this novel. She is in trouble, and needs his help, and she is, after all, the mother of his daughter, Jesse, and the pack love Christy, and aren't so fond of having their Alpha mated with a lowly coyote. Uh, yeah, there are sparks, and not the friendly kind. Especially when Christy decides she's going to take over running the house, AND using Adam's and Mercy's bathroom. Oh, yeah. Sparks. Lots and lots.Will Mercy back down? Uh, c'mon folks, this is Mercy Thompson Hauptmann we're talking about. She never, ever, goes seeking trouble, it seeks her. And when she and trouble meet, she never, ever backs down. She is, after all, a coyote. And when someone goes after her husband and mate, well, best not be you!For a great read, you'll not do better.

"I truly enjoyed this book. It is not a detailed history, but more a 'History Lite,' of the times and people in the year 1000 in Engla-lond. Based on the Julius Work Calendar, it describes what went on in daily life month by month.The authors are not historians, but rather journalists who did their homework. Perhaps that is why it is so readable.The weather was considerably warmer, certain foods were available then, several common ones did not come on the scene for a few hundred years. Many towns and or villages were named with a suffix showing their origin as either English or Norse, and were often interspersed. The towns today carry the same names. Macbeth was a real king who also had better luck of keeping the Vikings out of Scotland than the English had of keeping them out of England.Armies and battles were to be avoided at all costs, and when they could not be avoided, were relatively quiet. The farmer just a couple miles away would have been totally unaware of it and gone about his business.Buttons did not yet exist but rudimentary brain surgery did. Dolphins acted as weather forecasters, at least on the coast and there was a recipe for Viagra that long ago;-)If you want lots of dates and details and facts, just the facts, try another book by an Historian. If you want an enjoyable read with some interesting details, try this one, you'll like it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8TEEMW7845/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316511579#wasThisHelpful","R3C8TEEMW7845","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I 'bought' the boxed set for free. I got what I paid for. Terah Edun has a great imagination, and with a good editor, she'd have some terrific stories. She gets 3 stars from me because that's the average of an almost 5 star storyline and a 1 star grammar line.The books almost read like a first draft, though I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that one.Ciardis, our heroine, is an orphan and grows up scrappy in order to survive. A Companion comes to town and takes her to the Guild to be trained as another Companion. The training fell flat in many areas, Ciardis was always being told to watch herself, but no one ever explained HOW or WHY she needed to act, only that she needed to change. No one really explained to her (or the reader) what a Companion was, either. A Broodmare? A 'Trophy' wife? Someone to accompany the highest bidder to the ball? A Helpmeet? Lots of hints but nothing concrete. She reads the dossiers of her 'suitors' but what is she looking for? And why?On her 18th birthday, her magic powers come to fruition. She is a powerful mage, and again, is not given the training she needs, just told she needs to behave herself.Outside of the grammar mistakes on nearly every page, the biggest problem for me was there was no cost to any of the mages for the use of their magic. Only the Prince Heir, at the last, paid a price for his magic. Magic was so freely used in these stories it became, well, mundane.There were characters introduced who disappeared, characters I would have enjoyed seeing more of, especially the dragons.A lot of action, but not all of it explained well. A lot of Ciardis acting like a snot-nosed brat, a lot of her going off on her own. She doesn't grow much, and she doesn't pay much of a price for it. Oh, she's on the death list of someone, but we know she'll survive.Some romance, but not a novel of romance. Ciardis, the orphan discovers she has a brother, and then discovers her mother still lives, but has lived while hiding in plain sight.If you like high fantasy, don't mind some of the plot holes, and can deal with the grammar errors, I'll recommend this set, especially at the price. I think this author has a lot to offer, especially if she teams with a good editor.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJRZUYWG2GMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HBF56E2#wasThisHelpful","R1FJRZUYWG2GMG","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oliver Wendell Holmes once said something to the effect of, ""A person's mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."" My mind has been so stretched by reading this book.To get the legalities out of the way, I was given a free copy of Retaliation in exchange for my honest review, which follows.This is not a book I would have picked up on my own to read, the title did not sound appealing, but it fit the story perfectly; I live about as far from DC as I can get while still being in the Lower Forty-Eight; I live in a relatively peaceful neighborhood totally opposite of Tashera Odom and her neighbors. In short, I had nothing in common with the protagonist; however, by the end of the book, I found I had much in common with her.Tashera is a good girl, she has seen gang violence up close and personal, and wants nothing to do with it. Her older brother is in a wheel chair because of gang violence.  So when she is jumped on the way home from school by three girls she doesn't know for a reason she doesn't understand, and is put in the hospital with serious injuries, it comes as a total shock.This beating is the center part of the book, and how all the people in the book look and react at it. Her mother seeks retaliation immediately, rather than let the cops handle it. Her brother puts his old gang on it, and finds out who the girls are. Her boyfriend realizes his part in the beat down due to his past actions (which, by the way, describe today's rape culture very well, and the way it is accepted by way too many people. I think Ms. Shiraz has another book to write with Ahmed as the central character.) The three girls recognize their part and guilt.There are many characters in here, each deals with the beating and the aftermath in their own, and believable, way. This is a story of mothers who love their children, and mothers who don't; of children who commit atrocities, and are faced with the consequences. It is a story of family—family of blood, family of proximity, family of neighborhood, family of violence.There are times when the story jumps from one place to another, but the visual clues that a jump has arrived ""*****"" makes it easy for the reader to make the transition. The ending of the story is satisfactory, everyone gets their just desserts and recognizes their part in the drama. The ending of the book is more than satisfactory, as Ms. Shiraz has a section of Making Peace: Tips on Conflict Management with not only tips on conflict resolution, but information of where to find help if you're caught in a situation where you need it. There is also a Discussion and Bookclub Questions and finally a section on Questions with the Author.An excellent book on a tough topic, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is in high school, for any parent who has a child in, or entering, high school, whether you live in an area of gang violence or not, and for all you teachers out there. This book would make a great reading and discussion assignment. Copies should be in every High School Library in the country.Hollywood! Pay attention. This book will make a great movie!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWYHTKRSIW1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QG05MU#wasThisHelpful","R1EWYHTKRSIW1K","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book in one sitting. I had a hard time putting it down, and found myself not wanting to be interrupted by phone calls, or the vagaries of living. A memoir of reflections on her life as she faces her 65th birthday, the book travels to China, to Washington DC where she was arrested, to the fire that destroyed her home years ago.This is a gentle book, an inspiring book. Often, when I read such a book, especially as well written as this one, I thrill for having read it, and despair of ever writing anything again. This book has inspired me to write my own memoir as I face my 72d birthday coming sooner than expected ;-)I Love a Broad Margin to My Life is a free verse poem, filled with music as she writes about her life, where she's been, what she's done, the whys, and the wherefores. There are many tidbits of fun and useful information scattered freely throughout. Did you know the meaning of the word karma is work, not doom? She lists reasons to live and take joy in life.If you are a reader of Thoreau, as she is, you will recognize the title as a line from one of his books. The saying hangs over her desk. It will soon hang over mine, and this book will always be close to my hand, and bound within my heart. I am not sure what Thoreau meant when he wrote that line, or what MH Kinston meant when she adopted it, let alone what a 'broad margin to my life' means to you, but to me, it means to surround myself with space to think, to write, to create, to quilt, to learn, to be, to live. Thank you, Ms. Kingston for showing the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VJ4USLOS66WP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C43FYI#wasThisHelpful","R2VJ4USLOS66WP","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book. Why, then, only 4 stars? Because I think Ms. Roach could have put more into the book as to how the alimentary canal works, not just amusing anecdotes from her research. How does the small intestine work? What happens to the food that goes through it? How are the nutrients removed, and where do they go to get to us. This book left me with more questions than answers.Mary Roach is a marvelous writer. I've read, and enjoyed two of her other books, and as mentioned above, I read and enjoyed this one, but would have appreciated more, not less.If you have any curiosity about how your body works, from the inside, and have feared too much reading due to the 'ick' factor, fear not. When she talks 'ick' it is with taste (uh, pun intended) and humor. She has a knack for going into areas many of us consider taboo, and bringing those areas to light in a humorous manner. And why are they taboo, anyhow?She did talk about one thing I'd never considered – death by constipation. Yes, it happens. And it happened to people we knew, at least people in the public eye that we claim to have known. (Royalty, entertainers, etc.) Somehow, she managed to bring humor even to that chapter.If you've not read any of her books, you might as well start here. Nothing will give you nightmares, honest. Trust me. If you have read other of her books, you'll find this one a delightful addition to your Mary Roach library shelf ;-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WGLH36ZLB6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393348741#wasThisHelpful","R20WGLH36ZLB6V","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book I think everyone should read. The topic is heavy, the book is not. According to Stout, approximately 4 per cent of our population is sociopath. What does that mean? It doesn't mean they are all serial killers, for starters. They often blend in, and go unnoticed by the majority of people. They are usually intelligent, manipulative, and charming. Because they lack a conscience, they make perfect con-artists.Because these people lack a conscience, they are incapable of love, joy, remorse, or guilt. Because they have no fear, they take chances at work, in play, in their personal lives, and are often adrenaline junkies.How do you recognize one? And when you do, how do you live with one? You don't.Stout's writing is beautiful, almost lyrical, and most assuredly easily accessible by anyone. The stories she tells of individual people would almost make short stories on their own. But she doesn't just tell us about case histories, she also gives us ""Thirteen Rules for Dealing With Sociopaths in Everyday Life."" Those rules, alone, make the book worth the investment of both money and time.This is an extremely interesting book, full of useful information we all can learn from, whether you know, or think you know, a sociopath, or if you're a writer and want to write about one. As one reviewer said, this book needs to be read by every High School student in America before graduating. This kind of knowledge will save many a broken life. It won't necessarily stop the hurt because by the time we're involved with one, it's usually too late. But it can stop the breaking if we recognize it soon enough and end the relationship, whether personal or professional.Do not think about buying this book, JUST DO IT. Buy your own copy, read it, and if you're one of those people like me, keep a pen handy because you'll want to underline, highlight, and add your own marginalia to it. Highly recommend this for everyone who reads, for everyone who lives in today's world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HVII1M7KMHL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCJXTC#wasThisHelpful","R2HVII1M7KMHL0","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Moon Called in two days, it took me 3 to read Blood Bound because life kept getting in the way!Blood Bound picks up very shortly after Moon Called, and in this book we meet a few more characters of the Other realm that were perhaps introduced in #1, but now we get to meet them. (I closed one book and immediately opened the next, so the stories sort of blend for me.)Ms. Briggs has developed a most interesting world, and does not just toss fae, vampires, weres, etc. into it, she has carefully, and deliberately, given us the rules for each of the kinds of Others. The fae made themselves known, and now live, for the most part, on a reservation near Walla Walla, WA. They were the first to come out. Then some of the wolves. It's necessary, as science, especially forensic science, will out them one way or the other, and since many of the wolves, especially, work in high level jobs. Vampires may be another story altogether.There is logic in the way Ms. Briggs has built this world, this world of fiction in which I live right in the middle in the mundane world. I love a good story where I can enter, and even play with the characters. This is one of those stories. Ms. Briggs doesn't just spin a good yarn, she invites you to come in and play, too. But, be careful, you may meet some playmates you aren't expecting, and, well, blood has been known to make an appearance now and then. Especially when wolves and vampires mix it up.One of the truly refreshing aspects of this book, and I assume the series, is the romance element. It isn't harlequin—it's real. And Mercy is her own woman, and won't settle for any just any man, she demands love, and respect. Eventually, I'm sure, she will find it, but the chase is going to be interesting, so to speak.I look forward to reading all the books in this series. Although I'm sure I could read them as stand alone books, especially now that I know the characters, I think I'll read them in order written, and enjoy the unfolding of the various story lines. I highly recommend this book, though if you've yet to read a Mercy Thompson book, I strongly suggest you start with Moon Called.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20FOEZ3UR4EGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O76NHS#wasThisHelpful","R20FOEZ3UR4EGM","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though I live in the Tri-Cities (about half way between the Seethe and Mercy's Garage, according to the map), and have met Patricia Briggs a few times, I remained ignorant of the true genre of this series. I thought it was about zombies. Imagine my surprise when I discovered it is about weres. Oh, there are a few other folk mixed in, and mayhaps a zombie in a later book, but for the most part, it's about werewolves, and our heroine, Mercy Thompson who is not were but a skin walker, or shape changer. Most time human mechanic, part time coyote, raised by a pack of werewolves, she knows the ins, the outs, and the politics of the pack.This is not a book where the wolf-pack control or terrorize the locals. They actually blend in, and only a very few humans know of their existence. Adam, the local pack Alpha, keeps a tight reign on his pack, and considers Mercy his mate, thereby under his protection. Wolves and coyotes not the best of friends, he doesn't want anyone to go after her. She has also befriended a vampire or two from the seethe near my house, and some members of the fae community. All this makes for some great story lines, and some serious mysteries to be solved.Because Mercy is NOT a member of Adam's pack, she does not have to follow the rules of the pack, nor Adam's orders. She is not a submissive to his dominance. That allows her to do things his pack cannot do. It also allows her to get into trouble now and again.Mercy is beautiful, though possibly more from the inside than the outside. She is intelligent, and runs a garage that works on VW cars almost exclusively. Her coyote senses, especially that of smell, tell her more than most people realize. She can smell her friend, the undercover cop, no matter his disguise. She can smell a newly made wolf who has not been trained. And when her old love, Samuel, arrives to rent a room at her home, there are sparks between him and Adam, her neighbor. She can smell when it's time to leave the room before they decide to turn and go at it in order to 'win' her. Oh, those silly wolves. It will take more than that to win the heart of Mercy Thompson.This book has made me a fan of Ms. Briggs, of were wolves, and of Mercy Thompson. Almost makes me want to buy a VW so Mercy can work on it. This book is urban fantasy, preternatural thriller, there's humor, there's pathos, and all these characters are believable. Who knew I lived in the midst of such excitement? For a good time, read Moon Called.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUOX6Z8MOM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OCXHTK#wasThisHelpful","R2WUOX6Z8MOM8","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I love, and read, a fair amount of Fantasy, I've not read much in the Supernatural realm, not the Mystery genre, so I approached Ms. Keley's first book with a bit of skepticism, and couldn't wait to get my eyes on this, her second one. Suffice it to say I was not disappointed!Friar Tobe left the order before taking his final vows, but everyone calls him Friar. His training as a Friar-to-be, his devout Catholicism, all play a vital role in the solving of the mysteries in which he finds himself.Tobe is a man, not quite 30 years of age. He is single, and has fallen in love with a young woman of 18, and she with him. She became his secretary, and is now his fiancé, and when married will become his partner in his Private Investigator business. There is great chemistry between Tobe and Samantha, not to mention humor as they deal with the aspect of no sex until they are married. The characters in the book are believable, they are real, and they are, as all of us are, somewhat flawed in various ways.If you liked fairy tales as you grew up (and who of us didn't?), I think you will enjoy the retelling of them, in a modern and supernatural setting, as retold and explored by Ms. Keley's characters. A great read.

"The book is exactly as advertised. It is a novel of Intrigue, Seduction, and Redemption. There were a few places where I had difficulty suspending my disbelief, and I shan't mention them, because you may not have that problem.The book is emotionally captivating, I liked the characters, and I enjoyed the history woven into the story. I now know more about the Spanish Civil War than I knew before. The Awakening takes place over time, and to a degree over geography; mostly in Spain, a bit in Paris, and a tad in East Harlem.This book was a good read, wonderful for my bedtime read, in other words, the story moved well, but was not an adrenaline gusher. Much food for thought and cogitation, and it belies the old saw that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Read the book.

"After all the hype, I wasn't sure I wanted to read it. I've read, and enjoyed at various levels her other books, save one which I just can't get into, so I decided to read this one. I still like The Last Runaway best, but maybe because it was the first of her books I read?If you want a nitty gritty history of Vermeer, or life in his place and time, this probably isn't for you. I'm not sure how historically accurate this book is, but it's a fun read, and I do believe she has done some homework.My classification of this book is Brain Candy, and every so often, I enjoy brain candy, especially when fairly well written.I can understand why the wife would not like Griet. Griet is young, innocent, beautiful, and a servant. The other servant is old, ugly, and no competition or threat. I can understand why the wife would never want to wear the earrings again, and why her husband gave them away when he died (via a will). Why did Vermeer not paint his family? Perhaps as he says in the book, because they could not sit still. Perhaps no one would want to buy them. It is my understanding that many artists ground their own pigments to get them the way they wanted, that it was not usually something entrusted to a lowly servant. I may be wrong on that, but if so, then it was a sign of respect that Griet was allowed to do it. And, again, possibly his family had wanted to, and for whatever reason didn't do it right?Though these characters are not deep, they are satisfying, especially if read for what it is, a novel. A made-up story. If you want adrenalin, read someone else's books. If you want a satisfying read that isn't racing hither and yon, read Tracy Chevalier.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12HUPNJJJFEC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OCXIDK#wasThisHelpful","R12HUPNJJJFEC1","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the Soviet Union collapsed, Elena went from being an astrophysicist at Baikonur to being a janitor in her hometown of Almaty, who makes extra money buying and selling clothes on the black market. On her last trip, she picks up a small spherical object that is heavy, and oddly warm. As a scientist, she becomes curious and keeps it to study.Ilya is 800 years old, a warrior of myth and legend, not quite human, but not sure of what he really is, who has one goal in life — to be able to die. Every time he is close to death, the rusalka come and heal him, against his will.Ilya is hired to find the small, round object, and not only does he find it, he finds Elena, and together they discover the object can open gateways into an alternate Soviet Union, on another planet. Together, they must decide who gets the ""key"" and where they will live. Elena, the scientist does not know all the players. Ilya, the legend, does, and has spent 800 years hating and fearing some of them. But, are they who and what he has believed all this time?I had a hard time putting this book down. I loved the characters, and the travel down the Silk Road in both universes. The ending came at just the right time, and was both satisfactory and conclusive.

"I have a soft spot in my heart for Crocs n Gators. Don't ask me why, perhaps it's their constant smile? At any rate, I was delighted when notified that Ms. Child has written another one of her marvelous books, and this time on Crocodiles.If you haven't read her other books, you're in for a treat. She has a relaxed way of writing that will appeal to any child, regardless of their age. She researches her subjects, and uses professional photographs.As in all of her books, there is a section of fun facts to learn and wow your friends with. Like their 80 teeth are replaceable, and scientists think they can be replaced up to at least 50 times in a lifetime. That crocs can live up to 75 years of age (wow! something older than me) and that saltwater crocs are bigger than alligators, and can grow up to 23 feet or so.One question I have that was not answered—is crocodile meat as good to eat as alligator meat?This is a great book for children to read on their own, and also one that the adults can read to them, as often as asked for.

"Being a short book, I knew none of the stories would be in depth; however, because they were about women I knew nothing about, they were mildly interesting. The writing is good, the subject matter terrific, but due to the shortness of the stories, not overly informative; more gravy, less meat.I think this would be a good introduction to anyone not at all familiar with this part of our history, and would hopefully pique their interest to go on and read more in depth accounts, including the actual diaries of the women.There was nothing here about how they coped with emergencies, or daily lives on a personal level, except as a high level gloss. Personal things, such as how they dealt with babies and diapers would probably not have been mentioned in their actual diaries and or letters home. That would have been considered women's work, and of no importance to record, as all the women would have known. And the men wouldn't have cared what they thought, let alone read the diaries.I really wish the author had written longer stories with more usable information, given the women 50-60 pages each, and used more quotes from their diaries and letters. Unfortunately, the lack of information in this book make me hesitate to buy any of her other books, though I see she has several out about the same era and subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E79TE2A0YLWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1560445629#wasThisHelpful","R3E79TE2A0YLWE","A1O2I3BAX8FXZN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O2I3BAX8FXZN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I love stories of Ancient China, especially about Qin Shi Huandi, the first emperor. I love the histories I've read, and the fiction I've read, and the fantasies of Ancient China whether or not it ever was. So it was with great excitement I began this book. I was not as excited by the end of the book as I was at the beginning.The writing is consistent, and while I enjoyed some of the characters, I really didn't bond with any of them. I never saw them as anything but paper cut outs. And there were a few times when I was thrown completely out of the story.The story has its amusing moments, as Li Kao and Lu Yu (aka Number Ten Ox) go about their adventures finding the treasured ginseng root to save the children of Lu's village from a mysterious illness. However, I thought it a tad too long. By the time we were on the third, and final, adventure, I found myself wondering if I cared enough to finish the book. I was, at best, only mildly curious at the whole outcome (saving of the children was a foregone conclusion).I believe this is Mr. Hughart's debut novel, and long as it was (psychologically, not literally) I will give his next book a read. He has a good story, I think, just too much fluff and not enough busting (editing). I want to care about his characters.

"This is my introduction to Mrs. Pollifax, so I have no idea how it compares to the rest of the series. I found it moderately entertaining, enough that I finished it. Mysteries are not my normal reading genre, and when I read them, I try not to figure out who the bad guy is so the ending won't be ruined when I get there.This is a book I would be delighted to find on the hospital book cart, should I find myself confined to such a place. Mrs. P and the Lion Killer is easy to read, easy to put down, and easy to pick up again later.The title is somewhat misleading; it is not about a person who goes to Africa to kill lions, but about the man who kills others like a lion might.If you are a fan of the Miss Jane Marple books by Agatha Christie, I think you will enjoy the Mrs. Pollifax books.  While there is violence, it is neither gratuitous, nor graphic, and there is a great deal of humor.

"One of the problems I've had with the GoPro is that the location of the camera is almost never where the mic. should be. The MXL lavalier mic. is a good start to freeing the camera from live sound. I have tried mounting the camera in my car behind my seat (center console) to catch live driving. Attempts at narration are futile, buried in road and wind noise. Using this mic, I can clip the microphone to my shirt and the voice over is clean and crisp. This is a very good unit.Also packed with the MM-165GP is a second wind screen to go over the first. This one looks like fake fur. It is meant to handle outdoor conditions with real wind. I never had to use it, but this type of screen is almost always used on mics that professional cinematographers use outdoors. I tried it and it does cut down on wind sounds without noticeable degradation of the sound quality. There is a nice pleather case and a cleaning cloth (not sure why that was included).Just as the GoPro is a serious hi-def camera in a small package, this mic is an equally serious accessory for hi-def sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31O6DLVSMKAPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWCK0BE#wasThisHelpful","R31O6DLVSMKAPV","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This speaker offers a chance to extend music listening without running wires. I like that a lot. The sound is quite good for a speaker this size. I think it's a bit ironic that I am using a single, monaural speaker in the 21st century. The thing is that I find I am fine with it. The first problem I have with this unit is that it requires an IOS or Android device to control it. I have a Windows phone. Ok, not the end of the world. I also have an old iPad and a small Android tablet. But still, even though there aren't very many of us, it would be nice for Yamaha to remember the Windows folks.Setup using the app is a snap. I connected via WiFi. As it turns out, the room where I located the speaker is the same one where my WiFi router is located, so signal strength is not an issue. What is an issue, and the reason I only gave this product 3 stars is that it drops WiFi randomly. Each time it does, I have to dig out the tablet and redo the setup. That's inconvenient to say the least. I also have a Bose Wave radio that connects via WiFi for Pandora and my music library. It never looses the signal and it is considerably further away from the router.There is no question that this unit is versatile. It can receive music from a wide range of sources including the Apple system. In my case I have to use the app to select music from my server. That's fine. I have to do the same thing with the Bose. Since I don't have a Yamaha receiver or other MusiCast devices, my options are limited. But that doesn't matter. I can listen to what I like.

Fix that and I will give this unit five stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JXGUDRWEP4U2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01429SJL6#wasThisHelpful","R3JXGUDRWEP4U2","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another diesel fuel additive. The manufacturer makes significant claims that I can't verify. In fact, as far as I can tell there is only one claim that there is any chance for a driver to test: reduced gelling. Diesel fuel will gel in low temperatures (well below 20 deg F). It just doesn't get that cold around here. However, I don't doubt that claim. So why use this stuff?Diesel fuel, unlike gasoline, doesn't have an ""octane"" rating at the pump. Actually, diesel uses a Cetane value that roughly equates to available energy for the engine.A lot of truck owners believe that a cetane additive will improve performance and mileage. What it all boils down to is how much you trust your fuel supply. Good quality diesel fuel should have the necessary cetane rating and contain the additives to protect your engine. Pow-R 365 diesel fuel treatment has those additives in its formula. So, for a price, you can have both belt and suspenders for your diesel fuel.This product won't harm your engine. It just may not really help. We tried it in our Ford F350 Powerstroke engine truck. We observed no improved fuel economy. The engine ran fine before using and stayed fine with the additive in our fuel. Without dismantling our engine, we have no idea if this product cleaned the injectors or not.I had hoped for increased fuel mileage. I didn't get it. As for the other benefits, all I can do is take the manufacturer's word for it. We'll finish up the free bottle we got, but we won't be buying this product.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21UVWCEEMF4QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSHSLJY#wasThisHelpful","R21UVWCEEMF4QO","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had eczema for most of my life. Sometimes it gets going on my scalp. Tar-based shampoos do nothing for me. Last week I was suffering with that itchy scalp and started thinking back to earlier years> I remembered that I used Sebulex then and it worked. So, I did a search and discovered that Sebulex is no longer made but that Sebex is available. It is an accurate copy of Sebulex. It even smells just the same. Best of all, it works.

"I've seen shop towels around for a while, but I never imagined that it would make sense for my home use. However, I've been very unhappy with paper towels for cleaning our vehicles' windows and other around-the-garage and RV chores. I like these shop cloths a lot! They are very strong and I can use one or two for weeks for window cleaning. I can rinse them and they dry as good as new. I used them for some clean up around the RV. This is probably where they will end up. We have a lot of greasy clean up jobs around hydraulics and our fifth wheel hitch.What's particularly nice is that these cloths feel like the kind you launder, but they are disposable. Moreover, they are made of a renewable substance with little impact on the environment. I am tempted to reuse these more than I should. They are that good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25LUYC1W80OW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJXC80C#wasThisHelpful","R25LUYC1W80OW0","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vornado (does it rhyme with tornado?) products have an excellent reputation for long-lasting quality. My grandparents owned at least one Vornado heater. This heater (Model TAVH10) is definitely a twenty-first century product. The first thing I noticed was that there are no physical controls. When unplugged, all you see is a dark, smoked plastic panel on top. No obvious on/off switch. No indication of the promised features. It's not bad looking for a heater. The design is quite retro in my opinion.Back to the controls. The first time I plugged it in, nothing at all happened. I couldn't turn it on or make it do anything. Then I noticed that one of the feet was resting on part of the power cord. Ah ha! That caused the safety tilt switch to cut off power. Not bad, but annoying when first trying to test the product. Once the cord was moved out of the way, a tiny power symbol appeared behind the smoked plastic. Very cool. Touch the spot on the plastic started the heater and turned on the LCD display showing status, set temperature, etc. By touching  various symbols you can set the heater to 750 watts or 1,500 watts, target room temperature, etc. Easy peasy.Once in operation, the unit is very quiet; much quieter than other heaters we own. The air being emitted was warm, but not burning hot; another great feature, especially around pets or kids. Most important, it did a good job of warming the room. The fan is powerful enough to get good air circulation going. We have a rather large basement play room that is always cold. I put the heater there and let it go. We have been using another electric heater down there. It does an effective job of heating and takes about an hour to warm the room. The Vornado was about equal in time to heat the room. That makes sense since both units are 1,500 watts. The big difference is that the Vornado stopped heating when the room hit 73 degrees (the set temperature). The other heater just keeps heating until it is turned off. Once warmed up, the room was maintained that the set temperature.This model comes with some added features you may find helpful. One that I like is the twelve-hour timer. You can set the heater to run for a set period of time and then shut off. This period can be up to twelve hours. This is a big money saver for people like me who forget to turn the heater off after leaving the room for the night. The unit also has a remote control that will allow you to manage most of the functions. This is less useful for me. The remote is very small and has to be aimed carefully at the heater to work. Since there is no display on the remote, you need to be close enough to the heater to read the settings. I suppose if you have everything preset and you have the heater on a high shelf, you can use the remote to turn it on or off. Or, if you use it in the bedroom, you can shut it off or turn it on from bed. The remote comes with the battery packed separately. You need a small Phillips head screwdriver to put it in the remote. Inconvenient, but not the worst thing in the world.There are several Vornado Vortex heater models at lower prices. This is the top-of-the-line model and the only one with the remote control. There is a comparison chart on this page that might help you decide which model is right for you.Vornado heaters are among the best available and the TAVH10 is no exception. It comes with a five year satisfaction guarantee. That is something I like since the controls are all electronic and this guarantee shows Vernado's confidence they will be as reliable as the old-fashioned mechanical controls that have lasted decades. There is a very big difference between the way this unit ""feels"" and the less expensive heaters. Most noticeable for me is that the temperature of the air coming out is pleasantly warm, not burning hot like our less-expensive units. I am confident this heater will be keeping us warm for decades to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WC70P1Q89T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVF0HYA#wasThisHelpful","R33WC70P1Q89T","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a golden retriever and two parrots. I am allergic to the parrot dust and dog dander. We own several vacuum cleaners, each one top rated by Consumer Reports when we bought them. One is a Kenmore canister vac, the other a Panasonic upright. Both do a good job, or at least we thought they did. Each of our older vacuums cost more than twice as much as the Black and Decker AirSwivel.The surest test for a vacuum is to clean an area with the old vac and then go over the same area with the new one. As it was, my wife had vacuumed the bedroom floor last night before we went to sleep. This morning we unpacked the Black and Decker. Assembly was easy. You do need a Phillip’s head screwdriver for the single screw you need to put on. Everything else snapped into place.We started off by vacuuming the parquet wood floor in our hallway. The Black and Decker picked up all dirt and none was scattered or left on the floor (both of our old vacuums struggle on bare wood). We moved to the carpeted area where the birds live. The Black and Decker did a great job on that carpet. However, it could not pick up larger nut shells. The head is too close to the ground to allow them in.Next, we moved to the freshly-vacuumed bedroom. We were both amazed at the results. The dust container quickly filled with dog hair that the Panasonic missed! This will be great to help keep away my allergies. As a bonus, the head didn’t clog with hair.  This is a frequent problem with the other vacs. Until now we thought that the Panasonic did the best job. It has an indicator that goes from red to green when the carpet is clean. It lied! After vacuuming an area until the indicator said it was clean, the Black and Decker pulled a large amount of dog hair out. Clean indeed! The Black and Decker is truly powerful.The dust container removes easily. Dumping was a bit messy since the dog hair needed a helping hand to get it out of the container. This is normal for this type of machine. Our other vacuums use disposable bags. While it is a bit messier, the reusable dust container will be a big money saver for us.This unit is advertised as “Air Swivel” meaning it is easier to maneuver the head. The swivel works beautifully. We were able to get the head into every corner, under the bed, and below the bird cages. The machine is quiet as well. The other two vacs we own make much more noise.Frequently, products I review don’t make it into our day-to-day lives. Often, the products we already have do a better job. Not this time! The Black and Decker AirSwivel is now our main vacuum. The other two will be in the garbage next week.Let me emphasize that this is the best vacuum cleaner we have ever used to pick up pet hair. Our real-life testing proved to us that compared with high-priced, heavier, noisier vacuums we used until now, the AirSwivel out performs both of them. If you have pet hair to clean up, this is amazing! We love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BLB7ECGY1YNK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010T1QZMG#wasThisHelpful","R3BLB7ECGY1YNK","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that in this age of giant monitors it may seem, well, old fashioned to want a 21-inch monitor. But actually this smaller size is perfect for some important applications. HP clearly intended this monitor for TV viewing. It has a HDMI input and can be connected easily to a cable box or, in my case, a DirecTV DVR. It also has a VGA analog computer input. My first use was as a larger monitor for my laptop. Since this monitor is very thin and it's base lets you put it right up against a wall, the monitor with my laptop in front of it, fit perfectly on my home desk.This is a mid-range resolution monitor for a computer. It's 1920 X 1080 pixels is about average for popularly priced monitors.But that's not the whole story. I wondered why HP would develop a monitor this small. It's price point isn't the lowest for similarly-sized monitors. Once I connected it to my DVR I found out. Resolution isn't the entire story when it comes to monitors. If you want to watch hi-def TV, the monitor needs to be very fast. That means it can track motion without blurring caused by pixels taking too long to extinguish and light up. This is a very fast monitor. Hi-def TV looks great. The other feature that is important for TV watching is how far off axis the picture remains bright and sharp. The 22cwa has a remarkably wide viewing angle. Another key feature is the contrast ratio. The larger the number, the richer the blacks and dark colors will be. HP claims an impossibly large  8,000,000 to 1 ratio. I can't measure this feature, but that is a very big number for a monitor at this price. However, the proof is in the watching. My viewing experience was nothing short of great.I was skeptical about this monitor when I received it. I am very fussy when it comes to monitors. I have a 55-inch plasma for our main TV watching. I figured that the 22cwa might be a good monitor for my laptop. I never imagined that I would want to use it for TV. I don't think you can do better for $100.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYZWTP0936UQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WCV70W#wasThisHelpful","RYZWTP0936UQ2","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our luck with doggy puzzles hasn't been very good. Our golden retriever chews the doors off of a couple we tried. Yes, she solves the puzzle but has her own way of solving some that destroys them in the process. Knowing that, we are understandably cautious about investing in expensive ""educational"" toys. The Foobler looked like it could provide some lasting fun.When the toy arrived, it was a bit of a human challenge to work out preparing it for our dog. The markings on the body and lid that indicate where to put things together are not easy to read. If they were larger or engraved deeper in the mold, it would be much easier to open the power compartment and the all-important food bins.It takes a lot of unscrewing to get the battery cover off. I have  never had to deal with so many turns of the screwdriver to get in. Since the battery compartment is inside the toy and away from prying teeth, I don't see why a simpler lock for the battery couldn't have been provided. Be sure to use alkaline batteries only. Once we got the batteries in and the food loaded, we pressed the button to start the fun. A green light blinked for a little while and then it turned into a rapidly flashing red light. We tried this several times with the same result. We rechecked the batteries to be sure they were correctly oriented; they were. Finally, we concluded that the unit was defective. I went on the Foobler web site and confirmed that we did things correctly. I wrote an email to Foobler customer service (this was Friday evening). At the same time I asked Amazon to replace the defective toy. The reply to my email and the Amazon replacement arrived at about the same time. Good work for Amazon and a disappointing wait for Foobler.The replacement unit works correctly. Now the hard part. We filled the toy and put it on the floor. The dog wasn't very interested. So, we rolled the ball around and when a treat fell out, we showed her. That inspired her to push the ball around a little. When no treat emerged, she gave up. We repeated our demonstration and fed her the results. My wife got very good at extracting treats. Too bad, this isn't her toy. The dog got the idea and found some treats on her own. Clearly we need more tempting goodies to motivate her. Fifteen minutes later the bell rang. She ignored it. My wife got on the floor and showed her that treats are available again. We did this a couple of more times. Our dog is smart, but she hasn't figured out what the bell means.We plan to try again tonight. The toy has real potential, but it isn't something our dog just understood without help. So far she hasn't tried to chew it. The construction doesn't seem to lend itself to that sort of attack. We are following the instructions that were packed with the Foobler to train her to enjoy it. I am sure that eventually she will learn. It will take time and work, but she should eventually love it.I gave this product only three stars because of the low initial quality that required a replacement, and more importantly the slow response from customer service. If you buy the Foobler, prepare to spend some time helping your dog figure it out, especially the timed release of treats. We both enjoy this opportunity to interact with the dog, so the extra work for training is a plus for us. If you don't have the time or interest to train your dog to use this toy, save your money and get something else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBX6GC4SH0CWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXF6OLY#wasThisHelpful","RBX6GC4SH0CWN","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a large, rugged, and heavy watch. Everything about it shouts that this watch can take it. There are a lot of cheap watches that look similar to the Invicta, but they are all show and no go. This is the real deal! The price is reasonable for a watch of this quality. Here's what I like about this watch:• It’s rugged. The case is high quality stainless steel.• The dial window is synthetic sapphire. This is much more scratch resistant than glass. Only the finest watches have a sapphire dial window.• The band is a perfect width for this watch. It is heavy, stainless steel.• This watch is waterproof to 330 feet. That means it can be used as a dive watch. Watches that claim to be waterproof to 30 feet are generally unable to handle long immersion in water of any depth. The 330 foot certification means the watch will keep running on a scuba dive.• It has analog day, date, and 24 hour time dials. I prefer this to the numeric kind.• The hands are wide, easy-to-read, and glow in the dark The minutes are engraved in large, black digits on the bezel.• It has a stop watch function (something I don’t really use)The watch is made in China. The quality appears to be very good. I don't have very thick wrists. Large watches like this often look like I have an alarm clock strapped to my wrist. Even though this is a very large watch, somehow it looks like it belongs on my wrist. The only thing I am not too happy about is the weight. This is a thick, heavy watch. I would have liked it to be a bit thinner and lighter. However, because of its thickness, all the controls seem meant for big fingers. Adjusting settings and accessing features is easy even for a big guy.It comes packed with an excellent, illustrated guide on how to use it. Like the watch, the guide is large enough to read without a magnifying glass. I'm very happy with this model. The price is right and the quality makes it an excellent value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHO7S4QE63E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146HVMVS#wasThisHelpful","R1QHO7S4QE63E0","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Trager rub is a good, mild, very-standard rub. It absolutely makes chicken delicious on a smoker. Due to the nature of the spices in this rub, it may impart a burnt taste if you use it on a standard grill. The rub also works very well if you roast your chicken in the oven. The secret to getting a perfect, wonderfully browned chicken is to first wash and pat dry with paper towels. Then, rub oil (I use canola oil) all over the skin. Next, sprinkle a liberal amount on the chicken and PAT (not rub!) the rub into the chicken.I tie the legs together. It makes a much neater presentation. I also have a stand so I can smoke/roast the chicken vertically (they have them here for less than $5). Preheat the smoker (or oven) to $450 and roast the chicken until the internal temperature is 165 degrees. That's it!

"I have a cellular internet hub (AT&T). I wanted to use it to reach various Internet-connected devices in my RV. I had a combination of wired and WiFi devices (laptops, DirecTV receivers, etc). I purchased a wireless router that would handle everything. The problem was finding a way to get the cellular hub connected to the router. The router needs an ethernet cable to get the Internet. This is the standard way your home system works. So the problem was to make a WiFi connection to the cellular hub and convert it into a wired ethernet connection. The Linksys WES610N-4 is the device that does the job.Setting it up is really simple. Just connect the WES610N to your wireless router. Then power up the device and your cellular hub. You will find a way to connect to a WiFi device to your hub, generally a button to touch. Press the button on the Linksys and do the same on your hub. The devices will connect. Voila! You are done! You can connect wired devices to the 4 ports on the WES610N.This works perfectly. I have been using it for months with no problems at all.

"I'm not one for cosmetic products. I also have very allergic, sensitive skin. My face tends to dry out in warmer weather, so when I came across this product, I had to give it a try. First and foremost, it is completely unscented. I love that. I put some on and it felt light, not oily. For a while after applying I feel it on my face. It isn't unpleasant, but I know it is there. I can't attest to the SPF 15 sun protection, but I'm sure it is there and works. Cetaphil is a great brand. I have used their skin cleaner for years.This is the first face lotion I have seen that is designed for men. I like the way it feels and my skin is definitely less itchy. That means it's working. Now the challenge will be to remember to put it on each morning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYE3ZBIHCRQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHNZUS2#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYE3ZBIHCRQE","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a heavy fifth wheel. The plastic chocks are easy to run over and crack under the weight. We had metal chocks that wedge between the two tires on each side. Just hitching up had us run over these. The Roadblock chocks are expensive, but they are worth the price. These chocks are designed for 18-wheelers. They aren't pretty and have a slight rubbery smell. Each one weighs 8 lbs.! The work. If you have a heavy trailer, these chocks are going to hold you in place. We bought four of these and love them.One small issue: The eyebolts that come on each chock are not tightened at all.

"This is the first concentrate I have used. It took me a few glasses of tea to get the strength I like. Now all I have to do is squirt enough in to get to the ""right"" color and the tea tastes great. Surprisingly, it is pretty easy to make it too strong, at least for my taste. It's refreshing with no bother. Normally I make my iced tea using my Keurig. But there are a lot of times when I just want a quick, refreshing drink.There are two things I suggest you consider about this product: First, there is a significant amount of caffeine in each glass. If you react to caffeine, be careful when you drink this and how much you consume. Second, I fount a ""chemical"" aftertaste. The product does use an artificial sweetener (sucralose), but I don't remember that aftertaste with other beverages using it. This taste isn't very strong and won't stop me from continuing to enjoy this convenient product.This slight aftertaste reduced my rating from five to four stars. There is a lot to like about this concentrate. It's definitely worth a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24PWSHIO58ECX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK4VNV8#wasThisHelpful","R24PWSHIO58ECX","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Norelco Body Shaver for years, so I have an excellent basis for comparison. The writeup claims that the Mangroomer  pulls less and is less likely to pinch than other body shavers. I found the opposite to be true. To be fair, I did a trial comparing the Norelco body shave with this product. Here's what I found:1. Close shave: Both products were equal in terms of cutting down to the skin.2. Catches hair: In this case, the Mangroomer lost badly. It took four or five passes with the Mangroomer to get the same amount of hair that the Norelco removed in one pass.3. Pinch and cut: In this case, the Mangroomer was horrible. Even when stretching loose skin, the Mangroomer nicked me repeatedly. The Norelco isn't perfect here, but it is way better than the Mangroomer.4. Combs: Both razors come with combs for trimming. The Mangroomer's combs are closer to what I want than the Norelco's. The shortest comb is 3mm, which is about perfect for me.5. Charger: Both razors are equal in terms of charging time. The Mangrromer's charger is flimsy and difficult to hold firm contact with the charging base. The Norelco is much more secure in its base.6. Price: The Mangroomer is the same price as the least expensive Norelco, and considerably less than the better models.SUMMARYIn my opinion the Mangroomer is not the best choice for male grooming. It was rough on my skin. Since I have been grooming for many years, it isn't because I am not used to an electric shaver. It's due to the quality of the Mangroomer's cutting head. The Norelco Bodygroomer is my shaver of choice. I think it is worth the money to avoid the nicks and poor shaving coverage of the Mangroomer.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB749S4ZP1A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O50I7CE#wasThisHelpful","R2QB749S4ZP1A6","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used various plastic blocks to put under my 5th wheel's 6 leveling jacks. The rig weighs 15,000 lbs. We were most recently using Camco's large jack stabilizer pads. These pads are advertised as very heavy duty and are more expensive than these. They did work, but clearly showed signs of strain. They didn't remain flat on an uneven surface. These Fas Ten Leveling Blocks are considerably thicker and do a better job under our pads. Of course, their open design makes them unsuitable to be used alone under the jacks. We put 2 - 4 X 6 X 12 in. wood blocks on top of the plastic blocks. This works out perfectly for us. The plastic protects the wood from ground moisture and also provides a slip-free landing for the wood.Since we have a six-point leveling system, we don't need blocks under the trailer wheels, so we can't comment on how well these work for that purpose. Side-to-side leveling is critical with any RV. These blocks look like they will be a big help for rigs without jack systems. For those of us who have these systems, the blocks make an inexpensive, handy way to protect our jacks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M3V0J2TIZ6H7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T36IQJO#wasThisHelpful","R3M3V0J2TIZ6H7","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very interesting read. Since it's written by a current Google employee, it gives insight into the Google analytics platform in the context of Google's intentions. I use Google analytics in addition to a tool that I host on my servers, Piwik. The numbers from Piwik and Google never agree. Google always shows more users. This is interesting since the Javascript for both are located one after the other in my footer. However, exact numbers is much less important than trends and page popularity, entry, and exit pages.This book explained exactly how Analytics integrations, the combination of pre- and post-visit activities can help improve site performance. There is much in this book that goes way past my interest in site analytics, but if you have a site that produces revenue, this book and the very robust Google platform provide help in building traffic and revenue.The book itself is well organized and it is easy to go directly to the topic of interest.

"I've had the glass version of this feeder for several months. This model is identical except that it has a plastic nectar container. I hung this one at a different location and it proves just as effective as the glass model. That's no surprise, of course. I also have a hummingbird feeder that uses the ""IV"" bottle. It will only feed one hovering bird at a time. After I hung the Perky-Pet glass feeder, ""business"" dropped off dramatically at the IV type. The hummingbirds clearly prefer this style of perch and feeder openings.There hasn't been a bee or ant problem with this feeder either. If ants do come around, just fill the moat (it's the depression in the cap that you hang the feeder from). That will prevent ant access. I don't use the commercial nectar. It contains coloring. Contrary to what some say, hummingbirds are just as happy with clear nectar as with red. The red color of the bottle is not necessary either.You can make your own hummingbird nectar easily. Just put 1 cup of sugar and 32 Oz. of water in a pot. Stir and bring to a boil. Let it cool and fill the feeder. This model holds 32 oz. In the winter if the temperature is going down below 25 degrees F, you can mix the nectar with two cups of sugar per 32 Oz. of water. This will keep it liquid down to about 20 degrees.  Be sure to change the nectar weekly during warmer months. Bacteria, harmful to the birds, can grow in old nectar.I like the glass model better. It is more rugged. But both work perfectly, so it is a matter of preference. This is the best feeder I have used.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9W01CY10VRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JN9NHRM#wasThisHelpful","RF9W01CY10VRF","AYGFPGFKAWOVM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYGFPGFKAWOVM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product has a mildly-salty, menthol taste. It is much milder than other mouthwashes. It usually hurts to swirl other mouthwashes in my mouth.

It's pleasant.Most important, it did sooth a sore spot in my gum. This is the first product that has actually done that for me. This stuff does what it claims. On the negative side, it is incredibly expensive.It may be worth a shot if you have sore gums. If it works for you, it's worth the money.

"I don't know what it is about humidifying type diffusers, but I had a hard time finding an attractive one which also had a good average customer rating. (I mean, what's up with all the weird, asymmetrical shapes?) This Allay Aromatherapy EO diffuser was the best I could do in the looks department, although it's only moderately attractive. However, the functionality and end results of this diffuser are much better than the old-fashioned heat-warmed diffusers I've always had previously.Basically you fill the water reservoir with distilled water, if you don't want hard water deposits to eventually build up inside your diffuser. It takes maybe a third cup at most I think. Then you drop in 3-4 drops of essential oil, replace the reservoir lid and the decorative outer funnel thingy, and turn it on. It works very well to scent the room while adding a touch of extra humidity -- a very helpful bonus in dry, overheated winter rooms. The built-in shutoff occurs when it runs out of water; perhaps 3 to 4 hours altogether. I really like that I don't have to monitor this myself.Just one cautionary tip: I have read in many customers' reviews of humidifying diffusers that it is not advisable to diffuse any citrus EOs in these diffusers, on the grounds that contact with citrus oils will eventually degrade the plastic they are made of, and impair the unit.  On some product pages you will see customers' comments about other types of EOs (such as Eucalyptus and Pine) also being destructive to plastic diffusers. I have no idea if this is true, or just a rumor. The Allay diffuser had no such warnings printed about avoiding any specific EOs, but I have been hesitant to test citrus, pine, and eucalyptus EOs in mine all the same. This is a real shame, because these oils are among the most aromatherapeutic  for people with breathing difficulties. If there is a problem with specific EOs, Allay should have notified me, so I am not sure what to think about this. Having to avoid grapefruit, bergamot, and orange EOs certainly impairs my enjoyment of this product! I *have* tried lavender, sandalwood and lemongrass in this diffuser, with no problems so far.I do like this product overall. I can recommend this diffuser as a pretty good, low-maintenance aromatherapy tool that is especially appropriate for winter use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV8JD4EMOI211/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RODQEI#wasThisHelpful","RV8JD4EMOI211","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ordered this pack of screen protectors before I even bought the Nintendo 2ds for my kids; I suppose I must have learned a thing or two from experiences with other electronic devices. ;)The installation is about the easiest I've ever experienced, and you can quickly line the protectors up and lay them down. Before you do that however, be absolutely certain that there are no little specks on the screen. That's what the little black microfiber cloth is supposedly for, but the instructions failed to mention that part.The best technique I have found for screen protectors of all types is to line up one edge perfectly, then bend it back a bit so that it sort of rolls down into place, as opposed to just laying it down flat all at once. This helps you eliminate any air pockets as you go with the plastic card. In the case of this screen protector however, there were literally no air pockets to push out.The screens of our 2ds are well protected now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8A7WH4DQDF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6FJCMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1A8A7WH4DQDF0","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was sent to me as a Christmas gift last week. I have used it several times in the past few days. I love this diffuser!My observations:ASSEMBLY: Simply two parts, and couldn't be easier; just the base and the flower-shaped glass top part that rests on top of it.GETTING STARTED: I scoured the package for instructions, as I had never operated this type of diffuser before. The only instructions included were printed on a little address label-sized sticker which said the following: ""Caution: Do not use alcohol based fragrance or perfume in any 'aroma burners'. Heating of fragrant oil without use of hot water is not recommended. Use no more than 10 drops of fragrant oil for every 1/4 cup of hot water. As water runs low from evaporation, add only hot water to dish. Avoid the build up of old  oil base by periodically washing this dish with soap and water."" Well it isn't rocket science, so despite the dubious ""manual"", I was able to boot up two of my brain cells to figure out that I was supposed to put water in the glass dish, then drop a few drops of essential oils on top of that before turning on the base. Still, the writers of the instruction sticker need to brush up on their skills a bit.To turn on the diffuser, simply plug it in and touch anywhere on the base unit. To my delight, I discovered there are three light intensity settings, which you also change by touching the base unit area. Ingenious!QUALITY: so far, so good. It operates well and appears to be well constructed. Admittedly, I have only used it for less than a week, so time will tell. Taking the low price into consideration, the quality of this diffuser can't be beat.APPEARANCE: Simply lovely to look at this softly glowing, rosy light thorugh the pierced metal pattern of the base. It is a bit more impressive in a dark room, but it is also pretty to look at in daylight. No complaints!EFFECTIVENESS: works very well to disperse the aromas of the essential oils into a smallish room area. I have used it in our dining room which is about 20 feet by 25 feet. I haven't yet tried it in a larger room.Cautions: Becaues the way this type of diffuser works is by heating the water and oil in the glass dish, eventually the water and oil will evaporate. I found that on the medium intensity setting, after having been filled to maximum capacity before turning it on, this took about 3 and a half hours. After that, whatever oil residue left in the bottom will dry and then..I don't know for certain, but I imagine it might start to burn if left indefinitely. I really don't want to find out. It is obviously not advisable to let that happen. There is no built in time setting for this diffuser, so for safety reasons, I would not leave it turned on unattended, nor indefintely. The instructions do not mention this at all, and it is irresponsible of the company to not include more ""idiot-proofing"" somewhere on the packaging to ensure that hapless customers don't have easily avoidable accidents in their homes while using this product. We all know those people who would simply assume that if the instructions don't tell you *not* to dry the family pet in the microwave, then it must be okay.CONCLUSION: A great little diffuser for the money, but I would not let it fall into the hands of people who rate Jersey Shore higher than Breaking Bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C7SCY6U9WCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NQ5QXU#wasThisHelpful","R16C7SCY6U9WCM","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One star for the nice snowflake molds, one star for the tasty chocolate candy. Zero stars for Wilton's peppermint ""bark"" scheme.On the front package picture, this project looks awesome: you mold chocolate peppermint ""bark"" into snowflake molds and package them in unique gift bags. The picture makes it appear as though the peppermint portion of the bark is smooth and pretty. Nothing could be farther from the truth.You heat the chocolate and the peppermint separately in the microwave, taking them out at intervals and kneeding them, until they are sufficiently melted to squeeze nicely into the snowflake-shaped cookie cutter molds. (alternate directions suggest you can use a double boiler, but I didn't have one on hand so I microwaved the two bags of candy). The chocolate candy bag melted quickly and smoothly; I had no trouble squeezing it into the molds. You let the chocolate portion harden first for 10 minutes, then squeeze the peppermint bark candy bag on top of this. The problem is, the peppermint candy (which as far as I can tell is white chocolate mixed in with little pieces of candy cane) doesn't want to A, melt completely, nor B, melt at a temperature in which the human hand can comfortably handle the bag in which you are melting it. I must have had that darn thing in and out of the microwave, burning my hands as I attempted to kneed it into something smooth and workable, at least 10 times. It would not melt past the consistency of cookie dough, and finally I realized it was pointless to continue. I squeezed the peppermint candy into the molds on top of the chocolate, and it would not settle in nicely. I was forced to use my fingers to push it  into the corners. After about 10 seconds, the stuff stiffens up in the plastic squeeze bag and I had to scoop it out with a spatula. The end result is that after fussing with this for far too long, my peppermint bark had a lumpy and unattractive appearance. No way was I going to give these as gifts.Later, these snowflake barks do not unmold well, meaning there's no way they are coming out in one piece. No, you have to chisel them out with flatware or something. Double fail.Do yourself a favor and forget this kit. If you like the snowflake molds, I believe they are sold separately.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KDXVCCM4TDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CN5T12#wasThisHelpful","R7KDXVCCM4TDF","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carrot seed EO by Nature's Kiss is a wonderful deal. When I bought it, I had no idea that it had a natural SPF -- still haven't had an opportunity to test that out for myself, and now that it's November. ..well, wait until June for an update on that. What I did notice right away is that it does live up to its reputation for being a natural skin smoother. In a facial mask recipe and an anti-wrinkle blend (diluted in a base of jojoba oil and other EOs), carrot seed oil gave me a nearly instant result of smoother-feeling skin. I've been using this blend for about one week now. It could be the placebo effect, but I also notice fewer tiny lines around the mouth and corners of my eyes. Gotta love that!As for the smell, you will have to experience it for yourself. My kid likes it because it smells like pumpkin seeds to him, my man..not so much. Carrot seed EO definitely emits a warm, earthy odor. If you decide it's not to your taste, maybe blend with Lavendar to disguise ithe smell a bit, and be sure to dilute heavily in a base of carrier oil regardless: put ""neat"" onto my skin, it provokes that that faintly tingling feeling that warns me it could irritate more sensitive skin areas.I've also seen recipes for carrot seed EO in massage oil blends with names like ""PMS oil"" and ""Fat Attack"" (to be massaged onto cellulite problem areas). Supposedly, the vitamin A-rich carrot seed oil helps with weight loss. Now THAT sounds like an overblown claim to me but it couldn't hurt me give it a try some time :).

"At first I was taken aback by the seeming lack of pungency of this Cinnamon essential oil, but then I remembered: this is REAL cinnamon bark (cinnamomum verum), not the cassia (cinnamomum aromaticum cassia) that's commonly labelled as cinnamon in the USA. Just like a stick of real cinnamon bark, this essential oil has that light, clean, almost floral scent with just a touch of sweetness.Cassia oil is definitely a heavier and sharper scent, which many actually prefer; however if you want the aromatherapeutic benefits of real cinnamon bark oil, this EO is what you'll need.I have used my cinnamon EO in a recipe to imitate doTerra's On Guard blend. It's nice to dilute the blend with distilled water in a spray mister, which I then use as a sanitizing spray on tables and counter tops -- it smells like Christmas cheer in a bottle. Here is the basic blend:20 drops clove essential oil18 drops orange or lemon essential oil10 drops cinnamon bark essential oil8 drops eucalyptus essential oil5 drops rosemary essential oil.Simply combine into a small, dark glass bottle and swirl to blend. Dilute with water or carrier oil when ready to use. If using as a spray, put approx one teaspoon of the blend into a 4 oz glass bottle with a mister pump and fill to the top with distilled water: shake before each use to disperse oils.There are a lot of uses for cinnamon bark oil due to its antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, etc. properties. It is a very potent medicinal oil, and I have also heard of people using cinnamon EO to flavor their cooking and baking in place of powdered cinnamon.

I have been pleased with the results of this oil, which has come to our rescue in my personal blend inspired by doTerra's Deep Blue; combined with Wintergreen, carrier oils,  and a few other EOs, Blue Tansy was effective as an anti-inflammatory, healing topical on two separate muscle injuries this month.Although I have no other experience with which to compare Nature's Kiss' Blue Tansy EO, it does seem to be a pure oil with powerful therapeutic benefits. The unique tansy scent is a sweet and slightly musky floral -- not unpleasant. One drop is all you need per application. This bottle will last our household for a few years at this rate, unless I find futher uses for it; but even so, it was more than worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2244164Q0M7O9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00746RA38#wasThisHelpful","R2244164Q0M7O9","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you read those product descriptions that claim that the aroma of roses is historically considered an aphrodisiac, you may wonder: an aphrodisiac for whom? Surely many people like sniffing it from flowers or using it to disguise worse odors, but when I think about it, I can't say I've ever personally known a *man* to be turned on by the smell of roses. I also can't say that I have, either :). Ah well, but on to the review...I have always enjoyed the scent of roses, sandalwood, and jasmine; and to find a blend that featured all three was like a dream come true. My expectations were for something warm and sensual, being that sandalwood and jasmine have those properties, brightened nicely with sweetness from the rose. What the Sexxy Blend from Miracle Botanicals gives you is a strong hit of rose. While you're reeling from that, you might also detect the sandalwood and jasmine dancing timidly around the perimiter of the ring while Rose Up The Nose charges in for the knockout punch.It's okay. I have come to terms with the fact that this was never going to be the aphrodisiac scent that I was looking for. Plenty of skin care and body lotion recipes call for rose essential oil, and Sexxy Blend will substitute nicely. This blend would also be good to refresh a rose potpourri or a sachet. Unfortuantely, after my husband got his first whiff of Sexxy Blend, all possibility of using it in a massage oil recipe was wiped out by that ""I am horrified but resigned to ignore this"" expression that crossed his face. Never mind hon, I get it: Sexxy Blend is retired from the bedroom.One more of life's imponderable mysteries: how can such a hugely expensive oil such as rose, jasmine, or sandalwood be sold for a mere forty-ish dollars per 5ml if in fact it is ""100% Pure Essential oil blend""? Absolutely incrdible. Meaning, methinks there is something literally too good to be true in that claim... we continue to live and learn.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FXGO9DUULWX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073WUQR0#wasThisHelpful","R2FXGO9DUULWX6","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of course it shrinks, that's been the nature of T-shirts ever since the dawn of the Age of Comfortable Clothing.

"Our smart phones are much-abused, when you think about it: rattling around in purses amongst the tiny bits of debris, sand that somehow worked its way into the bottom of handbags from that late-summer trip to the beach (even though it's now November..I don't clean often, and my handbag is no exception!), and left exposed in various ways which invite all kinds of Bits and Pieces to randomly wind up in those little cracks and crevices which *should* be kept pristine for optimal functioning of the device. Headphone jacks are particularly vulnerable to Bits and Pieces invasions, as most of the time they are left unplugged. That's why I love this little stylus/plug accessory.Note that while I like the *idea* of a smart phone stylus, I rarely use this mini-stylus /plug for that purpose. My fingers, as clumsy as they can be, are still handier for navigating the screen. Perhaps if I had bull-in-a-china-shop man-fingers I would be all about the stylus; but then, if I had beefy man-fingers, I'd probably want a larger stylus anyway.It comes in 8 cute colors, so you'll probably give the puke-colored ones away to your hipster friends.

"Stories of miraculous healings abound around Helichrysum essential oils; disappearing cysts, bruises, dark circles, and muscle injuries healed overnight. Some claim that Helichrysum EO has cured their back injuries, stiff joints, sciatica, and neck pain. How can a newbie such as myself resist what seems like such a bargain price for this reputed ""miracle oil""?I bought this Helichrysum essential oil a few months ago before I'd done much research into using EOs for therapeutic purposes: it turns out that this type of Helichrysum, Gymnocephalum, is not considered the best not the most potent strain of Helichrysum which you find in the higher-end essential oil companies -- that would be Helichrysum Italicum. H. Italicum is the strain with consistently high levels of anti-inflammatory curcumenes and regenerative di-ketones. H. Gymnocephalum has lower levels of these molecular components, though I couldn't tell you how much lower. But now that I know this, it's no wonder this was so inexpensive compared to DoTerra's and Young Living's (both Helichrysum I.) EOs!Having established all that, I do think this oil has some good beneficial properties, based on my limited use of it. At first, I used a couple drops of Nature's Kiss Helichrysum Gymnocephalum EO in a homemade facial mask; it had a cool, slightly tingling effect on my skin. I do believe it did its job there in terms of improving my skin's texture and smoothness, but of course that kind of thing is highly subjective. One month later, my son sported a deep muscle injury from training for wrestling on his upper arm; he could barely lift the arm and was in constant pain. The coach had applied an ice pack to the arm right away, but when we got home that afternoon (about two hours after the injury occurred), I made a concoction of Helichrysium, Wintergreen, Blue Tansy, and Peppermint EOs -- loosely interpreting a recipe from a very pricey EO blend used for soothing injuries and aches. I diluted it in extra virgin coconut oil and rubbed lightly over the injured area. This mixture dulled the pain somewhat, but I admit he also took an Advil before bed The next morning the pain did not return and the injury had lessened up somewhat, so I applied more of the mixture to the area before he went to school. By the end of the day, his injury had nearly disappeared, my son could lift his arm again and we still haven't seen a bruise or any visible sign of injury on his arm since. Who's to say if that's due to the Helichrysum or something else?So there's my personal testimony for this product. I am now a believing skeptic for Helichrysum G. Essential Oil by Nature's Kiss. As with their other EOs, my opinion of this product is that it is a good quality EO for a very reasonable price: a budget alternative to the more premium EO brands out there, if perhaps not the absolute top medicinal variety. When this bottle is finally used up, I plan on investing in a bottle of H. Italicum essential oil, which can be had from a few other companies on Amazon, and other external Web sites. It pays to do one's research before buying expensive aromatherapeutic products -- I know that now. Hopefully you can benefit from reading of my experiences, to then make the right purchase for yourself.

"My reasons for ordering this unscented, organic shampoo and conditioner are that 1., I am attempting to incorporate more natural body care products into my life as I cut out synthetic and toxic substances, and 2., so that I can scent the products myself with essential oils that I enjoy and use for aromatherapy purposes. This conditioner accomplishes both of these objectives admirably. One to two drops of EO mixed in with a single application of the shampoo and conditioner (in separate bowls, obviously!) is enough to put a lingering aroma on my hair after everything is rinsed away. It's like perfume for the hair without the chemicals; subtle, not overpowering.If you've read my review of Desert Essence Organics Unscented Shampoo, then pretty much the same points apply here: like the shampoo, it's good on ""normal"" and/or greasy hair, but it is not especially moisturizing. I found on my ""normal"" hair it moisturized/conditioned adequately, and when my hair had dried, it was in good condition, but on the drier side (if that makes any sense). Therefore, I would not recommend it for people with hair that requires extra moisturizing.I like Desert Essence and will continue to buy their products as needed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D29U610O66R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E4EKQ6#wasThisHelpful","R1D29U610O66R3","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this unscented, organic shampoo so that I could scent it myself with aromas that aren't often found in shampoo (at least, not in the more reasonably-priced product lines that I can afford): good-quality essential oils of sandalwood, jasmine, ginger, etc. That has worked out really well: I squirt one ""serving"" sized amount into a bown and drop my EOs in, mix, and take to the shower. I wish I could have mixed my EOs in the squeeze tube itself in order to save time, but there really is no way to do that (no removable cap/ dispensing tip). Oh well, not a dealbreaker -- but note to the manufacturers, a removable cap would improve my satisfaction with your product!As far as the shampoo itself, it does the job. This Desert Essence shampoo is a decent quality shampoo and I appreciate that it's organic and all-natural. I have ""normal"" hair, meaning neither greasy nor especially dry, and I find that this shampoo does tend to leave my hair in good condition -- but perhaps just a tad on the drier side. The shampoo does leave the faint scent of the EOs on my hair, which is great for my puposes of a subtle aromatherapy effect in place of wearing actual perfume :).I don't use this shampoo every day due to the bother of having to scent each application of both shampoo and conditioner every time I use it...I tend to forget to get my EOs and bowls before I'm in the bathroom and ready to start. But that's my problem, and it did not influence my rating of the product itself.A good shampoo: I would recommend it generally.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B18S02OO5GDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019GZCYI#wasThisHelpful","R1B18S02OO5GDQ","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being that citrus essential oils are expeller pressed and not distilled, they do have a limited shelf life..the relatively faint scent led me to wonder if this bottle of grapefruit EO was perhaps older stock. In my opinion, situations like this merit expiration dates on bottles of certain, more volatile essential oils such as this.I thought it was a nice grapefruit-y smell, but too weak. Still, I will use it until it is gone, and then not order citrus oils from Plant Therapy again. To be fair, their other oils (ginger, petigrain, lemongrass) did make a good impression on me, so I would be open to ordering other types of EOs from this company in the future.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23D9N1PUH0314/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005V2UKLG#wasThisHelpful","R23D9N1PUH0314","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone who is more familiar with the scent of German chamomile (been drinking the tea for 2 decades), I was interested to see what a Roman chamomile essential oil would smell like by comparison.

Nonetheless, Nature's Kiss has it at a great price and the value per dollar is very good.

"As soon as the cap comes off you will smell this powerful hybrid lavendar as a potent and slightly more camphorous scent than you may be used to with ""French"" lavender. I put that  word in quotes because I have a variety of lavender that the nursery sold to my as French lavender, which looks nothing like Lavandula Angustifolia. But I digress..Nature's Kiss has a great, high-quality lavandin oil here, you can't help but be pleased with it.For this past 2 months I have been using this essential oil in a homemade lotion recipe, and it adds a very rich and lasting fragrance to my nighttime routine. I generally do not have trouble falling asleep so I can't comment on its sedative properties, but it is very psychologically soothing. I do believe that it may have repelled more than a few mosquitos, as evidenced by the fact that since I started applying my lavendar lotion before bedtime, I only woke up twice with a new mosquito bite whereas my dh (who of course would never wear ""girly-smelling"" lotion at any time of day!) would awake with with several. I wasn't looking to use it as an insect repellent, but there you go.All that being said, I enjoy the fragrance from this lavandin oil very much and would use it in all kinds of body care products, but it is not as sweet as true lavender. However, lavandin's higher camphorous content ( cineole, camphor, and borneol) is powerfully antibacterial/antimicrobial, making it ideally suited to applications in cleaning and personal hygiene products. I will share my ""all-purpose"" cleaning spray recipe with you:1/2 cup white distilled vinegar1/2 cup distilled water12-24 drops of ""cleaning"" essential oil of your choice*.Put ingredients into a spray bottle, seal, and shake well, to evenly disperse essential oils before each use.*I love using citrus essential oils for their uplifting scent combined with tea tree oils for antiseptic properties in this recipe, but Lavandin Grosso essential oil is also excellent here.Is there any purpose which Lavandin Grosso EO is ill-suited for? Reportedly, the high camphor content is not beneficial to the treatment of minor burns, which is something regular old lavender oil *is* recommended for.

"I don't get the product description's claim that this isn't ""true"" lavendar: it may not be the exact scent that some people have become used to from French Lavender (Lavandula Angustifolia), but it IS the true, original lavender cultivated by monks and medics going back to Roman times, Lavandula Officinalis. I happen to think that this lavender scent is the nicest and purest form of Lavender.Nature's Kiss has done it once again with a top-drawer essential oil, their ""Wild"" Lavender. It has a strong, rich top note that is intensely floral. rub a drop on your inner wrist and note, it has staying power! I like to use this EO in body lotion recipes as well as a drop in my baths, facial steams, difusers, and any recipe calling for a sweetly-scented lavendar; it is an excellent, all-purpose aroma.

"So ""what if"" the South had won the War of Secession?Readers already familiar with Harry Turtledove's previous work, Guns of the South, can look forward to another novel set in a similar -- although not exactly the same -- alternate history timeline. How Few Remain picks up after a new country was born of a split between the USA and the Confederacy: the CSA. Now, as adolescent countries are wont to do, these bitter rivals have a new quarrel to occupy them as the CSA aims to purchase a hefty chunk of Mexico that will enable the young nation to realize its own version of Manifest Destiny, extending its territory to the Pacific. Egads, this will not set well with the arrogant and power-hungry USA, now will it, my fellow history students?HFR is written in what has become the typical Turtledove format of splitting the point of view between several characters -- some of which are real historical figures, although others are just the author's own figments. This makes for a good plot device to balance the narrative between ""the noble and the common"", giving us insights into slice-of-life history as well as the larger arc of the war's progression. Readers will instantly be able to tell which historical characters are the author's pets and which he considers to be buffoons (*cough* Custer *cough*). A major highlight of this story format is the author's delightful take on Samuel Clemens, which showcases a brilliant wit that's uncharacteristic of this author...as if he'd really channelled Clemens to write that portion of the book. The downside of course is that it is often confusing (to me personally, anyway)to switch POV's so frequently; I often thought that a glossary of characters would have been useful. But you could chalk that up to early onset senility if it's convenient..One unmistakable theme in this book (that's hammered to the point of tedium) is that the USA is a proud and overreaching nation --basically, bullies on the world stage. In the space of the first half of the book, we (Northerners) already managed to display the worst sort of racism, condescension, and fascist attitudes that have (in our present-day reality) traditionally been attributed to the South. And is there any truth to that? Well, possibly. When you re-write history you can make any ""truth"" you want, but there's an undeniable authenticity to the racist tones of speech and thought uncovered in all the characters. It's perhaps a hallmark of their era, but highlighted and underscored more on the USA's side of things here. There are numerous hints throughout that the author apparently believes that, given the right circumstances, our country would have become an oppressive and genocidal tyrant to rival Nazi Germany; and he makes the case with logic and...glee, I do believe. Yes, there is a distinct element of revenge fantasy playing out in the narrative. Turtledove certainly enjoys subverting our established underdogs and winners, that much is certain.The narrative in HFR is looser and more fragmented than in the superior previous work Guns of the South, which is an outstanding example of the best of alternate historical fiction. Sidebars nowithstanding though, HFR is a solid piece of speculative history, written by somebody who obviously knows his subject well. In that sense, Turtledove proves himself to be a master of this era of American history: he plays with the possibilities and remixes them as a master chef might remix a favorite recipe to bring something new and delightful out of an old standby. It was a pleasure to observe how the nations collided, reacted, and mingled in this tale. This was what, in the end, elevated this book from three-star mediocrity to a four-star fandom. Well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LR1MICVD0R7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345406141#wasThisHelpful","R3LR1MICVD0R7W","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Last summer when my grandmother moved to a retirement facility, my family and I discovered hundreds of priceless family photographs being stored loose in one of the drawers at her old house. She had no album to take with her to her new home. The solution of course was for me to create a scrapbook for Oma so that she could enjoy her memories as well as share them with visitors.This K & Company album kit was the perfect answer to Oma's preference for pink and the retro look needed for an album that had most of its photos from the mid-20th Century. The papers are sweet, charming, and actually very simple in pattern, many with a '50s style. You do not have to use them for baby pages (although of course you can)! The front of the album cover was customized with letter stickers included in the kit to read ""Dot's Family"" and a b&w picture of Oma with her young family inserted into the photo frame. It was perfect, and the way the album went together did not look ""babyish"" at all but rather something straight out of the 1950s. The leftover baby-themed stickers and embellishments included in the kit were saved for an actual baby album.Everybody agreed that this scrapbook album was a great present for Oma's 89th birthday.Thank you K and Company for these great scrapbook album kits. If I had one complaint it's that I could have used more of the papers  -- you only included like 10 sheets in the kit-- I looked for them separately but they were nowhere to be found unless I wanted to buy another kit! I had to extend the album with papers matched as best I could with the kit papers, and it wasn't easy to find matches but in the end it worked out alright. Really, the coordinating papers should be available to buy separately.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL6DI87A1PKSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002OM5ZES#wasThisHelpful","RL6DI87A1PKSB","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have many K and Company albums and products already, and have been completely satisfied with them. So satisfied, that when I searched for a scrapbook album with a turquoise blue color accent and came up with this one, I put it in my cart without a second thought. I intended to purchase it the next day after I'd had more time to shop for a few other items to add to the order.So imagine my dismay when I logged in the next morning and the price had more than doubled overnight! Yes, it was an amazing coincidence that when I initially added the album to my shopping cart, it was 10 dollars and change, but in less than 24 hours the price had gone up to 20.60. I moved it into the Save for Later hoping this was a mistake that would be corrected.I have yet to move this item out of the Save for Later back into the cart. It has been sitting there for approximately 2 months as I wait for the powers that be to realize that they messed up and lower the price back. That has not happened. Meanwhile, I still would like to purchase this album but it is not available locally. So, I am in deadlock. I am certain now that this was a deliberate price increase triggered when I put the item into my cart -- somebody noticed that it was mistakenly priced and ""fixed"" it to the tune of double what it had been. This ""fix"" is all in the favor of the seller and against the customer, and it makes for lousy service policy. In a real-life retail situation, would K and Company want a customer to find an item with sale price, bring it to the register and be told ""sorry, that's not the real price, let's fix that and charge you double what you thought you'd be paying."" Of course the customer would not stand for it. In protest, I am refusing to move it into my cart for purchase until the situation is corrected with the price back down to ten dollars. Then and only then will I buy this album and update my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6I4520CYFQ0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003I2GEGG#wasThisHelpful","R6I4520CYFQ0M","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Big Book of Scrapbook Pages has one main thing going for it: lots of pictures of scrapbook pages done in the latest styles. This could be very inspirational if all you're looking for is trendy ideas for your next layout.However, very little other information is included next to each picture, aside from the manufacturer of the products. This can be daunting, especially for somebody without advanced scrapbooking skills; most of the layouts are done in very ""busy"" styles which include lots of elements, bits, and pieces and maybe only one or a few photos. Because of this, it is hard for me to decipher what elements are on each page and ""translate"" it to the order and techniques I'd need to duplicate the look. I am an intermediate scrapper who's been away from scrapbooking for a few years, and it isn't automatically obvious to me how to recreate these pages.So as a point of inspiration, TBBOSP is right on target, but I was hoping for more help from this book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6167G5EMS05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1599631334#wasThisHelpful","R1E6167G5EMS05","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up at my supermarket thinking the kids and I were in for a real treat; they'd had peppermint hot cocoa from a restaurant recently and were begging for more.You mix this stuff with one cup of hot milk and have to stir like mad for a long time to get it mixed in properly.

"Following the recipe on the package to a ""t"", I still managed to overbake this cake by about 15 minutes.

"I am well known in my family for my home made breads and baked goods (sorry I had to toot my own horn there). I used to think from-scratch was ALWAYS best. But even I can't top how delicious the pumpkin bread comes out when made with this kit. I took the sliced loaves of pumpkin bread to a school picnic and people were going back for seconds and thirds.Your kit basically has the can of pumpkin, the dry mix and the icing packet. Add your own (4)eggs, oil and water to the pumpkin, blend, then add in the dry mix and stir just until moistened. Pour in tins and bake. Easier and faster than measuring the dry mix ingredients out one by one in a scratch recipe.Hint1: use olive oil. It mades for a moist and dense bread and definitely smells better than anything made with corn oil.Hint2: butter the loaf tins generously. I think butter does the job better than nonstick spray...just a personal preference.Hint3: stir in the dry mix JUST until moistened. Overstirring toughens anything made with wheat flour. Do not try to ""work the lumps out"". They work out on their own in the baking process.This recipe made one 8X4 loaf plus three ""mini"" 5X3 loaves. You can get a bundt cake out of this or make other sized loaf combinations if you like. Probably even makes great muffins ( I don't have the back of the box to check on this right now).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ASIW97BNQOS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002O039DO#wasThisHelpful","R1ASIW97BNQOS7","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cake's style is the definition of quirky, and it hasn't changed at all from their first album: monotone-ish lead singer vox, acoustic and electric guitar, a small brass section and an enthusiastic drumbeat underpinning it all. There's a supplement of background chorus shouts every now and then, putting me in mind of a Punk influence. The lyrics are smart, more coffehouse-style poetry than anything else, and each track covers a wide variety of subjects from romantic musings to Austrian noblemen. The ironic served up with the sincere -- yep, that's Cake all right.Comfort Eagle has a few standout tracks and a lot of milder ones which grew on me. Short Skirt/Long Jacket is the big hit that first grabbed me, an upbeat tribute to the modern dream girl who is ""touring the facility and picking up slack"" while her nails ""shine like justice"" and she ""uses a machete to cut through red tape"". The title track Comfort Eagle is a strange compare/contrast mashup of religious cults, the music business, and television shopping channels--but it was absolutely useless to resist that beat, and I was chorusing along with it and stomping my heels in time on the second listen. I would have clapped my hands, too, if I hadn't been driving. Love You Madly is a bold declaration of love exactly as the title suggests, my third favorite track for its fast pace and tuneful sincerity. Subtler tracks such as Meanwhile, Rick James..., Shadow Stabbing, Arco Arena and Long Line of Cars took a few more listens as they were slower and more thoughtful, but still quite well-crafted. In a more mellow mood, those are my tracks of choice. Commissioning a Symphony in C is an unusual track about the patrons of the arts way back in the days of Mozart, nice enough but I never go out of my way to seek it out. The only track I can honestly report as an ""avoid"" is the first one, Opera Singer. Please don't let its bad placement in the lineup discourage you from the rest of this fun and intelligently made album!Consistency of style and great musicianship: if you have enjoyed any of Cake's radio hits in the past (Never There, Going the Distance), you will know exactly what you're in for when buying Comfort Eagle. This album is IMO their overall best effort to date, showcasing the band's personality and independant flavor to perfection. Do try!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RROCJTVE00214/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005MCW5#wasThisHelpful","RROCJTVE00214","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself; we're only on March 25, and already I have to review this book. It was just impossible to wait until we'd finished out the entire yearJ.Being a christian is hard even before you even consider God's command that we must also raise our children in the ways of the Lord and teach them the scriptures. It would be easy to just put that job off on the Sunday school teachers (and much of the time, that's exactly what I did), but is that really *their* job? Traditionally, my family not only went to church on Sundays but also Wednesday nights and we read from the bible, although not every night. That was how I grew up learning about the bible, but I confess, it seemed like a dry and dull way. My grandmother also had a set of vinyl records with bible stories and picture books to accompany them (I don't remember the titles) -- now that was more interesting, and stuck with me more as I grew and remembered the beautiful illustrations.  So now as a parent, that seems more intuitively the ideal way to bring the bible alive for my own boys.The One Year Bible for Children is nicely geared toward children of about elementary school age as a daily ""devotional"" style read-aloud.  It begins on January 1 with the Genesis creation story and follows approximately along the time line through the Old and New Testaments until the end of the year. Flipping through, I would say that about half of the daily selections have illustrations -- but they're truly top quality illustrations, nothing cartoon-y or ""babyish"" about them (please excuse me, those are pet peeves of mine..I believe children's books should be every bit as well-illustrated and lovely as anything an adult would read that has illustrations). The text is a simplified version of the more familiar bible stories, which seem to be selected for being interesting and action-oriented from a kids point of view, and they are told in a language that paraphrases to a child's level of understanding, but never patronizes them. Each ""day"" ranges in length from one quarter page to a full page of text. At the bottom of each selection, there are questions that parents can use to help the children recall details of the story and encourage them to analyze and apply the morals and principles to their own lives. My 6- and 10-year-olds never stall or complain when ""story time"" comes every night.To give you a taste of this book: As of this day in March 25 the book has progressed to Joshua 1-2, ""Spies Visit Jericho"", with a small box illustration in the bottom corner page. Tomorrow's has ""Crossing the Jordan River"" with a two-page spread and a colorful, panoramic picture taking up the entire bottom half. An excerpt reads: ""Joshua gave orders, too. ""Each of you must make yourself clean on the outside to show that your heart is pure and clean on the inside,"" he said. ""Tomorrow you will see a miracle"". The next morning Joshua gave orders to the priests. ""Take the Ark and lead us across the river"", he said.  So the procession started.""  Skipping ahead to the New Testament, September 2nd, Jesus Stops a Storm, the entire two page spread is the picture of the disciples and Jesus in the boat with the text printed over it: ""Jesus spoke to the wind and the waves. ""Be quiet!"" he said. The wind and waves died down quickly. Suddenly everything was calm and still. ""Why were you so afraid?"" he asked the disciples. ""Don't you believe in me?""Fabulous!Yes of course attending Sunday school and memorizing verses is indispensable in our children's education. Why not also make it seem real and alive to them?  I will be giving this book to many other children as birthday and Christmas gifts -- what a great way for them to see bible history!Andrea, aka Merribelle","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DYK94G9194I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0842373551#wasThisHelpful","R26DYK94G9194I","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a ghost story, but not a horror story.  You may get chills reading it, but not always from ""the creeps"". On the other hand, you may finish it wondering just what the heck you just read. I submit to you All Hallows' Eve-- definitely not for everybody.All Hallows' Eve is Charles Williams' last novel, written and set in WW2 England. It starts shortly after the tragic deaths of two women friends, Evalyn and Lester, in a bizarre collision, and neither is aware at first that they have died. They wander a weirdly deserted London separately for a brief time before meeting up, which gives the author an opportunity to focus on Lester's inner spiritual journey as she slowly confronts some unattractive truths about herself and her important relationships with her husband and her friends. In a separate but intersecting storyarc, Lester's surviving husband and his artist friend cross paths with a popular cult leader, Simon Le Clerc. This disturbing figure has a hidden past that is revealed only to us, the readers, as the plot unfolds.  He is shaping up to be something not unlike an antichrist of sorts who is conducting covert, occultic experiments on the artist's love interest, Betty Wallingford, who is the daughter of one of Le Clerc's most devoted followers.Williams makes use of Betty's nighttime passages to scratch the surface of an alternate universe which Evelyn, Lester and (presumably) other newly-deceased inhabit. It is simply described as the City, and although it bears a surface resemblance to London, it is more of an infrastructure to London, or perhaps the Platonic Ideal of London...possibly something more. Many things in this realm tantalize us with glimpses of hidden spiritual truths, and time itself seems to have no linear requirement; past, present and future flashbacks occur without regard to conventional order.  I was left with the sense that I would have liked to discover more about this City, and as this is my first Williams novel, who knows..he may indeed refer to it in his other stories.I'm not sure what sort of person would be best prepared to read this final Charles Williams novel. The author (an Anglican, or so I've read) clearly gives his audience much credit, as he allows us to draw our own conclusions about either the allegorical or the literal truths he dallies with along the storyline; he never force-feeds or ""preaches"". Somebody moderately educated in various religious history and/or theology would recognize a lot of the hints and references Williams makes along the way to telling his story. I wouldn't say that you must be a Christian to appreciate it, but it might help. On the other hand, I would only recommend this book to a mature Christian who has some direct study of the bible under his belt and yet a non-legalistic attitude toward their christian fiction. Certainly the reader would benefit from an ability to appreciate mysticism.All Hallows' Eve was recommended to me by A Reader's Delight, which appeals to readers who crave rare literary treasures from various genres. Williams' writing style is rich and many-layered, so that I may have to read All Hallows' Eve several times to extract everything I should from it in time. Take that under advisement, and if the shoe fits, do try.-Andrea, aka Merribelle","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S6Q97NWP800D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1573831107#wasThisHelpful","R2S6Q97NWP800D","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1. This book is definitely intermediate level or above. Having learned some stumpwork and ribbon embroidery myself, I think of my skills as intermediate and I would never give this to a beginner as a learning tool. Although the author does explain the stitches and techniques, it is done in a very condensed way that could be confusing for first-timers. There are few how-to illustrations here compared to beginner's books.2. In order to complete the embroidery sampler as pictured (the whole book is a panel-by-panel sampler project, by the way), you need to go on the author's Web site and order her pre-printed cotton fabric to embroider and stump on top of. In theory one could trace the design in the book, but that would leave out the subtle colors and shading that give this piece its extraordinary colorful, dimensional quality. Apparently, all of Di van Niekerk's books need their accompanying printed fabrics, and this one is about 16 American dollars. Why this is never mentioned either on the online page or on the book's cover is a mystery to me.3. The threads and silk ribbons that you will need for Di's projects are brand names that can not easily be found outside of South Africa (the author lives in Cape Town). You can order these from her Web site as well. Of course you could use YLI or other brands more available in America, but you'd have to guess to match the colors.  I'd feel more comfortable using the author's recommended brands and colors.A Perfect World in Ribbon Embroidery and Stumpwork is simply exquisite. It features high-quality, lovely, original designs. The finished effect of combining ribbon embroidery and stumpwork takes my breath away, and Di van Niekerk deserves credit as a pioneer of sorts in the world of embroidery. She does indeed show a few techniques that I have never seen before.Be prepared to do some online shopping first, and you will be able to make a sampler project that will be the envy of all your embroidering friends.-Andrea, aka Merribelle","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BJ0D962FVIWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844482316#wasThisHelpful","R2BJ0D962FVIWR","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If the Harry Potter books are the most popular books of this generation, then the Nancy Drew books were the hits of the 1930s. Remarkably, how every decade since then, both girls and boys have rediscovered Nancy Drew and made her adventures their own. This is how you can tell the true classics apart from the pretenders.Like most of the `80s kids, I had never realized that the escapades of my favorite childhood heroine had ever been made into movies. It took a badly done remake in 2007 for somebody to realize that money could be made from the generations of fans who have adored the real Nancy Drew; and so these four films were released on DVD as part of a cross-promotional marketing tactic. Well lucky for us, anyhow!Starting with Nancy Drew, Detective and progressing to the Hidden Staircase, we get four fun mysteries.  Detective introduces Nancy and shows how she got started sleuthing when a wealthy elderly woman disappears mysteriously.  Reporter is about Nancy and Ted's investigation into a murder, which kicks off when Nancy is convinced that the accused woman is innocent. Troubleshooter follows Nancy and her dad to a vacation at Sylvan Lake where they uncover clues to exonerate a family friend who has been charged with the murder of a local businessman. Hidden Staircase is the most exciting mystery, in which Nancy and Ted find an underground tunnel in the basement of a ""haunted"" mansion. I regret that I no longer have a sharp memory for the specifics of the books' plots, so I cannot compare them to these movies with any accuracy, but their spirit is well kept as I remember them.*This* is the Nancy Drew I remembered from those books read so long ago: feisty, charismatic, energetic and unstoppable. Bonita Granville's Nancy is also impossibly cute, which is very much in keeping with the style of those times. The actor who played Ted Nickerson is the perfect sidekick, reluctant with just a touch of teenage dorkiness. I enjoyed their performance, if it was a bit over-the-top acting by today's standards.In my opinion, this Nancy Drew DVD would be enjoyed most by people who have read the books and who like nostalgic black and white films. It's certainly a wholesome and perhaps somewhat corny look back at the 1930s ideal of an independent, intelligent young lady.-Andrea, aka merribelle","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R212KI99HU0WRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVL1YU#wasThisHelpful","R212KI99HU0WRX","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is almost two books in one: the first half is a superb, thorough instructional manual of stumpwork embroidery techniques; the second half, a detailed collection of stumpwork projects from designers which have been featured in Inspirations magazine, arguably the most prestigious embroidery publication in the world. You really get the A to Z!Despite the carefully photographed, step-by-step technique section, I would rate A-Z of Stumpwork as a book for the intermediate stumper. True, it is published in a spiral-bound format, which in my opinion is invaluable for a working reference guide of any kind. But even experienced stitchers do forget stitches from time to time. And let us not overlook the elegant, gorgeous designs that are laid out for us to duplicate, designs from the likes of Anna Scott, Jan Kerton, Wendy Innes and Janet Luce. Their elaborate embroideries are given complete materials' lists and instructions, but not illustrated step by step.Everything in the A-Z series is so beautifully photographed, so carefully organized and detailed, and so charmingly illustrated with whimsical prints and retro-Victorian artwork, that of course I have to award A-Z of Stumpwork five stars. I recommend that a beginner get a copy of Kay Dennis' Beginner's Guide to Stumpwork to get started and this lovely A-Z reference to use and keep for a lifetime of usefulness and inspiration.-Andrea, aka Merribelle","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYYCTQNVFJU1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975092057#wasThisHelpful","RYYCTQNVFJU1I","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I have stated elsewhere, there are three things I look for in an instructional embroidery book:1. The book must not be so thick that it is intimidating to beginners.2. Embroidery instructions are best if they are illustrated each step of the way; the higher the quality of the illustrations, the better a beginner will be able to learn.3. Projects must be simple and quick to complete.Needlelace and Stumpwork by Loretta Holzberger certainly starts off well.  The book is a nice modest size for students to get into (pass on point #1). The basics are explained logically and in a simple enough manner. However, my impression of its quality was marred early on when I noticed that except for a few color plates in the center of the book, it was entirely printed in black and white and on relatively cheap stock. The illustrations were relatively sparse, simply hand drawn, and slightly amateurish compared to the standards I've come to expect from other embroidering books printed in the last 15 years or so. Several of the photographed samples were fuzzy and unclear. In short, corners were cut, and for the price I expected better. My second point was not successfully honored.On the positive side, the projects are indeed simple and beginner appropriate (pass on point #3).  I thought the butterflies pictured on the cover (the reason I bought this book to begin with) were fun and quick. With careful attention, it is possible for students to learn beginning level needlelace and stumpwork methods from this book; it does its job in the end.-Andrea, aka merribelle","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D85NDYH4Q4TK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0967945402#wasThisHelpful","R1D85NDYH4Q4TK","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not even scratched the surface of this new stumpwork hobby, but I have tried learning a lot of new embroidery techniques over the last 10 years. If I have come away with anything from the experience it's how to spot a good beginner's book:).Students want to feel encouraged to try. Three things are important:1. The book must not be so thick that it's overwhelming.2. Embroidery instructions are better if there are photos and/or illustrations for every step of the process. The higher their quality, the better a newbie will be able to follow and duplicate techniques (hint: look for full color!).3. Projects should be basic and quick to complete.Kay Dennis has hit the nail on the head with all of these points. The Beginner's Guide to Stumpwork covers just enough technique to give the reader a feel for the craft, really showing just a few of the most common stitches and their variations to get somebody started stumping and needlelacing. The sample projects are quite simple, even a bit primitive in my opinion, but they are presented perfectly for learning and building confidence.Once you gain some basic practice from this book, I would recommend moving on to the Complete Book of  Stumpwork Embroidery by Jane Nicholas for elegant, inspirational designs and a nice bit of background on the history of stumping.-Andrea, aka merribelle","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DWD1HCY30GNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0855328703#wasThisHelpful","R1DWD1HCY30GNU","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom line, you buy one of these mainly to make pancakes.  The Anolon Double Burner Griddle is better than a traditional frying pan for pancakes because you can fit more on it at one time, which means less time in the kitchen and more time eating those tasty little crumpets while they're still hot. The kids also get less whiny when you can serve them all at once instead of doling out a few pancakes here and there or worse, serving them all at once when they've gone cold.Turns out, it's also good at French toast, eggs, bacon, quesadillas and grilled cheese sandwiches. Added bonus: you only have to add butter or oil if you like the flavor, because after owning and using this thing for two months, I have to admit, it truly deserves to be called nonstick (unlike so many ""nonsticks"" that have disappointed me after the first few uses).Some might point out that at 10 inches wide, this griddle is too narrow to fit all their breakfast items at once. Well get two, they're a slim profile and lightweight and at about fifteen bucks less than the Circulon, you can probably afford it.My 22-year-old recipe for Frickin' Fantastic Pancakes:1 cup Buttermilk, 1 cup flour, 1 egg, 2 Tablespoons oil, 1 Tablespoon sugar, 1 tsp. baking powder,  tsp. baking soda, ½ tsp. salt.Heat your griddle to med-low. Mix ingredients in a large bowl with a balloon whisk until just a few lumps remain (no overworking allowed). Pour on the griddle (you know what size you like) and watch for the bubbles in the center of your pancakes to signal it's time to turn.

"I feel a connection with David Masumoto. Not that I've met him or anything - in fact, there's a good chance I never will (although I keep hoping that one summer day I can make it over to his farm to pick peaches). No, this feeling is based on an impression that we have both fought the same fight over different things, for the same reasons. It is also because he writes so poignantly about a landscape I grew up in.  Mr. Masumoto is an organic farmer in the valley of California, and his story is becoming more and more familiar to me as I see this way of life disappearing across the country.A third generation Japanese American peach and grape farmer, David Masumoto inherited the family orchard from his father. He also had the heritage of his childhood memories of how that particular peach variety, Sun Crest, tasted and ran with juice unlike the pretty red baseballs that have passed for today's supermarket peach varieties.  Mr. M wanted to show the world how delightful an old-fashioned peach could be. When he took over his father's farm, he resolved to not only continue growing his Sun Crests, but to do it organically. This would prove challenging in our day and age of cheap, quick fixes; moreover, it would test his strongly felt ideals.  The land needed to heal and replenish itself after years of chemical fertilizers and toxic pest control methods. Masumoto had to take his example from research on other organic farming practices, planting wildflowers to encourage beneficial insect life and sowing ""green manure"" crops to act as natural mulch and compost. All this took time, patience, and faith that his hard work would eventually pay off.Epitaph for a Peach is rich in sensory descriptions, philosophy, and nostalgic flashbacks. It is a picture of the way a farmer's life is connected to the seasons, capricious weather patterns, and changing market conditions. Not incidentally, Masumoto also teaches about the obscure history of Japanese farmers in the Valley - something that even I, native to Fresno, had little idea of. Reading this book was a slow, thoughtful experience much in the same manner that one slows down to savor a rich fruit.

"At some point after you've sealed your umpteenth jar of strawberry preserves and peach jam, you find yourself asking, Is this as exciting as it gets? Really, your sister and office mates are probably (secretly of course) just as bored with your yearly batches of apple jelly as you are. To keep motivated every harvest time, you repeat to yourself over and over, like a mantra: Made with real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup...Well imagine their eyes popping out of their heads when you triumphantly hand them your Pear and Ginger Marmalade, Green Tomato Relish, and Plum and Raisin Chutney!When the title of a cookbook claims the status of Art, expect that it contains inventive, quirky and elegant combinations in addition to the more pedestrian basics.  Also, assume that it was not meant for rank beginners any more than it was written by a rank beginner. Jan Berry, the author of Art of  Preserving has decades of experience with preserving a wide range of fruits and vegetables, and while she discusses the basic methods in a short preface chapter, it's barely sketched. But more on that in a moment.In the ten years that I have owned my copy of Art of Preserving, I have tried perhaps a dozen of the 300 or so recipes in this book.  It's all I have the nerve, resources or the gourmet gumption, to have tried. From this book I have produced Blood Orange Pommander Brandy, Orange Wine, Lemon Oil, Candied Citrus peel, Blueberry Jam, Apple and Geranium Jelly, Figs in Brandy, Red Bell Pepper Jelly, herb-infused vinegars and sugars, Preserved Ginger, and Banana Jam. I am eager to try several more as time and ingredient availability permit, such as Pumpkin and Rosemary Jam  and Melon Jelly. Ah, for an acre of garden space to grow the stuff and a few months every year to harvest and preserve it all! That would definitely be somewhere in my heaven.In a way, the Art of Preserving is like a look back to pre-industrial times. The author apparently grew up in the Outback under poor circumstances.  She had to learn to make do and be very careful with her resources, so I believe that is why none of her recipes here list commercial pectin. Instead, the jams and jellies are set with the natural pectins in apples, quinces, citrus seeds, etc. Some of them require elaborate preparations of more than one day's time to draw the juices out through jelly bags, or marinate ingredients to perfection. In a nutshell, Jan Berry's preserving style is not for those looking for instant gratification.As to Jan Berry's recommended methods for sealing up jars: waxed paper and a lid. If you want to be decorative, she suggests additionally covering the tops with paper and twine or ribbon. I'm the first to admire the simple rustic charm in this style, but I can rarely use it as I like to ship my jams and jellies as gifts and enter them in fair contests now and then; the official rules prohibit anything but hot water-bath canning methods, sealing lid and screw-rings only. In order to translate her sealing instructions for modern times, it might take a bit of know-how from a more intermediate canner. See what I mean about this book not catering to complete amateurs?Finally, the photographs are works of art in themselves.  Truthfully, TAOP is one of the best-photographed cookbooks I have ever seen, and thankfully, a little more than half of the recipes are displayed in these artfully arranged shots. I have never seen such a complete and extensive collection of offbeat jam, jelly, chutney and etc. recipes in one place, as in The Art of Preserving. It is certainly a must for preservers who love to gift their jars.This book, sadly out of print for several years now, is well worth the time and effort to search out if you enjoy preserving above and beyond its original, practical purpose.-Andrea, aka Merribelle","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2007","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARIO6NMCVF3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0091854474#wasThisHelpful","RARIO6NMCVF3J","A3ATTCCO32ZXET","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ATTCCO32ZXET?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"On the one hand, I loved this book. It was light and frothy and you could buzz right through it in one sitting. However, there is the rub. One of the best selling Bible study aids of all time is the meaty ""Imitation of Christ""--in which almost every sentence should be reflected on and digested; in comparison, you finish this book filling joyous and uplifted, but then stop to think--""what did I really learn that will change me going forward""--this book pales in comparison. Yes, it has the obligatory end-of-chapter Q&A's and discussion group prompts, but somehow, it still winds up more on the ""cotton candy"" pile than ""meat and potatoes"" pile..Would I rec it? Absolutely! Loved it. Learned from it. Laughed out loud.Would I buy it? $10 is pushing the envelope for such a short read, but definitely for $4.99 or less.Would I reread it? Yes.

"To be fair, the first half of the book is absolutely excellent: riveting, well-paced, lots of twists and turns. Couldn't believe it was on the Kindle free list. The two main characters (Vince and Laura) are well drawn, three-D characters, and the reader will deeply care what happens to them. The author does a fine job of fleshing out supporting characters and not simply making them ""plot devices."" At least three of them have weaved a fairly tangled web of their life, and the author knits all of these pieces together seamlessly. There are enough unexpected plot changes (like good key changes in music) that keep the reader riveted to the page and at the edge of their proverbial seat..But then comes the second half, where we get ""more is better."" There can only be so many people who get their head's bashed in, or then it becomes just another ""basher"" book. Almost everyone who dies in this book gets their head bashed: poker, walking stick, pick ax, etc. Since it's not always the same character doing the bashing (and since this is such a messy way to kill someone), it's unclear why this gratuitous choice is made over and over again--it begins to be salacious. However, far worse than this is the implausible ending.  It is one thing to have a ""dark horse"" candidate be revealed as the murderer/murderess at the end of a mystery. It's another thing to have that person be completely out of character with anything that has gone before in their story arc. Imagine ""Casablanca"" if Elsa had decided to turn in Rick and her husband to the Nazis before she got on the plane--sure, it's an unexpected plot twist, but it doesn't fit. If you twist just for the sake of twisting, something will break, and that's what happens here..Would I rec it? YesWould I buy it? YesWould I read other books by this author?

"That should be the title of Ms. Fluke's next book. Can someone please tell me why we are still reading these? Thank God my library no has OneClick, so I can now just check them out electronically for free and listen to them on my laptop. I am not spending another penny on this fodder. I agree, at the point, Ms. Fluke is just ""phoning in"" these books, so to speak. Who can really churn out a book every other month if they are trying to write something worthwhile. She's got a great franchise, but she's killing it with ""overexposure."" At this point, it's like looking at a train wreck that you just can't look away from. I haven't read every book in the series like some loyal readers, but even I've had enough of Hannah's ""stuck in the doldrums"" life. I agree with many of the reviewers who have begged Ms. Fluke to wrap up the series. All good things have to come to an end--even Seinfeld pulled the plug after nine years, and it still had a lot of gas left in the tank, but he wanted to go out on top.

"I wanted to like this book; I really did. I love Christ on many levels, but especially as an entity that walked the face of the Earth and did it with such grace, control, and boundless love. I love the succinctness of Christ. How in the world can someone come up with such amazing guiding principles: ""Love your neighbor as yourself."" Five words! Phenomenal! The efficiency and effectiveness of the gospel parables are mind boggling. We (and by this I mean 20th and 21st century humans) get so gummed up in splitting biblical, spiritual, moral, and societal hairs, that we forget (often) the profoundness of many of the quotes that are attributed to Christ. Does it matter if he uttered them all or not? Does it matter if the Bible came down to us with 100% fidelity or a little less? Just as Shakespeare transcended his milieu as did Bach to emerge out of almost nowhere to write words and music that were so far advanced for their time that all one can do is shake one's head and drop one's jaw in wonder. Of course, Christ is the ultimate jaw-dropper because he was like a meteor striking the Earth with amazing spiritual clarity that is seen once a millennium or so. Having said the above, the author challenges this paradigm to say that Christ's missing years (from ages twelve to thirty) were spent in India and Asia learning teachings of the Buddha. Great story line for a book if developed properly; however, there are issues:.(Too Preachy) First, THIS BOOK IS TOO PREACHY (not evangelical preachy, but preachy just the same). Buddhists and ""spiritual people"" are good, but fundamentalists are dogmatic and bad. Yawn. Whether or not we always like or respect their position, there certainly are wonderful people who are evangelicals. The type of people who don't abort a child with Down's Syndrome or other disease and actually take wonderful care of them all their lives. (Don't see many secularists pulling that trick). OK, they can be annoying too with their positioning on ""gays,"" and other narrow-minded stances, but they are not all bad. So, having every evangelical in the book being either a hypocrite or an opportunist is annoying..(Derivative) Second, the evangelical ""villain"" who is trying to keep the Issa Codex from becoming public knowledge because it would undermine Christianity is a virtual clone of the nut case from DaVinci code: same ""pervert who hates himself because he can't control his sexual desires,"" same ""brainwashed by religion when he was young and now he wants to be a martyr."" It's annoying..(Lecturing) Third, there is WAY too much lecturing on Buddhism especially, and in glowing terms that seem to imply that the author feels this way is the best choice to enlightenment. That's fine, but don't pretend to be ecumenical if the real agenda is to promote one philosophy over another. Because the author spends so much of the book (40%) ""teaching"" us about different religions, it distracts from the plot. If the reader has what they feel is enough familiarity with these different religions, the lecturing is just annoying. If I wanted to read a non-fiction book about ""What is Islam?"" that's what I would be doing..(Phony Romance) Forth, the ""romance"" between Grant and Kristen is pretty lame. There is a scene after he has a ""debate"" with an evangelical who accuses him of academic plagiarism. He is embarrassed by this, and apparently ""the media"" pounce on the story and further run him down. Somehow, in the midst of all this scandal, where his whole career could be ruined, he finds the energy and interest to go to his girlfriend's apt. and have a ""make out"" session, which we are told lasts for thirty minutes (I guess that's so we know that Mr. Sensitive Post-doc Man knows how to give foreplay.) Anyway, after this scene, where we are told ""pelvises were grinding"" (yikes!), but she decides that she doesn't want to ""do it."" Mr. Sensitive Post-Doc tells her, ""That's OK. We don't need to go there."" Really? Isn't that a little forced? You mean to tell me that Mr. Post-Doc doesn't need the release that would come with sex after such a horrendous day? He's just going to be Mr. Understanding and not even walk out in a huff? Serves no purpose and doesn't seem realistic. For that matter, the whole ""romance"" seems forced and not at all interesting..(Poorly Paced) Fifth, some of the most ""revelatory"" parts of the book take place over Indian food. This totally deflates their importance. In the DaVinci Code, Robert Langdon was revealing things to his side-kick during tense situations, where the insights really mattered. In many of the scenes in this book, the facts just ""spill out,"" but there is no ""weight"" attached to them..OK, having said all the above, here are the good parts: (1) Book is highly readable. I'm not saying it's at the level of ""I can't put it down,"" however, the reader does want to know what happens next. (2) The ""on location"" scenes are good, and the author clearly has a good knowledge of the areas and locales in which he sets parts of the book. (3) The basic premise that Christ might have gone to Asia and India is intriguing, and although it could have been developed with more suspense and intrigue, it is--a priori--interesting..Would I recommend it? YesWould I read it while it's discounted to $1.99? YesIs it a MUST READ? NoIs it logical with good grammar? YesHope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1393PH7I101EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OA64UW#wasThisHelpful","R1393PH7I101EE","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really think if the artwork hadn't been so wonderful on the cover, the book wouldn't seem half so good. The very best part of the book, and the only think that salvages it from absolute chic-lit fotter, is that every chapter starts out with an excerpt of the protagonist's (Sophy's) great-great-etc-relative, Alys, who may or may not be a witch. These diary tidbits are easily the most interesting part of the book. We slowly find out more about Alys, but never really enough--pity, since she's the most interesting character in the book. She has recipes for various cures, recipes, and details about various plants and flowers..As for the actual story--yawn (sorry). It doesn't have an interesting POV, nor does it have any interesting history (which is a wasted opportunity since Alys lives in the 1500s. The author could have fleshed out something about the world that Alys lived in if she didn't want to build a full character and plot around her. Sophy inherits a fabulous, decaying house, and ""bonds"" with it when she goes there to investigate. That's fine, but not terribly novel, since many of us have a ""love at first sight"" feeling for the home we buy. There is an obligatory fake suitor (who can be spotted a mile away--very one dimensional character...bad, bad, bad). There is the friendly assortment of loyal ""servants"" who want nothing more than to restore the house to its former glory. There is the feminist ""women can do anything"" theme that also rings cliche and improbably. There is the dark horse suitor that hooks up with Sophy at the end so they can live ""happily ever after,"" all with the blessings of Alys, who Sophy just knows is pleased by all that has transpired..As many other reviewers have already mentioned, the book is well-written on a sentence by sentence basis, so it flows well. This is true even if neither the characters nor the plot is particularly engaging. Now that I've finished the book, I have to say that the plot really goes down the drain at the end. Everything is so predictable that it's almost unbearable. On the other hand, if you can buy it for a few dollars and are looking for a modestly anglophile read, you could give this a try.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R46TVIQY1QH08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UZ5JI6#wasThisHelpful","R46TVIQY1QH08","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book. It is a nice, old-fashioned, ""Root for the Good Guy, Hiss at his Evil Wife"" story. I don't want to give too much away, but the husband is a Scot who comes to America seeking a little adventure and to expand his fortune. His wife thinks Americans are uncouth (well, ain't we :) and wants nothing but to convince him to return to Europe. He has firmly planted his stake in the ground here, and won't be moved. She is conniving, which makes the story enjoyable (few thinks better than seeing a wicked wealth spoiled diva get her comeuppance!)

"Very much enjoyed this book. It is a unique blend of history, romance, and ""coming of age"" story. If you like the Bible, that's an added bonus as the author weaves in passages with the narrative; if you don't, it doesn't ruin the story either because the author isn't beating readers over the head with verses, just sprinkling them throughout like a nice seasoning. It's enjoyable to watch the story come together, and the characters grow from what they've experienced. There are some unexpected twists which keeps one reading. Well written, flows easily, believable, and enjoyable.

"This book is dreadful. There, I've said it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's ""clean"" and ""sex-free.""  Can't imagine who is giving it 4 and 5 stars unless the author has a network of friends and fellow writers who are propping her up. Don't take my word for it though, let me share with you a sample of said dredge:.""Dr MacClueless was at the hospital doing a post-op clinic when I arrived. I kid you not, that was his name. I wasn't too happy about a doctor with that name operating on my eye...."".Yikes! I'm not sure if the author thinks she's being clever by doing a ""send up"" of Dr. McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy, but there's nothing clever or tongue-in-cheek about the way she develops the Dr. MacClueless ""joke."" Once you have to explain a joke, you know it wasn't funny. Cut your losses and move on. Then, on the very same page, she continues with this twaddle:.""I grabbed a coffee from the waiting room vending machine and sipped. Yuck. It tasted like it had been sitting there for about a hundred years. (Is this really the most clever analogy she could invent? Writers have been bemoaning bad coffee in detective novels ever since the genre was invented, surely, there is something better to be written. Perhaps, ""if I had scooped a cupful of the nearest mud puddle it would have tasted better,""--just sayin')..She continues: Could you get Legionnaires' disease from stagnant coffee? I didn't fancy risking it, so since the brown sludge didn't pass the Amber Fox (why is she referring to herself in the third person?) taste test, I binned it and stared at the ""healthy eating"" poster on the wall instead. I knew all about the advantages of eating five portions of fruit and veg (sic) a day, but I had trouble with the actual eating part."".So, you've been warned. If you can in any way embrace that kind of abysmal dialogue, have at it. The protagonist is a poor man's Stephanie Plum, the writing is awful, and the plot is inane.

"Half way through and I will say this is a very good book, especially for a freebie. Quick Review? ""Reads like a poor man's Agatha Christie,"" which is still high praise indeed. The detective (Henry Grave), if not quiet a three-dimensional character, has a unique m.o. and some moxie, which is essential in a detective. The writing is fairly clever, and there is a lot of self-deprecating humor in the book, which is funny when you realize that he's not really the old fart he claims to be (a la Columbo ""crazy""). The supporting characters all have a purpose and are crisply and distinctly drawn (now that I'm finished, I take this back...supporting characters are barely 2-D, and add little to the story...predictable). The plot moves forward at an appropriate pace (until the middle of the book, when it just stalls. Book really tanks after that. Let these people off the damn boat for a minute. Boat docs in several ports, but Henry stays on board first because he gets stabbed, and then to continue the ""investigation."" I say: ""Get off the ship and go have some fun, or an adventure. 2nd half of the book is monotonous). There are enough details of the people and places to keep all of the back stories interesting and relevant. So far, I really like this book. (Obviously I changed my mind on the last two statements.

"As those of you who read my reviews know, I have been very hard on Stephanie Bond. Many of her books are so predictable I could fall asleep while Kindle was reading to me, wake up twenty minutes later, and the book would be exactly where I expected it to be. However, with each story her writing seems to get better and better. When I first started listening to this--partially based on the writing and partially based on the subject matter--I thought I was reading a new series by J.E. It was THAT good! Ms. Bond now uses supporting characters to the plot's advantage, instead of as ""window dressing."" The dynamic between the sisters is good and believable. She actually allows the reader to stay in the dark while she's weaving the plot instead of tipping her hand as she did in her earlier novels. There are little secrets that emerge about both of the sisters' husbands near the end of the book that keep the reader guessing. It is fun and a little frothy, and could certainly make for a good series (in fact, isn't this one of Sandra Bullock's favorite comedy themes--the ""girl buddy"" detective: Ms. Congeniality and ""The Heat"")..On the other hand, there is certainly still room for improvement. Bond could spend more time describing the scenery and surroundings for various scenes, which would make the story come to life and allow the reader to feel they are ""inside"" the story instead of clearly just reading a book. The male (future) love interests for the grieving widow is very thinly drawn, as is the old college flame of the other sister. The clothes, meals, hotel rooms, house decor, etc., is not fleshed out at all, other than one or two adjectives: messy and chaotic or plush and heavenly. I know Ms. Bond churns out a novel or two a year, but now that she is graduating to the big leagues, she should take time to describe what the reader should be seeing in their mind's eye like the ""big girls"" do..Would I rec it? YesWould I reread it in a year or two? YesWould I watch the series? Only if it had top shelf actorsWould I pay for it?

At that time, it was a fresh breeze in the romcom world, and gave us less than perfect (or more than size 2) women some hope that we too might one day find our own ""Mr. Darcy,"" (both, with a bit of irony, played by the yummy and multi-talented Colin Firth). But alas, in this brave, new, ""super-sized"" world in which we now live, the ""solid"" woman has gone from a size 8 or so to a stolid size 16! (And at 5' 5"", that's clinically obese!) It is fine for all of the ladies of ""The View"" and other such estrogen-fests to proclaim that women have worth regardless of their size; I'll broach no argument here. However, irrespective of whatever fantasy world this author, her protagonist, and all other size 16+ women want to live in, there are a plethora of health issues that start to kick in once the BMI > 30: diabetes, stroke, heart disease, heart attack, etc., to name a few. So the fact that the author made her ""heroine"" an unabashedly proud size 16 is untenable. It's also troublesome that while the heroine is free to be 180 pounds, her male lead--OMG!--has washboard abs, broad shoulders, and a tiny waist. To this I cry ""foul""! What's good for the gander is good for the goose!.Sadly, we are given no real reason why this gorgeous east Indian hunk falls for Ms. Chunkster, except that ""Punjabi woman are curvy,"" so apparently that's what he's used to. Then there is the silly plot where said hunk, who is a fashion designer, is suppose to be gay. Obviously he's not, or there would be no book, but somehow the author, instead of having fun with this ruse, actually treats it as if we are gullible enough to believe it--as if?! It might be plausible if there were other men in the book vying for chubby's attentions, but since he's the only male lead, we know he can't be gay. So the reader is left to plow through the book knowing darn well that they're going to wind up together from the moment they meet. Lastly, there is this silly sub-plot where the heroine spent a year in India, and somehow (magically?) became fluent in Hindi--a very difficult language to learn in a year for an English speaker. Then, without showing us why, we are told that Delhi, ""with all its bustle, is the only place this southern born, New York transplant, has ever felt at home."" Now this could be endearing if we were ever SHOWN why, but the author is too lazy to write any flashbacks or scenes of the heroine in India; no, instead all we get is the fact that she ""doesn't want to speak about it because she doesn't want to act like a 'know-it-all' in front of Daniel (the male lead)--yawn."" If you are going to write about an American who considers India her home, you have to provide some rationale for it all else what's the point? Exactly..The book is readable, the ending is unbelievable, but the writing is cheerful and almost clever. There are some witty similes and analogies (not Oscar Wilde, mind you, but better than average) to keep the story (which is pretty thin) moving along. Sorry..Would I pay for it? NoWould I rec it? Only to die-hard ""The Devil Wears Prada"" fans who are looking for anything to read set in the fashion industry.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M3DQZ8ANPDBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D51AOXO#wasThisHelpful","R3M3DQZ8ANPDBQ","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I understand that many good stories are reworkings of other great stories. How many times has the Cinderella story been told and retold? But there has to be a reason for retelling it with new twists or a modern spin or why retell it? So it is with ""Legally Wed."".First of all, it latches on to the ""marry me so I don't get deported"" genre, which was already done to perfection in ""The Proposal."" If you're going to mess with perfection, you better expect tomatoes to fly!.Second, if you're going to do a ""deportation"" story line, at least mention the deportation throughout the book. Nowhere in the book are there any ""funny scenes"" with the deportation officer where they try to pretend they know things about each other that the other than has to pretend is true by doing something inane to ""prove"" the other spouse's lie..Third, if you're going to write a love story, give us a plausible reason why the two characters who are ""thrown"" together might possibly fall in love. The whole book is a very lame love story with Mia, the female lead, a 34/29 year old (the author can't decide which) who's not worried that she's not married even though she wants to start a family b/c she's a ""career woman""; then there's Max (how cute, Mia and Max) who is (you won't believe this!) ""the most gorgeous man she's ever laid eyes on""--how original! He's a confirmed bachelor with a gorgeous, 10 ft. ceiling apt. overlooking the Thames; he dates super-stick, leggy, blonde, super-models, but somehow, when he finds out he must marry Mia to prevent deportation, finds himself ""lusting"" after her and possibly ""falling"" for her. We are given NO plausible explanation why, after a life of easy debauchery, he would find size 12 Mia to be his ""Snow White,"" other than she ""had curves in all the right places,"" and ""silky smooth skin."".Fourth, there is no real plot other than them moving in together as part of the ruse, them  planning their fake wedding, and them going to work to ""fool"" their co-workers after the wedding. Even the wedding itself, we are told that ""they wrote their own vows"" because they didn't want ""any of those old cliches."" Yet, the lazy author can't even bother inventing these amazing vows for her characters and putting them in the book..If you are dying for a ""fall in love over work"" romcom, either re-watch ""The Proposal,"" or the all time classic, ""His Girl Friday"" with Rosalind Russel and Cary Grant. Leave this fodder alone, or glance at the cute cover...that's the beginning and ending of everything worthwhile in this book.

"Don't be fooled friends--this brutal series is nothing more than a cheap Liftime movie glossed up for Spike TV. It is full of amoral, poorly drawn characters whom we never care about. The closest thing Book One has to ""protagonists"" are two scions of rival rich families who learn nothing throughout the book, and grow organically not one iota (unless you count the woman bemoaning the fact that she never wrote checks to charities to help the homeless?!) Both of them have ""Daddy"" issues that help them ""bond."" The plot is implausible (the head of one of the rival families promotes the daughter of the other rival family as president of the world's largest hotel in Manhattan even though she has no work experience so he can ""get even"" with her father--""you can do this. I believe in you"" is the ""explanation""); the characters truly are one-dimensional and interchangeable; the writing is very average--no pithy lines or clever word choices to move the story along..I have no idea why there are so many amoral characters in the book, unless its to serve as fodder for brutal killings. Even the ""good girl"" sister to the female scion is sleeping with a new guy on the first date after she found her fiance' cheating on her: no grief, no anger, no ""man hating phase,"" just ""let's get back in the saddle""--total male fantasy, and unrealistic. The only char of any interest is the middle age lawyer who's a good family man and friend by day, and a kinky S&M freak by night; clearly, he's a tortured soul but we are never allowed to understand his motivations, except for a brief Psy 101 blurb before he kills himself by jumping in front of a speeding subway (Anna Karenina anyone?) and we are told that ""judgmental society did this to him."" Yawn. Imagine all of the shallowest char from any soap opera all stuffed together in one book, and you pretty much have 5th Ave. It's Dallas without Bobby or Ms. Ellie; it's the Kardashians without Rob or Bruce; it's the evil step-sisters with no Cinderella..Would I rec it?

"The beautiful Jesus of ""The Bible"" series makes it worth watching, just as the real Jesus of the Bible makes it worth reading. What would the Bible be without Him? Yes, there are some wonderful accounts, parables, and verses in the OT, but would they still resonate as strongly as they do with us if it weren't for Christ coming and fulfilling those prophecies and leading an amazing, unimpeachable life? Of course, that's a topic for another discussion, but when we think of the importance of Jesus in history and spirituality, it's interesting to ponder what the world would be like if He had never made an appearance, or if we as a species had been allowed to develop further before He was sent to Earth. I often marvel at atheists who are so sure we should remove God and Christ from society and our belief systems, as if they know, a priori, that this would make the world a better place. How about we take them up on their offer and remove Christ from society, as a thought experiment, but at some date in the past. Should we remove Him before Handel wrote ""The Messiah"", or before DaVinci painted ""The Last Supper,"" or Michelangelo ""The Sistine Chapel""? Who knows how much their beliefs helped mold them as artists--perhaps if there were no Christ, there would be no DaVinci? It's absurd to think that all of the good things in society (art, literature, music) in the Western world would have developed without the West's single most overarching theme (Christianity), but I diverge..My point is that Christ is the highlight of the Bible just as Morgado is the pinnacle of ""The Bible"" series. (Plz don't think I'm being sacrilegious, b/c that is far from my meaning. It's just that Christ had to be cast perfectly, and they have done that here.) His love and compassion shines thru in every frame, and adds a tender dimension to Christ that isn't often shown on film. The series isn't perfect, but once it gets to the NT and starts telling the life of Jesus, with Diogo at the helm, it improves considerably. In fact, if they would edit the 10-hours down to 5, and sell just ""The Christ"" portion, I would buy it and we would watch it in our home every Easter. That portion of ""The Bible"" is truly a classic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22UYY17Q3YRQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AMR5LZA#wasThisHelpful","R22UYY17Q3YRQP","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book tries so hard to be ""literature,"" but it just doesn't make the cut. Firstly, the heroine, Danielle, is just never fully developed as a three-dimensional character. She's suppose to be an artist and a ""fabricant de parfum"" as they might say in French, but we're never really taken to her inner place where an artist lives. The author rather drolly spells out that she would use ""jasmine, rose, and sandalwood"" for instance, for this or that effect. We are never treated to the moment of inspiration where D. comes across a scent while walking in the woods after the rain and catching just that first sniff of honeysuckle, or a budding rose, or breaking an herb or crushing a flower to release just the right smell at the right time and this, ah yes, this particular transient odor is the one she will capture--this one, and only this one, will do. Instead, the author acts as if all jasmine or rose or sandalwood smells exactly the same which is to miss the point of how a great ""nose"" captures just the right essence at a precise moment in time and bottles it. It's no different than knowing when a wine or cognac is ready to drink. So, the protagonist, who is in every scene of the book, is never fully fleshed out as an artist..Secondly, she's never developed as a mother. She's parted from her son at the very beginning of the book b/c of WW2, and his memory is 'sprinkled' thru the book, but never in an organic way, that shows the pathos and anguish and haunting loneliness and longing of a real mother who had lost a child and was never quite sure if he were dead. Instead, the author writes silly little sentences about D. seeing a child who looks like her son and feeling a ""sudden pang of longing."" It's all so superficial and unrealistic--where is the agony that she would undoubtedly feel about the loss of her 3 or 4 year old child? Who could bear it? Yet, it is almost never mentioned in the book, as D. is too busy raising her other two girls (who themselves are rarely mentioned, although they live with their mother), and moving to America to get far away from the German threat, and building her perfume business in America, and sorting out her love life. It's very superficial, and I'm not even sure why she's portrayed as a mother, except that the children are used as a plot device near the end of the book..If you can overlook the unfinished threads and gaping holes, the book is a decent story that shows how one woman came to America, rebuilt her life, and found true love after losing her first husband in the war, and making several poor choices after that as she struggles to survive. But to call it an historical novel is like calling ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" an ""in depth look at 21st century, upper crust America."" The amount of ""history"" in the book is equivalent to what any of us (of a certain age anyway) would remember from junior high and high school (Nazis bad, Allies good). I would suggest that the author leverage some beta-readers who could help her find her missing pieces, and pull the stories together for a satisfying read, instead of a choppy one.

"When I first started reading this book, I though maybe the protagonist was supposed to have a learning disorder. The story was so disjointed and the grammar so hard to follow, that for a long stretch of the book I couldn't tell if the author was illiterate, or if she was trying to create a very special protagonist. By the time I finished the tome, I had decided it was a little bit of both, even if unintentional. The protagonist literally seems part Cher Horowitz, part Holden Caulfield. The strange language and bizarre interpretations of people's actions made me think that Kayla was going to be some kind of brilliant anti-heroine. The author leaves lots of lose threads throughout the book, interesting supporting characters (at least one), and as the book approaches the ending, it could still go in a dozen different directions. But then, sadly, she wraps up everything in a neat little fairy-tell ending. Huh? Imagine if Holden Caulfield finally met up with Jane, had sex, improved in school, and they went off to college together--what a totally unsatisfying ""feel good"" ending. Well, yeah, that's what happens in this book. For the first 300 pages the author captures this quirky, struggling, skewed heroine, only to turn her into a Hallmark character for the last 50 pages.

"Katie and Scott are the ho-hum ""protagonists"" of this easily forgettable book. Katie, although beautiful, leads a very dull life. Uh-huh? Scott, despite being ""the most beautiful man she had ever seen"" (yawn...aren't they all anymore?) is single at 26 and looking for Ms. Right. The ""cute meet"" starts with him racing his truck/SUV passed her on a snowy road and drives her into a ditch. She later meets him somewhere and then recognizes the car, gets all ""huffy,"" and that's suppose to be the spark/tension that makes Scott realize ""this one's different than all the other girls."" Bored yet? Exactly. The book is about as interesting as watching grass grow and horribly predictable. The only other thing that happens in the first half of the book is the two of them go on a sleigh-ride date (awwwww) and then Scottie taking her into the woods to cut down a ""real xmas tree."" (awwwww) Somehow, while setting up the tree everything gets hot and heavy and they have 30 pages of pornographic sex under the (blushing?) tree. Then an evil woman at work tries to break them up, and it works for about 30 pages, until Katie's BFF (who only appears to move the plot forward, and has no other purpose in the book nor dimensionality) tells her what the *itch did, and everything is resolved in short, predictable, (painfully obvious) order. This book is awful, except for the sex scenes if you like X-rated, which I don't. It can be read in 30 minutes by skimming one page, skipping three, skimming one, skipping three.

"Hired by the Cowboy? More like ""Written By a Formula."" I cannot imagine how this book received an average of 4.5 starts from hundreds of readers; that's clearly too many to be in the author's circle of friends, so it can only be that women (of a certain age and fertility status) are suspending all possible belief to enjoy this book. Yes, there is a ""cute meet""--Alexis (the female lead) literally 'falls at the feet of' Connor, the handsome cowboy. They both have no family, for various reasons, as is 'revealed' throughout the story, although it's pretty obvious from the start that neither of them has parents or siblings b/c she's a little waif on the lam, and the only person he has to introduce her to is his 'grannie.'.(Plot) The plot of him falling in love with her even though she's pregnant is laughable, and given no credulous reason for existing except for her 'glow' that he finds 'mesmerizing.' Really? Perhaps if his mother had been pregnant when she was killed in a car accident, there might be some Freudian issues that would make the plot plausible. Or if he had a 'handicap' himself, even a limp from a hunting accident. No, he has to be 'drop dead gorgeous, the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on.'.(Reality Check) I have actually known a few pregnant women who started dating a man other than the baby's daddy; however, these 'fill in' men have always been 'fuddily,' and are leveraging their 'Mr. Nice Guy' persona by being in the 'right place at the right time.' I've even known some of these relationships to work, where the beautiful woman marries the 'plain, nice guy' and is genuinely happy to have a husband and dad. They might add a second child to the family and live happily ever after. However, NEVER in the handful of relationships that I've seen in real life did I ever see 'Mr. Drop Dead Gorgeous' ride in on his white horse and whisk the pregnant-by-another-man woman down the alter. So, the plot is far-fetched, the writing is very ordinary (no witty, pithy phrasing, metaphors, etc.), and the protagonists are kind of dull.

"Secrets of 'Bethlehem' is a great title; I'll give it to the marketing department--it caught me attention. But the story has so little light or hope like other great stories that have come out of the other Beth-le-hem (Israel) that I'm not sure why they tried to be 'clever' by giving the book this title. The eponymous Bethlehem here is in Pennsylvania, and is a broken-down, old coal/steel mill town, that seems to churn out people who are as hard and cold as the product it used to make.

"This tonic is terrific. I could NOT believe how well it worked, especially for a ""feel good, all natural, go green"" product. I thought it would probably be 'politically correct,' but would lack any real killing power. Wow, was I wrong. It has been said that all drugs are just natural remedies that have been purified, and to some extent, I'm sure that's true. So when you can go straight to the source, why bother with the man-made alternative?This product is nature's finest: it's a simple blend of peppermint oil, clove extract, and sodium laurel sulfate (a soap found in most shampoos). I rubbed it into my dog's hair and skin with a cotton ball (I did not spray it b/c I didn't want the fumes). Maybe working it into her skin really made the difference, I'm not sure since I never tried otherwise. I left it on her about 20 minutes, at which point she was sitting at me feet with her head cocked to one side and a ""what did you just do to me"" expression on her face. The smell is wonderful, but I could imagine it was over-powering for her, so I decided to rinse her off (even though the directions say nothing about rinsing). Since she's a little Yorkie (oh, yeah, super cutie), I decided to shower her in the upstairs tub that has a detachable shower-head so I could really put a lot of water pressure on the little suckers. I don't know if they were dead, in shock, or just too fumigated to hold on tight, but they rinsed right off and down the drain. She has a short 'puppy cut,' and I worked my fingers into her skin to dislodge any fleas that might still have a strangle hold. All totaled I rinsed about 15 of them down the drain with a scalding hot chaser. Sorry, I give to PETA but fried fleas are NOT animal cruelty :)She has been one happy puppy ever since, and is scratching just a few times a day, instead of every few minutes. I will repeat the treatment next week as well, just to finish them off, but all in all WE are D-E-L-I-G-H-T-E-D with the results.

"I keep hoping to find a good murder mystery voice out there somewhere. Can it really be that hard to update and pay homage to Raymond Chandler? When you're reading his books, it seems that they are good, but that others somewhere could pick up where he left off and give us more riveting murder mysteries in his style. Apparently, I'm wrong; it's harder than it looks b/c no one seems to be doing it, especially this author..Plot is OK, and at least there are a few gentle, sloping twists and turns, although there are no ""blow your socks off, I wasn't expecting that"" ones--not by a long shot. However, the most annoying thing about the book is that the protagonist, a 45 y.o. former cop and detective turned writer, doesn't know exactly who he is. One page he's Bogey in ""Key Largo,"" the next he's Adam Sandler in ""Just Go With It""--I kid you not. There's a few pages half way thru the book where the prog explains ""guy hugging"" protocol. It's suppose to be funny and clever, but it's not, and its something I could NEVER imagine Sam Spade saying in any incarnation. Secondly, the prog speaking in the first person throughout the book is just lazy writing--it takes away all the 'suspense' to know what he's thinking and feeling at every moment, with very few 'false leads' scattered in along the way to make us think. Lastly, there's the ending--where both the hottest chicks in the book (one in her mid 20's the other in her late 30's) can't live without bopping the prog--which is just the author's male-fantasy wet dream. Unnecessary, and unbelievable. To make matters worse, they both want an 'open, modern' relationship with no strings attached. A book where there is no emotional attachment or commitment by anybody is just, in the final analysis, uninteresting. If they don't really care what happens to each other and they're just 'using' each other for sexual satisfaction, then why should we care what happens to them. Bogey NEVER played a role where he got TWO women at the end, unless it was to send one of them down the river, which would have been a much more satisfying ending.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1083W010NYS54/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VIR2CU#wasThisHelpful","R1083W010NYS54","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, serves me right for not waiting for other people to review the book before I jumped in and started reading it. And it doesn't help that the cover looks like a good romcom movie with a red-haired Katherine Heigl and maybe John Cusack?.Sierra is a feisty (but predictable) matchmaker who lives in a small town, a few hours from LA. Marc is a big city corporate raider (a la Richard Gere in Pretty Woman?). He comes to Sierra's small town (cutely name ""Love""), and slowly falls for Sierra over playful banter and many, many pages where they ""moon"" over each other. There's a decent sub-plot that has Marc's mom remarrying after divorcing his awful/misogynistic father. There are some ""colorful"" characters, such as ""Flo,"" who acts suspiciously like a certain t.v. Flo, even though the former is suppose to be an Aussie. Same wisecracking, dime store perfume, know-it-all..75% of the book is frothy and runs smoothly along; it's not Dostoevsky, but it's competent. Sadly, the last 25% is mindbogglingly poor--predictable, trite, obvious, unbelievable. Marc goes back to L.A., and of course he can't sleep, can't eat, can't work, can't do anything but think of Sierra--really? He winds up back in Love for his mother's wedding, and what do you know, asks Sierra to take six months off and travel the world with him. Then he wants them to move in together when they get back, and if that works out, maybe down the aisle together. Really? I don't know of any man who would ask to ""maybe"" move in six months from now.

"Really terrific read that makes you rethink what it means to be a follower/fan of Christ--the person, the enigma, the prophet, the freak! He was radical, and he wants nothing less than that from his fans. It's definitely now a ""feel good,"" ""God loves you,"" blah-blah tome. But don't we get enough of that from ""spiritual"" people who believe in G/god (I'm not even sure which one they call him now)? Fans of Jesus need to be intense, the way Packers fans are intense (not like Heat fans :).Lots of good stories/antidotes to keep it moving, and good references/re-interpretations about the Gospels. For example, every Christian knows the account of the fish and bread feeding a multitude. But author makes us rethink that by saying, ""but guess what, most of those people hung around Jesus overnight, hoping to get breakfast the next day too. Christ said, 'Sorry, the buffet is over. I am the living bread. Everyone who hears my words and believes will never hunger or thirst again.'"" Deep. Author points out that Christ didn't feed them a second time, but let many get confused and walk away. If you can't hang! Very intense and though-provoking. Yeah, few real Christ followers out there, right? How many would really 'pick up a cross and follow him.'

"Full disclosure: I have to admit that for me, the Apostle Paul has always been very difficult to understand. Respect, appreciate, enjoy? Yes, but would I want to ""hang out"" with him? Probably not. He's almost the ""bad cop"" to Jesus' ""good one."" (No disrespect here, just as analogy). It is very difficult for anyone to find fault with Jesus' amazing life: his enlightening parables; his love of the sick, poor, and children; his grace, grace, dignity, passion, passion, fortitude, and love are legend. (Hope you get the double entendres). But Paul expands and clarifies the fledgling philosophy, and is fierce in his evangelism for ""The Way."" He always seemed to me part elitist, part spiritual warrior, and part unreachable scholar--very inaccessible. This book helped me understand the man behind the Epistles, which gave me a lot more empathy for Paul's rabid determination. Learning what life was like in Tarsus, how he was raised, what were standard living styles of Pharisees, really were eye-opening. I do agree with other reviewers that the author over-stepped a bit, and it's important to clearly separate the speculative from the factual when dealing with subject matter this important; yet, all-in-all the book is well-researched, extremely well-written (flows like a good novel), and does add to the dialogue about this quintessential disciple of Christ.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENTMNQVA9S6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006J9DFDA#wasThisHelpful","R1ENTMNQVA9S6H","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of Horton's second book, ""Reaching for the Stars."" Just a quick note to all that this is definitely the ""starter version."" She has not yet found her ""voice"" here, nor how to develop a plot. There is not enough ""Scotland"" in the book to make it a romantic get-away novel. The plot is so predictable that I could nod off while Kindle was reading to me, and sure enough, when I awoke a few minutes later, it was exactly where you would expect it to be. There is a silly ""subplot"" about the heroine, Orly, gaining weight by eating chocolate b/c she's a vegetarian and there was nothing else to eat. Then she's in an ""accident"" and the hospital puts her on a food plan to raise her protein levels. Her beau, who is Scottish, feels so bad about not feeding her well when she was staying with him, that he resolves to ""take good care of her."" Really? What is she, two years old? Doesn't she know what to eat? Apparently there was nothing in the house so she was living on chocolate that she would buy in town (apparently they had no other food there?) She was gaining weight b/c of the empty calories but her beau ""finds her curvy body beautiful."" Really? You definitely know a woman wrote this--not very believable (although I know we women would like to think it's true). You can read it to kill time; it is ""finish-able.""

"I really wanted to like this book. There is nothing like a good, regency romance to take you away from your own problems--(OK, maybe the presidential debates lol, but you get the idea)..(First Half) This book starts out so strong I wanted to call everyone I know (female) and tell them to get it while it's free. But something in the pit of my stomach told me to wait until I got to the halfway point. I am so glad I did. The breathtakingly beautiful heroine (sounded like a cross between Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner-- is there any other kind in these books?) was engrossing while she was traveling thru England, trying to find her dead fiancé's family, and tending to their little girl. She had to throw herself at the mercies of his (not-so) evil brother, and there are many twists and turns at this part of the story: will he take them in, will he give them money, will he double cross them, will he keep the girl as his ward and send the mother away? It's all so thrilling. But then, another of the fiancée's brother, who I think is 23 (or was it 32), decides he can't let her go, follows her, and decides to make ""an honest woman out of her."" There is no real motivation for this playboy and cad to want to settle down; it's not as though we're told that he owed or even felt he owed anything to his dead brother.  Then, about a week after they marry she decides (I kid you not) that ""a part of her was glad that Charles (the dead fiancé) was gone. She could see now that after a few short years, they would have been bored with each other. This would never happen with Garrett (the brother she married)."" Really? You're going to admit to yourself that the man you were so passionate about that you would sneak off to have sex in a corn field during the American Revolution was really boring after all, and you're better off without him? And the father of your child no less? PLEEZE!.(Second Half) The second half of the book is a mishmash of random, newlywed type bickering, interspersed with random sex scenes, which were apparently supposed to be make up sex, although they hadn't made up. Not to be un-politically correct, but this is a British lord and a New England blue blood, not a Univision soap opera. It makes no sense for these two to be so impassioned by their fight that they have to make love on the kitchen floor! The second half of the book is so bad it was as if I had gone from ""Gone with the Wind"" to ""King of Queens."" The book does redeem itself somewhat by wrapping up with a very well written fight scene. It keeps you riveted, and guessing until the end about how each opponent will best the other; it stays perfectly consistent in using each boxer's strengths (and weaknesses) to maximum effect. If it didn't get lost for about 100 pages in the middle, this would be a great read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEOMK7KI35B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083P8EZM#wasThisHelpful","R2MEOMK7KI35B8","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I didn't get the connection btwn the quote in my review title, and the play on words she uses for her book. After all, ""All Roads..."" is not an Austen quote, so why is it the title of this book? I mention this b/c its a perfect example of Dr. Smith trying to squeeze something witty or pithy in where it doesn't belong; a book can be too clever for its own good..The intro tells us the author was inspired by Azar Nafisi (aren't we all!), so she set the bar very high for herself, as Dr. Nafisi's work is a terrific tome enlightening us about the social/political/familial milieu that is modern Iran. It's fascinating for many reasons, but chiefly b/c the books she chooses to read with her book club create perfect point and counterpoint for the story she's telling. Since the West needs to hear this story, and has no idea what it's like to live in such a place, the book has a purpose, and could have stood alone on this. But then she weaves such interesting relationships among characters--especially in Lolita and Gatsby--and Iran and the lives of the women in her reading circle that the finished product is mesmerizing..""Roads to Austen"" (if I may abbreviate it so) does not have such a clear vision. I understand that as a literature teacher, she probably wants to take certain licenses with her book. She spends all of her time in Latin America (although it's not a monolith); she's careful to be politically correct and assert that all the countries have a distinctive ""sabor/flavor"" (as are countries like France, Germany, and Italy, although they all have a European ""feel""); yet, all of the countries do seem to have a ""rhythm"" and way of doing things that we lack in the U.S. Perhaps she wanted her book to ""meander"" and reflect some of that ""laid-back"" attitude that she so enjoys on her road trip. The problem is, there are too many ""characters"" in the book, as she travels from country to country meeting with new reading circles each time. Frankly, seeing how one country reacts to ""Pride and Prejudice"" but how another reacts to ""Emma"" is not as compelling as seeing how the same set of Iranian women react to ""Lolita"" and then ""The Great Gatsby."" There are not as many profound revelations..The story/account/narrative really does go in too many directions. The main theme seems to be, ""What do women in these countries think of Austen? Does it resonate?"" But there are sub themes about these peoples' lives, and then her love life with one of the readers. It's just too much to cram all in one book and somehow it doesn't flow. If she had perhaps started each country with the reading circle, and then gave the backstories of the readers, and left her love life out of it, it might have all hung together. But as it stands, the reader is forced to careen from one topic to the next, forced to care about characters that are gone in the next chapter as she moves to the next country, and it just doesn't hang together.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OU5RG6TPA597/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008846VK8#wasThisHelpful","R1OU5RG6TPA597","A3DV2IG6TIPY9E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DV2IG6TIPY9E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book is a character study on one woman's life: Vivian. She is an artist who had a summer fling in England 10 years earlier, and now she has to decide whether that was her real life, or if it's the one she's currently living. The book is very well-written, and flows beautifully. We are given enough details about her childhood and her current husband to fully understand all the points of view she experiences. The reader is swept into her world, and the struggle between being a fully actualized person, or a devoted wife and mother. This is not a new theme, and even the most well-written book needs to add something new to the dialogue. From Madame Bovary to Kramer vs. Kramer, we have decades of literature about women who are trying to find themselves, and the struggles each faces. I devoured the book, enjoying every page and kept in suspense about what decisions Vivian would make. However, a few days after I finished the book, all of it just started to fade into oblivion, my mind knowing that I had addressed and answered all the questions it raised long ago.

"(Characters) Finn is a hot, celebrity chef, who is the ""main"" character in the sense that he drives most of the action. Raine is a newspaper columnist, who writes for the entertainment section, and really provides the emotional drive for the book. Ross is her counterpart and foil, a paparazzi style journalist who works for a rival paper, and who is always trying to scoop her when it comes to Finn stories. Anna is the chief character in the sub-plot and a budding chef in her own right, as well as the daughter of a great chef, who was Finn's mentor..(Plot and subplots) The main plot deals with Finn, and his quest to be a three-star Michelin chef. His back story is that he's been divorced twice, and his third marriage is teetering. He needs to find work-life balance. (Yes, this supposedly exist in a parallel universe.) Anna needs to come to terms with her fathers death; she is closed off emotionally. Raine needs to decide if she wants to be a columnist or a ""real"" writer. Ross needs to decide if being duplicitous is worth the price he will eventually pay.(""Romance"") There is suppose to be a romance triangle ""brewing"" (and the author even uses several coffee imagery here) between Finn and Raine and Ross. However, this is probably the weakest part of the book. Finn and Raine have some ""chemistry,"" but they never go thru anything together that would cause their romance to blossom. The closest thing to a ""reason"" we get is that they both ""looked hot in their jeans,"" albeit on different occasions. Ross supposedly has a crush on Raine too, but that has to be put on hold because of his career. He takes her on ""dates,"" but these are almost always to leverage (if not outright use) her as a ticket to get into events he wouldn't be invited to w/o her. This could have been built into a solid love triangle, but never was..The book is very readable; sentences flow smoothly, and the plot moves fluidly along. Plots and sub-plots are interwoven well--(and thank God there are some, I've read too many books lately that just hammer on one plot line for the entire 300+ pages--don't try it if you're not Hemingway, and who is!)

The friends and boyfriends in this book are no different than the ones that all adult women have probably already experienced. It's a decent, clean read for younger women: the sentences and grammar are competent, although nothing ""magical""; the characters are all well-developed, and stay consistent; the plot resolves itself logically, and even if it is a little predictable, it's not annoyingly so.

"John, the main character, is a ""professor of antiquities"" at Harvard. He is married to Shannon, who is a helpful, dutiful, and very ""lucky"" wife. Without any organic dialogue or actions that show how clever she really is, she is credited in the book with one outstanding ""brilliant hunch"" after another. All the while she is satisfied to support her husband's work and career. She's a main character in the book, but is completely under-developed, and is only brought in to advance the ""plot,"" such as it is..Some of the book is excellent, as one reviewer already pointed out: ""Muslim history being explained is vastly more interesting than the plot!"" This is very true. By far the highlight of the book is the ""summit"" that occurs between John and one of the top ranking moderate Islamic scholars. After this, the book really devolves into too many unbelievable coincidences and inconceivably important discoveries about the New Testament. I don't want to include ""spoilers,"" but imagine that you go out in your backyard, take out a telescope, and see shooting stars, Halley's Comet, a super nova, and the aurora borealis all in one night. That's about how believable all the ""discoveries"" in the book are. There are just too many of them, and of course the author does this because he wants to be able to narrate/educate on same..I love the Bible and enjoy learning new scholarly research on same; however, when I'm reading a ""novel"" I expect that it should first and foremost be a well-knit story, and only then a tool for educating the reader. This book gets to the point where it is just ""shoe-horning"" information into the book, and making it fit the ""story"" the best that he can. Back to my astronomy analogy, you might--in the spirit of good readership--be able to swallow the fact that someone in a story saw both a shooting star and Halley's Comet on the same night. But that would be the absolute most. If s/he also saw green cheese on the Moon, or a Martian on Mars, well, it would dawn on you that you had entered the twilight zone. That's where we end up about 75% the way thru the book--it just completely unravels into Neverland. There's way too much proselytizing and too little story. Sorry.

"Can you say cute yet creepy all in the same breath?I wasn't sure what to expect with this crow but it honestly  gives off the appearance of a dead crow.It is feathered  but the feet are plastic  looking .Upright it  supposedly runs off all the small birds as it looks like  out for prey. But  upside down it looks dead and scares crows and ravens  as it looks like a predator is near.I get it as it is creepy as can be.One thing for sure if it doesn't run off  birds it will make  a great Halloween decoration or  a nick nack for a  libraries Edgar Allen Poe reading of the Raven or even on the shoulder of a costume lol.So it  does  have lots of potential uses.I did receive this unusual  scare feather  crow at a discounted price to test it out and I see lots of  potential for it's use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YGPNT5IV4NIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFD97M2#wasThisHelpful","R2YGPNT5IV4NIK","A2QDN8G18NWAPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDN8G18NWAPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

To be honest it is really just cardboard with material glued on it .The top of it was  done  with a  ribbon  for holding  it  from going backward but problem was it was too short and lid would not lift  farther then few inches.

Lots of  bandages and  bandaids and alcohol, antiseptic etc wipes.I did receive this  great  first aid kit at a discounted price to test for you  and I can tell you it is worth the money, and would be  a g great item to send back to college with your child for emergencies and a great wedding present for the couple  who don't even own a bandaid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31PZHSQK9N1C0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4WDN10#wasThisHelpful","R31PZHSQK9N1C0","A2QDN8G18NWAPD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QDN8G18NWAPD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This rug / mat comes in a plastic bag so if  your plan was to  gift it  you need a box or bag. . No box for gift giving.It is the color  brown  but it can also be purchased as a beige  or gray one.There are NO / ZERO instructions included for  washing it or storing it .The labels on it says It is made in China so if you have issues you need to know this right off. It is very large at 35 inches by 23 inches and it truly is that large. It is rectangular in shape and basically a rubber mat with a design which parts are smooth and parts are rough. The back  side of the mat is smooth. It is great for capturing excess litter that gets kicked out of box. It has a lovely criss cross design on the topside.It is a nice mat just not what I had expected. I expected parts of it to be like  a dried sponge or rough in some way but it is  entirely  rubber.

"So disappointed in this set. I expected more from it . Everything  about it  is small.The tote is so small  it is difficult to even get the items to stay in it without it buckling.If your a serious gardener this is not  for you . If you have other garden tools this is not for you .If your  a beginner just doing a few house plants or looking  to purchase a set of garden tools to teach your young children or grandchildren then this is the set  for you .Having said that the  nippers  and pruners are very sharp so dangerous for children ,They are spring loaded and do have a safety catch on them. They are okay not great  but not bad  either.The water bottle is  awful. It is that plastic that if you  clank it  cracks easily. The small trowels have wooden handles , the tote has 5 pockets and  two end  areas but are so  flimsy  the stuff  just fell back out of it .I did receive  this set to test and review for you at a discounted  price and I am not impressed at all.The tote is actually just too short so it buckles form any  weight to sides.. needs  a stabilizer for  bottom or  to be taller to  with stand the weight of  tools .

"I am giving this rug a 4 star because I have had one of these rugs for 4 years now and it is used every single day in my bathroom.  It is still as nice and as plush as the day I purchased it  at full price  years ago.So I was  in awe when the opportunity arose for me to  receive another one of  these at a discounted price  for a review as having purchased one outright  I knew how well they held up.

I like  that  actually better  then the two piece type.The mandolin a has a great handle on it to  hold  onto or to carry. Plus it has feet. one short set to  keep it stationary when  using  a higher elevation and handle, the other is longer  and folds up to allow you a lower angle . Both feet have grips to prevent slipping and sliding.I did receive this really nice mandolin a t a discount price to test for you and other then no instructions and the  confusion ( on my part) to understand  how 3 blank blades cut / slice  differently it is really a nice one.

"When I selected Valerie L. Winslow's book titled 'Classic Human Anatomy in Motion' to review, I had our youngest son in mind, who draws several hours a day.  And while he's acquiring an impressive collection of drawing books, this has to be at the top of the list.  With examples of bone structure (including the names for all parts of the body), muscle placement, how the body moves in various positions, and diagrams showing incredible attention to small bits and pieces, this book is amazing. And honestly, it's one of the finest modern-day art books I've seen.  She shows in such detail the bodies underneath the skin and bones, and that's what needs to be understood.  Our son is impressed, and from what he's said and what I've seen, it's really like a science book masked as an art book.  Human anatomy beautifully represented.  His main comment is that it's easy to find anatomy books that show a limited array of detail, but Winslow shows that detail to the extreme.  There's nothing I would add to what she's already produced.For the seasoned artist, or a beginning art student, this is a wonderful addition to to their bookshelves.(i received this book free to review from blogging for books)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWZLSYBDGNGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770434142#wasThisHelpful","R2GWZLSYBDGNGX","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Clearly Lisa Bogart is a very joyful person, and it shows in her delightful devotional.  In 'Knit, Purl, Pray' she shares 52 written pieces using knitting analogies to bring her thoughts home.  Mistakes, dropped stitches, comfort, relaxation, and contentment stream through the pages of this sweet book.It's a nice addition to a knitting bag or on a side table beside stitching supplies.  A light devotional, never taxing, but just simple stories from a knitter who has a passion about her art.She talks about wanting so badly to produce a perfect bit of knitting, without flaws.""All this struggling with perfection made me think of the verse about good works versus grace.  I still think I can work my way into heaven.  If I do all the right things, I will be guaranteed a spot.  Just like if I work hard enough my sweater will turn out perfect.  But there is no work that needs to be done to get into heaven.  Jesus has already done the heavy lifting.  There is not a thing we can do.""She's included a couple of patterns in the back of the book, an added treat.

"Some books grip you, pull you in and force you to be honest about things that are happening.  And when an author is able to share without reserve, I'm totally smitten.  So it goes with Rachel Macy Stafford's 'Hands Free Life'.I was hesitant at first to offer to read this book to review since at her blog she shares such sweet stories of her children, and I was afraid it'd be one more book of a perfectionist mom showing us how it's done.  But she's nothing like that.  The thing is, she's realistic enough and willing to share the ugly places too.  Her struggles with being a mom, and both the victories and trials.  She's willing to be human.Slow down, appreciate what's in front of you, don't beat yourself up for mistakes in the past---learn from them and move on.  I guess that sentence is at the heart of Rachel's message.  Mess up?  Try again with the Lord's help and have a do-over.One more have-a-pencil-in-hand-while-you-read-this sort of book.

"Back when I got married, thirty-two years ago, there were standard books given as wedding presents.  I'm remembering 'Joy of Cooking' and 'Betty Crocker', both of which I still use even though they look pitiful with age.  Alana Chernila has written such a gorgeous and full-of-information cookbook with 'The Homemade Kitchen', brimming with photographs, that I'd say her book should fill the shoes of the new perfect wedding gift.She not only shares recipes for foods I've never used before:  kefir, tofu, or mizo, but she includes old standards as well.  Maybe you want to make animal crackers, or little fish cheese crackers.  She has recipes that encourage using leftovers and always, always she enjoys her preparing her meals.  There's love in her food.  And never a hint of pressure---it's all about enjoyment and feeding.I truly love this book.  One review likened her to Laurie Colwin, whose book 'Home Cooking' is a classic in the style of conversational cookbooks.  Tell me a story and give me a recipe.

"With the turmoil caused by terrorists being constantly on everyone's minds, I was drawn to Brother Nathan's story called 'Love Casts Out Fear'.While Nathan was still a young child in Egypt, his pastor father was murdered before his eyes by killers targeting Christians.  For several years after, he vowed to revenge his father's death. Before that could happen, however, the Lord touched his spirit and claimed Nathan for His own.The rest of the story speaks of his Christian upbringing, and his life in the hands of God, ministering to other believers. Clearly he's being used even now, still in the areas where he was raised, preaching the gospel and being a light in the midst of terror.""...through the living example of this twenty-first-century disciple, I hope you will catch a glimpse of how our mighty God can do extraordinary things through the lives of ordinary people who fully surrender to his will.""~from the Introduction by David CulrossI was amazed at hearing of groups of Christians still living in the midst of such persecution.  These are Muslim-dominated areas, with Brother Nathan focusing on his homeland of Egypt.

"Another book to read with a pencil in hand.  Deidra Riggs with 'Every Little Thing' has written a beautiful story that gives the reader permission to exhale, to give in to the workings of the Lord and to be who He created you to be.  Even when things just don't make sense.She focuses on the 'good enoughs.'  The days when we feel insignificant and unworthy.  And she says He loves us just as we are.  We need this reminder.Deidra shares her struggles with fitting into the places God has led her, focusing on a pastorate her husband accepted in Nebraska, where the black population is very, very small.  Deidra is black, so this is pretty significant, yet she shares the whole event with such humor.  She really is hilarious.  And it took her about seven years before she felt at home.  That's saying something.  She understands disappointment, but learned patience at the same time.Her book is a comfort, and tells beautifully how He's working even when we can't see the image of what He's creating.

From moving into a new place (not necessarily an apartment or flat), including making a checklist for that move, considering traffic patterns for placing furniture, decorating styles, paint colors, window treatments, selecting art for your home, special bits on particular rooms in your home, gardening ideas, entertaining, and monthly ideas for keeping your home special and in good fettle.'apartment therapy complete + happy home' is such a beautiful book.  The photographs are bright and happy, and the whole feeling of the book is upbeat and engaging.

"Sandra Byrd's book 'The One Year Home & Garden Devotions' is an encouragement.  She shares daily stories, adds a Scripture at the endings and gives a glimpse of her family life.  It's light and sweet, maybe more so than what I'm used to, but will speak women who feel stretched for time in fitting in a devotion.  In a few minutes time you can find a focus, a bit of guidance, and refreshment.  In addition she shares recipes from time time along with gardening tips.  A little bit of everything related to home.This might sound foolish, but Sandra just seems like such a likable person.  Her book is engaging and uplifting, and her website (sandrabyrd.com) offers more of the same.  She has links to her Pinterest page as well that links to her books.  Being very visual, I enjoyed looking at the photos she saved to pair with her book.For any mom or woman at home who wants a bit of Godly leading in the morning, this might be the book for you.(i received this book free to review from tyndale)","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UYPZJV2JT2PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414391862#wasThisHelpful","R3UYPZJV2JT2PQ","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Brazzeal's book 'Pray Like a Gourmet' is a light-hearted, yet sincere manual to encourage creativity in prayer.  He begins the book by talking about how mundane and ordinary are our eating habits.  Being satisfied with junk or take-out food when there are so many other possibilities.  And with that angle, he takes the reader through various ways of incorporating imagination into our prayer lives.  Now, everyone doesn't need this help, but many folks would gain some ideas they'd maybe not thought of.I get the impression he's directing the book toward those who've become jaded in their prayer walks, and need an encourager.  With a joyful spirit, Brazzeal shares ideas (sadly, not food recipes, which I was hoping for), and has a great enthusiasm for his prayer journey.My only complaint with the book regards design and not content.  A yellow ink is used repeatedly as an accent with some phrases and is very difficult to read.

"In my defense, when I requested Dr. Solomon Katz' book 'Beauty as a State of Being', I was unaware it was a book on Zen Buddhist thought.  It's what I'd call yoga for the mind.""The individual soul is the same thing as the universal soul.  In other words, your essence, the most intimate aspect, the very heart of your being is the universal Being, the Eternal, the All.  The soul, then, is the Heart and the All.  At heart, you are literally God.""I think I've quoted enough.To me, as a born-again believer in the true Creator of the Universe, the Trinity, the Lord Jesus Christ, this is so much drivel.  And while there are positives in the Buddhist belief system---avoidance of conflict, for example, and techniques for quietening the mind---the roots just don't work for me.  It's a very shallow belief system.  Eternity is a very long time.Dr. Katz is very enthusiastic for his system of thought, and has substantial followers.  I just won't be one of them.(i received this book free to review from speak easy)","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QUCK5DK8MA3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098911127X#wasThisHelpful","R3QUCK5DK8MA3Q","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shauna Niequist's book of devotions called 'Savor' is a very sweet collection.  Not too light, deep at times in spiritual truths, and full of personal stories that tell of her own struggles.  It's the perfect devotional for a mom who's strapped for time, or for anyone who wants a less-restrictive bit of reading in the morning.I've not read her other books, but women who've read 'Bread and Wine', or 'Cold Tangerines' have praised her writing.  This is apparently more of the same---easy-to-read and refreshing.Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of devotional type books, feeling that they're often dry and boring.  Shauna proves that this isn't always the case.  I do like Savor very, very much.My only regret is that I now own the e-book.

"I read Matt McCarthy's new book 'The Real Doctor Will See You Shortly' from cover to cover, all in one day.  Full of things the lowly patient might not realize, much of it a surprise, mainly how the students are often in the dark about what to do even after years of schooling.  I appreciated his honesty and humor in sharing what a first year intern really experiences.  Sleep deprivation, a bad diet and lots and lots of trying situations.He kept saying that when you got the chance to eat, eat.  And when you could sleep, sleep.  He went further with it, but that was the gist.I'm not feeling much envy for the life of a new doctor, but he laid it out in such an engaging way.  And he's a gifted writer.  Not bad for a physician.My only complaint was the profanity.  I realize I might sound like I'm coming from the Dark Ages to fuss, but is it necessary?  Even with the stresses of the medical life, does that allow for lacing the book with common swearing?  I'd say no.  But still, I enjoyed the book.

"I read Martin Pistorius' book 'Ghost Boy' in one day.  And it's not that the book is an easy read, though it is, but I wanted to get to the good parts.  The happy ending.  With so many years of being trapped in his body (his own words) I needed to see that he survived the trials, and he does.At twelve years old, Martin was hit by an illness that slowly took his life away from him.  A sore throat first turned into an inability to move or speak. Years later, he began to return to life. That's it in a nutshell, but the book is so much more than that.  Martin tells of abuse he suffered in care homes, and being unable to communicate this abuse, he suffered silently.  That part of the book was hardest to read---his vulnerability in the hands of supposed caregivers who molested him, not caring that he was aware of every action.He talks about his faith, and how he felt God touch him, in the midst of his illness.  He held onto that.  And while parts of his life were unbearable, there were individuals who looked past his outside and began to pull him back to life.  Virna, an aromatherapist, who worked his limbs and really looked at him as an individual, was the first person outside his family who really attempted to see past his disabilities.  Her care was the springboard for everything that commenced afterward.  She was his miracle.Years later, he's working, has married, yet still lives with physical limitations.  His spirit, however, soars.(i received this book free to review from booklookbloggers)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CBBROTJK13K3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400205832#wasThisHelpful","R1CBBROTJK13K3","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because I have a weakness for Catholic literature (though I'm Anglican), I reserved Ronald Rolheiser's book 'Our One Great Act of Fidelity' to review.  Curiosity about the Catholic position on transubstantiation was my main objective.  He covers that.  For him/them it's about a physical presence, something that humans tend to need, and that makes sense to me, even though I've never been aligned with a church which literally believes in this.  I will say, though, that our church is very sensitive in how the elements are prepared and handled.  Never in a trivial manner and never thrown away after blessed.  There is something Holy about it.And honestly, to read the Scriptures you can go either way---either the elements do change into Christ's blood and flesh, or they don't.  A laboratory can't prove it, but lots of aspects of God's presence can't be proven.  Can't prove the Holy Spirit lives in my soul either.I decided after reading the book that whether a person believes in Christ's literal blood and flesh being present in Holy Communion is a personal position.  If the act of receiving the Eucharist is more dear for that belief, then absolutely believe.Rolheiser's book is a gentle writing about the Lord's Table.  The importance of a regular partaking, the forgiveness and the strength it gives us to bear/live another day.(i received this book free to review from blogging for books)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T2748YJJPEGU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307887049#wasThisHelpful","R3T2748YJJPEGU","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ken Wytsma's book 'The Grand Paradox' covers thoughts and truths about God's personality---His fairness (which we don't always understand), and His great love for us.  The paradox comes when His waiting and/or our impatience get in the way of seeing what He's attempting to bring forth.Like when we're waiting for my husband's shop to acquire more work, and the bills are late.  Or someone is sick and you just can't see the benefit in it lingering, or ending in death.  Those questions we all run into and struggle over.  They don't make sense.The best quote in the book, in my opinion, and one that sums it all up, is this:  ""The problem is we are always trying to walk by sight but call it faith.""Recently I was in a Bible study class on the book of Jeremiah.  The thing that stood out to me was while God was delivering a hard truth to the Israelites, He was loving them at the same time.  Well, I saw that Jeremiah appeared to be almost sorry at the burden he was placing on the Israelites.  They disobeyed and he was hard-pressed to tell them what would happen as a result of their disobedience.  I felt that in a way it shadowed the reluctance of God to blast His people.That's what Ken's book meant to me.  God is with us.  Period.  And maybe He doesn't always enjoy putting us through the necessary to achieve His ultimate will.  We have to get over having to understand everything and really go by faith, not by sight, because it really is humanly impossible to see that far ahead.And besides Ken's passion for justice issues and talking about the Neolithic period (which I question, being a strict Creationist) in the beginning of the book, I found the book spot on.(i received this book free to review from booklookbloggers)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPN7R74BEK83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0849964679#wasThisHelpful","R2OPN7R74BEK83","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When after putting a book down you feel light and encouraged, that has to be a good thing.  I wasn't sure at first about Ragan Sutterfield's book 'This is My Body'.  I was intrigued when I ordered it to review, thinking about his struggles with weight and then competing in and finishing the race to become an Ironman.  Amazing.  Anything is possible.  But I got a tiny bit overwhelmed at the details about his college years, and the frank way he shared.  He's so real.  Maybe more honest about his past than I was comfortable with, but that's the trend these days.  Anything is open game.  He's humble, though, and not arrogant in talking about his personal monsters.  His upbringing was traditional and fundamental.  Went to Wheaton, which he's quick to lay out as 'not the Christian university we all like to think it is.'  But he got off course in his personal life, had a bad first marriage, went up and down with his weight, but wanted very deeply to experience joy.  He just went about it the wrong way.  What else is new, right?  We all have been there in one way or another.I guess overall, Ragan tells his readers that Christians sometimes are as confused as everyone else, but with Christ in us, really in us, we have an advantage.  His preparations to compete in the Ironman weren't just about finishing, but about a physical experience of living for Christ and not just a spiritual one.  He make the argument that our bodies are important as our spirits.  Christ indwells us.  Think about it.His discussions about the Anglican faith were a draw as well, as he spoke about the disciplines necessary to maintain a daily faith walk.  'The Book of Common Prayer' was a blessing to him, as it is to me.  Good comparison,  He kept at the prayers as he trained.  Both require devotion and consistency, the key to succeeding at anything.So as I said, after I put it down I felt light and encouraged.  He makes change feel do-able, and I did enjoy that feeling.(i received this book free to review from bloggingforbooks)","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G8RGBTES59M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601425511#wasThisHelpful","R2G8RGBTES59M9","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes you read a book at a particular time and you know the Lord has placed it in your hands right then.  That's the way it was for me, reading Michele Cushatt's book 'Undone'.  And, seriously, they should sell it with a pencil attached, because I underlined throughout the entire book.Michele shares her journey through a cancer diagnosis (which I can't relate to, but learned from), divorce (which also isn't on my radar), unruly teenagers (yes to that), telling a child they have to move out when they refuse to follow the house rules (again yes), becoming a foster parent to three little ones (oh my) and all the varied experiences of a believer who's just trying to find their way (amen).With abundant grace and humor, she shares her life.  All the ugly bits and the parts where God is truly a Loving God.

"'The Postage Stamp Vegetable Garden' by Karen Newcomb is WONDERFUL.  I made a mental list of things I wanted to know before beginning to dig our garden plot this spring, and every one was answered in this gem of a book.  She even says on the back cover that a 5x5' garden can produce 200 pounds of food.  Amazing.I was so encouraged.  The chapters cover preparing the soil, composting (so many types), which plants love others, including using flowers and herbs in companion planting.  She also covers pets and other annoyances.What surprised me was her advice on planting in pots indoors.  I tend to set limits on myself, not realizing the potential for success.This book is all you need for a small garden, though her diagrams include spaces as large as 8x10'.  I have the sneaking suspicion my copy will get nicely gnarly by the end of summer, but that's as it should be.More information can be found at www.postagestampvegetablegardening.com.(i received this book free to review from bloggingforbooks)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HLPD70W267R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607746832#wasThisHelpful","R1HLPD70W267R8","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sheila Walsh's new book called 'Loved Back to Life' came to me just at the right time.  Depression is the norm for me, not to the extent she's suffered with it, but a part of my daily walk nonetheless.It's interesting to me how she was treated by the Christian community when her struggles became public knowledge.  Sadly as believers we tend to think we have to portray a perfect lifestyle, which oddly enough, diminishes proof of God's work in us.Back in the 90's Sheila was a host on the 700 Club, was a very popular Christian singer, and appeared to have everything going for her.  Her routine of working Monday through Friday for the 700 Club, then flying out to do concerts, all the while never letting. on how difficult it was, finally had its way with her.  She never let on that it was too much, she just ceased to be able to manage it.  Life lost its joy.  That certainly sounds familiar.  She crashed and ended up checking into a Christian-based psychiatric hospital.  There she learned to handle her stress, and let go of her need to be perfect.  We all should be so wise.The part of the book that reached me so clearly was when she spoke sharply to her friends, who then let her know her harsh words really hurt them.  Her counselor who she shared with told her to write the following out every morning:  ""God loves a woman with a quiet and a gentle spirit.""  She called herself a 'quiet terrorist'---""someone who didn't look like an angry person, but who liked to quietly control things from the sidelines.""Yes.I underlined all through this book and would freely recommend it to anyone who either struggles with depression or the need to exhibit perfectness.

"Every time I read a book regarding the World War II era, I'm stunned by the strength of those who survived it.  My own father fought at the Battle of the Bulge, and I'd give anything if I'd drilled him for more information on it while he was living.  Miranda Mouillot had the courage to do just that in researching her grandparents' lives during the early/middle part of the 1900's.  I admire her hard work.There were hidden aspects of her grandparents' meeting and marriage, and it took Miranda years to get to the truths that explained a marriage that quickly broke up.  And the weight of her grandfather's work as an interpreter at the Nuremburg trials colored much of it.  Who can really know of the distrust and fear of the people who lived in the most trying period of modern day life?I so appreciated reading about Miranda's unusual (for me) family, the home her grandmother had bought in France where Miranda felt such a connection, and her visits with her strangely obsessive grandfather.  The book is rich.  And like me you might wish you'd interviewed your own ancestors as thoroughly as she did hers.  No regrets.

"I've just finished reading Mimi Thorisson's beautiful cookbook called 'A Kitchen in France--A Year of Cooking in My Farmhouse' and found it such a comfort.  With her husband's crisp and mouthwatering photographs highlighting her cooking, she makes every day a Feast Day.  I'm inspired, and encouraged to be a bit more adventurous in the kitchen.  And to take more care in preparing a meal.Mimi takes the simplest of ingredients and creates a masterpiece.  And in reading through the recipes, she proves that the most ordinary bits and pieces can be woven together to feed family and friends in an elegant way.With modern lifestyles being centered more on hurry and get-it-done in as short a time as possible, she brings old-style into our homes.  Her meals are definitely full of love.I truly loved reading her book.  Every page is a delight.  And the way the book is divided into seasons is clever, telling us how to cook within a framework on what's available and fresh.  To cook within those parameters gives a bit of new-ness to a meal, not assuming all ingredients are at their best at all times.  I like that idea.  Plus, cooking within the seasons allows some foods to be looked forward to.I wish her well, and truly offer thanks for sharing her home and family.  Gorgeous children, and a delight all around.

"Stephen Orr's newest book called 'The New American Herbal' is gorgeous---one of those beautiful Clarkson Potter heavy-weight paperbacks.  And with Orr having a background working for Martha Stewart Living, House & Garden and Domino, you'd expect quality work.  He doesn't disappoint.I've collected books on herbal cures, plants, and recipes for several years.  Some focus on different topics and they all work together to fill my needs.  Orr goes into depth about identification, uses in recipes and teas, and gives extensive historical information.  I was especially fond of his findings from old herbals.In speaking of Cumin he quotes Theophratus saying, ""One must curse and abuse it while sowing, if the crop is to be fair and abundant.""And in Orr's words, ""Farmers sowed the seed with epithets and incantations to preserve this highly valued plant from the evil eye so it would flourish."" Magical.For this writer to share those bits of history adds to the beauty of the book.  It's not simply full of facts and his own wonderful photographs, but also with information you'd not automatically expect.I highly recommend 'The New American Herbal' for anyone who (like me) wants to enrich your own herbalist's library.

"Even though I've not finished reading 'Les Misérables', I thoroughly enjoyed Bob Welch's companion book called '52 Little Lessons from Les Misérables'.He shares the strengths of Hugo's masterpiece, and stresses areas that clearly point to hope, and mercy in the midst of devastating circumstances.I love the way Welch shares personal stories of his own struggles.  He says we ""give up our true riches to the things we unconsciously consider our saviors.  Work as savior, for example.  How easily we live as if getting things done is that which sustains us.  If I could live my life again---I'm fifty-nine as I write this---it is the thing I'd want to change most:  the pace at which I've lived.""And 'Les Misérables' is the perfect book to encourage a person to appreciate the little things---the joys.

"The first phrase that comes to mind in reading Preston Yancey's book 'Tables in the Wilderness' is 'stream of consciousness.'  He spends the majority of the book talking about being broken and not finding his way in his Christian beliefs.  Truly, he's like a majority of young people who are attempting to pay homage to their upbringing, and at the same time decide if that's how they want to live their own adulthood.  And as his friend, Sam, says---Preston's not broken, though he continues to insist that he is.  Really, he's just seeking.  Claiming brokenness all the time might be more of a self-indulgent attention-getter, but my experience is that when you feel that way, you really feel that way.  You don't mean to come across as a martyr, though those who hear your grumbles might believe  you sound that way.It is refreshing.  To read about a person's internal struggle with an honest attitude feels good to me.  He's not a know-it-all, though he is smug at times.  He has a poetic gift for getting his point across, but is angsty through most of his storytelling.  He seems in mental anguish, though that might sound extreme.His focus is on God's presence having left him.  That's he's out in the world on his own, drifting without any direction.  He seems to be looking for sure signs of what he's supposed to do, and only later in the book feels confident to make smart decisions after struggling through prayer.  To act no matter.I believe that any honest Christian could relate to what Preston has experienced---what he's been open enough to share.  And happily, he does end the book on an upbeat note.  He breaks out into the light again.

"How do you review a book told by a grieving mom who's lost her only son?  To a freak accident.  A drowning when he was only 12 years old.  How can you even be impartial?  You really can't.  Nobody can imagine the pain of the death of a child, especially when it comes out of the blue.To be honest, when I got the email offering me the opportunity to review Anna Whiston-Donaldson's book 'Rare Bird', I hesitated.  I wasn't sure I could bear reading her story.  What saved me was listening to and watching a video online of her talking.  She's survived, but some days it probably feels otherwise.  I was so grateful to see her smile.  She can still conjure up a happy expression.  ""Living and partly living"" as it's quoted in TS Eliot's 'Murder in the Cathedral'.  Seems apt.A few years ago, on a rainy late afternoon Anna told her two children to go out and play in the rain.  As the book states, only one came home.  Her son drowned in a creek that had suddenly overflowed behind a neighbor's house.  The book is the story of a family's tragedy that fully demonstrated God's tender hand.Could someone read this who was freshly grieving?

"I'm held to a 200 word review, but can sum this book up by saying I absolutely adore it.  Will that work?  No, seriously, I opened Michael Yankowski's book called 'The Sacred Year' and was drawn in from the first page.  His opening story about being disillusioned and worn out was perfect, and he made me laugh.  And he continued with sharing how totally sacred God is.  With our acceptance of mundane living, it's easy to forget that part.Here's a beautiful quote from the book:""The God who called you into existence ex nihilo---out of nothing---is the same God who holds you in existence this moment and every moment.  Were he to withdraw this hand, you would vanish without memory.....he wants you to exist.  And not just exist.  He wants you to live life in all its fullness.""Liturgy.  Ritual.  Authentic faith.  Appreciation for God as the awesome Creator are fully shared in the book.  'The Sacred Year'---what a perfect title.  Michael sets aside a year to experience God.

"""My healing journey began when I finally granted myself permission not to be okay. Not to stay there forever, of course, but rather to acknowledge that not being okay is a perfectly normal part of the Christian journey.""Excellent quote and it, pretty much, sizes up the whole gist of Vicki Courtney's book called 'Move On'. For the most part, I enjoyed the book, but for me it began to lag somewhere in the middle when I got bogged down in too many stories. Too much personal information.While I understand the necessity for folks to air their pains, I really don't agree with the wisdom of telling every little secret. For others to be blessed through your messes, is it necessary to share your family's hidden secrets as well?Yes, life is very messy and Christians should be the first to admit that they go to church with a lot of sinners, who are also saved. We need to get over ourselves and our need to be perfect. Point taken, and Courtney shares tips in achieving a greater self esteem, which I'm in favor of. But not at the cost of too much information.

She causes Eliot come alive in her telling of Eliot's life and career, all the while spinning in her own love for Eliot's writing.  Rarely am I able to find a book that depicts an author so clearly.  It was like the very best university course all neatly packaged in a beautifully bound hardback.I was partial to this comment of Mead's:  ""This notion---that we each have our own center of gravity, but must come to discover that others weigh the world differently than we do---is one that is constantly repeated in the book.  The necessity of growing out of such self-centeredness is the theme of 'Middlemarch.'""Mead is so incredibly thorough in her research and portrayal of George Eliot.  She must've spent hours and hours of enjoyable time in adding to her vast collection of information.  But the clincher for me was a bit at the first of the book when she's going to be able to read a journal of Eliot's stored in the rare book collection of the New York Public Library.  What thrilled me was Mead describing the book opened in front of her, and the subtle scent of a fireplace stealing over her.  She imagined all the places that journal had been stored, and thinking of Eliot holding it, writing in it and maybe the smoldering of a fireplace where Eliot actually lived.Real folks writing real books.  She made George Eliot come alive for me.  Now.  Considering 'Middlemarch' is Rebecca Mead's favorite of novels, I'd love to find a similar work for my own favorite, 'Jane Eyre'.  Satisfying that would surely be.I highly recommend this book, especially for lovers of 19th century fiction, which for me is the perfect era.  Excellent work.

"There's something about John Ortberg's newest book called 'Soul Keeping' that disturbs me, but it's hard to put a finger on it.  Maybe part of it was his tendency to use humor to push a point across, but it came through as very juvenile.  And his stories about himself, especially one part when he admits his selfishness towards his wife during their honeymoon, no less, was troublesome to read.  His honesty might be considered a plus to some readers, but that's not the only incident where he talks about himself in an unflattering manner.  But it's not like he changes.  He just keeps being irritating. Enough already.  Stop pushing everybody's buttons.  And there's an incident where he badgers his two year old daughter to tears, shooting her with constant questions because he's tired of her doing the same to him. I guess his reason for sharing these stories is to show how our souls sometimes need work.  I get that, but still...This book seems to be heavy on him quoting his spiritual mentor, Dallas Willard, who is an unknown to me.  Reminded me of reading Thomas Moore's book 'Care of the Soul' and how he cozied up to the late Thomas Merton.  Nice to have someone to look up to, but the tendency is to quote your favorite writer/human/educator/pastor and present them as perfect.  Like their words are always crystal and worthy to be quoted.  I find that dangerous territory.While I'll applaud his research and the references he uses, his anecdotes relying on humor to pull him through were draining to read.  I didn't detect sincerity, rather I felt I was reading work from a stand-up comedian.(i received this e-book free to review from thomas nelson/booklook bloggers)","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3UAI5UKK851/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRZDCAW#wasThisHelpful","R2A3UAI5UKK851","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""It is the act of chasing brilliance that keeps hope alive within our hearts.  And that chasing act produces an expectation of belief--though the shadows lengthen and at times overwhelm, the brilliance is not far away.""Excellent book.  I have to say that 'Home Behind the Sun' is one of the best books I've read this year.  I feel rejuvenated. Timothy Willard and Jason Locy have written a very honest book that's all about our Creator and His love for us, and His desire for us to be filled with wonder.  And with their gorgeous use of words they encourage us to approach the Lord as our children are still able to do, in their innocence.  The older I get, the harder that's become, but I can still try.Both writers share extensive examples of how they're looking to fall in love with God again.  To see Him in all the varied experiences we travel through on a given day.  And they're not all pretty situations, but they also tell of hard times that try a person's faith.  The thing is, we should still be able to find the magic.Life was never intended to be ordinary.  I mean really, if we would look at each day as if it's the first time we've seen it, how would it appear?  This is how Tim and Jason gifted me, and I read this book at just the time I needed it.

"'A Table by the Window' centers around the life of French/Italian (though born in America) Juliette D'Alisa.  She's a food writer, also a culinary school graduate with restaurant life in her blood.  Her grandmother had a patisserie, her parents run a restaurant, and soon into the book she's invited by her brother to start yet another one.I really enjoyed her writing style which was laid-back, and I enjoyed seeing that she added the recipes that are mentioned in the story.  Also, since the main love interest lived in Memphis, I pricked up my ears.  Reading about my hometown was a treat, and Lodge hit on Memphis spot on.  No fake accents, and no making fun of the Southerners.  We get that all the time! Made me wonder if either she or someone close to her lived here.  It's easy to poorly portray characters from varied parts of the country, and it's refreshing to see it done well.There was lots going on, and honestly, she tells the story of Juliette so well, I'm thinking this will be a book I'll remember.  I read a lot and often as soon as I finish a book, unless it has something pretty good going for it, I forget the main thread. This one isn't like that.  It's light, yes, but solid enough to stay with you.  There's a mystery involving her French-born grandmother, some hidden genetics going on, a serious illness, a long-distance romance, beautiful food descriptions and a story of faith that holds it all together.  Plus, the end of the book contains a few pages of the sequel.Many thank to Hillary Manton Lodge for writing what I wanted to read.  No drama that was so overbearing that I got edgy, but just enough to intrigue me.  Well done.  Very well done.(i received this book free to review from waterbrook/multnomah)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFQKK82DMT23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307731758#wasThisHelpful","RYFQKK82DMT23","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often you find a book about someone who's been there and back, and is willing to own up to their mistakes.  But honestly, who hasn't messed up?  I think it's the public shaming that's so rare, and something we tend to be unfamiliar with.  Most of us commit sin in a more quiet and private way.  Rodney Jetton's life came to a glorious head with fast-paced popularity, but his fall was just as swift and not-so-glorious.Rod got in touch with me a few weeks ago about a new book he's written called 'Success Can Kill You'---he is incredibly open about his rise and fall in the political scene, his indiscretions, failed marriage and woven through all of it is God's grace.I have to admit to not knowing who Rod was before his email.  I'm not up on politics in Missouri where he was in office, but he was the House Speaker and gained that prestige within four years to being elected to the state legislature.  He was also marked as a possible candidate for the Governor's office at a future date. That in itself is heady information.  He did an awful lot of good for the Republican Party while he was in office, but that's not all of what the book is about---the point of his writing it in the first place, is to minister to others who get caught up in the glamour and ego-building lifestyle of being success-oriented, no matter what occupation.  Of wanting what we want at the cost of everything, whether it be our marriages, morals, or faith. He suffered through each of these and more.With the help of God Almighty, his parents and close friends, Rod was able to turn his life around.  I'm not saying it was easy, since it came at a huge cost, but he is recovering.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's so driven that they've forgotten their roots.  We can become so enamored with fame and success that we forget God's hand on us.  That's Rod's point.  To warn of the dangers of becoming so entrenched in work, especially if the job becomes our main focus, that we neglect our families and our faith.  There's a price to pay, and hopefully with the ministry of Rod's book, many men and women can heed his warning. Sadly though, we think it'll never happen to us.(i received this book free to review for my honest opinion)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R339CD7FY0KIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991312627#wasThisHelpful","R339CD7FY0KIE","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The overriding feeling that hit me during and after reading Myquillyn Smith's book 'The Nesting Place' was sweetness.  Not the sugary type, but honest sweetness.  That's how Smith comes across, like just an awfully nice person.  I read about her family moving so many times, suffering from financial hardship, rearranging their lives over and over again, and was struck with how solid her marriage appears to be.  I was encouraged.Add to that she knows how to decorate on the proverbial shoestring, which is what the book is really about.  Because of tight times, she's learned how to make her home inviting and cozy with minimal resources.  You'd never know it, though.  Judging by the photographs of the rooms in her house, the first impression is style and maybe even a bit of opulence.And to compare my house to hers would be ludicrous.  I could learn a thing or two.  She weeds through her things and either tosses what she doesn't need, or uses less items to style her rooms.  I tend to put it all in.  In one exercise, she recommends taking out everything except the furniture.  To take out the accessories and items that are flexible.  Then she says to put back only what's necessary.  Brilliant.  I should do this.I highly recommend her book, partly because of the practical knowledge she shares, and also because she deserves kudos for providing a new way to think about interior design.  I applaud her.  I really do.

"While I have to admit this book will help many couples understand how to enjoy a satisfying sex life, I found several parts of the book uncomfortable to read.  I realize folks want to know what to think, but sometimes more isn't better.The author leaves no stone unturned, it seems, and covers all the areas a couple might have questions about. I take issue, however, with the emphasis on having so many paper towels on hand in the bedroom--how messy the act is---and how a person can make clean-up easier.  Please.  And as for details about personal grooming--do you think it'll go over well for a husband or wife to nudge his mate and share how unhygienic they are?  Some of the details would be best left alone.When descriptions are clinical and maybe too obvious, I think some of the magic leaves.  No book is a one-stop shopping sort of enterprise.  Yes, she covers many topics that people want to know, but is there anything wrong with just finding out on your own?  Do we have to have one more self-help about sex?  Hasn't it all been covered before?  Are we so clueless?Yes, her book is thorough.  But not sure it's what I'd want to pass out to anyone.

"Lisa Samson has a gift for telling a story behind the story.  Her books are never light, and always give a refreshing spiritual uplift.  I've thought before that in some way she personally identifies with her heroines---that she puts herself, or the way she thinks into her main characters.  There's a common thread in each of her books that always appeals to me.  And she's done it again with 'Runaway Saint.'This one is about a young married couple who live a wonderfully artsy life.  They run an old-style printing company and Samson goes into a great deal of detail telling of the antique equipment they use/buy (which was a bit confusing and overwhelming), but was probably necessary to the story.  Their shop is full of unusual people, more than I run into during an ordinary day, and this is a typical Samson trait, always a treat.  Sara, the main character, has a long-lost aunt, Bel, who moves back into town after being a missionary in Kasakhstan and the strange behavior of her aunt is the curious thread that drives the story.Her aunt has a secret---really many secrets, and little by little they come to light.  What Samson tells isn't always pretty, sometimes painful, but the ending to this story is perfect, and I never saw it coming.  Highly recommended.

"Jane Kirkpatrick's monumental undertaking (at least from my point of view) called 'Emma of Aurora' was impressive.  This weighty book, over 1,000 pages is three books in one including 'A Clearing in the Wind' (2006), 'A Tendering in the Storm' (2007), and 'A Mending at the Edge' (2008).  For fans of Kirkpatrick's, this is a treasure to own.The vast majority of characters introduced in the books are taken from real life incidents, and her re-telling of the events of their lives is done thoroughly and with style. Kirkpatrick writes beautiful dialogue and her characters are believable.  And even though I'm not keen on saga-style writing, she does it well.  Her research and the bibliography at the end of the book are impressive.The books tell of the life in the 1800's of Emma Wagner, who at a young age marries a rising star in, what appears to be, a cult.  She marries for love at the beginning of the series, suffers a loss and in the second book (which I found a bit disturbing) has to recover from that loss and, as a result, makes some very bad decisions.For anyone who enjoys fiction/non-fiction set in the days of America's early days of the frontier, this is the series to read.

"To be honest, I thought William Sirls' newest book called 'The Sinners' Garden' began with too much unnecessary detail.  He walks you through every noise and action of the characters, which I found mildly irritating. Less is really more, even in writing.That said, his story is interesting to the point of being hard to put down.  Several parts of it are strange and hard to believe, but they work just the same.The book is partly about Judi, an abused wife and mother of Andy, who as a small boy suffered a disfiguring accident, yet he grows up not knowing what really happened since the truth is kept hidden.  The story is also about Judi's brother, Rip, and his involvement in the incident with her son. Heather, the small-town police officer, former girlfriend of Rip, is also caught up in the thick of the mystery.  Everything revolves around how they struggled and lived after that life-changing situation.  After telling about the tragedy in the Prologue, the story flashes forward eleven years later with the child, Andy, having grown up into a very bitter and angry young man.  Oddly enough, the anger is all directed at his mother, and the readers don't know why he comes across this way.  I did find it frustrating to read the story told at times from the young man's point of view, which slipped in at different spots, and wasn't consistent throughout the book.  He'd comment in an ugly way on his mom's outfit or her expression, and that comment was told to the reader in the author's voice.  That was confusing.But even so, I enjoyed the book.  Sirls uses a science fiction/fantasy style with Christian overtones.  He has characters seeing things or hearing things that seem out of place in an ordinary day, but as I said, they do work.  It's a good story and one I'd recommend even with my picky fussing.  I just think Sirls needs to polish up on his style.(i received this book free to review from booksneeze/thomas nelson)","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9E08M3NJQVMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNBECY8#wasThisHelpful","R9E08M3NJQVMJ","A3CYEO4TZG97EK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CYEO4TZG97EK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Christa Parrish's book called 'Stones for Bread' is mesmerizing. After downloading the e-book to review, I instantly began reading, only to look forward so much to the next night's installment. Parrish's book is amazingly full of bread recipes, rich dialogue, and characters that are unique and totally believable.  I loved it.About depression:  ""In my mother, as dishes piled up and cocoons of dust huddled in corners and her dark moments overcame her.  No one should have to shrink this way.""Her sentences grab you and cause you to take notice.  I couldn't take it all in---such a beautiful story.It's about a young woman, in her thirties, who's the owner of an artisan-style bakery.  Her bread is all original and far beyond anything I've ever tried to bake.  Works of art.  That's what Liesl McNamara creates.  But she has baggage.  The pain of her mother's suicide, and her dad's re-birth into the church which causes Liesl heartache since she feels he's in part abandoned her.  Plus she becomes involved in a relationship which puts her in the position to make difficult choices.  Oh, and she's chosen to take part in a televised bake-off with a famous fancy baker.  Lots going on, and highly recommended.My only regret is that I wasn't able to receive a print copy of the book.  Would love to thumb through it, underlining and turning down corners.  I marked several passages, and with the Kindle, that's sort of difficult. Not impossible, but do-able.  Might order the hard copy just because.

"The introduction to 'Awakening Faith' which is compiled by James Stuart Bell and Patrick J. Kelly says the following: ""Perceptive readers will notice the Fathers' almost exclusive focus on personal virtue rather than broader societal changes, which may be frustrating at first blush to Christians whose understanding gives primacy to social justice.""Current evangelical writers place a lot of importance on voting, morality based on social issues and post modern thinking.  The writers in 'Awakening Faith' talk about self-discipline, guarding your hearts, sacrifice, and cut to the heart of what a believer's life should represent.  They talk about personal responsibility in the light of Who Christ really is.I find it very refreshing and a wonderful resource for morning or evening devotions.  And for me as an Anglican to be able to read the Early Church Fathers is a joy.  Many of the names are familiar to me from the Book of Common Prayer and are also mentioned in 'The Way of a Pilgrim', another classic.  I also appreciate that a thorough list is given at the back of the book telling basic facts about the Church Fathers.

I decided to try it with my French Press using the recipe at http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-perfectly-robust-french-press-coffee-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-113601 as a guide.Well, it turns out that this did the trick because I got a really robust, great tasting brew that equals any I have ever made at home, and may even be the best.This could very well become my regular 'go to' coffee.End of Update.This is a good all around basic coffee with a nice flavor, excellent aroma and no bitterness.  It also has a very reasonable selling price.I would, however, not make it my regular brew.

"One of the best , if not the best, cups of coffee I have ever brewed. When opening the bag the aroma was very fresh and  ""coffee-ie"". To me, it is medium bodied but full flavored with absolutely no bitterness. It is very smooth and well-rounded in taste and I noticed no subtle or unique flavors, only an excellent coffee flavor.I like that it is a medium-dark roast because a medium roast usually lacks boldness whereas a dark roast can be too overbearing with that too toasted, often bitter, taste. This comes off as being the best solution between the two.This coffee is so good I can leave it at room temperature for hours in a tight lid jar or thermos, and after SLOWLY reheating it, it will taste just about as good as when first brewed.The beans are a combination of 50% Honduran Peaberry/50% Guatemalan San Antonio.And, the price is outstanding for these high quality coffee beans!This will be my regular java from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1UYC45314S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY95FBU#wasThisHelpful","RK1UYC45314S9","A204QN2VRUQA9B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A204QN2VRUQA9B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, the good news. I am retired and usually have my 3rd and 4th cups of coffee about 6,8 or 10 or so hours after my first two. This thermos will keep the flavor of the original brew when I SLOWLY reheat it, and this is good.Now, the bad. This was made in China and it seems, and has the feel, of a cheap product. It is quite thin and the interior reminds me of chrome rather than stainless steel. The top of the container so thin it is almost sharp and this is not good when I have to wash it.The top, after a number of uses, is still difficult to take off and it is by no means a smooth removal.The worse part is the Number 5 in the triangle on the plastic top. This number indicates it is subject to having the most toxins in the plastic. Number 1 and Number 2 are the best numbers and indicate no BPA.  Since I only use the thermos to pour from AND NOT DRINK FROM THE LID, this does not concern me too much and I will keep it.

"I am an engineer who has been completely disgusted with the home lighting situation. There are no standards and many misstatements and counterdictions at the stores. I own a Minolta flash meter which accurately measures a lights color temperature. I've tried the bulb technology at Walmart, Sams Club Home Depot and Lowes. The most glaring examples:1) yellow light is called soft white (2700)2) very blue washed-out color light is called daylight (6000-6500)3) Low lumen (400-600 lumens) LED lights go for as much as $90!4) Some bulbs are advertised as white but the chart on the back shows its yellow. Go Figure!Here are the bulbs to avoid: all (harsh washed-out blue) daylight, and (yellow) soft white. The GE Reveal offers somewhat better clarity, but is overpriced and quite yellow.Full spectrum (5000-5500) bulbs are a step-up but stores offer a very limited selection. The Home Depot full 100w spectrum's beats the Lowe's Ott-Lite.On the LED front Sam's Club carries a 520 lumen, 4100K, 9 LED PAR38 reflector which has a easily noticeable smoother light spectrum. Great for the one light on in the kitchen in the evening. The equivalent $70 LED lights at the hardware store are hardly a bargain, as the Sam's is $20! However its Color Retention index (CRI)is only 74.The best of all are lights are these 5500K Alzo's. I've installed a 45w in the kitchen pantry and the color of the food boxes really pop. Food looks like it does in the magazines. The clarity is first rate (however 27w should be sufficient). They are the reference to which others are to be compared. My wife has not complained even when they are on at night-time. This is a first.Skin tones in the bathroom look very natural. A first again.Color temperature alone is not the sole basis to buy a bulb as a high CRI is also required. The Alzo's come in at 92, which is very high. Most manufactures do not even list this measurable figure (assume because its too low).I've been testing other bulbs. For vanity and lamps (Alzo does make any) these offer a VERY uniform ball of nice white 5000K glow. I ordered 12 for my new house's bathrooms:Maxlite 14 Watt G30 Globe CFL DL SKM14EGDLFor kitchen these are now the best 5000K PAR lights. Not as high of color quality as Alzo, but they don't make reflector lights!Maxlite 23 Watt CFL R40 Flood Day Lite SKR423FLDLIn summary best home lights are the Photo CFL which offer both a 5000-5500K range with a CRI over 90. Further these bulbs allow for brighter rooms, as compared to hardware store types. That is, the more pleasing light allows for greater brightness levels, so go for the 45watt bulbs in larger pantries or rooms.Thanks go to Amazon and Alzo for allowing consumers to purchase superior quality products at a price no higher than the unpleasant and unsatisfying bulbs in the store.

"I am an engineer who has been completely disgusted with the home lighting situation. There are no standards and many misstatements and counterdictions at the stores. I own a Minolta flash meter which accurately measures a lights color temperature. I've tried the bulb technology at Walmart, Sams Club Home Depot and Lowes. The most glaring examples:1) yellow light is called soft white (2700)2) very blue washed-out color light is called daylight (6000-6500)3) Low lumen (400-600 lumens) LED lights go for as much as $90!4) Some bulbs are advertised as white but the chart on the back shows its yellow. Go Figure!Here are the bulbs to avoid: all (harsh washed-out blue) daylight, and (yellow) soft white. The GE Reveal offers somewhat better clarity, but is overpriced and quite yellow.Full spectrum (5000-5500) bulbs are a step-up but stores offer a very limited selection. The Home Depot full 100w spectrum's beats the Lowe's Ott-Lite.On the LED front Sam's Club carries a 520 lumen, 4100K, 9 LED PAR38 reflector which has a easily noticeable smoother light spectrum. Great for the one light on in the kitchen in the evening. The equivalent $70 LED lights at the hardware store are hardly a bargain, as the Sam's is $20! However its Color Retention index (CRI)is only 74.The best of all are lights are these 5500K Alzo's. I've installed a 45w in the kitchen pantry and the color of the food boxes really pop. Food looks like it does in the magazines. The clarity is first rate (however 27w should be sufficient). They are the reference to which others are to be compared. My wife has not complained even when they are on at night-time. This is a first.Skin tones in the bathroom look very natural. A first again.Color temperature alone is not the sole basis to buy a bulb as a high CRI is also required. The Alzo's come in at 92, which is very high. Most manufactures do not even list this measurable figure (assume because its too low).I've been testing other bulbs. For vanity and lamps (Alzo does make any) these offer a VERY uniform ball of nice white 5000K glow. I ordered 12 for my new house's bathrooms:Maxlite 14 Watt G30 Globe CFL DL SKM14EGDLFor kitchen these are now the best 5000K PAR lights. Not as high of color quality as Alzo, but they don't make reflector lights!Maxlite 23 Watt CFL R40 Flood Day Lite SKR423FLDLIn summary best home lights are the Photo CFL which offer both a 5000-5500K range with a CRI over 90. Further these bulbs allow for brighter rooms, as compared to hardware store types. That is, the more pleasing light allows for greater brightness levels, so go for the 45watt bulbs in larger pantries or rooms.Thanks go to Amazon and Alzo for allowing consumers to purchase superior quality products at a price no higher than the unpleasant and unsatisfying bulbs in the store.

Then I had to wait until the next hour time to see if the hard disks still spun-up like clockwork.Finally the Samsung Magician process was identified as the malware. I disabled it in the Windows Task Scheduler.There is no discussion or user setting to disable this fragrant violation of owner/user privacy.If i am misinformed I will update this review.

"I am an engineer who has been completely disgusted with the home lighting situation. There are no standards and many misstatements and counterdictions at the stores. I own a Minolta flash meter which accurately measures a lights color temperature. I've tried the bulb technology at Walmart, Sams Club Home Depot and Lowes. The most glaring examples:1) yellow light is called soft white (2700)2) very blue washed-out color light is called daylight (6000-6500)3) Low lumen (400-600 lumens) LED lights go for as much as $90!4) Some bulbs are advertised as white but the chart on the back shows its yellow. Go Figure!Here are the bulbs to avoid: all (harsh washed-out blue) daylight, and (yellow) soft white. The GE Reveal offers somewhat better clarity, but is overpriced and quite yellow.Full spectrum (5000-5500) bulbs are a step-up but stores offer a very limited selection. The Home Depot full 100w spectrum's beats the Lowe's Ott-Lite.On the LED front Sam's Club carries a 520 lumen, 4100K, 9 LED PAR38 reflector which has a easily noticeable smoother light spectrum. Great for the one light on in the kitchen in the evening. The equivalent $70 LED lights at the hardware store are hardly a bargain, as the Sam's is $20! However its Color Retention index (CRI)is only 74.The best of all are lights are these 5500K Alzo's. I've installed a 45w in the kitchen pantry and the color of the food boxes really pop. Food looks like it does in the magazines. The clarity is first rate (however 27w should be sufficient). They are the reference to which others are to be compared. My wife has not complained even when they are on at night-time. This is a first.Skin tones in the bathroom look very natural. A first again.Color temperature alone is not the sole basis to buy a bulb as a high CRI is also required. The Alzo's come in at 92, which is very high. Most manufactures do not even list this measurable figure (assume because its too low).I've been testing other bulbs. For vanity and lamps (Alzo does make any) these offer a VERY uniform ball of nice white 5000K glow. I ordered 12 for my new house's bathrooms:Maxlite 14 Watt G30 Globe CFL DL SKM14EGDLFor kitchen these are now the best 5000K PAR lights. Not as high of color quality as Alzo, but they don't make reflector lights!Maxlite 23 Watt CFL R40 Flood Day Lite SKR423FLDLIn summary best home lights are the Photo CFL which offer both a 5000-5500K range with a CRI over 90. Further these bulbs allow for brighter rooms, as compared to hardware store types. That is, the more pleasing light allows for greater brightness levels, so go for the 45watt bulbs in larger pantries or rooms.Thanks go to Amazon and Alzo for allowing consumers to purchase superior quality products at a price no higher than the unpleasant and unsatisfying bulbs in the store. Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5L8DMNR7O9X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018OS06S#wasThisHelpful","R5L8DMNR7O9X7","A3N4I2KRSMACW8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4I2KRSMACW8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The unit works partially as advertised and correctly receives and displays the current outdoor temperature, humidity, time and date.However all four days of forecast are wildly incorrect. The MSN weather source here in my large metropolitan area must be sending bogus data to the weather station. I've compared the WMS802 forecast to the local TV broadcasters and Internet sources such as AccuWeather. They are correct and the WMS802 is not.Investigation reveals that MSN Direct service is now targeted to the latest GPS mobile devices and annual subscriptions. For some reason these devices don't display the four day forecast. Further MSN Direct offers no support for Oregon Scientific owners. Oregon Scientific support says they will get back with you promptly - within SEVEN business days! Lastly MSN Direct charges $129 for a lifetime subscription fee for each device. Looks like Oregon Scientific customers are caught in the middle with no way out.I was hoping to eliminate maintaining my own outdoor sensor by purchasing the WMS802, but I have no choice but to go back.

"This case is perfect for my Stratocaster - It is a very snug fit, which is what you want so your Strat doesn't move around in the case. The Douglas EGC-350ST is adequately padded (not as much as more expensive cases, but enough to surround your guitar with soft surfaces). Before putting my guitar in the case, I checked thoroughly to ensure there were no sharp objects in the case that my guitar could get scratched on, I did find one exposed staple however it was in the inside of the lid of the storage compartment and was flush to the surface. I love the size of the case, it is compact, yet there is room for picks, a strap & other small items in the storage compartment.It also has a very attractive tweed pattern on the case, in a nice shades of gold & tan - it is not yellowy like it appears in the photographs. All-in-all this is a very good case for a Stratocaster (I didn't try my Telecaster in it, but I imagine it would fit nicely as well.) It is light, compact, and perfect for my needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K26ESW2U916O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLZNOHA#wasThisHelpful","R3K26ESW2U916O","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all this is an absolutely beautiful guitar! I mean it is stunning. However as my 8 year old daughter said to me today -""What's most important is how it sounds"". Well this guitar sounds as good as it looks. I was not expecting it to be this good given the price-point this guitar sells at. I figured the pickups would probably be adequate, but no better. Boy was I ever wrong - the pickups on this 'Les Paul look-alike' are outstanding! The tones at each of the 3 positions of the selector are fantastic, the volume & tone knobs operate smoothly and just as they should. (The only gripe about the knobs are they do not fit flush to the body on mine, in fact there is quite a space as if the shafts are too long  Minor nit-picky gripe aside. I'm amazed that you can buy a mahogany bodied, maple necked (rosewood fretboard) guitar with body & neck binding, mother or pearl look fret-marker inlays, with a set neck, proper tuners, chrome or chrome-like covers over the dual humbuckers, and a gorgeous transparent purple finish at this price. Mine came perfectly set-up. All I had to do is tune it. The neck is well done, the fret ends are smooth, there are no dead frets and no fret buzz. IMO this guitar could easily sell for 2 or 3 times the price and still be considered a good value. Other than the 'too log' shafts on the volume & tone control of my OE20 the only other nit-pick worth mentioning is that the 3-way toggle doesn't feel as sturdy as it could, yet it works fine. Everything else feels like it would be at home on a much more expensive guitar (well maybe not the pickguard - it's fine but nothing special).If you are considering an OE20, my advice would be - go for it. This is a guitar that begs to be played. It's enjoyable to play for hours at a time. In fact you probably won't want to put it down. I know I don't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CBRRJX0JYA1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FLSLSY#wasThisHelpful","R3CBRRJX0JYA1Z","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anything that can help maintain my acoustic guitars at a proper relative humidity is okay with me. Having had a beloved Epiphone FT-120's neck warp after 38 years taught me a valuable lesson - don't let your guitars get too dry! After buying a new acosutic (a Yamaha FG710S) I decided to keep one of these Planet Wave humidfiers in the case at all times, as they came highly recommended. I use distilled water as recommended and moisten the sponge every 3 days or so as needed. When I'm playing the guitar I put the humidifier in a ziplock bag and store it in the case.I've had no issues using this humidfier & like it so much I bought one for my Epiphone as well (I'm planning on getting it repaired - as you just don't say goodbye to one of your favorite guitars after 38 years).Be sure to keep some replacement sponges on hand, and again use distilled water as recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NVKJUXJ7BFS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D0COE#wasThisHelpful","R3NVKJUXJ7BFS0","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally a comfortable pick that I don't drop! After using the same brand & style of pick since 1968, I've found myself dropping my picks more & more  in my old age. Let me tell you, it is both inconvenient & embarrassing to do, especially in the middle of a song. I decided I would try these textured picked (I prefer medium) and not only are they nice looking & comfortable, but I don't drop them! In fact since I started using these picks I haven't dropped one - not even once! I now keep a few of these Fred Kelly picks in each of my guitar cases.

"When I bought my first electric guitar, a Telecaster, the sales person suggested the Fender 25R Frontman amplifier to me. However I decided to go with a Champion 40 instead, thinking I wanted something with a few more 'bells & whistles' as the Champion has many voices &  effects built into it. After I was playing a while the number of amps and guitars in my collection started going up as I added a Frontman 10 bedroom amp, a Champion 20, as well as a few Stratocasters and a Les Paul guitar. It seemed every time I went into my local guitar store to try out a few different guitars, I found myself seeking out that neat red amplifier with the nice reverb on it. I would pass by the expensive large amps with all kinds of features, and would plug into the 25R. I love the clear clean sound that they 25R amp provides in spades. At times a 25R wasn't available and I would plug into a much more expensive amp, but when one became available I would switch amps. I especially love the wonderful reverb. Also the overdrive & volume of this amp are very impressive. I also appreciated the straightforward controls the 25R has. Input jack, Rotary knobs for Volume, Gain, (a button to turn the drive/gain on or off)  Rotary knobs for Drive Volume, Treble , Middle,  Bass, & Reverb level - auxilary jacks, Foot Switch Jack, Earphone Jack, & Power (On/Off) switch - There you have it - all you need for great sound out of a 25 Watt amplifier. Again the sound of this amp is extremely impressive and I found it perfect to compare various guitars abilities for clean sound, overdrive, and of course the outstanding reverb that this amp has in spades. Finally I saw that fewer & fewer 25R amps were available and decided to get one before they were all gone. I called the manager of my local guitar store and he found me a brand new one still sealed in its box and had it shipped to the store for me. I have bigger amps, I have amps with a lot more features, but I find that my Frontman amps (both the diminutive 10, and it's impressive big brother the 25R) are the shining stars of my sound equipment. I truly find that the 25R is all I need in a home amplifier - excellent sound and excellent reverb. I highly recommend this amplifier - Get one before they are gone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R101WK0RNYOE5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UEZB2K#wasThisHelpful","R101WK0RNYOE5S","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am blown away by the quality of this case!  It is well-made, well-padded, looks terrific & fits my Epiphone Les Paul like a glove, (and my Les Paul looks terrific in the case as well). I only wish I could have found fitted cases like this for my Stratocasters & Telecaster. This is just a terrific case. When I first opened it I immediately noticed that there was no strong 'new case' odor. (I usually air out a new case for a day or two before putting my guitar in it. There was no need to with this case.) I really appreciate the 'safety latch' on the opposite side from where you open it, this looks like added protection from the case inadvertently flying open. The case also has a locking latch for security, however please note that it only comes with one key - another key would be nice, just in case (no pun intended). A nice touch is the very large, well-cushioned carrying handle which allows you to maintain a comfortable grip. The metal feet on the back & the bottom of the case are also appreciated - You can actually stand the case up on the floor without leaning it on something due to the feet on the bottom (I'd be worried a pet might bump it an knock it over though). As stated, the interior is very well padded, and it features a wonderful covered compartment in which to carry accessories such as picks, a tuner, a strap or an instrument cable etc.I really like the fact that because it is made for a specific model guitar, the Epiphone Les Paul case is no bigger than it has to be. You'll be surprised at how compact it is. Not only will this easily fit in the 'way back' of my SUV, but it will also easily fit in my convertible which I can't say for my large ABS cases that I keep my Telecaster & Stratocasters in. Granted the large ABS cases have lots of bins for storage inside, they are also heavy & more difficult to carry around, where this case is much easier to carry & has enough storage for just what you need to take along with your Les Paul Guitar.For the price paid I wasn't expecting such a nice guitar case. I was pleasantly surprised.

"The Epiphone Les Paul 100 is a lot of guitar for the money. First of all it has two wonderful humbucker pickups (at the bridge & neck), separate volume & tone controls for each pickup and of course the classic Les Paul 3-way toggle to select bridge pickup, both Bridge & neck, or neck pickup. It has a bolt-on neck (rather than a glued neck) which IMO is not a bad thing, it is a bit thinner than your typical Les Paul which makes it light (a good thing). Still for the $250-$300 usually paid for a Les Paul 100, you get proper tuners (which are very good) a nice finish (mine is Hertitage Cherry Sunburst) and the wonderful Les Paul sound in a well-constructed, nicely-crafted guitar. The 12"" radius neck feels wonderful, and I found no sharp fret-ends on the rosewood fretboard. All controls work just as they should (volume, tone, pickup selectors) and the tones this guitar is capable of are wonderful.This is a guitar that although it is value-priced, it isn't and doesn't look, feel or sound 'cheap'. It's a guitar you can happily play for many years  and want to keep.What you don't get on this guitar that you might get on a higher priced guitar is as previously mentioned - a glue-on neck (this one is bolted on) fancy large inlayed fret markers (this has the usual dot markers common on many guitars) and binding on the body. The later two are more cosmetic than anything and doesn't change the fact that this guitar looks & sounds wonderful.I own many more expensive guitars, but I find that the Les Paul 100 is a very enjoyable guitar to play. My 8 year-old daughter refers to it as my ""pretty"" guitar, and indeed it is very nice-looking. The proof is in the playing, and this is a guitar that you won't want to put down. The lighter weight also makes playing very enjoyable and I've yet to experience a sore back playing (the weight is one of the reasons I choose this over other Les Paul models).Don't let the reasonable price fool you - this is a very good guitar that you won't be sorry you purchased -not a month from now, not a year from now & most likely you'll still be enjoying it years & years from now. It's that good & it's a great value.

"First the positives - The Epiphone Slash AFD is nicely finished and even has body binding. The built in tuner (on the bezel for the bridge pickup) works well. The pickups are very decent, especially for a guitar at the price-point, and the sound is very good. It really is a nice looking guitar, comfortable in that it's a bit thinner and lighter than a standard Les Paul, and it is priced right. The gig bag is decent, but you probably would want more padding if you are going to be carrying it around much. The strap is okay, the picks are a nice touch.So why not 5 stars? Unfortunately, the guitar does have some negatives as well. First are the tuners - it has very low quality tuners and the guitar I received could not stay in tune, not even for strumming a few chords. The 'A' string was constantly out of tune. In fairness, the 'A' string's tuning peg felt like mush, so it could have simply been a defective tuner, but in any case - a better set of tuners would be in order. Secondly the strings the guitar comes with are not very good, not only that mine were covered with some kind of sticky substance. I don't know what the coating is for, but I would change the strings. Probably the biggest negative for me was the fret-ends were very sharp & rough needing a good sanding/polishing. Again it may have been this particular guitar as I have seen similar Epiphones with decent frets unfortunately the guitar I received was not one of them. As for playability otherwise, I had my luthier adjust the action because it had a great deal of fret-buzz and it did help quite a bit.Overall, it's an okay guitar that can be made better with a few modifications, and it is a decent but not outstanding value in my opinion.With a little work this could be a very decent guitar with a lot going for it, however if you spend a little more you can buy an Epiphone Les Paul with proper (better quality) tuners & separate tone & volume controls for each pickup. It depends on what you want/like. If you like the style of the Slash AFD Les Paul (and again, it looks great) it's not a bad guitar at all, but you'll probably want to change out the tuners & dress the frets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TLN1RKQA7CXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQCRJ8K#wasThisHelpful","R1TLN1RKQA7CXA","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one fantastic guitar. The build quality, fit & finish, features & playability & tone are all first-rate. I own a number of guitars including a Fender Deluxe Stratocaster & a Telecaster FSR and this Squier Deluxe Stratocaster can hold its own against it's Fender cousins. I absolutely love the HSH configuration. This beauty can play anything from metal to country, jazz & blues. (You can coil-split the humbuckers at the 2 & 4 positions) The locking tuners & 2 point tremolo are also wonderful features. The pickups are excellent and I wouldn't even consider swapping them out for pricier ones. The neck is beautiful, fret-ends smooth, and the Crimson Red Transparent finish is absolutely stunning, as is the flame maple top and the pearloid pickguard. Don't let the 'Crafted in China' stamp dissuade you - this is one exceptional guitar made by Fender. It's also an exceptional value. In fact, I doubt you could find a more versatile guitar at twice the price. If you're considering buying one, my advice is get one before they're gone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B8O2G5J940FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7Q5EO8#wasThisHelpful","R2B8O2G5J940FT","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Given the mixed reviews here, I was curious as to how the Chord Buddy would work. Actually I was curious as to IF it would actually work, and this is what I've found thus far - Once you get the Chord Buddy installed on your guitar properly it works like a charm. I installed mine on a Squier Strat and found it was very easy to adjust properly. Within a minute or so I was playing chords easily and could work on my timing & strumming. Shortly thereafter I was playing LaBamba. I believe that it is important to make sure you install it absolutely in the proper position. I did find that it fits my Squier Strat better than the acoustic I also tried it on (although it does fit the acoustic, just not quite as well - a bit of string buzz, but still playable).I can't speak as to whether the Chord Buddy will actually help with finger dexterity (it very well could) or help actually learning to play the chords (it might) since I've had it less than a week, but it certainly helps me work on timing & strumming as I mentioned above.I do believe the Chord Buddy will be an excellent tool to get my daughter more interested in playing the guitar and that is definitely a good thing. I think it's a great idea, and time will tell how well it helps with finger dexterity.

"This Stratocaster has to be the most versatile guitar I own. The 'voices' the Lone Star is capable of are amazing. You can go from playing metal with the strong humbucker at the bridge to rock, country as well as soothing  mellow jazz & blues tones from the Texas Specials at the middle & neck. A great feature is the ability to split the bridge humbucker to play it as a single coil pickup. Fender really outdid themselves on this model packing high quality pickups into a beautifully built quality guitar. The Ocean Turquoise color is beautiful as is the maple fretboard. The workmanship is amazing.  This truly is a smooth playing guitar with great sounds, and it's a great value as well. In fact, based on the way it looks, feels, & sounds, you would swear this was a $2,500 - $3,000 guitar - It's that good. I honestly don't think I could find a guitar that I could possibly enjoy more at any price.

"I first used an SN-8 while visiting a local  music store & was amazed at it's speed, tuning accuracy and easy to read display. (In fact it put my electronic tuner to shame). The following week I ordered one for myself. Once again this little tuner amazes me. I've used it on my Telecaster, my Strat and my vintage acoustic Epiphone, and it always tunes my guitars quickly, precisely and no matter which headstock I put it in I can always find a position where it is very easy to see & read (which was not the case with my other clip-on tuner). I especially like the thick rubber grips that hold it snuggly to the headstock and the large, clear display. The Snark SN-8 is very easy to use & relatively inexpensive.

"This is a great idea that goes wrong with an large oversized button that makes it virtually impossible to attach a guitar strap to it. Once I got my strap attached to the button it appears that the button itself is about to fall off of the rivet. I've been playing the guitar for 46 years  and have used countless straps on my guitars, so I know how to carefully attach a strap. The main problem is that the button is too large, now with a button that looks like it is about to come apart from the rivet, if I use this, I risk dropping my vintage guitar on the floor. This is a risk I'm not willing to take. For the $8.95 price I paid for this, it really isn't worth returning it, too bad the button isn't fastened to the rivet better and too bad the button is so large.

I also like that it could apparently also easily hold my acoustic Epiphone. Unfortunately when I opened the package I was underwhelmed by the build quality, but the worst flaw was that some on the padding was already worn off of the cradle right about where the front edge of both my Tele & Strat would sit on this stand.

"he Roadmaster Granite Peak Mountain Peak Mountain Bike is an excellent value. Keep in mind this is a relatively inexpensive bike, so don't expect an ultra-light weight bicycle. Still it is not what I would consider a heavy bike either, in fact it is a well-made bike with 18 speeds and thoughtful touches such as a quick adjustable seat. It has excellent tires to ride on rough dirt trails or commute on a city street. The handlebars have a slight upward bend and are positioned very comfortably. We purchased ours (for my wife) at a local big box store and then took it to our local bike shop to have it adjusted properly. Once adjusted we were pleasantly surprised at how well everything works.The brakes work great & the shifters work easily & are precise. The only thing I would change on the bike would be to replace the very hard seat with a more comfortable memory foam seat. (My personal preference is memory foam as opposed to gel seats, because gel seat have a tendency to leak as they get older). Also my wife added a water bottle holder & water bottle - (The mounting screw are already on the frame).Speaking of the frame, it is painted a very attractive shade of teal with purple accents, and it is a very good looking and functional bike.

"I own a Squire Bullet Strat HH in Blue Sparkle with a white pickboard, other than the colors, it is pretty much the same guitar as this black beauty sold here.This guitar is an AMAZING value. Although described as a 'beginner's guitar' I can tell you that this is a nice guitar for anyone who enjoys playing and the dual-coil humbucker pickups are wonderful on an electric guitar at virtually any price due to fantastic sound and their lack of hum through the amplifier.Yes, this guitar's body is constructed of basswood so it is light in weight, but be careful not to ding it up, as basswood has fine acoustic qualities but is a softer wood so it will dent rather easily if not careful with it.My other electric is an Ash wood bodied Fender Telecaster FSR, which is heavier and sounds terrific as Telecasters do, so when I bought this Strat I wasn't expecting much (other than virtually noiseless humbucker pickups). However, as soon as I started playing the Strat I realized I was wrong - Not only does it sound great, but the overall construction of the guitar is wonderful, the fit, finish and quality rivals guitars easily costing three times what I paid for this beauty. Another pleasant surprise was I found that it stays in tune. I've played my Strat for hours and hours and I have not had to re-tune it. Of course if you like using the 'whammy' (tremolo) bar be prepared to tune it often, as the type of tremolo bridge on these guitars will put the guitar out of tune quickly when used. Fortunately I don't use the tremolo bar, and in regular playing, this guitar stays in tune beautifully.This Squire Bullet may not have the cache of it's more famous and more expensive relatives - the Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters, but it certainly shows its Fender bloodlines and is a very enjoyable guitar to own and most importantly, to play. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THEPYXTWD87D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B8IKO0#wasThisHelpful","R3THEPYXTWD87D","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased a Kaito KA 600, and also Kaito KA450 as a surprise gift for my daughter who is going into the second grade. I chose the KA600 radio for the following reasons: 1) It is equipped with electronic tuning complete with RDS on FM. 2) My entire family, including my daughter, appreciates a radio equipped with the NOAA weather bands 3) My family enjoys all kinds of music & sports and the KA600 has a easy to use digital tuner. 4) We all enjoy shortwave & again the KA600 ha shortwave bands. Quality issues aside (for the moment) KA600 has what appears to be far too many nice features too list here however the flash light, reading light, rechargeable (by hand crank or solar power) batteries are all nice touches. They also can produce 'just okay' sound (from the rather small speaker) and decent (but by no means great) volume without distortion. Unfortunately again quality is hit or miss - some radios appear to be okay, others pretty terrible. I found one disappointing issue with this model that seems consistent, generally poor (as in horrible) AM reception. In our area, with a KA600 weaker AM stations can be a real challenge to pull in (more so during the daytime) but more alarming is that even 50,000 Watt stations like WBZ Boston tend to suffer with static and interference most likely due to a rather small internal AM antenna, however if you take the time to reposition the radio you can usually find a position to listen to the major AM stations albeit with static (unfortunately with the KA600 you may appear to be partaking in a game of ""Twister"" just to get the latest sports scores) however the AM reception does seem to improve somewhat at night. Unfortunately, depending on whether you get a fairly decent one or a bad one this reception issue isn't just limited to AM. I've got one with almost decent FM reception and another that is absolutely dreadful (not to mention the ones we returned due to poor reception). Shortwave reception is poor as well. I wish I could give this radio a solid 5 Star rating however due to the quality issues IMO it doesn't even deserve 1 star. Make no mistake, these radios are absolute junk. Although we currently own two Kaito KA600 Multiband radios (one is just decent, one is  really bad). I prefer (less expensive) KA450, model better. In fact when you factor in the price difference the KA450, KA500 & KA550 would all be worth considering If only Kaito quality was where it should be. The idea is good, unfortunately something was lost in the execution, that something lost is quality.Again it's just too bad the quality is hit or miss and unfortunately it has been my experience that it is usually miss. I really wanted to like these radios, but because of the issues I've mentioned, cannot recommend them and rarely even use mine. In my opinion they are better suited for the trash bin than on my desk. What an absolute waste of money.10/1/2014 Update - These Kaito radios are very bad quality. The unit that I described as ""okay"" has proven to be as poorly made as the others. In fact when I extended the antenna last night, something sharp cut my finger, so I looked at the antenna - a sharp brass-like clip that apparently holds each section of the antenna to the next came out of the antenna and cut my finger. I was able to carefully re-install the top section of the antenna into the rest of the antenna, but it just proves how poorly made these radios are, using the cheapest quality components possible. Again, I would never buy another, nor would I recommend a Kaito radio. I'm also not happy that I was injured by this piece of rubbish.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S97OQMAVMV4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFCB1PC#wasThisHelpful","R1S97OQMAVMV4J","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find it difficult to find  well-built compact multiband radios these days, and when it comes to radios I'm a bit of a perfectionist. Some multiband radios currently on the market  lack any quality and are completely unacceptable. Fortunately I find the Sangean ATS 505P to be well-built and perfect for my needs. This compact radio packs a lot of great features in a compact package.

"The Grundig Satellit 750 is an excellent radio. Ive only owned mine for a few days short of a month, so I should say that I am still learning how to use all the features that it has. Reception of AM, FM & Shortwave is exceptional. AM with the rotatable antenna, FM & Shortwave with the very impressive telescopic antenna. I also have a very nice outdoor  40+ foot long-wire antenna hooked up to the shortwave and I must say that the built in telescopic antenna performs nearly as well as the long-wire. (I can't say the same for other shortwave receivers I own, but the Grundig's telescopic antenna is THAT GOOD).Sensitivity and reception is excellent on this radio. Equally impressive is control feel (sturdy & smooth), sound quality (excellent) and overall build quality. I waited for months for the Grundig 750 Satellit to come in and it was well worth the wait. I must also say that Eton/Grundig customer service is excellent as their friendly staff is always helpful.The first 750 Satellit I received arrived in an open box (seals were broken) and the owner's manual was clearly been used. I called Eton/Grundig and spoke to a tech specialist and he verfied that the box should have had the seals intact and when I asked him what he would do, he didn't hesitate to say that if it were him he would return it. Explaining that I purchased a ""new"" radio and should not accept an open box. Taking his advice, I returned the unit to Amazon (who were sold out at that time) but fortunately I found another major retailer that had some just arrive in stock.My present Grundig Satellit 750 arrived quickly and in perfect condition in a sealed box,  and I eagerly installed the 4 ""D"" cell alkaline batteries and begain enjoying my new receiver. Owning other shortwave receivers, I must say I am amazed at how many shortwave broadcasts this receiver pulls in with its telescopic antenna. Still, since I keep this unit on my desk next to my computer monitor, I do keep it hooked up to one of my long-wire antennas. A nice feature is a switch on the right side so you can easily switch between  an external antenna (such as my long-wire) and the internal (telescopic antenna). The rotatable AM antenna is also a very, very nice feature and it certainly pulls in far away AM stations with ease as well.As I previously stated, I'm still learning how to use all of the wonderful features of this Grundig (such as programming in stations to the pre-sets. I may call Eton/Grundig tech support for help with that) but what I have learned is what a wonderful and well-built receiver the Satellit 750 is.Since these are not inexpensive units (I paid $248.99 for mine), I personally recommend looking into an extended warranty if available. Fortunately the retailer I purchased mine from offered a 3 year warranty that even covers accidental damage from drops or spills, at a very resonable cost, so I did not hesitate to purchase the extended warranty.I am extremely pleased with the Grundig Satellit 750 receiver, and Eton/Grundig customer service. In fact I am enjoying mine so much I considered purchasing another as a Christmas gift for my father-in-law, as I think he would enjoy hearing broadcasts from around the world, not to mention the great reception of local and not-so-local AM & FM broadcasts.Although I still enjoy my old fashioned Realistic DX-100 shortwave receiver, and my other shortwave radios, I must say that overall the Grundig Satellit 750 is the best receiver I've ever owned. It would not be my first choice if I was looking for a truly portable radio, but it is certainly my first choice when looking for a receiver with the best overall performance (you can carry it around, it even has a carrying handle, but it is rather big and with 4 ""D"" cell batteries installed, rather heavy as well). In any case, it looks great on my desk (my trusty DX-100, and my very portable and exceptional performing Radio Shack 20-629 receiver) sit on my file cabinet right beside it.I highly recommend the Grundig 750 Satellit. In my opinion they are worth every penny of their MSRP. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase one again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X91SZRE6U310/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014T7W8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2X91SZRE6U310","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After suffering through many, many, really bad Kaitos only to return them to get more bad Kaitos (what happened to their quality?), this Radio Shack 20-629 Shortwave is a delight. It actually pulls in distant AM stations where the Kaitos (particularly the KA600) couldn't even pull in the close ones (It must have a very good Ferrite Rod AM antenna). The same goes for FM as well as shortwave. The signal strength & sensitivity is amazing. I am receiving strong reception of out-of-state FM stations that I didn't even know existed. It is powered by four AA batteries or an optional 6V AC adapter. This little gem of a radio is extremely well-made, well-designed, packed with useful and thoughtful features and performs flawlessly. The only thing that could possibly make it better is a NOAA station, but it's pretty darn perfect the way it is. In fact it's the best compact multiband radio I've seen in a long time.This gem of a multiband radio is packed with many useful & thoughtful features such as the fine tuning mode and the 'lock' switch (to prevent accidently turning off/on or changing stations). As stated, the sensitivity is amazing and it receives strong reception of AM-FM and Shortwave stations (much better than any other compact portable multiband I have used). The sound is excellent as well whether listening to music, news or shortwave. The long telescopic antenna is enough to pull in shortwave stations from around the world (as well as distant FM stations that come in strong & clear).  However I recently hooked it up to one of my external long-wire antennas and was absolutely blown away by the incredible shortwave reception (It rivals much more expensive receivers). Even at the original MSRP it would be an excellent value, and at the discounted prices it is now selling for it is an absolutely amazing value. I have not seen or used a portable multiband radio this impressive since Sanyo's RP 8700 debuted in 1975. If you familiarize yourself with this great little radio and all of its features and you will be amazed at its performance.I love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VZGU459343XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K58WL18#wasThisHelpful","R3VZGU459343XU","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I replaced a 16 year-old Bell Headlight on my mountain bike with the Bell Lumina 200 and found that I liked it so much I also put one on my 10 speed racer (which had a 'CatEye' headlight that was nowhere near as good as this Bell). I found the installation easy. I'm very appreciative that Bell includes extra rubber mounting strips so that these will fit on virtually any handlebar. These headlights produce more than enough light for any driving condition I encounter and I also like the flashing mode in order to be seen by others.These Bell Lumina headlights have proven to be trouble-free.

"My mountain bike came with a nicely padded Selle Royal seat but it still became uncomfortable after a mile or two. At first I was considering a memory foam seat pad until I saw the Bell Recline 825 Memory Foam Seat selling for about the same price as a pad. I didn't hesitate to order one via Amazon Prime and it arrived 2 days later. Installation was easy, as all I needed was a 6mm allen wrench. I adjusted the new seat to my liking and took a ride. This seat is amazing, as the miles went by I remained comfortable. The memory foam certainly does the trick, as this seat is virtually identical in size to my Selle Royal but it is much more comfortable.

This 24"" bike is perfect for the shorter rider. If you are 5'5"" or shorter, this will most likely be a much more comfortable bike for you than a 26"" bike. When it comes to a value this one would be hard to beat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4SGZEOOH96TY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTVLWQK#wasThisHelpful","R4SGZEOOH96TY","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pure Lye Drain Cleaner saved us a lot of trouble as well as the expense of having a plumber once again come out to clear our kitchen drain. We have a very troublesome kitchen drain, most likely because the pipe is straight for 25-30' but then takes a sharp 90 degree turn as it goes to the main drain pipe in our basement. I remember many times having to bail out the kitchen sink as we waited for a plumber to come and unclog the pipe. Well this time we first tried an acid based drain cleaner which did absolutely nothing, so before I called a plumber I looked on Amazon to read the reviews for different types of drain cleaners. I was impressed by what I read about pure lye drain cleaners, so we decided to give it a try. After just two treatments of just one tablespoon of pure lye, our sink is completely unclogged and draining faster than I have ever seen it drain before. Another good thing about this product is that there is no odor like with the acid based drain products. We decided that we will put a tablespoon in our sink each month to keep it clear of clogs. Pure Lye really worked for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZGVUCVX653P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BW4MV8#wasThisHelpful","R37ZGVUCVX653P","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Spigen SGP Screen Protector is excellent in every way. It is extremely easy to install even for a klutz like me. Just follow the simple directions and you have a super clear screen protector that is virtually impossible to see. The quality is excellent. I especially like the fact that you don't need to wet the protector or the device to install it correctly - It goes on dry, and again is very easy to install. I was at first hesitant to attempt to install this myself, however there was absolutely no need to worry. The Spigen went on perfectly centered and bubble-free. In fact when I need screen protectors for any device in the future I will look for the Spigen name. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NRGFS4199ON9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RXFVQY#wasThisHelpful","R2NRGFS4199ON9","AVOFQL8D5NLUO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVOFQL8D5NLUO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It comes with a large plastic bottle for fabric gluing, a small bottle to glue bling onto things and a small bag of gems. The directions are clear, poke a hole in the spout of glue and only glue one side of the project in dots or wave pattern. Place patch on garment and I put I sheet of foil under the fabric and another sheet on top of the patch so the glue won't seep into the fabric, I put books as a weight on top and left it alone overnight.

"I have owned 4 electric and one alcohol fireplace over the years and this one is great. The fireplace arrived today by fedex and when I took it out of the box it was perfect. It was very well boxed with plenty of styrofoam to protect it. It really was 100% assembled, even the casters on the bottom where attached. The solid wood construction and stain finish is well done. No dent, scratches or imperfections at all. The remote changes flame brightness, speed and color. It also turns heat on and off.  The primary use of this unit will be for the flame effect. The heater on this unit is hot and works well but heat was not the main reason I bought this. If you go on YouTube and search SPECTRAFIRE PLUS, the video of theses led flames is amazing and uses almost no electricity.The logs glow internally red as if they are red hot, the blue flame effect at the base of the fire is very realistic.  This is furniture grade cabinet and mantel. The fireplace is very quiet almost silent with just the flames on. I did buy a fire crackle sound machine that creates that crackle pop sounds that burning wood makes.  This is an investment that will last forever. I should mention that since this is real wood, you could use  Minwax Polyshades to change the color of the cabinet and mantel. For example I might, use it to change the color to espresso, or dark cherry to look more like the color of the other furniture in the room. Poly shades can only make the wood darker not lighter.  Would I recommend this electric fireplace..Yes","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32W88RR7EN8KX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O2LMK60#wasThisHelpful","R32W88RR7EN8KX","A3R4Q2UEPTZPSQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R4Q2UEPTZPSQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I consider myself an expert plucker.  I was blessed with bushy italian eyebrows and a thick italian beard.  On a daily basis I am plucking my face in one spot or another in order to NOT look like one of the cavemen in the Geico commercial.  This tweezer is very good.  I have no complaints about it.  I am able to grip the tweezer well and I am able to easily remove hairs.  The price is the only negative about this tweezer.  I have been using Revlon Expert Tweezer, Slant Tip for several years and I have not found anything better yet.  And the price is almost 1/3  of this one.  I have 4 Revlon Expert Tweezers in my possession.  One in my bathroom, one in my car, one in my desk draw and one in my pocketbook.  If this tweezer was more reasonable I would purchase several of these because it works very well.  But when I can get nearly 3 of them for the same price as this one why would I do that?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10D9ZQ0137I4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TD24UW#wasThisHelpful","R10D9ZQ0137I4M","A9NXTC0HTPSDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9NXTC0HTPSDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honestly I don't think Luvs doesn't get the credit that it deserves.  No this is not one of the highest priced diapers. It isn't one of the highest quality diapers either . Your child will not be able to urinate in this diaper for hours and hours on end.  There are some diapers where children can urinate several times in the same diaper and it will hold up. Luvs is not one of those types of diapers . With that said , I highly recommend Luvs diapers because of the cost and the overall quality of the diaper. If you are a parent that changes their child's diaper regularly these diapers will work for you and will cost you half the amount of money that other diapers cost you. I have read that some children who have sensitive skin have issues with this brand of diaper. None of my foster kids have had issues with this brand and therefore I continue to buy it. I have used Pampers, Huggies and various storebrand diapers and in the end I still choose to buy Luvs over the other brands.  Why? Because I honestly feel I get more for my money with this brand of diapers than the rest. I have no issues with leaking and my foster children stay dry as long as I don't keep the same diaper on them for hours and hours on end . Diapers are so expensive, I would strongly suggest you try these diapers to see if they work for your child because you will save a ton of money in the long run.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMDQ0W1ZSM2ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSM7M1E#wasThisHelpful","RMDQ0W1ZSM2ZX","A9NXTC0HTPSDO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9NXTC0HTPSDO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow!  A $90 phone with no bloatware??  Are you kidding me???  This is a great unlocked phone for the price.  The screen is bright and Lollipop is much better than the previous Android software.  Now, this is not an iPhone but it also isn't $600 dollars so you need to keep this in mind.  The camera works just fine.  I primarily use my phone for calls, texts, social media and e-mail so I don't require a phone with a huge processor or one that has a ton of unnecessary apps.  The phone feels good in my hand and it doesn't feel cheap at all.  In fact I like the orange peel type feel of the back cover.  It isn't slippery at all.  Prior to activating this phone on the Verizon network I was using a Samsung S4.  This phone is slightly bigger than my S4 but not by much.  The power butting and volume are on the same side of the phone which I haven't seen before.  It really does make it easier to not have to switch the position of my hand to go from powering the screen on to controlling the volume of the ringer.  I can press the power button with my index finger and use my middle finger to adjust the volume.  How simple!  I really love that this phone is so reasonable and comes with everything that I need.

"What a great product!  When you need it you open it when you don't it is folded up nicely in the back of your car.  I love the wet cooler aspect of this bag.  I use this bag when going to my nephew's baseball games.  I throw a bunch of snacks in the sides and load up some diet pepsi's in the wet cooler and I am good to go!  The other great thing about this bag is that I live in Florida and it is hot most of the year.  Just going to the grocery store and home, some of my frozen items start to defrost forget about having to make a stop somewhere between the store and home.

The frames have a decorative antique design across the front and a bit along the temple.

"I love stepping onto the mat, it has such a cushioning feeling to the feet.  We have just installed hardwood floors that replaced tiled floors and I bought this mat in the toffee brown cobblestone pattern to run along in front of the sink and dishwasher area which is my baking/cooking prep area.  The mat is more than I had expected.  It wipes up perfectly with a damp dishcloth and I've had no issues with stains or slipping.  So far it has stayed put with no movement at all.  I love the 72"" length particularly in my kitchen.  I have ordered a matching one in the 36"" size to place in front of my stove which enables me to step from one to the other without stepping on the hardwood flooring.  Hubby liked it so much, I ordered the Nantucket pattern 36"" size in Mocha  to go in his bathroom.  I highly recommend these mats.Update:  The 36"" mat came packaged in a flat cardboard box the size of the mat.  I had ordered a matching one for the kitchen and a 36"" in the Nantucket pattern in Mocha.  Both arrived packaged as described in different boxes.  Both arrived in perfect condition since no rolling or folding was involved.

Overwhelmingly, their responses were ""Bona"" everything - mops, cleaners, etc. I then called the manufacturer of my hardwood and asked, as it was not specified in their care and maintenance info. I received a resounding ""that's our go to recommendation for cleaning our hardwood floors"". That along with everything else I'd read and heard convinced me.

"I bought a pack of six in the red and came back and ordered two more packs.  These are the best dishcloths I have ever bought and I've bought plenty through the years.  I particularly love how they wipe up granite countertops without leaving a wet mess behind.  In addition, they dry so quickly after use.  I initially bought these to go in our RV but after trying one in the house, I kept back four to use everyday.If it's true that they don't smell as quickly I think it's due to their quick drying time.  So for now, I'm a big fan of these dishcloths!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WNJAT61ULTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO0ZOGY#wasThisHelpful","R11WNJAT61ULTQ","AZ9OSRM9DHJU3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ9OSRM9DHJU3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thank you to the person that wrote about his ""Accidental Find"".  I have been so frustrated with stainless steel appliance cleaners; sprays, creams, moistened towelettes, micro fiber clothes - name it, I've thrown my money away on ALL of them.  Something that I had right under the kitchen sink was the answer to my prayers.  Boos Mystery Oil does what no other did for me except mineral oil and even that was so messy but I did achieve the shine I was after.  The Boos oil is basically the same thing but it takes so very little to get that shine and then a light wipe with a clean rag and DONE - I love it!Oh, did I mention I use it as well as the cream to keep my large Boos board looking its best.  A little goes a long way and I much prefer it to drug store mineral oil.  When I treat my cutting boards, I apply the oil or cream and let it set in overnight.  Needless to say they look well taken care of and I highly recommend both the oil and cream.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DOB5SFGOF3E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00063QPYQ#wasThisHelpful","R3DOB5SFGOF3E7","AZ9OSRM9DHJU3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ9OSRM9DHJU3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well, where has this been my whole adult life.  My feet have never been bad or really crusty but a couple of spots could use a bit of touch up.  This callus remover is a miracle gadget.

A light touch is all that needed - well, that and a towel as it produces a lot of white powdery skin.  I just run it along the area I'm working on and it softly sands away the dead skin.

"First off, let me say that I measured out sea salt with this scoop and it holds just about a level teaspoon.  That being said, it is exactly what I was hoping for because I use the Berard olive wood salt keepers for my kosher salt and course ground pepper at the table instead of salt and pepper shakers.  This is so much better than sticking my fingers or anyone else's for that matter directly into the salt keepers.  Just a light sprinkle is all that's needed for our tastes.  The scoops are the perfect companion to the salt containers.  I would recommend the little scoop, just be aware they are tiny and may not meet your needs if you're looking for more than a teaspoon full.

"Superb!  This is a very elegant executive looking writing pen stylus combo.  For it's slimness, it's very comfortable in the hand.  Evenly balanced from stylus end to ballpoint end.  It's sleek with a bit of a texture giving it a satin look finish which I prefer.  I ordered the set of silver for myself and a set of black for my hubby.The micro fiber mesh tip is the best I have ever used bar none.  I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't the smallness of the stylus tip.  My biggest complaint was I could never find a small enough rubber tip that I was pleased with particularly when using it on my iphone.  This mesh tip glides effortlessly over my iPad and only needs a soft touch when selecting or typing from the keyboard.  There is no sticking, dragging or leaving fingerprints.  The fiber mesh is soft and I have no fear of marring the screen's surface.The addition of extra tips that easily screw on and off puts this set over the top.

"I didn't want to wait to protect my new iPad Air 2 back so I ordered this because there were no others available.  I was skeptical about the fit and the frosted rubber material.  How surprised was I when I received this back cover and found a pretty nice product.  I've always had and thought I preferred the smooth acrylic clear hard back cases.  I actually like the feel of this cover and the most positive thing is that scratches are much less likely to show than the clear acrylic ones.I have the gold color iPad Air 2 and it clearly shows through as gold with the apple clearly visible as well.  I love the way the rubber totally encases the three sides of the iPad with my Smart Cover protecting the remaining side.  I dressed mine up a bit by attaching a silver ""Scottish Terrier"" jewelry piece off of a previous iPhone case onto the back.  You can certainly see that the back of the iPad is that gorgeous gold.I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this back case, just realize it's not a hard back case but since I don't tote my iPad around, it was not a deal breaker for me.Let me add, Luvvitt did a great job in getting these back covers out well before the stated availability and shipping date.

"I bought this recipe binder for my printer produced recipes.  Upon ordering, I added four additional protector refill packs from C.R. Gibson which fit perfectly and are the exact same full page protectors that are included in the binder.  After giving some thought, I decided to order the ""bundled"" pack (includes the binder, page protector refill pack and the card refill pack) as a Christmas Gift for my mother.  My hope is that she will fill it with her treasured recipes that we have enjoyed throughout our lives and that after she passes, her recipes will remain in our family for every one to share and cherish her memory.  A keepsake gift for sure!This is a beautiful recipe binder with little stainless cooking utensils hanging in an inset on the front cover.  On the inside of both the front and back cover are helpful hints such as measurements and substitutions.  The tab separators are thick and sturdy.  The page protectors are a cut above the normal, thicker, not flimsy and a 8.5x11 page fits perfectly.  I feel for price you pay, you get a quality product.  I highly recommend this binder and the refill packs.Give the gift of memories this Christmas season.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MDSWVUCNRIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078N264K#wasThisHelpful","R33MDSWVUCNRIC","AZ9OSRM9DHJU3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ9OSRM9DHJU3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Contrary to the other review listed here which, BTW isn't even for this top loading washing machine.  This is the best washer I have ever owned.  There are so many things I love about this machine but here are a few.*Slow closing lid*LOCKING LID - preventing opening*Super large tub capacity*Beautiful graphite color*Front controls*Sleek stunning looks*See through lid allowing you to see what's happening with your clothes*Minimal water usage*Minimal detergent as well as fabric softener*Stainless steel tub*Winkle free setting that tumbles laundry left in dryer at intervals for up to three hours*Self balancingWhat I love the most is your clothes do not sit in the water they've been washed in,  the washer drains and sprays clean water throughout the cycle.

"I'll admit it, I've loved popsicles since I was a child.  I didn't need any of the fancy ice cream offered by the ice cream truck (telling my age) just give me a simple banana popsicle.  I'm on a health kick and thought making my own popsicles would allow me the freedom of enjoying different types of fresh fruit in popsicle form.  I tried little paper cups with wooden popsicle sticks but I couldn't fit it in my mouth to really enjoy a popsicle like you should.  In addition I despised the wooden sticks and having to buy them.After reviewing far to many popsicle molds I finally settled on the Zoku Classic Pop molds.  I am so glad I decided on these.  We've been making peach popsicles from fresh peaches we froze last summer and the molds have been great!

"I have the wired BP Monitor and loved it so much I thought I had to have the wireless one.  I ordered it directly from Withings and never could pair it with my iPad 4 or iPhone 5.  I have the Pulse as well as the newest WiScales and have had no issues with either one pairing up.  The instructions are minimal at best and indicated the initial light would be blue but mine was green leading me to think I had received a returned defective unit.  It would show that it was connected in my iPhone/iPad settings but would not pair up with the healthmate app.  It constantly would tell me to ""reconnect"" and therefore would never give me the option to inflate.It has taken MANY emails to get a response for the return and credit back to my charge card.  Withings finally sent me a return prepaid label and I returned the BP Monitor two weeks ago and have yet to hear if Withings received it.  I have sent numerous emails asking if they have received it with no response.  I have checked my charge card acct and no credit has been issued.  I love Withings products but the hassles with their customer service should not occur.  I will stay on top of the return until it is resolved to my satisfaction.  Also - there should be a phone number where their customer service can be reached, not by email only!  What's with that, Withings?I am staying with my wired version of the BP Monitor as I have no problems with it.  I really wanted to love the newest version but it was not to be, unfortunately.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UDTBLK4UFX4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H43WOAK#wasThisHelpful","R3UDTBLK4UFX4J","AZ9OSRM9DHJU3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZ9OSRM9DHJU3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Being that I use it in my master bath, the white is perfect for not showing dust/powder, etc.  I had a few issues getting it connected to my wi-fi but once that was done it has performed flawlessly.  I love when I come out after weighing, look on my ipad/iphone and the app says ""Congratulations, you reached your goal this week"".  It's gives me a little boost of confidence.

"The item I received is not the item I ordered.  The one pictured shows a separate syringe and separate medicine dispenser where the baby could suck as you push the medicine in OR you could just have the medicine part separate so they can just suck on it like a pacifier.  But I really wanted to be able to leave the syringe in so the medicine ONLY goes to the nipple and not the surrounding areas like other medicine dispsensers (I have the Munchkin one and meds get trapped around the rim.  The one I recieved is an all in one that I could buy at any Walmart, Target, etc.  I wanted the one pictured because it is separate and easier to dose small amounts.  The one I received is a white syringe with a clear pacifier nipple and the smallest dose amount you can dose out in it is 2.5mL.  I need one to be able to dose 1.25mL so this one is not even one I would order in the first place.  Also, the nipple part of this is HARD AS A ROCK.

"Adorable, functional, fits newborns!  I put it on my son when he was about 3wks old and close to 7 pounds.  I think it would have been too bulky on him at 5 pounds, 6 pounds might have been ok, but closer to 7 was perfect.I use Dandelion bamboo blend prefolds (trim and super soft), osocozy perfect fit cotton prefolds (bulky but work), Buttons inserts and Best Bottoms inserts.  All work well and this cover contains blowouts.Similar to Imagine covers.  The PUL on Rumparooz feels thicker than the PUL on Imagine covers, but they function the same, Imagine might have a little less bulk because of this.  I like both covers equally, but seem to grab Imagine more often.This print is adorable and brings me back to childhood.  I love all the colors.

"The Rawr Imagine cover is absolutely adorable and does its job very well.  Rarely a leak, if I do, it's my fault or the insert is far too wet - my boy is a very heavy wetter.  Contains blowouts.  I put it on my newborn son starting around 3wks old once he was close to 7 pounds so this cover will fit most newborns.  I think I probably could have put him in it a little sooner, but I didn't have it until then.I've been using Dandelion bamboo blend prefolds in them (LOVE those!!!!  Super soft and mega absorbent while still being very trim!), first with a snappi and now (at age 2 months) just trifolded.  I also use Osocozy Perfect Fit cotton prefolds (much bulkier than the Dandelion bamboo ones!), Buttons hemp inserts, Best Bottoms hemp inserts, and Buttons microfiber inserts just laying in the cover because my favorite diapering system that I already have are Buttons and Best Bottoms (Buttons are superior for us) and it works well with those inserts too.  I do wish this cover had snaps so I could snap in my Buttons and Best Bottoms inserts, but other than that, I have been very pleased with this cover!  It does not have Flip style insides where you can kind of hold the insert in place with the top and bottom layer of PUL folded over inside - if that makes any sense!  If you know Flip diapers, you'll get it though and this cover does not have that.  I don't mind that it doesn't have this feature since my Buttons and Best Bottoms do not, but I do think the one-size version does - I have an Imagine one-size velcro cover and it does have the Flip style inside.This cover is very similar to Rumparooz.  The Imagine cover's material does feel differently than Rumparooz, but the fit and how they work have been the same for me. The Imagine's PUL feels a little thinner and less bulky than Rumparooz, which feels a little more substantial, but so far, it does not affect function or durability at all.  I think I reach for the Imagine covers more frequently.This dinosaur print is ridiculously adorable and even though I prefer my inserts to snap in, I plan on buying this print in the one-size version as soon as he outgrows this one because I am not ready to see it go!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WU9ZWUJLGQ21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FMHFLK0#wasThisHelpful","R2WU9ZWUJLGQ21","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Looking for socks that would stay on and these do a great job, much better than regular socks.We get compliments absolutely everywhere we go on just how cute these are.  They are truly adorable.They still come up above the knee of my 9 month old, but I don't mind at all.  They still fit.  We were originally looking for thigh high socks, but had a hard time finding them in her size, so these were a great alternative.When wearing her in my wrap, these socks keep her lower legs covered when  the wrap makes her pants highwater on her.Love the grippies on the bottoms of the feet.The insides do not have a ton of loose strings like another brand I have (of thigh high socks) so that's a big plus for these.Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20XTGVURPV24O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2Y2F5I#wasThisHelpful","R20XTGVURPV24O","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We use this in our Grace Travel Lite Pack n Play to give our baby girl a bit more cushion than the hard as a rock pad it comes with and we wanted to protect the original pad from leaks and spit up.This fit the bill perfectly.  We use changing pad covers as sheets for the Travel Lite since the sheets you can get for it are terribly scratchy and you can get much better quality changing pad covers that fit even better anyway!  This mattress is thick enough to add just a bit more comfort, yet thin enough that we have no problems putting fitting the changing pad covers we use over it.Perfect!  I am definitely going to try to find another pad like this to go with our full sized Pack N Play when she outgrows the Travel Lite, hopefully there is one, haven't checked yet!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IXTLTANL1808/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00319CK6O#wasThisHelpful","R3IXTLTANL1808","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have tried every prescription steroid and non steroid cream and ointment and every natural cream and ointment out there for our 9 month old's eczema.  So far, the only 2 things that have worked are Aquaphor for the painful flare ups and Mustela Lipid Replenishing Balm for healing and maintenance.The scent is lovely, though I wish it was scent free.  It's very soft and doesn't last, I only smell it when I put it on her.  Almost a vanilla type of scent.This actually gets her rough, scaly patches all smooth and beautiful like her sweet baby skin should be!Check your local T a r g e t store first though because it's cheaper there.

"I had no idea this shipped internationally.  My daughter wears a size 6 so I wanted the 7-8 for her to grow into.  It's more of a small size 6.  I wanted to return it only to find out that I'd have to pay international shipping to do so....  Was not thrilled about that.  Ended up keeping it.She never used it because it was supposed to be part of her Halloween costume that I knew she'd want to wear for a long time, but due to the size, I didn't want to use it for that purpose.  I ended up buying a white hoodie from another amazon seller for MUCH less expensive and dyeing it to the shade I wanted instead.It was $24, which is way too much to pay for a simple sweatshirt, but I really wanted that color for her DIY Vanellope von Schweez costume I was making for her.  Wish it would have been a more accurate size and I also wish it hadn't taken several weeks to be delivered.  I had no realized it was shipped from England or I would never have ordered it because I needed it quickly.  It arrived the day after Halloween so I ended up not needing it at all anyway.  Thankfully I had dyed the other sweatshirt I ordered (after this one!) from a US seller just to cover my bases.  I wanted to be able to compare the colors and then choose and possibly return this one if I liked my dyed one better.  But since returning it will be a hassle with even more money spent, I'm just not going to do it.  Maybe I'll resell it here at a yard sale though I know I can never come close to getting the $24 I paid for it....","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FLPYQLAB3LL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHXUD8S#wasThisHelpful","R1FLPYQLAB3LL3","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Was hoping for a good substitute for Aquaphor for my 9 month old's out of control eczema.  We have to use Aquaphor 5 times per day all over her body (including her scalp) in order to keep it under control.  (Yes, we've tried everything else, prescriptions, diet, laundry, etc and Aquaphor is the only thing that helps.)  I was looking for something to replace Aquaphor since we tend to use mostly natural products in every aspect of our lives and weren't too keen on using Aquaphor so often.The scent is nice, I do like it a lot.I like that it absorbs very well, however that's also the reason I really don't like it.  I can't see how it would be a good barrier ointment since it simply absorbs.  Our daughter's skin was dry, peeling, and red (her normal skin without aquaphor) after lathering her full of this.  When we use Aquaphor, after just one application, her skin improves.  But we've almost used this entire bottle, which has only lasted a week, and it has really done nothing for her skin at all.I would not recommend this for those looking for a more natural Aquaphor substitute.**** UPDATE ****I still don't recommend this as a good natural substitute for Aquaphor, but I did find one that is pretty close:Burt's Bees Multipurpose Ointment.  Aquaphor still works best, but I like that I find I'm not using it as often.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32FPNDBCC6WI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018SJ0G8#wasThisHelpful","R32FPNDBCC6WI2","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for my 9 month old.  I have many friends who advise against buying from amazon and have places they recommend, but with our daughter cutting 2 top teeth and 2 bottom teeth at the same time, I was at my wit's end and wanted them fast, so amazon prime to the rescue!The necklace is too long for my 9 month old.  She can pull it up over her face.  My friend's kids necklaces are not this long and they've never had to shorten them at all.  They aren't constantly pulling it back down from their kid's faces like I am.  After just a few days, I took it off of her.  I started wrapping it around her ankle and putting a sock on over it to keep it there, though I can't let her nap like that because she could easily pull the sock off and get the necklace off that way.I kinda feel like I was ripped off.  This is my first amber necklace so I wasn't sure what to expect.  A few of the beads looked like the ""raw"" unpolished parts were coming off, revealing clear beads, not quite sure what that means.  Are they not real amber?  Did they coat some other bead to make it look like amber?  Like I said, I'm not experienced with amber, but I've never heard my friends say anything like this.She did seem more comfortable after several hours of wearing this, but I can't say whether or not it was related to the necklace or if her teeth were just feeling better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FMH7GVTE12SE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XBJR9S#wasThisHelpful","R1FMH7GVTE12SE","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great for organization and the protection of those precious baby teeth.The materials are VERY sturdy, the clear plastic covering the tooth slots is strong!  Strong enough so that if you have the tooth not quite in the slot and the plastic (which is kinda hard to move) slides over the tooth, the tooth will break....  (yes, one of her beautiful baby teeth split right in half because it had popped up when I was trying to slide the plastic cover over it and it just snapped in half.)Love that it has a zipped case.  It also has a ribbon on the zipper, which is handy because I hide this in my closet between stacks of clothes and the ribbon is the only part I have sticking out - therefore, I know where it is and it's easy to grab, but my daughter has no clue.Speaking of which, this case seems to be designed FOR your child, as in, your child apparently should know that all their baby teeth are going in this album.  The Tooth Fairy takes all of her teeth, so this case is really for me, and possibly for her as an adult, so I wish it was geared more like a baby book instead of geared towards the child in their childhood years.The artwork on it is UGLY, I'm not a fan at all of the crazy eyed cartoon kids with gigantic heads.  I would have preferred just a simple cute tooth or maybe even just a plain case but no other tooth cases that did have much more muted artwork were this quality.  I haven't compared the size to an actual cd case yet, but they are pretty close so maybe I'll get a cute cd case and swap it out somehow.  It's just so ugly!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOS5DQXMERLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HKCSGO#wasThisHelpful","R2OOS5DQXMERLO","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Rachel's blog/facebook posts.  The blog posts tend to be a little long and I have to admit, it takes me a few sessions between caring for my kids and other household duties to read one in its entirety (ironic since she's so ""hands free"" and present with her kids and still manages to write something that long and so often, but I can't even read one straight through), but they are beautiful and usually worth the read with a lovely reminder.  I was so excited she was coming out with a book, though I did question it since it seemed like she had just started her blog and I worried it would just be a compilation of her blog posts - which also would have been ok, honestly.  But reading the book left me rolling my eyes more often than not with a ""HA, yeah right..."" when thinking about incorporating some of the philosophy into my own kid's lives.  Maybe it was just too much sunshine and butterflies and perfect days rolled into one book, not allowing the parent to feel normal emotions or dealing with every day frustrations - when reading her blog posts, it was usually broken up into once a week or so and it seems more helpful.I think most of us who are looking to go hands free already understand that we're possibly lacking in a few ways as parents and truly want to make things better for ourselves and our families.  Reading this can kinda make you feel like the worst parent in the world for not doing these things.  Sensitive response, maybe, but I'm a realist.  Every day isn't going to be perfectly lovely and this book seems to ignore that or if you aren't having a perfectly lovely day, then you must be doing something wrong because you should be able to find something perfectly lovely about that day.  I know, we SHOULD try to find that perfectly lovely something every day, but it's also very ok acknowledge all the situations and emotions that might not be peachy every day too.  We can't ignore the ""bad"" stuff every day, that's not living, that's pretending.  Her blog seems more realistic in nature than her book.  While her posts do tend to get repetitive (understandable since how many ways can you say ""enjoy the moment""?), the book was a bit excessive.I was hoping more for a guide, not something more like her blog.  Which is great, I love her blog, she tells incredible stories and is a great writer.  But I wanted a guide and there wasn't really much in the book that I wasn't already doing.  Maybe I'm not as addicted to devices as others?Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way was she mentions is her religious belief as the basis of all of this and instead of using an ""i feel/believe"" phrasing, it was more of a ""God is"" and that's that type of phrasing which can leave those with other beliefs feeling a bit judged if that's not what we believe.  I've never seen her mention religion in her blog and this is why it surprised and slightly disappointed me.  I understand everyone has a right to write a book based on their beliefs and I am very supportive and embracing of all beliefs, but like I said, I wasn't aware that would be in this book as she had given no hint of this in her blog posts (on facebook) so it caught me off guard.Maybe this would be a good book for those that do not already read her blog or for those that are so truly addicted to their devices - therefore these stories may just snap you offline.  I would recommend this to those people.  The stories can be really lovely reminders, but maybe not all in one sitting/book.  But I wouldn't recommend this to those that already read the blog or already like her on facebook.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRN3M2JMY6M72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DL10HF8#wasThisHelpful","RRN3M2JMY6M72","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buttons vs. Best Bottoms reviewFirst things first:  Best Bottoms inserts are compatible with Buttons diapers!  LOVE this, because I prefer hemp inserts and Buttons have not made a hemp insert yet.  (Speaking of inserts, I prefer Best Bottoms inserts over Buttons inserts - the Buttons inserts bunch up more than Best Bottoms do.)Double gusset awesomeness.Buttons covers (2 layer PUL, just like Best Bottoms) are SO soft even though they are thicker and more durable than 1 layer PUL covers.  Best Bottoms are also 2 layer, but are much stiffer and noisier - if you pat baby's bottom with Best Bottoms on, it's loud, I know that sounds like a silly thing to rate a diaper on, but I much prefer my diaper options to be more discrete/quiet.Buttons covers are slightly stretchy, whereas Best Bottoms aren't for the most part, so I feel like I get a better fit with Buttons.Buttons covers are less bulky than Best Bottoms - this says a lot because Best Bottoms are some of the trimmest diaper systems out there!  Buttons is even trimmer, I think due to the fabric being just that much softer/moldable.Buttons covers seem to last longer than Best Bottoms.  I have a Best Bottoms cover that I purchased the exact same time as a Buttons cover - the elastic in the Best Bottoms cover has relaxed while the Buttons cover still looks like new.One of the hip snaps on one of my Buttons covers is starting to lose its snapping capability, however, my baby has an unusually trim waist and we've been using the same hip snap since she was 6wks old, she is now 8 months old.  I just use other snaps, so while slightly irritating, it's not that big of a deal at this point as I know we won't be using that snap much longer anyway.  I haven't contacted Buttons yet about possibly replacing the snap - I would like to replace it since I plan on selling these once she is potty trained.  On this same cover, there is also a small tear on the PUL on the inside of the diaper at a snap that holds an insert, this tear happened within a couple months of purchase.  Doesn't cause any leaks since this is a 2 layer PUL and the tear is basically under the snap - you can only see it when unsnapping an insert.  I do not have any tears in the PUL on the Best Bottoms diapers, so Best Bottoms PUL may be more durable.  (I still prefer Buttons and still consider them a 5 star cover.  My other Buttons covers are slightly newer, but have had no issues with them in the months I've used them and believe this is an isolated problem with just the one cover.)I have this in Pebble, Sweet Pea, Snow, Blueberry, Purple, Strawberry, Acres, Tangerine, Thicket, Cherry, Peony, Marina, Charming, and Banana Cream.We rarely have leaks.In addition to Buttons and Best Bottoms, I have a Rumparooz cover, a Lotus Bum cover, and fleece covers.  I also have fitteds (which I also like a lot), pocket diapers (my least favorite), tons of flats, some prefolds.  I always grab Buttons first.  Always.*** UPDATE ***My baby is 9 months old now and crawling all over the place.  She does get slightly irritated on the tops of her thighs from the PUL that is exposed to her skin and rubs there when she moves.  Once I realized this, I just started tucking that part of the ""wing"" in so the outer fabric is what rubs there, not the inside PUL.  Simple and does the trick.  Just wanted to mention this in case anyone else wanted a simple fix for this scenario.**** UPDATE AGAIN ****My baby is 15mo old and we still LOVE Buttons.  Pretty sure we are going to sell every other diaper we have and just stick with Buttons.Their customer service is phenomenal.  The slight tear in my Pebble cover eventually made the whole snap come out.  That same week I had ordered some new covers from them and one of the hip snaps popped off.  I sent a friendly email with a pic of the covers that the snaps had come off of and asked how to go about replacing them.  She right away emailed back and I had new replacement covers within 5 days - I didn't even have to send the ones with faulty snaps back!  That was a HUGE plus for me since I live out of town and getting to a post office is a pain.  LOVE Buttons!!!!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y9S1MQO8CGF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEH2GQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1Y9S1MQO8CGF8","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was so disappointed when I opened it.  I thought it would be a prettier pinkish/purple and instead, it's more of a light burgundy-ish shade.  I also thought it would be a little shinier and it's very very flat, there is no sheen to it whatsoever.  The purple designs are almost a gray/purple, not nearly as vibrant as they appear in the picture.I wish I had looked at the customer image before ordering it because I never would have ordered it.I should mention, I want it for a baby wearing wrap, not for a tablecloth, so my preferences may be different than those looking for a tablecloth.It's a sturdy material, which is great, just wasn't the color I thought it would be.  Not even close.Bit of a bummer.  Now I'm wondering if I should bother returning it or if I should try a different one to get more of a look that I want.** Update **Decided to keep it since my other daughter really likes it and I'm making her a wrap from it as well.  After I cut/hemmed, washed, and dried it, the length (which wasn't part of hemming) shrunk from 120 inches down to 108!  I was a bit shocked at how much it shrunk.  I expected a handful of inches, not 12!  Yikes.  However, it still works as a great shorty wrap.  Very comfortable, soft, and baby agrees - sleepy dust in these for sure!  I prefer the reverse side of this, the grayish/purple is very pretty with the burgundy pink stitches showing through.  This will probably be a ""car wrap"" for me since it's a lot shorter and I don't have to worry much about it dragging on the ground in parking lots.  I kinda wish I had chosen a different color, but this one has grown on me after the initial disappointment in the actual color.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6MFIONB58OKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRW9LTU#wasThisHelpful","R6MFIONB58OKZ","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Strong citronella-type scent.  I used these daily on my dogs while visiting some family that are not used to any doggy smells and had hoped this scent would be pleasant.  It's really not a very nice scent!  I saw reviews mentioning the scent is strong/not pleasant and I wish I had listened and gotten the unscented version or maybe tried the mango one.  Scents are not usually a deal breaker for me, but I truly don't want to use these anymore.  Maybe I'll save them for the summer time in hopes that the citronella-like quality of it will help repel mosquitos when we're outside.  ;)These wipes get dirt off just fine, but I need them to do more than that.  My dog has oily skin and most other bath wipes can cut the grease, but these do not.  That is what ultimately made me not care for this product.The scent lingers on their fur for quite a while - if you like the scent, that'd be a good thing.I just wish it could cut the grease in my dog's fur from her allergies.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WLCBZLR01YWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018CLYPO#wasThisHelpful","R1WLCBZLR01YWJ","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't even express how beautiful this is!!!!  I didn't even notice the cute bow on the faux belt until I got it, it's so adorable!  Nice and cozy, warm, good for snow since it's actual winter coat material and not just fleece or microfiber like so many other prams, it's an actual snowsuit.Only a couple things I wish it had:  I wish the feet were detachable so she could use it a little longer since I'm afraid she may outgrow it before winter is over.  My other minor issue is that I wish the zipper was not straight up and down as it creates the bulky ""ripples"" like all coats do and for babies, it's just too much.  I've seen others at places like One Step Ahead that have zippers going from one shoulder down to the opposite foot to help with this.Decent price, but wish it had the other features like some of equal price have.  However, this is not much more than the non-snow play prams you can buy at local stores made of fleece/etc.She is 6mo old, 14 pounds 10 ounces right now, and it's a bit big on her, which is what I had hoped for in the 6-9mo size, so we're good there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GT92GGM53MUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI49LPO#wasThisHelpful","R1GT92GGM53MUU","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a Veterinary Technician.  My American Pit Bull Terrier has had incontinence issues since about a year or so after she was spayed.  She was spayed at 10 months old.  For the first 4-5 years, she was on PROIN, but we kept having to increase the dose to see results and eventually, the effectiveness of the drug seemed to wear off.  She never had a negative reaction while on it, but she started to refuse to take it and we got tired of jamming those huge tablets down her throat twice a day when it wasn't even working 100% anyway.  We have just been cleaning up the dribbles as we see them and washing the dog bedding frequently - she usually loses control while sleeping/resting and it's almost always on the dog beds or in her fave place to lay in our kitchen on the rug in the sunlight.  So while irritating and a lot of work, I thought it was better than her being on a drug with potential reactions.  But oh the puddles...they have gotten so large this year (she's turning 9 soon) have gotten out of hand.  She was waking up covered in pee and our other dog started getting covered in pee too if she slept on the same dog bed.  So we were bathing both dogs nonstop and washing bedding nonstop.  So tired of the smell of pee.  We were ready to rip our hair out.  She also has skin allergies and last year (after trying everything else) decided to go grain-free with her and have seen a huge improvement in her skin snice then.  I was afraid to introduce any supplements that might have grains so all tablet versions were pretty much not an option, not to mention, it's irritating to shove tablets down throats and I didn't want to deal with that if I didn't have to.  I was even nervous about this one, but decided to give it a try.We (hubby too, one who doesn't like to spend money on the dogs) are SO GLAD we gave this a try.  She's been on it for 3 weeks now and we started noticing the puddles were gone within a few days of the 3 times daily dose.  She still dribbled, but no more lakes.  That was awesome enough for me to be really excited and would have been content with just that result alone!  Within a week to 2 weeks, the dribbles were gone.  Now, she's down to the twice daily dose and we are still seeing no dribbles.  She doesn't reek of pee, the dog beds don't reek of pee, it's absolutely awesome.  After years of struggling with this, we have finally found something that is doable for her and us and it works!I couldn't be more pleased!I don't know how on earth people manage to get their dogs to take this on their food or in their water though!  Mine HATES the taste.  To avoid having her taste it as much, I put the drops in her closed mouth along her gums towards the back of her mouth, kinda just opening her jowls to do it, wait for her to swallow a couple of times and bam, done.  Easy.  She doesn't mind taking it that way.  I tried putting it directly on her tongue and she hated it, so I won't be doing that again!  Also, I thought maybe I could mix this with the coconut oil that she eats daily for her skin...Leaks No More does NOT mix with the coconut oil - I melt the coconut oil and put the dose of it she needs in ice cube trays, let it harden, and it makes it super easy to give her the coconut oil daily by just plopping the hardened perfectly dosed amount onto her food (instead of spooning it out every day, that got old quick!).  Well, when I tried to put the Leaks No More drops into the melted coconut oil, it went straight to the bottom.  When the coconut oil hardened, all the drops were on the bottom still and did not mix with the coconut oil.  I wasted about half the bottle of Leaks No More trying that, whoops...  So don't do what I did!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12PY8ZBAYK1GE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EO6FT6#wasThisHelpful","R12PY8ZBAYK1GE","A1POD4SH35DZ3X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1POD4SH35DZ3X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My favorite pair of fleece-lined jeans are actually ones that I've bought twice before at Walmart. They are the (men's) Wrangler Carpenter Relaxed fit jeans, for $24.99 and they are won-der-ful. But, they were no longer available online and not available in any of the stores nearby, so I headed to Amazon.First, let me tell you the pros and cons of the Wranglers:Pros:They are toasty warm. I've worn them in 5 degree weather and was perfectly comfortable, and yet wore them in the office on casual days and was not uncomfortable at all.They are soft and move WITH your body, not clinging to your body for easy movement up and down stairs, bending, working in the yard, etc. In that sense, they were as comfy as pajamas.They looked good on.Price! At 24.99, they were a steal! And one time, I bought them on sale for $19.99!Cons:They are HEAVY. No kidding. It may seem contradictory to my 'comfortable' comments, above, but, you can easily add 3-5 pounds on your body wearing them. The extra weight was noticeable for me.I realize I had lost a 'little' bit of weight, but aside from that, it seemed that the waist stretches out and the fit gets loose, so getting a correct and consistent fit in the waistline is something to look for.On Amazon, I chose the Carhartts for my replacement because of the name. When you see people who work outdoors for a living, what brand of clothing do they usually wear? Carhartts. So, it must be good for cold weather. But, at more than DOUBLE the price, I was hesitant to give them a try.Here's my take so far:Pros:They look nice and they fit well. The waist is just as it should be. They washed and dried well. They are regular weight, and feel no heavier than 'regular' jeans, so I don't feel like I'm walking around with barbells on.Cons:Expensive. This may appear contradictory to my weight comment, above, but they are so lightweight; and the fleece lining so much thinner than the Wranglers, I don't know how it would keep me warm in frigid weather. It's not cold enough outside yet for me to put to the test - let alone 5 degree weather to make the comparison! But, the lining of fleece is much, much thinner.Comfort. They don't move with the body at all. When I walk up the stairs, I have to use my hands to ""hitch"" them up, otherwise, they grab my knees. The same is true when bending, kneeling or any movement. I wonder how, then, would this be for a 'working man' outside when the movement is not as giving?When the temps drop down to the teens and below, I'll update my comments, but for now, this is my review and I hope you find it helpful.If you're lucky enough to find the Wrangler Fleece Lined jeans in your area - snatch them up! Maybe you'll like those better. If warmth, price, and mobility is foremost for you, you'll do better with those.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMALI6ZXFZXPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JQWMTC#wasThisHelpful","RMALI6ZXFZXPZ","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why did I forget all about Corn Huskers? It wasn't until reading on a FB Cast Iron Cooking page (with over 100,000 members), many of whom are cowboys, and ranch hands, etc and they were talking about the best lotion to help with chapped skin that I decided to get some.Oh, my goodness! I could not believe how instantly it made my hands, arms and legs as soft as a baby's butt! And get this, it seemed to STAY that way! I don't get that part, but for me, it seems true. You know how you apply lotion and it's only as good as the time it's on there, but as soon as you wash or shower, you need to apply again and in the winter months, you are winning a losing battle!?Well, my hands have actually STAYED soft and smooth.Anyway, I recommend. And, if you wash your hands a lot because of your job (doctor, nurse, teacher, etc) or simply because you do (!), then you'll love that this is non-greasy or slippery, but also that it seems to penetrate and really actually eliminate the dryness and chapped skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R298U8UJD2QRGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OYYTLE#wasThisHelpful","R298U8UJD2QRGH","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the Aquasana glass bottle and left it in the freezer by accident, and of course, it shattered. I thought that bottle was pretty decent and wasn't unhappy with it at all, but once I got the Bromvital bottle, I realized what I had been missing.I know this may sound crazy, but the water tastes better in THIS glass bottle than it did in my other glass bottle! So that makes me wonder - isn't glass...glass? Why would one taste better than the other?

"The edition that I had, the 2011 Deluxe, would no longer work with my financial institution, so I just ""let it go"". There's no way I wanted to give in to the extortion of being forced to upgrade every two years and especially at such high prices. Personally, I think it's greedy and irresponsible that companies market the way they do.Anyway, I missed being able to do my normal, and basic reporting. I'm a ""numbers"" person, and I do like detailed financial accounting.When I saw this Starter Edition, which was priced at $22 (and not the $42 it is showing here today!!), I liked what I saw. Personally, I never used or cared for the Deluxe features anyway and just preferred the basic.When I read the reviews and read the website, it assured me that it would load my previous information, however, when I downloaded, it immediately told me that it would not because my version was the Deluxe. I opted for downloading anyway as a ""new file"".Then, it insisted on a password. I entered my email address, as prompted, and it said that email address already has an account, perhaps from any other Intuit product (such as Turbo Tax). It would not take what I presumed my password was and then locked me out. Long story short is, I was so angry and so frustrated, and the Chat Talk was not working, so I just paused and prayed for awhile. Lo and behold, I keep a document with some odd websites, products and services passwords, and looked there to see if there was one and there was. Even though it insisted on my email addy being my ID, I entered the info I had on this sheet, and it took it! So, I was very happy.The only thing I don't like about it is the way the account categories are set up. I also am not a graph or pie chart person. I prefer to see it written out. So, I will play with it and see if I can't create and change things to the way I want them.But, for right now, I'm happy to be back in the saddle again and downloading my bank info.Before you uninstall your old version, be sure to backup or copy files if you don't want to lose the info and in case it will not convert. And you may have to create a ""new file"" in order to proceed, but just press on and don't give up.

"I have the Lexi Marigold sandals in the Red and absolutely love them, so when I went back online (I had actually ordered that pair from QVC) to order them in Black, I was devastated that they were not available, not even on their Wait List.I could not find them in Black anywhere - not on Amazon; not on Clarks, Zappos - anywhere.So..I looked for another pair of black sandals that I might like instead and decided on these - the Lexi Sumac. The first pair I received was in the 7.5, which is what I normally wear, but they were tight around the foot and I could feel the straps, and they bothered my little toe and the bunion on my left foot. So, I sent them back and ordered the 8, since ordering in a wider width was not an option; and hoping they wouldn't be too big.The size 8 feels great and these are incredibly comfortable. I don't even feel anything on my feet at all - just simply feel clouds of comfort. I can stand for long periods of time; walk for long distances and be completely comfortable. I love how stealthly quiet they are, too! Makes me feel like I'm gliding across the carpet at work.I still would have preferred to have the Lexi Marigold because I think it's a more elegant design for greater variation of day-to-night wear while the Sumac style seems more casual with it's brass buckles, but I do like it very much and am glad I have them.As far as I'm concerned, Clarks is 'on a roll' with me and winning hands down!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IUP5PWCAY545/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3ROWYG#wasThisHelpful","R3IUP5PWCAY545","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes the best movies or books are ones handed to you to read that you have no idea what it's about or anything about it and it ends up being something so worthy, and so surprisingly good.Such was the case here when this book was mentioned in a FB post, and I found myself so absorbed in the book and unable to put it down.I hate to confess that so often, I don't read a book from cover to cover anymore, but skim around and through the book, but NOT this one! This was a real page turner!Sadly, I was finishing up this book when yet another shooting tragedy occurred (will it ever end??) and the man in that story can easily be compared to the character in Carolyn Wyatt's book.As another reviewer said - there are so many other families and homes going through the same thing and we ALL, unfortunately probably know someone just like that - someone we all would see capable of committing heinous crimes.I lived next door to one. He terrorized the neighborhood and was the reason most sold their homes and moved.The 'soul particle' and various other theories as to 'what went wrong' with this child is interesting to contemplate and is a topic that needed to be written about. What is the problem? What, then, is the solution?I especially appreciate what Carolyn Wyatt wrote at the end of her book which reflected my own thoughts exactly and I look forward to reading more of her work.Thanks, Carolyn for writing this. I think it's very timely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS9LZ4BYP3QU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HI5WFMQ#wasThisHelpful","RS9LZ4BYP3QU7","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me say that I've always been a Travelon-Girl and have never owned a Baggelini until now.I carried the same exact Travelon purse for 8 years - even had it stitched up a few times at the shoe repair store because I loved the bag and Travelon stopped making it.This year, when I finally had to ditch my favorite purse, I've enjoyed buying several purses that I do like, but they still never have compared to my favorite, dearly departed discontinued Travelon.A couple weeks ago, I went out to lunch with my sister and absolutely loved her new purse. I had to try it out - zip and unzip and visualize my belongings in it. My heart was racing and I got really excited to see that many of those favored features were designed into her purse, the Criss Cross Baggalini and I wondered hmmm..She had ordered hers in the Mushroom color (I really liked it) and lo and behold, she surprised me and ordered one for me in black!I couldn't wait to try and put all my belongings into it to see if it would work! I don't really carry much, but what I do carry has to be arranged just ""so"". One thing I love about Travelon bags is their whole premise is that you can do everything with one hand, and without looking. I refuse to be one of these ladies who are digging and searching through their purses - or better yet, have to take things out to find them! Why would anybody do that when you don't have to??!So, first let me tell you that the material is nice - light weight and easily wiped clean. The hardware is substantial and feels good in your hand - not flimsy and cheap. The zippers move nicely; and the shoulder strap is nice and thick to wear comfortably and not dig into your shoulders.The outside appearance appears 'small' to some. My hairdresser commented that she wouldn't be able to fit ""anything"" in that tiny purse but yet here's what I have in mine:1) In the front zipper, I have only my lip balm - though there's room for much more2) In the first zippered compartment, I have a 3 1/2"" x 3 1/2"" square compact mirror, business cards, an ID holder that carries two cards; coins in the zipper pouch, some dental floss (yeah, I know) and in the internal zipper, I have a travel sized thing for Advil/Aleve, and a pair of tweezers. The zipper zips completely all the way around to open up all the way.3) In the first large zippered section, I have a full size wallet with pictures; a pen in the pen loop and there is room for more as there is both a pocket and another internal zippered section. The zipper goes all the way to the bottom on one side so that once again, you have full view and accessibility to your items. Never is your hand being squished when you reach for anything.4) In the middle section that is open, I have my cell phone, my big key ring with plenty of keys on it; my work badge; and a 6"" slim flashlight. That section is magnetized but even without it, the design as you wear it, seems to keep that area closed, so I don't worry about anything flying out of it. This was the one thing I loved about my favorite Travelon bag. I like to be able to have one section of my purse that is open or has a flap so I can easily grab keys, phone, or flashlight without having to unzip anything. This is perfect.5) In the last main zippered compartment, I have TWO eyeglasses cases - and they are full sized, AND they are the hard cases! I also have my pocket calendar/planner/phone book, and another pen.6) The very last area of the purse is an open, magnetized pocket, and I have dummy bank deposits and blank envelopes; store receipts and a shopping list.My purse doesn't look stuffed, and in fact, still looks flat; and you would never guess I have all that in it! But I wanted to show you how much it carries and that's largely due to the great design of this bag with it's all around zippering, light material, and open center. I am truly amazed and thrilled to see that essentially, my ol' favorite bag has been reincarnated in this Criss Cross Baggalini.Oh, be sure to check the prices on this style regularly as they change all the time. The price depends on the color you choose and there are plenty of colors to choose from! They all look great. The dimensions are posted, so I don't know how anyone can misinterpret the size. I think you will be surprised with this bag and love it more than you thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DD6T1L3Q7GMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6EHCRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2DD6T1L3Q7GMN","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought this was very well written and organized in a way that flows as to how someone would approach their learning.I stay pretty well informed on health topics, so it wasn't that I was expecting to learn anything new but mostly wanted to see what Ann Malkmus had to say about it, being 'who' she is and appreciating all that she and her family does. I was excited to get her perspective and input.The surprise was that she mentioned some things I did not know; had not ever read before and I was very intrigued with that and it made perfect sense.This is a sensible approach that anyone can benefit from. Being informed is the key first and foremost in order to make changes and decisions. This book makes it easy to not become overwhelmed but rather to understand what's going IN you from what's AROUND you, so that you can make changes yourself that are easier and simpler than you might think.They say 80% of all cancer comes from the foods we eat - and is preventable - while the remaining percent is primarily environmental (some of which we still can prevent!).Ann Malkmus did a great job compiling the information in a coffee-table approach - making it an easy family topic of discussion to get on the road to positive change.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QGH1MT174GNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5UW3AC#wasThisHelpful","R3QGH1MT174GNG","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My hairdresser works out of her home and she swears by these FitFlops, as so many others do. She loves them and highly recommends them saying if it weren't for them, she could never stay on her feet for 12 hours a day, and she's getting close to 70, though you'd never guess..I've been on Amazon - and a reviewer - since the mid-90's. When I'm interested in something, I will read every single review and every single comment. I IMMERSE myself in what others have to say about something. So, I think it's safe to say that I get a good feel for what people like/don't like about something.I needed some flip-flops anyway and thought they'd make a good pre-birthday gift to myself and so I began reading all the reviews; checked out all the styles, etc, and couldn't wait to choose one and try them for myself. I mean the reviews are so glowing - ladies buying several different styles and different colors each in every style!You have people saying they do 5-K walks in them; prefer to wear them HIKING; climb over rocks; doing their workouts in them; and hating to take them off!Unfortunately..I'm not having any of those exclamations and I'm really bummed as to why not (??). Did I choose the wrong style? I normally wear a size 7.5 shoe and ordered these in a size 7 and the fit is perfect. Is it my feet?! My feet are neither wide nor narrow - they are a true medium. They are not UN-comfortable. Even the toe-piece is not rough or uncomfortable. But, they are not rocking the house down - OMG - they are amazingly wonderful - don't want to take them off - want to do my 5K walks in them, either!For one, they don't stay on my feet. I'm consciously aware of them the entire time they are on my feet. My feet have slipped out of them numerous times, so I'm aware of needing to grip them so they stay on. I think a better way to give visualization is, for example, when we ladies wear nylons with our shoes and we feel too much movement and slippage between our feet and the shoe - do you know what I mean?I wanted so much to love them - to really, really enjoy them! And especially those who mentioned they can WALK for hours in them, better than any walking shoe or running shoe - so much so that they prefer them for their 5K walks! But, after two weeks of wearing these, I can't say I want to wear them around the BLOCK! :(As for the '""FIT benefits"" - I also feel nothing. Nothing in my calves, thighs, buns.

"Yes, I enjoy WRITING reviews, but what I really enjoy best is reading YOURS. I get so much out of the reviews and also the comments and it's all of your reviews that really save the day for me.For example, I wanted a travel bag but just wasn't satisfied with my search. Then I stumbled upon a comment and it made me realize that I hadn't thought ""outside the box"" and done a search on tote bags! But it was one review in particular that compared the expensive and heavy (travel) tote bags to the link for this bag that really sold me.I absolutely LOVE this bag! I used it as my carry-on bag on the plane. I had my cell phone in the little ""secret"" pocket; and my boarding pass and other papers in the front zippered pocket (which later I was able to fit a light sweater in). I also put a purse organizer (bought on Amazon also) inside to fit prescriptions, supplements; lip balm, Aleve, mirror, etc so as not to drop into a black hole. I also had pens and flashlight within easy grasp inside the organizer. In the pockets that are built into the tote bag, I had my camera; glasses; sunglasses; and two Kindles.I love the water bottle holder (I brought the Rubbermaid Chug bottles with me - also bought on Amazon and LOVE them!) on the side of the bag. There is so much room in this bag! And yet, it wasn't huge or silly looking when carried over the shoulder; and it fit comfortably. It also slid very well under the seat on the airplane.I had a regular sized wallet when using the whole bag - so that it was easy to grab when I opened the bag - but when I wanted to leave the bag at my sister's house, or in the trunk of the car, I just took a ""satellite"" purse with me. My satellite purse is just basically a wristlet that comes with a detachable cross-body shoulder strap and simply holds your cellphone, cards, and change but I can fit a lip balm in there, too and yet it's the size of your phone. It was perfect for taking walks on the beach or for day/night fun.I picked the Cosmic Girl print because I didn't want it to look like a computer bag (though it will be used for that, too); I didn't want it to look like a beach bag (though I did use it for that!); and I didn't want it to look like all my other purses or bags (a solid black or brown) - so the pattern worked really well for me.It absolutely solved all my anxiety of which bag to take and freed me up of lugging a purse and a carry-on, and having to transfer anything back and forth.The only ""negative"" comments I have are this: In my opinion, they should automatically make EVERY type of tote bag with a shoulder strap option (cross body preferred)! It's ridiculous not to! I don't care whether it is detachable or even as an additional purchase, but these days it is so much easier to wear things cross body and is also better on your back, neck and shoulders.The other comment I have is that although the water bottle section was big enough for two of my Chug bottles, I would've preferred to have a pocket on each end of the bag rather than only one end. It just made the bag heavy on one side and awkward, so if they did that it would distribute the weight. Small 'complaint', but I thought I would mention it.I will get so much use out of this bag, and know you will, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6MH4YD4USMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P13KV6#wasThisHelpful","R1J6MH4YD4USMV","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One day about ten years ago, it seemed I woke up and could no longer wear shoes - it seemed just like that. So, for the last ten years, it has been a real struggle to find shoes that are comfortable whatsover. I became desperate enough to not even care anymore what they look like.It's a sad day when that happens because if a woman can't wear shoes, then she can't wear clothes.So, for the last ten years, I wore fewer and fewer skirts or dresses. It really does change how you feel about yourself when you can no longer wear pretty; sexy; or flirty clothes and something as ""simple"" as shoes can really change a person's life.Then, I needed to absolutely find a pair of shoes for my daughter's wedding and I panicked. I didn't want to even GO because I would have no shoes to wear, and of course, then what clothes would I wear?! I felt sick and trapped that my own feet held me hostage!One day, I was watching a QVC episode online, and they were showing this shoe! The reviews were amazing! I went to Amazon.com and again, the reviews were the same! So, I ordered the shoes in the nude color and hoped for the best.I couldn't believe that right out of the box I could put these shoes on and walk all over the house! I was thrilled! But, I wondered - could they stand up to a wedding - on my feet for hours; and some dancing?These shoes not only stood up, but my feet never tired and I was able to wear a full length gown and feel like the pretty, feminine and sexy lady could finally be set free! I haven't felt that good in a long time and I thank you, thank you Clarks for making them and giving ""me"" back myself.*******Here's a side note: I had to travel to the wedding and checked two bags at the airport coming back home. I had 4 pair of shoes in the second bag, along with all my electronic chargers for everything. Two of the pairs were brand new and were this pair and another Clarks that I will do a review on also. When the airlines lost that bag, I was just sick. But, the good news is that I got the bag back today!!

"I saw a video of the QVC show where this shoe was introduced as well as read the glowing reviews. It is such a hot, sexy, classy, cool-looking shoe and I can ONLY wear Clarks - so I was hopeful.Sadly, it barely made it ON the foot and it was a resounding NO, for me. My left foot has a small bunion - even though very small, and hardly noticeable to some, if a shoe rests on it, it is so painful, it stops me in my tracks. The design of this shoe not only touched it, it pressed right on it. Extreme discomfort right from the start.If you watch the video on QVC, and you read the reviews - perhaps this is a shoe that will work for you. It has such promise, and I know would look awesome with  slacks, skirts and even jeans.I can't tell you how sad I was that this didn't work for me, but I know it's not the shoe - it's MY foot. :(*************Stay tuned.

"I have always secretly lusted after this juicer, but had already purchased another juicer. Still, in the back of my mind, I knew someday I would get this juicer.There was one review in particular that had 'sold' me back then, and I exchanged comments back and forth with that reviewer a number of times over the few years, and he was always so very helpful. Darn, I wish I could find it.Anyway..there was also another review that was hilarious, and it was his ""journey"" of juicing that I wanted to compare with on my review here today, but I cannot find that one either. Ah well, whenever I do, I will modify this one.There's not a lot I can contribute here that hasn't been said already.I'm an experienced juicer and by that I mean that I not only have had a number of juicers, but I sometimes had them simultaneously - LOL! I've also been juicing for about 19 years, which is how long I've had my VitaMix and back then, it was my primary ""juicer"" - whether blending ""whole juice""; or straining into a bowl and having ""strained juice""; which nowdays, we don't refer to the former as juice at all, but a blended drink.Anyway, I digress..I've had both types of juicers - the centrifugal and the masticating - as well as a number of different brands/models of each one, and I'm back to the masticating, and gladly! Yes, there's more chopping involved, but it's been no big deal at all for me, and if it is, I can do beforehand and store in the fridge until ready.The cleanup is so delightful, I practically giggle  - but the JUICE! It's far better!I love the carry handle. I have to actually lift it and move it to a different area whenever I juice, and it's so easy to do. I love the design and how smooth and high quality it is. And you can't beat that 15 year warranty!Although this is one time that I did NOT purchase through Amazon; as I work retail on the weekends and purchased there using my discount. When working there I recommend this model all the time.I have not used the other features but when I do, I will be sure to comment on them. I'm anxious to make almond butter!It's so wonderfully quiet to operate and takes everything I've thrown at it so far.Be sure to understand what you should and shouldn't juice with juicers. I've read some reviews that comment about fruits. The saying goes ""..EAT your fruits; JUICE your vegetables"" and that is primarily true. So, to the reviewers who are looking to juice things like blueberries or raspberries, this is NOT how to go about it, and your quickest best route for things like that would be to blend (straining, optional). No, these types of juicers use fruit to augment the stronger flavors of vegetables and greens - using harder fruits such as apples; and ones that juice well, such as citrus, and pineapples.I don't regret my juicing journey or feel that I didn't like the other juicers I had, or that it has been a frustration or disappointment  with the ""types"" and styles of juicing. Not only do you somewhat have to have the experience in order to truly know what will suit you best; but also your needs change! Just like anything else in Life, right?For me, I can safely say that this is where I want to stay - with the Omega 8004 and my trusty Vitamix - I need nothing else. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10EWBD29DG7CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RLYOEE#wasThisHelpful","R10EWBD29DG7CQ","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Foolish and dumb as this may sound, I'd forgotten what impact caffeine has on various health issues - primarily raising my ocular pressure - and that can be serious for those with Glaucoma and other medical eye issues.New job; new pressures; stress; longer hours; inclement weather, and I was brewing more coffee and having more refills; taking bigger travel mugs and not thinking about it. I was using a higher quality of coffee and had read many articles about how organic; higher quality, etc really has more to do with how coffee affects/doesn't affect someone than the actual caffeine component, so I felt I was ""okay"" with drinking more of it. Wrong (at least for me).I had forgotten how I used to mix my coffee half and half with Teeccino and that cut down the caffeine. Teeccino's a great product, but it is not very cost effective for me, and I prefer something without the gluten.In the past, I tried the packets of Dandy Blend and it was ok. They quickly hardened and dried out so I threw away the unused packets.I had received some very bad news from my Ophthalmologist, so back to the drawing board and saw this 2# bag of Dandy Blend, with outstanding reviews and comments and thought I'd give it a go again. After all, it's a MUST!Not only is it gluten-free (and they explain on their site 'how' that is); but dandelions are great for the liver which is very closely related to eye issues - they go hand in hand. (I already take Milk Thistle every day for my liver, so this will be an added bonus!)Then I asked all of you a few questions on the Q/A area (great feature, and big help!). I wanted to be able to brew Dandy Blend along with a scoop of regular coffee grounds (as I did with Teeccino) and you all told me how I could. Score!So, right now I'm enjoying a delicious cup - or two, or three - of mixed brew and eventually will cut out the coffee altogether.I was too chicken to put the DB in the brew basket, so I used my normal amount of water for the pot; only put in one scoop of coffee, instead of two, and then when it was finished brewing, I added one rounded tablespoon to the pot and stirred it in.FABULOUS!The recipes and ideas on both the bag and the website are great - I would have never thought of doing that. Now I look forward to trying it. I'm getting ready to do some traveling, so will bring some with me.Folks - we can monitor our BLOOD pressure at home (which I occasionally do); but we cannot monitor our own ocular pressure. Hopefully, one day, it will be possible to do. Fortunately for me, I HAVE to go regularly to keep a close watch on it; but I was without insurance and took my chances and it was almost disastrous. Please be sure to get your eyes checked regularly, especially to check your pressures. It's still the leading cause of blindness.*****One week later****I only mixed with coffee for one week. I ended up loving it so much, I prefer it ALONE! It's delicious! And what's really awesome - no headaches; no fatigue; no withdrawals whatsoever being without coffee!

"I'm sure that you, like me, have dozens of various shapes and sized water bottles filling up your cupboards and even at work.

I love that they have an option to buy EIGHT for families, or for those who are good 'planners' and freeze some to have later.I love that I have dropped them and nothing happened.I love that they snap closed tightly and when closed properly do not leak no matter how they are tossed around in my bag.And I love them so much I am taking them on the plane with me (empty of course) because I won't be without them.I would've never guessed that I would enjoy a water bottle so much so I guess another winning surprise!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUGOTRFKG618/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001R70RIK#wasThisHelpful","R2SUGOTRFKG618","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been wanting these forever. Finally, with the Holidays coming, I decided to splurge and get them, especially since it came as a two-pack.The reviews were awesome, and so is the price so I couldn't wait to get them and use them.Primarily what I wanted to use them for was for roasting vegetables. I used to use foil on a cookie sheet, drizzle olive oil and seasonings over them and roast them, but so many stuck to the foil that it was a waste of expensive organic produce plus I didn't want the aluminum from the foil getting in my food.I thought the silicone baking mats would be perfect and like the idea of using a reusable product rather than disposables. I could easily store them, and it would be so easy.Instead, I had such dreadful experiences with it, that I just gave up and tossed the one right into the trash!First of all, it would not wash clean. The oil, no matter what I washed it with, just seemed to ""grow"" worse and it was a huge mess trying to get it clean. It stained after one use, and it burned and burned right into the mat and it was worse trying to get the blackened bits out of the mat more than it ever was trying to clean a dirty pot! I got these to save me time and energy and cleanup - not create even more! Since I can't put them in the dishwasher, I had to clean by hand and they weren't cleaning! Even a de-greaser didn't get it done.Maybe they are fine for biscuits or cookies, and that's wonderful for all who have used it and loved it.As for me, this is the worst purchase I've made. Oh well, after all these years, I'm bound to have one flop.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9P8A85O2W7C7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00629K4YK#wasThisHelpful","R9P8A85O2W7C7","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To begin with, I think stevia tastes awful no matter how you mask it. I grow it outside and have picked the leaves off and chewed them just to see if maybe the 'freshest possible' might make a difference. It doesn't. Stevia is just bitter and nasty and leaves an aftertaste.There are a couple of brands that get all the accolades and all the advertising and this is one of them. Since most food things are a personal preference, one can not argue that it 'is' or 'isn't' tasty and good as you either like it or you don't.All I can say is I haven't necessarily found a stevia that doesn't taste like stevia - LOL! But, I have found an item that I DO like better than this one - is twice the amount in ounces and costs less, and with less of an aftertaste, but still has an aftertaste. I did not get it from Amazon, however (how rare!).There are better ones out there, and that give you more, for less money.

"Minus one point for the mesh zipper pocket inside the bag. The mesh does make it nice to be able to see what's inside the pocket and I agree that that can be nice, hoowever, it gets in the way constantly when you are pulling something out  either by coming out with it, or by pulling up. Also, the mesh material rubs my hand very roughly and it hurts! So, improving that part of the purse in the material and in keeping it better in place would be great.Everything else is really nice. I love having the open pocket in front - perfect for things I don't want to have to constantly zip and unzip but just grab such as my work badge and keys.The back zipper is big enough to hold my Kindle 3 or a paperback.I don't buy bottled water (bring your own and save on landfill debris!) but I have a container that fits in the water bottle holder and am happy about that because I avoid bottled water at all cost.I'm a true, diehard Travelon fan and all my bags are Travelon.

"Not much really to say about this. I wanted something I could have coins in  but not have to lay down on a surface to open and get them out; and to be able to do with one hand. I wanted something that might securely hold other things as well since other reviewers mentioned earphones, etc, and sometimes I am digging for safety pins or something small and this holds it securely.I wanted something I could grab and put in a pocket if I wanted to, in order to just dash out of the house without a purse. It has a key ring attached to the inside, so a perfect place for a spare key.I think it would be great to give to your house sitter/neighbor/dog sitter to have the house key, plus inside the pocket could be a list of phone numbers or feeding instructions, etc.I just got it so I don't have any issues with the hinges. It opens very easily, unlike what one reviewer said that it was very difficult and you needed to be strong. Not mine, at all. I would've preferred better quality, sure, but I guess that's what you get for about eight bucks. It isn't terrible quality, no, but it's not a $30 item, either.I'm very sensitive to smells and this is really stinking up my purse. I do expect that to go away however. Hopefully.

"This is a review for the entire Season 2 of Grimm. What began as just needing something to watch (and for free streaming) ended up as an absolute obsession.In the beginning of Season 1, it took a few episodes before deciding if it was worth my time. Was David Giuntoli just another pretty face or did this show have any possibility?First, let me tell you that as Season 1 wrapped up and I got wrapped up in Season 2, not only did the star, Nick, played by David Giuntoli prove to be a terrific actor - but the actors together do a superb job. I really like Hank, played by Russell Hornsby all the more once he was ""in the loop"" as to the real goings-on; and the development of the Captain's character was a nice turn of events. The character, Monroe, played by Silas W. Mitchell is the real maker of the show, because without him, it would be missing the element of humor and charm. And I love the addition of Rosalee! She's superb. The only character that's flawed is Juliette, who I found not only annoying, but her acting is sub-par and took away from the show. Everyone else made up for it though.The writing, storyline, acting, makeup, special effects and scenery make this Season 2 of Grimm the best. I stayed up late last night to watch three in a row if that tells you anything!(I do not recommend for children - let it be for adults only, in my opinion)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q43B30LTWYOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QTTGGG#wasThisHelpful","R3Q43B30LTWYOT","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's nothing wrong with the product and it certainly has many well deserved reviews by those who really seem to enjoy it.I am still in search of the 'perfect' sweetener, and quite frankly, that pursuit is a bit bittersweet. No wonder sweeteners are 'big money' and why there's Big Pharma involved; and GMO's involved as everyone wants to find the perfect sweetener, too.The short version is that I'm not happy with stevia (even those that say they don't have an aftertaste - they do); honey just doesn't do well in coffee; maple syrup is my favorite natural sweetener so far, but it's expensive and messy. I haven't tried agave yet but am looking for one that is not processed in the same way HFCS is; and just the name Xylitol is scary to me (although I like it the best overall). The latest reports on xylitol are not favorable either.So, I ordered this coconut palm sugar with high expectations. It looks good. It tastes okay too. There is no unfavorable smell. So, what don't I like? Well, for me anyway, I found I needed 2-4 times as many spoonfuls in my tea and coffee as I did with regular sugar. And although reported to be lower in calories and certainly lower glycemic levels, going through it fours times as fast just to get to the same sweetness level was just not going to be cost effective.Another reason I don't care much for it is because it reminds me of rapadura.Last year I had ordered five POUNDS of rapadura sugar from a local bulk co-op here. It had great recommendations and looked promising. However, number one, I can't stand the smell of it, and number two, I can't stand the taste of it, and number three, I had to double or triple the amount to get to my sugar equivalent sweetness. But, since I didn't like the taste or smell, I didn't get very far with it anyway.The coconut sugar reminds me of the rapadura experience in appearance and (lack of) sweetness. The only good thing is it doesn't taste or smell bad.I'm not saying you will feel this way. You probably won't and it could be just 'me'. But I am not likely to order again and will keep searching..","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31X8R9WNWJO9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004KPFUCO#wasThisHelpful","R31X8R9WNWJO9H","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who doesn't enjoy pasta in some form or another? With its many shapes and sizes and great in both hot and cold dishes and many different cuisines, pasta is just a staple in most peoples' homes.But, if starch, or wheat, or gluten is an issue, or grains in general are an ""issue"" with some people, you're bound to miss having your favorite dishes. I know I have. I have found various substitutes for noodles - and they are great in and amongst themselves - but I still longed for ""regular"" noodles.Spelt didn't do it. Rice noodles didn't either.

"I've always owned Rival brand Crock Pots. Do you ever buy something and think it's because that's what you're ""supposed to"" buy? Maybe it's because that's what Mom always did, or some other reason?Well, the first crock pot I ever heard of was Rival and it's been Rival all through the years.When it came time for me to buy one again, I bought the larger, oval shaped Rival and have been using it for about 8 years but was never happy with it. For one, the Low setting cooked much too hot; and I thought I would like the oval shape but really didn't.I use a crock pot weekly, primarily to make healthy bone broth and if the temperature is too hot, it will not become gelatinous and it will also not taste right. Such has been the case now for months but I just couldn't justify buying another one when this one wasn't truly 'broken'.But my last batch of broth tasted 'burned' and I decided to throw in the towel and get a new crockpot and I wanted something smaller, as well as round.The first one I ordered was too small (what was I thinking!?) and I sent it back.Then I decided on this slow cooker, stepping outside my Rival zone - one for the three settings, and two for the great price and reviews.I used it yesterday and was tickled. I love being able to switch to the ""keep warm"" setting. I love the round shape.I will update if I feel or experience anything differently, but as for right now, I am glad I got it.Ha!

"This was a free item, just so you know that I did not *purchase* this book.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I don't have kids at home anymore, so to be honest, I only had an interest because of listening to co-workers; reading FB posts, etc and seeing how poorly our children are eating and being concerned about it. I like to be able to make suggestions that are helpful with the idea of ""what would I do if I still had kids at home to prepare lunches for??""I believe that part of the reason for kids not having good, nutritious meals is largely due to 1)Education - about healthy eating choices as well as learning about PREPARATION (SO many people these days don't know how to cook!); 2)Sheer laziness - grabbing a bag of chips; some Lunchables, and an apple is just ""easy"" to throw in a child's lunchbox; 3)Lack of imagination - however, the more you know, the more you will (should!) want to know; 4)Learning ""workarounds"" for inconveniences; 5) ""Stigma""(I can comment more later on what I mean by ""stigma"" and how to get around that, if anyone cares)I thought this ebook had a lot of interesting, different recipes (imagination!) that were kid-friendly and nutritious and therefore, I am happy to share this book with FB friends who struggle with lunch ideas for the family.My only comment that I would have liked to see would be ways to show how these recipes get implemented into the typical busy family's work week and how kids can bring to school for lunch as a practical school-week lunch.I think the author did a good job!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B5OCUCK5AAA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1J50A0#wasThisHelpful","R3B5OCUCK5AAA7","A1TCSC0YWT82Q0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TCSC0YWT82Q0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely fell for ""Jericho"" with a passion and an addiction like I've never had before for any TV series. The acting, the characters, the writing all reeled me in hook-line-and sinker to a show that had me on the edge of my seat with my pulse racing the whole time.I never knew of its existence when it was a television show, and it was such a wonderful 'find' when exploring my Amazon Prime benefits and I latched on to Season 1 and 2 immediately.What a grave disappointment to learn that it ended there..with a makeshift compromise of a comic book version of continuation in what is known as Season 3, and holding out for something that will be Season 4.Nonetheless, in my excitement to at least keep the story going and not wanting to part with the characters (!), I ordered the Kindle version of Season 3. I have the 8.9 inch screen and STILL have to use a magnifying glass to see the print. So much of the adrenaline and the excitement is gone trying to suffer through it.For only the second time in 19 years of being an Amazoner, I'm considering a refund. It just doesn't do it for me.

I had stopped eating pasta altogether because I was so dissatisfied with everything. I would end up occasionally just buying 'regular' old .99 cent - whatever's on sale at the grocery store stuff to eat since the ""good stuff"" didn't do me any good and cost a fortune so why not suffer through it to be able to eat certain recipes?!

How the constitution came to be and why the constitution exists When our founding fathers sat down to write the declaration of independence it was not written over night. Although it is over 200 years old only 16 amendments have been added since. The reasoning is because the founding fathers took their time to cover as many angles as they could. With the times changing however there has been some loop holes many have used to slip through and change / bend the rules. Knowing your own constitutional rights are essential.

There are three different types of parenting 1. Authoritarian, 2. Permissive / Indulgent  and 3rd is Authoritative . The authoritarian is the parents know best and expect obedience . Permissive / Indulgent are the parents that give in afraid to upset and or anger their child offering very little guidelines. Authoritative - blends a caring tone , however sets structure and expectations . This istaread is based on the permissive / indulgent parent style in which has limited the now adult from being fully prepared entering college.

"We own a few straighteners in the house however this is the first one I used. The packaging is gorgeous with the zebra design on the outside as well as inside. Comes with the designer box, straightener and instructional manual. The straightener was easy to use and took literally maybe 3 minutes for my entire head of hair to straighten. The only downside was the on/ off switch along with temperature switch is inside. While this product is not in use that would not be a problem, however trying to turn it off may end up causing some burns. I would recommend unplugging it instead.

"I own several memory foam pillows. I never used them prior to this past year , however don't know how I lived without them prior. With memory foam pillows they retain the shape and contour of your own head, and spine. Helping to alleviate spinal problems, head aches, snoring etc. The bamboo helps to keep body temperature down , keeping it a cool surface. Normally these pillows expand greatly , this one however expanded but not to the width I have seen in others. The fillings seemed bunched up and or not spreading out in some areas. This is a queen pillow measuring 18"" in width and 30' in length. The bamboo covering can be taken off and washed in the washing machine as well as dried in the dryer. A regular queen pillow case can be used over it or with out it. I allowed mine to rest for about 48 hours. I have tried to fluff it a few times to get it to activate however there was some areas in which still remained lumpy. Over all this will make a great chest and or leg pillow.

Which can be reused in between use for storage. Slide the box open and the first thing you will see is the toy in a satin material box. There is also a box for the usb cord followed by instructional manual. This is a perfect toy to hit all the spots at once. The curvature creates and adds to different sensations while in use. This type of material is very easy to clean and keep maintained. Unlike other toys that have a sticky residue silicone this is more of a medical grade style in which lint does not attract or attach to it.To use - First plug in toy with the usb cord provided. Allow to charge for about 3 hours. ( 3 hour charge normally last a full 90 minutes if not greater)Hold down the 10x and RS together for approximately 3-4 seconds (this will also be how you turn the device off)There are 10 speed and vibration levels on the 10 x- these will go from pulsating , vibrating to a mixture depending on your preference.3 vibration speeds on the RS - slow , fast, fasterTouch - Is heat activated as well as touch activated.

"Fascinating memoir on Jimmy Carter. This Summary and Analysis didn't leave much out. It covered his early years, his family, his friends, his wife and everything that lead up to him being president and beyond. A rich life is not about money, but memories and he has plenty. I liked how they went into his own ethical and moral upbringing as well as code he has followed. An insight to all his success, may we all be as fortunate. The writer was fluent in his writing style. Did not appear to jump or skip but captivated as much of the original book as he could in his summary and analysis. Highly recommended.

"I can't believe all the positive reviews on this shoe --- did the others receive a different product than I?First thing I noticed was that the quality looks pretty bad overall.  The leather is hard, brittle, and scratchy on the inside (blister-making material for sure) and the staples in the shoe might be ok for saddles or something but on a shoe it really does look like a fifth grader made it.  I already anticipated this would need a Foot Petal or other insert since the wood surface would probably kill my feet after an hour or so and was as expected from pictures.  I went a full size up as others advised, which was correct, but still overall awkward.  I probably had a half inch of space in the back of the heel but the width of the front fit perfect (any smaller/narrower would be too tight) and the straps connected to the shoe base for the ankle strap were digging in under my foot (again with the hard, scratchy leather.)

"At one point in the story there is a joke about watching teenwolf --- if you've ever seen the mtv tv series, you will recognize quite a few similarities in the threads of this story.  I liked the hero a lot, he made the story for me.  He was an extremely mature and responsible kid and did not do stupid.  Very refreshing.  As much as he longed for his happy childhood and mourned for his murdered father, he soldiered on and was there to support his mother.  Two major problems (besides the teenwolf similarities) that dropped the ratings for me was 1) there was no plausible explanation why he is an alpha freak of nature since he was only half-werewolf and 2) the romance with his major enemy's girlfriend was flat.  I had no idea why he liked her.  They felt like they could tell each other everything and she didn't feel like she could tell anyone else.  Hah?  What about her boyfriend, the a$$hole bullying teen alpha?  She and the hero are running around together at night bonding over illicit kid hockey games and falling asleep watching move marathons together but she had no intention the whole time of breaking up with her boyfriend.  Only after the boyfriend tries to kill her does she realize she likes the hero?  What?  As a romance it was lame and weak.

"The characters in this story were all over the place.  So was the plot now that I think about it.  Hero didn't want to be alpha but became alpha and now wants to keep alpha status.  Isn't supposed to fall for anyone because he will be forced to hook up with whoever can snag the alpha female position but can't stay away from heroine.  Is major alpha to everyone except heroine who seems to be able to out-alpha even him.  Can even best another werewolf in a fight barehanded.  Not sure if there would be a reveal about her later but gave up halfway through.  Heroine is rebel without a cause since werewolves have somewhat first class citizen status in town.  Her cause is betrayed by best friend.  They do - do not - do - do not want to make up with each other to be bffs again.

Batman is probably the most changed but he actually works better as a vampire.  The mystery was excellent and kept me guessing.  What stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that even though the characters showed flashes of friendship and --- basically humanity, I guess --- they were all essentially unlikable characters that were flawed, egomaniacal, and it was hard to feel sympathetic for them even when you saw they deserved it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN5SDY3SQ4Q10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S1TATA#wasThisHelpful","RN5SDY3SQ4Q10","A27TQA0XCZUXZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TQA0XCZUXZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Second installment after Justice League War, Aquaman origin story.  Nowhere near as good as the first --- Arthur is a nice guy and not the angry man portrayed in other recent renditions.

Although I never cared much for Steve and not at all for Lois (who is a big B in every story rendition I've ever seen), can't say I'm a fan of the supes-ww romance here either --- this storyline seems to have cornered the market in awkward, stilted romances.  Strangely, the bats/supes pairing is still somehow a successful duo --- maybe to do with the normal/nice guy and tortured/jerk dynamic.  Cyborg, Lantern, and Flash have distinct personalities and add some humor to the story.

The material feels very plastic tablecloth thin which is a good and bad thing.  It should be lighter/cooler and I could easily tuck in the back flap in as I planned but also felt a bit cheap and flimsy overall.  The brim was slightly dented in a couple spots and felt like lightweight cardboard similar to a 12 can coca cola box weight.  Likely it would not be able to keep its shape very well over time.  On the plus side, the fit for my approx. 22.5"" head was loose but the sturdy cinch in the back worked really well to tighten it up.

I went with the fossil color which looks exactly as pictured live.  I actually like the array of colors --- even the crazy green-green one, why not--- being offered for outdoor wear.  Not like I'll be trying to match it with my office or dining out clothes, after all.  The material is similar to swim shorts and feels light, durable, and like it can handle water and sweat well.  The mesh inside helps keep your head cool.  The UPF and wider brim is the perfect width to keep the sun away but not get in your way.  Material and make quality is excellent.  Fits my approx 22.5"" head just about right so I would probably only need the draw cord at the crown (or chin strap) if it was a really windy day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QDYL3FB50TQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8Q4AL0#wasThisHelpful","R1QDYL3FB50TQ3","A27TQA0XCZUXZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TQA0XCZUXZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quality and materials are decent (did not try it in the rain, though.)  Fit my approx 22.5"" head on the loose side but has the drawcord to fit as needed and did not look bunchy or anything.  I did not notice in the description that the brim style is longer in front and back and slightly thinner on the sides if you like that effect.  I prefer a wide brim all around so I returned the hat but did not dock any stars for it.

As others noted, there was a lot of horse-related info and I sort of skim-read the pages relating to that since they were not relevant to the fae murder mystery being solved.

"These are obviously very slim inserts so those expecting instant nike walking on cloud action or birkenstock arch support are sure to be disappointed.  Also, I am pretty sure any super-cushion/arch support will require you buy your shoes a full size up --- I have some of those cushion/arch support types and they only fit in my running shoes because I can trade out the existing inserts.  Fashionable sandals or closed heels would be hopeless.So for those times when I've decided to sacrifice a little comfort for fashion, this is my answer.  These inserts have always fit in my regular sized sandals and fashionable heels without making them tighter yet adds enough padding to make that fashionable high heel that gets uncomfortable after 4 hours an 8 hour comfort shoe.  I have read that the foam is similar to custom orthotic type and will not get squished into flat paper or redistribute unevenly over time.Regarding difficulties putting in the insert --- I am willing to pay that price as long as the glue action is strong so it does not move around.  Having said that, I have never lost any inserts due to re-positioning mishaps.  After putting the first set I ever bought in place, I pretty much figured out how I could get it to work for me.  Here are some tips if useful for others:  The first time I insert the cushion, I guide it into the toe area on top of my hand and feel with my fingers where I want the main pad to sit under my foot.  I let the whole thing sort of sit ""lightly"" and re-position as needed (as long as you haven't pressed it on you can carefully pull it off and move it.)  Then I sit and with my foot up (no pressure on the insert) slide my foot in to the shoe as close to the top of the shoe to not press down and try to feel if it is where I want it or I need to try to re-position it.  Generally at that point, though, I'm good so I stand up in it to really let the glue stick in place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2AU960XXPVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XERXTE#wasThisHelpful","RN2AU960XXPVD","A27TQA0XCZUXZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TQA0XCZUXZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I collect children's books for the illustrations mainly but it still has to have a good story.  Case in point:  I was really torn up about this one because the illustrations are so beautiful but the story is so awful.Perhaps it was supposed to be whimsical but the whole plot came across to me as totally random and, therefore, pointless.  There was no clever reason nor resolution to her no-kingdom situation and same goes for the romance with the hero.  Major events seem to happen without any real cause and effect.Another aspect where the whimsical theme did not work for me was the setting.  Sometimes anachronistic things can blend seamlessly --- as shown with the steampunk genre --- but this one was a mess.  There are pony carts, lords in white wigs, food fights, public libraries, and princesses with delivery careers who propose marriage to their hero.Lastly, I wondered what age this is supposed to be targeting, exactly?  I assume this book is meant for a child but how many children would enjoy or even understand about the hero's jester-contract running out and the couple's discussion about the work they will have to do --- he will tell jokes in pubs and she will continue to cart parcels ---  in order to ""make a go of it""?  In a modern story that would not be out of place but in a princess story with such charming illustrations, those realities are just jarring and ugly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW6UD8LLF0SA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=184616799X#wasThisHelpful","RW6UD8LLF0SA1","A27TQA0XCZUXZY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TQA0XCZUXZY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first read this story ages ago in middle school and still enjoy it as an adult today thanks to a library book sale.  This story is a nostalgic romance --- somewhat reminiscent of Georgette Heyer --- set in Honolulu in the late 1800s with the completion of the Iolani Palace and Hawaiian coronation ball as the backdrop.  Orphaned Samantha Allen travels from New England to live with her uncle in Honolulu.  She is warmly welcomed by her part Hawaiian Aunt and family but troubled by her promise to her dying mother to return a stolen jeweled cross from Acapulco.  The original thieves are still after it and she knows she could be bringing danger to everyone if they catch up with her.

However, the best feature of all is that opening the fan to clean the blades will not take an hour of cursing and trying to get multiple awkwardly placed screws on and off.

"_The Best of Amazing Stories: The 1926 Anthology_ (2014), ed. Steve Davidson and Jean Marie Stine. It is (as the title suggests) an anthology of eight short stories and novelettes from the first year of _Amazing_. The covers of the nine issues for that year (all by Frank R. Paul) are reproduced on the back for them that likes such stuff. Readers with a sentimental attachment to pulp fiction of the  silver Gernsbackian era may enjoy this volume. Most modern readers, I fear, will not.There are three stories in the anthology that may be fairly be called ""classical _Amazing_"" stories-- ""In the Abyss"" by H.G. Wells, ""The Runaway Skyscraper"" by Murray Leinster, and ""The Man Who Saved the Earth"" by Austin Hall. The Wells and the Leinster were reprints, from _Pearson's Magazine_ and _Argosy_, respectively. In fact, much of the material from the 1928 _Amazing_ was reprinted material from Jules Verne, Edgar Alan Poe, H.G. Wells, and Garrett P. Serviss. The Wells is the chiller about the explorer in the bathysphere who encounters deep-sea monsters in the Pacific. The Leinster is the sprightly comedy about the time-traveling skyscraper and what befell its inhabitants during their wild journey in the past. The Hall is a super-science tale about Earth versus Mars that is patently ridiculous from begining to end-- and yet is somehow great fun to read. I rarely say this of an Austin Hall story.Two stories-- Charles S. Wolfe's ""Whispering Ether"" and Samuel M. Sargent, Jr.'s ""The Telepathic Pick-up"" are two scientific wowsers about two mad scientists who are done in by their mind reading inventions. This is the first (and probably the last) publication of these tales.The remaining three stories have been reprinted a fair number of times and may be familiar to old timey readers of _Amazing_ like myself. But they are are really routine pulp stories at heart, with few virtues to recommend them. The stories are: G. Payton Wertenbaker's ""The Man from the Atom,"" Curt Siodmak""s ""The Eggs from Lake Tanganyika,"" and A. Hyatt Verrill's ""Through the Crater's Rim"". The Werttenbaker is about the man in the Colossal suit who views many galaxies before coming to a rest. The author wrote a sequel. The Siodmak is one of those mad-scientist-and the-monster-from-the-laboratory (this time giant fly) tales that Hugo Gernsback loved to print by the dozen in _Amazing_. The Verrill is a lost-race-in-the-Amazon-jungle story, complete with cannibal trees and bloodthirsty Aztec natives. The last two tales represent dead-end types of stories that have vanished from the field today, though you may still find them on the Late Nite Monster Shows from time to time.So, by my count there is one ""A"" story, two ""B's,""  three ""D's,"" and two ""F's""-- not a very outstanding lineup. This seems to be the first of a year-by-year series of collections from _Amazing_-- the 1927 anthology is due out soon. This is an idea that seems to me to be a spectacularly bad one. _Amazing_ did have its string of good years, but it also had its decades of bad ones. For much better anthologies of _Amazing_, I recommend _Amazing Stories: 60 Years of the Best Science Fiction_ (1985) and _Amazing Stories: Visions of Other Worlds_ (1986), both edited by Martin H. Greenberg.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I4L40RO26XBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500715956#wasThisHelpful","R1I4L40RO26XBO","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1963, Keith Laumer published a lively three-part serial in _Fantastic_ entitled ""A Hoax in Time"". The book version followed... sort of. It was entitled _The Great Time Machine Hoax_ (1964). But while it had essentially the same plot  as the original novel, it was very different in terms of details. Some scenes were cut from the original novel. Others were added. Dialogue was changed. Sequences of events were altered. This is the original serial version that appeared in _Fantastic_, and for my money it still  wears very well.It is a lighthearted fantasy adventure of the sort that L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt used to do for _Unknown_, but it does have a kind of philosophy that might be described as a kind of amiable hedonism. The basic plot is this: Chester W. Chester has inherited a Victorian monstosity of a house, a supercomputer with his late grandfather's personality, and millions of dollars of back taxes in debt.

"G. K. Chesterton's _The Ball and the Cross_ (1910) was his second novel. [His first was _The Napoleon of Notting Hill_ (1904)]. While it was not published in book form until after his masterpiece, _The Man Who Was Thursday_ (1908), the magazine serial preceeded _Thursday_ (_Commonwealth_ 1905-1906). So _The Ball and the Cross_ must be considered the earlier novel.In later years, Chesterton expressed a dissatisfaction with the novel. In the flyleaf of a copy owned by Father John O'Connor (the original of Father Brown), Chesterton inscribed a poem that read in part:This is a book I do not like,Take it away to Heckmondwike,...The speeches jerk, the chapters sprawlThe story makes no sense at all.Now, it is true that the novel is not without faults. But it is a novel written during Chesterton's most creative period. It is not without its virtues as well.There are two noteworthy faults of the novel. The first is Chesterton's satire of science-- in particular, his dismissal of evolution. Chesterton had little knowledge of either science in general or evolution in particular. We may take chesterton's scientific satire to be verbally witty but essentially nonsensical.The second fault is the final chapter of the novel, an apocalyptic ending in which everything goes up in flames, the atheist is converted to Christianity at the last moment,, and the City of God comes to Earth. Now this may have seemed to Chesterton (and a few conservative Catholics) like the Cat's Meow of a light comedy ending. But an ending in which all the characters ( and everybody else in the world) has been fried by eternal fire left me a bit less than cheery. And Chesterton's chipper assurance that it was all okie-dokie because God saved everybody's soul somehow failed to elicit the proper comic spirit in me.However, before this rather apalling ending, Chesterton actually presents a rather decent novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJ47MIRR4LAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481956787#wasThisHelpful","R2QJ47MIRR4LAN","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"James Reynolds's _Ghosts in Irish Houses_ (1947) is a beautiful book, a real labor of love, ten years in the making. It is a blend of lovely art and folk tales. The cover is a striking wash of Rahee Castle, where the tale of ""The Four Terrors"" takes place-- a grim tale of brotherly double-cross and a bloody curse which followed a family for centuries thereafter..Other ghostly tales of a grim and bloody nature include ""The Bridal Barge of Aran Roe,"" which the author claims to have seen near Slithey Rock; ""Red Eva's Lepp,"" about a formidable female warrier who came back as a red cow; ""The Bloody Stones of Kerrigan's Keep,"" a nasty tale of revenge and ghosts that drive men insane even today; and ""The Black O'Flaherty of Castle Blake,"" about a _really_ nasty family: ""From the shadow of O'Flaherty, God deliver me"" (231).Not so bloody, perhaps, but a story of rather horrible revenge is ""Shallardstown and the Orloff Whip"". And for a similar tale of personal evil, there is ""Mrs. O'Moyne and the Fatal Slap"".Ghosts of a more whimsical or more sympathetic nature are ""mickey Filler and the Tasey Wreath,""  the circus ghost at the ""Place de la Reine Hippique,"" the incorrigible twins of ""Badminton in Bloomers,"" the lovely governess of ""The Phantom Portrait,"" and the wild girl who found true love in ""The Spanish Fan"".Rather bad but unusual haunts are the gluttonous Squire Bannot, ""the filthiest ghost in all of Ireland"" (10) and the headless Ormand Mallory of whom it was said ""he invested wickedness with a brightness and a sparkle"" (56). And Old Scratch himself makes one appearance as well.Two stories, ""Duel with Song"" and ""The Shattered Mirror,"" come from Belvelly Castle, and were related to the author by a folklorist from the area. Stories about the Castle abound. These are different tales from different times, but they both have to do with the sin of pride and the horrors that can come of it.""The Drums of Rathmoy"" involves the resistence to Cromwell's invading fleet and why Rathmoy house survived the bombardment and shuns occupants to this day. ""The ghostly Catch"" is about a manifestation that arises out of the sea like a force of the gods even today. One tale is Irish patriotic, the other, Irish mythical. The second was told by a man who was injured by the Catch.The illustrations are partly of places--Sligo Rock, Slieve Donard, Kerrigan's Keep, and Rathmoy House. Some of the illustrations are of the historical people as they were when they were alive. The frontspiece is of Red Eva McMurrough in her battle curass. There is also her husband, Strongbow. The brothers of Rahee Castle, Princess Orloff, the O'Haggerty Twins... all are there. The circus ghost is not, but her much beloved toy horse is. Also present are portraits of native Irishmen: A White-Hooded Woman of Balinsoe, Kelp Gatherers of County Galway, a Listening Girl at Belvelly Castle. There is an illustrated map of Ireland with the Castles and Houses drawn in.In his introduction, Reynolds gives a thumbnail portrait of ghosts round the world. Italy and ireland, he says, have ""more ghosts per square inch"" (xiii) than any any other countries. Irish ghosts are no repectors of persons, but they do tend to be intensely personal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12VKAM9Z7KMOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486471713#wasThisHelpful","R12VKAM9Z7KMOY","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If ever there was a science fiction author influenced by Charles Fort, it was Eric Frank Russell. His early novels, _Sinister Barrier_ (1939) and _Dreadful Sanctuary_ (1948), used very Fortean themes. Later in life, Russell was active in the British end of the Fortean society, clipping out unusual (""unexplainable"") events from newspapers and playing host to Tiffany Thayer and other members of the Fortean society.Russell's _Great World Mysteries_ (1957) is a nonfictional, somewhat Fortean, book, though ultimately much more sane andsensible than the original books by Fort. It consists of eleven essays on some classic (and not-so-classic) mysteries. Two of the essays, ""Satan's Footprints"" and ""The Creeping Coffins of Barbados,"" were reprinted in _Fantastic_ in 1958. The first deals with a line of mysterious footprints in the snow, while the second deals with some coffins that were moved around in a sealed family vault. Russell offers solutions to both mysteries.Other cases that Russell discusses are those of the _Mary Celeste_, that of  Kasper Hauser, that of Benjamin Bathurst (who walked around the horses), Easter Island, spontaneous combustion, and levitation. There is also a chapter on flying saucers which Anthony Boucher loved but which I did not. There is a good index.I would recommend this book for somebody who does not already have an encyclopedic collection of books on the mysterious. It is an excellent introduction. To somebody aleady well-read in lore about saucers or Easter Island or sea serpents or the Kasper Hauser affair, this book may be a case of coals to Newcastle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHKQS692H8H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VDG2XE#wasThisHelpful","RWHKQS692H8H9","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anthony Boucher would occasionally give brief reviews in his ""Recommended Reading"" column in _Fantasy and Science Fiction_ on the latest batch of flying saucer books. He confessed that he collected "" the damned things"" and ""wouldn't miss a word of any one of them"" (74). Boucher professed to be an agnostic on the topic-- neither a skeptic nor a believer. But I believe that he later came to find much of the behavior of some saucer believers to be on the on the bizarre and outrageous side. I am on the skeptical side of the fence myself. I avoid most flying saucer books like the plague-- I find them to be mostly unmitigated trash.But Edward J. Ruppelt's _The Report on  Unidentified Flying Objects_ (1956, 1960) is that rare thing, a _respectable_ account of the U.F.O. phenomena, and it remains something of a classic today. It will not please sensation-seeking flying saucer nuts-- it is much too rational and sober-- and it did not initially please Air Force officials who wanted all UFOs neatly explained away. but it does represent the results of solid, honest investigation.First, a bit of background. The Air Force had a series of projects supposed to be officially investigating UFOs: Project Sign, Project Grudge, and Project Blue Book. Project Sign investigators were over ready to assign all UFO. reports to be extraterrestrial in origin. Early Project Grudge investigators bent over backwards to find non-saucer explanations-- some of them almost as bizarre as the saucer interpretations. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt was director of Projects Grudge and Bluebook from 1951 to 1953. Ruppelt was tempermentally skeptical, but he insisted on a thorough investigation of many of the reports and sightings._The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects_ is as close to an official, insider's view of the critical years of Project Blue Book that we are likely to have. But there are two different versions of the book. In the earlier, 1956 version, Ruppelt concludes that while _most_ UFOs can be accounted for in terms of named causes (such as airplanes, planets, lights, weather balloons, or hoaxes),  about 27% are still ""of unknown origin"". This leaves the door open for a few of them to be extraterrestrial. But in the 1960 edition, which adds three chapters, Ruppelt flatly concludes that the notion that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin is a ""myth"". Saucer believers tend to ignore the 1960 version, but I really don't see how we can. Ruppelt swung to the skeptical side, not because he was ""pressured"" by Air Force Brass, but simply because there was _no positive evidence in four years to support flying saucers_.It must be said that Ruppelt was becoming increasingly disenchanted with various saucer writers as well. He criticized Donald Keyhoe, the author of several bestselling books on flying saucers:To say the book [_Flying Saucers from Outer Space_] is factual depends entirely on how one uses the word. The details of the specific UFO sightings that he credits to the Air Force are factual, but in his interpretation of the incidents he blasts way out into the wild blue yonder. (chapter 17)As time went on, so did the number of reports from flying saucer nuts:Many inquiries come from saucer screwballs and these people are like a hypochondriac at the doctor's, nothing will make them believe the diagnosis unless it is what they came to hear. And there are plenty of screwballs.One officer summed it up neatly when he told me, ""It isn't the UFO's that give us trouble, it's the people."" (chapter 16)But the bulk of the book is loaded with anecdotal case studies that make absolutely fascinating reading. Of course, Ruppelt starts with the case that started it all-- that of private pilot Kenneth Arnold, who spotted several ""disc-shaped""craft flying over Mt. Ranier in 1947. Putting aside controversies about what Arnold actually said over the radio, Ruppelt is convinced that he did see actual aircraft (as opposed to sunspots or snow formations). Another early case was that of two Air Force colonels who spotted three objects in ""V formation"" while flying over the Carson Sink, Nevada area in 1952. They reported their findings in Colorado Springs, Nevada. (This one stuck in my mind because I have relatives in Colorado Springs.) And during 1946 and later in 1948, there were reports of ""ghost rockets"" of various shapes and colors appearing in many different countries around the world.In chapter two, Ruppelt spins out a story about crashed UFOs and two men known as ""Jackson"" and ""Richards"" and a Close Encounter on an island in 1947. Ruppelt piles on the details, and just when you think that you have encountered a real-life scenario out of _The X-Files_... Ruppelt jerks the rug out from under your feet. It was all a hoax cooked up by a couple of scoundrels who had just enough raw material to fake a UFO crash and some vivid imaginations. They were quickly exposed, and they faded off into the sunset.Ruppelt gives detailed attention to two ""classic"" UFO cases-- those of pilot Captain Mantrell of Kentucky, who was killed chasing down a UFO, and those of the famed ""Lubbuck Lights"" of Texas. Ruppelt does not interpret either case in the boogga-boogga manner that most saucer believers like. He believes that Mantell _could_ have been pursuing a skyhook balloon-- there was one just released from Tennessee at that time. But that we will never know for sure. Ruppelt rejects explanations involving extraterrestrial spacecraft or notions that Mantell was chasing down an image of Venus. As for the phenomenon of the Lubbock lights, well-witnessed over a long period of time by a lot of observant witnesses-- Ruppert does not give a solid conclusion to the mystery. but he rules out extraterrestrial space craft.In chapter four, Ruppelt gives attention to some spectacular bursts of light that appeared over parts of Mexico and the American southwest. They did not leave any trace of meteorite debris where they appeared. They always seemed to be the same shade of green. They were thoroughly investigated by some of the top scientists in America-- some of whom were eyewitnesses to the lights.But in the end, no solution to the mystery was found. One person suggested a ""duck hunter"" approach-- set up several observational ""blinds"" with permanent observers and cameras in places where the lights were likely to appear. This is sound in theory-- but awesomely expensive in practice.Other cases include the case of the Florida encounter with the scoutmaster that could be real... or a fraud, the case of the rise in radiation that coincided with a UFO sighting, and the massive numbers of UFOs that were sighted over Washington, DC and had President Truman calling him to ask what was going on. But Ruppelt says that there is always the persistent problem of perception. When one person says that they have seen a UFO, all critical thought goes out the window. Nobody asks if it could be anything elseIn one instance I traveled halfway across the United States to investigate a report made by a high ranking man in the State Department. An experienced observer. It was evening by the time I got to talk to him and he'd excitedly told me all the pertinent facts, how this bright light had ""jumped across the sky,"" he said, ""Want to see it? It's still there, but it's not jumping now.""We went outside and there was Jupiter. (chapter twenty)In a review of _The Report..._,  Anthony Boucher praised the book but predicted: ""Ruppelt is almost completely successful in maintaining a neutral attitude which will exasperate both 'pro' and 'anti-saucer' factions in and out of the USAF"" (90). He was quite correct in this prediction. But I will tell you. There is something likeable about the voice of the author who speaks to us. It is sane, rational, humorous, clear-headed, and energetic. And he has a fascinating tale to tell. This is a book worth rereading today._References_: Boucher, Anthony. ""Recommended Reading,"" _Fantasy and Science Fiction_, May, 1955, 74.

"Stanton Coblentz's _Under the Triple Suns_ (1954) is a novel from roughly the middle of his career. To be honest, it is a novel that has much the same strengths and weaknesses as his earlier and later novels. Stanton Coblentz (1896-1982) was a poet and satirist who was associated with the silver Gernsbackian era of the American science fiction pulps (from roughly 1926 through 1939), along with writers like David H. Keller, M.D., E.E. Smith, Ray Cummings, Miles J. Breuer, M.D., Capt. S.P. Meek, L.Taylor Hansen, Murray Leinster, and Edmond Hamilton.Coblentz's first novel, _The Sunken World_ (1928), was a straight utopian novel and proved to be passably good. But most of Coblentz's later novels were concerned with constructing silly, satiric dystopias. They were consequently marred by heavy-handed satire, cardboard characters, silly plots, and asinine dialogue. And yet, in a review of this very book, Damon Knight (1967) first pointed out an unexpected strength of Coblentz: His descriptive passages that evoke a sense of wonder-- in particular, an alien city on another world. He concluded that writers ought to study Coblentz's descriptive passages: ""If your alien planet is just like Broadway, or even just like Uganda, what the devil is the use of leaving Earth at all?"" (13)In evaluating _Triple Suns_, then, we must balance its weaknesses (its satire) with its strengths (its sense of wonder). Let us start  with the satire. Coblentz would usually have a main target for his satire in his novels. In _Hidden World_ (1935), it was perpetual warfare. In _Next Door to the Sun_ (1960), it was political electioneering. In _Lord of Tranerica_ (1966), it was automation. In _Under the Triple Suns_, the target is social classes and social repression of the ""have nots"" by the ""haves"" in society. This is done through some fairly obvious symbolic action.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ALTPD3TOM7V0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612872166#wasThisHelpful","R3ALTPD3TOM7V0","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas M. Disch's _The Prisoner_ (1967) is a novelization that was a tie-in to the unusual television series starring Patrick McGoohan. It was written to make a quick buck, and I think that it would be grossly overstating the case to say that this novel is a classic like _The Genocides_ (1965), _Camp Concentration_ (1967), or _337_ (1971). But it is much better written than anybody had a right to expect it to be.The basic story line is this: The unnamed  hero hero is an ex Secret Service man who is promptly kidnapped and made prisoner in a strange, Orwellian Village, populated with automaton-like Villagers and guarded by giant spheres called Guardians. There authorities try to pick his mind while our hero hatches increasingly complicated plots to escape.The action of Disch's novel covers the early action of the series, from a scene with the hero's girl friend just before his kidnapping to a rather bizarre final scene that is something of a cliffhanger. It is true that some characters claim that the hero has ""been to the village before"". There is even some question as to whether the Village is really one Village or many. This is all part of the story's ambiguity, its playing with our sense of reality. But the action of the tale is meant to coincide with (roughly) the first three or four  episodes of the series. It does not take place after the action of the original series has ended.Unlike the series, Disch does not provide scenes that show his hero is a secret agent. He rather hints at it a few times, but his background is less clearly sketched out than in the television series.. He is a bit more of an enigma. We do not know his name. He gives different ages of himself to different people. But there is one thing he is certain about: ""I am not Number 6. I am not a prisoner.I am a free man"" (49). This comes from a realization a bit earlier on about the nature of the Village:The Village, this splendid room, the mirror in its frame of ormolu, and even the image in the mirror were not to be trusted. What, then, was?His body, the body beneath these wrinkled evening clothes, that could be trusted.And his mind.Because these things could not be tampered with.He could trust (as finally we all must) himself.

"Murray Leinster's _Planets of Adventure_ (2003), ed. Eric Flint is an omnibus of two novels and five short stories by the Dean of Science Fiction. The novels are _The Forgotten Planet_ (1954) and _The Planet Explorer_ (aka, _Colonial Survey_, 1956). They are not without their faults, but they are overall two of Leinster's very best science fiction novels. The short stories are lesser-known Leinster pieces, but they are mostly competent tales that deserve reprinting. Eric Flint has shown excellent taste in his selections.Due to a rather complex publishing history, _The Forgotten Planet_ is something of a curiosity-- a science fiction novel with 1950s science told with a 1920s style of writing. The ancestors of the survivors of a spaceship crash have had the misfortune to be on a partly terraformed planet where the dominant life forms are giant insects. The novel is a retelling of the Prometheus myth and has a curious power._The Planet Explorer_ is a novel in which four novelettes from _Astounding_ featuring different heroes from the Colonial Survey Team were rewritten so that they would all have the same hero-- a fellow named Bordman. One of these novelettes, ""Combat Team,"" was based on Leinster's Hugo-winning story, ""Exploration Team"". Therein lies the problem. In the other three tales, Bordman is a young, bright, but somewhat insecure troubleshooter. In the fourth story, he is a pompous bureaucrat who spends most of the story threatening to toss the real troubleshooter in jail. The character is not consistent.Still, I would recommend that you read these tales. They are some of Leinsters most _thoughtful_ pieces of science fiction. They have a lot of sensible things to say about the limits of freedom and authority and about the different ways that different people will look at the same problem. They are also about teamwork and friendship-- among both humans and animals.The stories are: ""Anthropological Note"" (_Fantasy and Science Fiction_, 1957); ""Scrimshaw,"" (_Astounding_, 1955); ""Assignment on Pasik"" (_Thrilling Wonder Stories_, 1949); ""Regulations,"" (_TWS_, 1948); and """"The Skit-Tree Planet"" (_TWS_, 1947). ""Scrimshaw"" has been fairly frequently reprinted. ""Regulations"" has never been reprinted before now. The other tales have been reprinted only once.""Anthropological Note"" is the tale about the female anthropologist, the male murderous scoundrel, the Venusian villagers with the mysterious customs, and an alien god who may or may not exist. ""Scrimshaw"" is about a grizzled old lunar prospector who manages to outsmart some ruthless outlaws. ""Assignment on Paslik"" opens with a spectacular spaceship crash and follows with non-stop action ever afterward. Pure corn. ""Regulations"" involves yet another scoundrel who comes to a bad end because he didn't pay attention to the rule book. And ""The Skit-Tree Planet"" involves the puzzle of an alien city that can appear or disappear at will. Nothing really classic here, but solid pieces of craftsmanship from the Golden Age that deserve another look.My ratings are: _The Forgotten Planet_ and The Planet Explorer_: four stars apiece. Collective rating for the Short Stories: three stars. Global score: four stars. Incidently, editor Flint deserves a few bonus points for his detailed and accurate bibliographical notes on the novels and the stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R186WS5PCW6FTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0743471628#wasThisHelpful","R186WS5PCW6FTY","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Cyril Judd"" was the pseudonym of C.M. Kornbluth and Judith Merril, which they used for two novels, _Gunner Cade_ and Outpost Mars_ (both 1952). _Outpost Mars_ was was originally a three-part serial in _Galaxy_ in 1951 under the title ""Mars Child"". It was later recycled under the horrendous title of _Sin in Space_ (1961), a version of the novel which is best forgotten.Let us start with the obvious problem of the novel: It hasn't aged very well. In the early fifties, _Outpost Mars_ must have seemed to be a fairly ""realistic"" and ""scientific"" picture of what colonial life on Mars would very likely be like-- the antithesis of the Romantic Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Nowadays a colony existing outside of domes, with the colonists using nary a spacesuit, and the miracle pills that allow humans to breathe Martian atmosphere for a limited amount of time, and the archaic forms of radio communication seem to us less definitive than quaint.And yet, what remains is still a fairly well-told tale, with carefully drawn characters. It is a struggle between a utopia and a dystopia. The utopia is the Martian colony of Sun Lake, still desperately struggling for survival, but hoping against hope that they will be the foundation for a fine social civilization to follow. The dystopia is a large mining Combine that intends to take over Mars and rule it with an iron fist.The main leader of the colonists is the idealistic Dr. Tony Hellman. The leaders behind the Combine are the ruthless and greedy magnate Hugo Brenner and Hamilton Bell, Commissioner of Planetary Affairs. Bell is a corrupt politician who failed on Earth, was kicked out to Mars, and would now do anything to get back in with his party. He is in Brenner's pocket. Brenner accuses some member of Sun Lake of stealing a narcotic called marcaine from the Combine. (This is rich, since Brenner is a notorious drug dealer.) It has been tracked to the colony by a device called an electric Bloodhound. A search is started in the hopes that something will be found that will blacken the name of Sun Lake so that Brenner can shut it down.Various character caught up in the struggle of the drug search are Mimi Jonathon, the brave and competent leader of the colony; Anna, Tony's medical assistant and true love; Jim and Polly Kandro and their baby Sunny, the Mars Child of the story; Lieutenant Neely, the decent Army officer; Graham, the cynical reporter from Earth; Hank Radcliff, in love with Mars but blind to the fact that his wife Joan is going insane;  and Learoyd, the last of the old Mars pioneers. (""Call yourselves Marsmen? In six months half of you'll be dead. And the other half'll wish they was,"" 43.) And finally, almosty impossibly, there will be Martians.There is one thing that you will not find in great abundance in _Outpost Mars_, and that is vivid poetic description. There are a few spots where such things come to life, but not many. Here is one:[The rocket] looked like a bit of the sun at first; that was its braking blasts seen from under. The monster settled swiftly, roaring and flaring in a teasing mathematical progression of successively shorter blasts more closely spaced. When you could see its silvery bulk in profile it was going _pop-pop-pop-pop-pop_, like a machine gun. It settled with a dying sputter and stood on the field two hundred meters from the crowd like a remembered skyscraper. (89)But such scenes are extraordinarily rare. _Outpost Mars_ is an oddly _prosaic_ novel about Mars. There are no detailed descriptions of the Martian lanscape-- no descriptions of the desert, the Rimrock Mountains, or the Martian vegetation. And when the Martians themselves appear, they are sketchily described.. _Outpost_ relies on on character, dialogue, and action to tell its tale. And it is a tale worth telling. But I wish the camera had lingered just a little bit less on the colonists and a little bit more on the landscape.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KXJ0WFFJJUS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006AT56E#wasThisHelpful","R1KXJ0WFFJJUS7","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green.""-- Francis BaconThe above quotation is one of the themes of _Thankless in Death_ by J.D Robb (number 38 in her long-running series of futeristic detective stories featuring detectives Eve Dallas and the stalwart Peabody). Not surprisingly, the theme is revenge-- or, to be more precise, _imagined_ revenge for false wrongs.A related theme is _gratitude_. Much of the action of the story takes place round about Thanksgiving. And the murderer-- we know his identity from the get-go-- is an an ungrateful, psychotic, loser who believes that everybody owes him a favor. And that they should pay for it with their lives.The police know _who_ the killer is, and _why_ he murders, and _how_ he kills. But they don't know _where_ he is or who he will kill next. Smoothly told, with a villain whom I fear that police deal with all too often nowadays.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18W49SHU0WHBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=051515413X#wasThisHelpful","R18W49SHU0WHBQ","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Agatha Christie's _The Big Four_ (1927) was her fifth Hercule Poirot novel. It was written during a slump following her classic _The Murder of Roger Ackroyd_ (1926). At the suggestion of her brother-in-law, Campbell Christie, Agatha reshaped eleven of her previously published stories into a thriller about a syndicate of criminal masterminds plotting to dominate the world. Mrs. Christie reports in her autobiography that _The Big Four_ sold well and was popular with readers. I have no reason to doubt her. But while it is mildly entertaining in spots-- especially where she parodies various detective stories-- it is on the balance awfully melodramatic and silly-- one of the weakest of all of her Poirot novels. It has not worn well over the years.There are some scattered mysteries solved solved in the course of the novel. But they are not Christie at her very cleverest, and they are all loosely reworked to serve the main plot of four criminal geniuses working behind the scenes in order to destroy the existing world order. Some of the crimes strike me as somewhat trivial affairs for taking over the world, and some of the motives for some of the crimes strike me as rather ridiculous. For example, the motive for murdering a chess master late in the novel was downright silly. There are, I think, three basic problems with with this novel. First, it is too loosely constructed. The plot depends too much on coincidence and happinstance. Secondly, the characters are heavily stereotypical-- cardboard Chinese, Russian, and millionaire heavies, seductive temptresses, pompous bureaucrats, and garden variety thugs. And third, the story is told mainly from the point of view of Hastings. Hastings has his virtues, but he is not the brightest crayon in the box. He is simply not the character to have in the center of a labyrinthine spy novel of this sort.A PBS film of _The Big Four_, starring David Suchet was made. Some elements  were retained from the original plot. Other elements were totally thrown out. Still others were drastically revised. Hastings was present (as he should have been), but he played a much smaller role. I do not usually say this, but the film was much superior to the original novel.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDGS44P49XRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062073877#wasThisHelpful","RXDGS44P49XRM","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"_Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel_ (1916) by ""Victor Appleton"" is the nineteenth edisonade in the long running series authored by Howard R. Garis (of _Uncle Wiggly_ fame). Tom's new invention isn't really anything very imaginative or colorful-- just a powerful explosive for blasting a wall of super hard minerals in a mine. But it sets the stage for a rather enjoyable jungle adventure in Peru.As usual, Mr. Swift warns Tom that his invention will fail and that he had better not continue his project. And there are a series of individuals problems which are all neatly solved by Tom in the Andes mountains through a series of incredible coincidences. Not very realistic, mind you. But rather fun to read about. There is a romantic misunderstanding that is eventually straightened out. And there are some villains who get their just desserts (though there are others who do not). This is certainly nothing classic, but it is passable fun. It is one of the more readable of the old Tom Swift adventures today.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E6M8VRF2N27R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083ZXZTM#wasThisHelpful","R1E6M8VRF2N27R","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Great Marvel Adventure series (1906- 1935) was a syndicated Jules Vernelike series of stories authored by ""Roy Rockwood"" that eventually reached nine volumes. Most (but not all) of these Edisonades were written by the indefatigueable Howard R. Garis (of Uncle Wiggly fame), before he began to write the Tom SWift books. The Great Marvel Adventures were never quite as popular as Tom Swift. But they were a touch better written-- and much more imaginative and colorful.The series was filled with interesting inventions (which were always breaking down at inopportune times), and lots of action and hairbreath escapes. In forty adventures, Tom Swift never made it into outer space. But the heroes of the Great Marvel stories were soon zooming off to Mars, the Moon, and Venus. The series manages to avoid much of the ""Empire politics"" found in many Edisonades of the day that make them politically offensive by modern standards. There is a bit of racial stereotyping common for pulp writing at the turn of the century-- but then, you can't have everything._Through the Air to the North Pole; or, The Wonderful Cruise of the Electronic Monarch_ (1906) is the first volume in the Edward Stratemeyer syndicated series, and I must say that it is filled with thrill-a-minute, action-packed episodes, with lots of cliffhanging scenes at the end of chapters. Orphans Mark Darrow and Jack Samson take to the road as tramps and hop a freight train. The train goes ""runaway"" and wrecks. They are rescued from the wreckage by Professor Amos Henderso and his black servant Washington. In no time at all, they are hustled aboard a marvelous electric powered dirigible and are flying to the North Pole. Along the way, they have adventures with screaming eagles, fierce polar bears, walruses, hostile ""Equimaux,"" and other perils. You can't take any of this too seriously, but it is easy to see why many affictionadoes rate the Great Marvel Adventures as worthy predecessors to Carl Claudy's science fiction juveniles of the thirties.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2REQ2GL5XUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1453808485#wasThisHelpful","RT2REQ2GL5XUZ","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a personal favorite list of the five greatest philosophers to read from a strictly literary perspective. They are: Plato, Fredrick Neitzsche, Rene Descartes, John Stuart Mill, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.* Thus, we may fairly expect _Rousseau's Political Writings_ (1988) to contain some lively writing, regardless of what you may think of the contents. And they do. They do.The book (edited by Alan Ritter and Julia Bondanella and translated by Julia Bondanella) is a Norton Critical Edition. It consists of three main parts: A. Original Political Writngs by Rousseau, B. Backgrounds (contemporary writings by and on Rousseau), and C. Commentaries (modern critiques of Rousseau). Ordinarily, the main value of a Norton Critical Edition is the third section. But in this book, it proves to be a mild disappointment.The Original Writings are: ""The Discourse on the Origins and Foundations of Inequality Among Men"" (1755), ""Discourse on Political Economy"" (1755), and _On Social Contract_ (1762). The two essays lay the groundwork for the longer work that followed, giving a detailed picture of Rousseau's theory of man's place in the original state of nature. He does not exactly portray such a man as a ""noble savage,"" but his view of man in this state is more positive than that of many other philosophers. Some readers have assumed that Rousseau wants to recapture this state of nature. Not so. Rousseau is mildly nostalgic about it, but he says that it is a long time past. We can't go home again.In these essays, Rousseau develops a remarkable (some would say ""preposterous"") theme: that ever since the concept of property was invented, man has been headed downward on a slippery slope of enequality and corruption. Most developments in science, art, and music have added to this corruption and enslavement. Rousseau's ideal state for turning away from all this corruption is Sparta. (I am more of an Athens man myself.)There is, however, in the first essay a marvelous argument for the humane treatment of animals that Rousseau must have just tossed off. We should treat other people humanely, Rousseau argues, not because they are especially rational but because they are creatures of feeling and sensibility. If this is so, then we should treat animals in a similar manner. It could still be used by animal rights activists today._On Social Contract_ was written at the same time as Rousseau's novel _Emile_, and they were published the same year (1762). They were in many ways drastically different books. In _Emile_, Rousseau seemed to be saying, ""Sentiment is everything! Feeling is everything! Away with reason!"" Yet with _On Social Contract_, Rousseau was writing a tightly reasoned work of political philosophy. Both works managed to offend French Catholics, Genevan Protestants, and materialists all at once. His books were burned. Warrents were sworn out for his arrest in both Paris and Geneva. Rousseau had to seek sanctuary first from Frederick the Great of Prussia and later in England at the invitation of David Hume.The earlier essays were a kind of looking backward: How did we get the way we are? _On Social Contract_ is a kind of looking forward: What is the best form of government for mankind today? We should keep in mind that Rousseau's plan was for a fairly small government-- something akin to a Greek city-state or to his home city of Geneva. And while it was for a kind of democracy, it was not for a representative democracy. Rousseau believed that citizens in a representative democracy would surrender all of their rights and abdicate all of their responsibilities. (Looking at our democracy today, I'm inclined to think that Rousseau may have had a point.)_On Social Contract_ is divided into four main parts: Book One on the rights of man and an overview of government; Book Two on a discussion of Sovreignty; Book Three on the various forms of existing government; and Book Four on the General Will (which runs Rousseau's Contract form of government and which Rousseau considers almost inviolate).Readers taking a close look at Rousseau's democracy may be surprised. It is a democracy, sure enough. But it is a strangely _authoritarian_ democracy. Rousseau's famous words early in the work are: ""Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains"" (85). One would expect Rousseau to be advocating a mellow, anarchistic, do-as-you-will sort of government. No such thing. In practice, Rousseau offers a government that offers more in the way of equality than freedom. Perhaps he felt that that was the best that we could do.The Backgrounds section contains a biography of Rousseau, excerpts from his _Confessions_, and comments (positive and negative) by Voltaire, David Hume, Samuel Johnson, Casanova, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Immanuel Kant, Joseph de Maistre, John Adams, Benjamin Constant, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Leo Tolstoy. One senses that these men were some of Rousseau's sharpest observers.The modern commentaries are all well-written and thoughtful. But they are all much-of-a-much. They all tend to be democratic, generally positive toward Rousseau, and fairly narrow in their range of interpretations. We could have used an anti-democratic essay, or an anti-Rousseau essay, or an off-trail interpretive essay. We needed more _variety_ among the modern interpreters. Jean Starborinski has a good general study of Rousseau's politics, and Robert Wolff has an excellent critique of part four. Simone Weil's article is interesting, but her plea that we all need to get rid of political parties seems a bit impractical to me.On the balance, though, this remains an excellent introduction to the political writings of one of the major political thinkers of all time.* The absolute _worst_ philosopher from a literary perspective is G.W.F. Hegel. Hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KRWE9ETFOYXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393956512#wasThisHelpful","R2KRWE9ETFOYXS","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. On July 2, 1778, barely two years into the American Revolution, Jean-Jacques Rousseau died of a stroke while walking in the woods at Ermenonville, France. _Reveries of the Solitary Walker_ (1776- 1778) was Rousseau's last book, a work that was clearly not quite finished at the time of his death. It is a series of ten essays, loosely constructed around the theme of walking around Paris and other parts of the countryside. The essays are titled ""First Walk,"" ""Second Walk,"" ""Third Walk,"" and so on.The reader might expect a somewhat Romantic view of Nature by this Romantic philosopher. And finally, in the middle of the book, in the Fifth Walk, there it is: a description of the Island of St. Pierre:The shores of the Lake of Bienn are wilder and more romantic than those of Lake Geneva, since the rocks and woods come closer to the water, but they are no less pleasing. There may be fewer ploughed fields and vineyards, fewer towns and houses, but there is more natural greenery and there are more meadows and secluded spots shaded by woodlands, more frequent and dramatic changes of scenery. (81)Rousseau and Therese Le Vasseur spent only two months on the island, ""but I could have spent two years, two centuries and all eternity there without a moment's boredom"" (82-83). There ""the soul can find a resting-place secure enough to establish itself and concentrate its entire being there"" (88). Rousseau underwent a genuine emotional bonding with Nature.In short, the island is a symbol of the thing in Nature that Rousseau would most like to grasp: a peaceful refuge. Unfortunately, by this time in his life, that aspect of Nature is usually beyond Rousseau's reach. For Rousseau is a troubled man:Happiness is a lasting state which does not seem to be made for man in this world. Everything here on earth is in a continual flux which allows nothing to assume any constant form. All things change round about us, we ourselves change, and no one can be sure of loving tomorrow what he loves today. All our plans of happiness in this life are therefore empty dreams. (137)The _Reveries_ contain a greater percentage of complaints than they do Naturalistic idlyls. Why is Rousseau so unhappy in his sixties? The reasons are complicated. For one thing, he has had enemies and has suffered persecution for his ideas from political and religious enemies over the years. That abuse takes its toll after a while. Rousseau also acknowledges that his own actions may have made him a lightning rod for trouble on many occasions:I lurched from fault to fault, error to error, and folly to folly, my imprudent behavior provided those who control my fate with weapons which they have most skilfully used to settle my destiny irrevocably. (28)There was a third source of Rousseau's unhappiness, however-- a psychological one. For Rousseau suffered from delusions of persecution throughout a large portion of his adult life. After David Hume had invited Rousseau to England to escape the wrath of French and Swiss authorities in the wake of the publication of his books _Emile_ and _On Social Contract_ (both 1762), Rousseau's increasing paranoia caused him to imagine that Hume (that most mild-mannered of all philosophers) was ""plotting against him"". He broke with Hume, and left England for continental Europe. For some time afterward, Rousseau feared that Hume would hunt him down.By 1776, while Rousseau had periods of rationality and lucidity, his mental illness was also very pronounced. His erratic behavior was noticed by many observers. He had withdrawn from contact with large groups of people. Throughout the _Reveries_, Rousseau consistently complains of people plotting against him. The reader must use a bit of judgement in evaluating such passages. When Rousseau recollects a mob stoning his house in Switzerland, he is talking about a real-life event when people _were_ plotting against him. When Rousseau says that doctors and members of the religious order of Oratorians are among his persecutors, I think that we can take this to be a notion purely in the imagination of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In a similar vein, when Rousseau writes about spies following him about in the streets of Paris, we can probably take this with a grain of salt. By 1776, there were no active political enemies of Rousseau taking an interest in him.It seems pertinent to ask the question: Suppose Rousseau had lived a bit longer and written a few more essays. Would he have been more at peace? There are signs that he might have been. He had rediscovered the joys of studying botany (and he takes great pains to tell us why other scientific studies will not do for him). And while he professed to hold authors and literature in disdain, he admitted his great love of Plutarch. Who knows what other writers he might have embraced in future essays? And in the last essay, he recollected his great love for Madame de Warens. Yes, there were signs that Nature was providing him some comfort.The _Reveries_ is not really a great book. It doesn't have the stature of _Emile_, _On Social Contract_, or _The Confessions_ (completed 1770). But it is an oddly engaging little book that captures the portrait of a brilliant, greatly flawed, and-- in the end-- strangely sympathetic man. Like the character in the Bob Dylan song, he had been through some stormy times and now wanted ""to go where it's quiet"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13V6RO17YJF0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140443630#wasThisHelpful","R13V6RO17YJF0Z","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"H.P. Lovecraft's _The Classic Horror Stories_ (2013), ed. Roger Luckhurst is an Oxford edition of nine Lovecraftian horror tales and the introduction to his famous essay, _Supernanural Horror in Literature_. It is handsomely packaged, with a good selection of tales, and excellent introductory material and notes. It's the sort of book that you might give as a present to a bright young person unfamiliar with the Old Master of Providence, RI. The sort of person who might relish learning new vocabulary words like ""eldrich"" and ""batrachian"". But Lovecraft affictionados will probably already have several collections that are more specialized.The most controversial aspect of this collection was the editorial decision to use the magazine or pulp versions of the stories, because they retain a kind of ""pulp energy"". (Translation: We didn't have access to the original manuscripts, so we did the next best thing.) The problem, of course, is that the magazine versions were frequently cut in ways that Lovecraft did not like. Purists who are looking for more carefully edited ""authorial"" texts should check out the collections edited by S.T. Joshi for Penguin.The stories are: ""The Horror at Red Hook"" (_Weird Tales_, 1927), ""The Call of Cthulhu"" (_Weird Tales_, 1928), ""The Colour Out of Space"" (_Amazing_, 1927), ""The Dunwich Horror"" (_Weird Tales_, 1929), ""The Whisperer in the Darkness"" (_Weird Tales_, 1931), ""At the Mountains of Madness"" (_Astounding_, 1936), ""The Dreams of the Witch House"" (_Weird Tales_, 1933), ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" (_Visionary Press_, 1936), and ""The Shadow out of Time"" (_Astounding_, 1936). ""At the Mountains of Madness"" (which was a three-part serial), ""Shadow Over Innsmouth"" (which was a pamphlet), and ""The Shadow out of Time"" all received covers. The cover for ""The Shadow out of Time"" was an excellent but somewhat whimsical one that failed to capture the horror conveyed by Lovecraft's story.Most of the stories in the collection are part of the ""Cthulhu (pronounced ""thulla"") Cycle. But we should be a bit careful here. Lovecraft took a more loose and casual attitude toward stories in this cycle than many authors who worked after him (like August Derleth), who made it a systematic mythology. Some Cthulhu tales seem to be fantasies, while others seem to be science fictional.One of the tales (""The Horror at Red Hook"") is early and decidedly minor Lovecraft. The other eight are much better fare, including four of Lovecraft's very best tales. ""The Colour Out of Space"" is the one about the meteorite with the Unhealthy Blight that spreads all about the New England farm. It has been made into several fairly wretched films over the years. ""At the Mountains of Madness"" is about the Antarctic expedition that encounters Horrors near the South Pole. ""The Shadow Out of Time"" involves a member of another expedition-- this one in Australia-- who stumbles into an alien library. I have found that when Lovecraft took the trouble to write stories that were more science fictional, his plots and description tended to be a touch more ingenious. ""The Whisperer in the Darkness"" is more of a _Weird Tale_ ish fantasy in which the hero makes a narrow escape from a horror in a lonely farmhouse.Lovecraft was an excellent critic of supernatural fiction, but readers may want to get the full-length essay published by Dover after reading the excerpt published in this collection. So. An excellent introduction to Lovecraft. But nothing that Lovecraft fans won't already have in a more definative text.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2CR7BNH0996/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199639574#wasThisHelpful","R3O2CR7BNH0996","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Howard Phillips Lovecraft's _Supernatural Horror in Literature_ (1945) when I was in high school. But in truth, I was only familiar with a few of the authors that Lovecraft discussed. There was Poe, of course, to whom Lovecraft devotes an entire chapter. And I had read a few stories by Clark Ashton Smith, Lord Dunsany, William Hope Hodgson, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. But the majority of the names, novels, and stories were unfamiliar to me.On rereading the Dover reprint of Lovecraft's essay, now that I have read most of the stories and novels that he discusses, I am impressed with how sharp Lovecraft's critical judgement remains over time. He perhaps underestimates Henry James a bit, but his evaluation of James as a writer of ghost stories is sound. And he was probably one of the first critics to call attention to Charlotte Perkins Gilmans' ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" ( though, of course, he does not give it a feminist interpretation). Lovecraft interprets Guy de Maupassant's ""The Horla"" as a tale about a supernatural monster that could be ""the vanguard of a horde of extra-terrestrial organisms"" (49) ready to invade Earth. The story _could_ be read this way. Or it could be read as the story of a madman's delusions.There are three chapters on the development of the Gothic novel. Lovecraft's discussions of Horace Walpole, Ann Radcliff, Matthew Lewis, Charles Maturin, William Godwin, Mary Shelley, and William Ainsworth are all still dead on target and relevant today. He disapproves of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""tendency toward jaunty mannerisms"" (43), but he approves of ""The Body Snatcher"" and _Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde_.The chapter on Poe is very fine-- an excellent reminder (in spite of modern critical snobbery) why we should still value Poe and why supernatural literature owes a great debt to him. There is also  a discussion of the _Undine_ (1814) myth from continental Europe (in this case, Germany). I had once read the opening portions of a French play about this myth in high school. It was about the love between a water nymph and a young knight. We were told that the story ended tragically. But we were not told any details. It was not until I reread Lovecraft that I learned the full story.The final chapter, on Modern Masters, is also useful as long as you keep in mind that they are what we would now call Old Masters: Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, and M.R. James.Some readers have claimed to find evidences of Lovecraft's racism and anti-semitism in the text of this essay. Lovecraft was not without his prejudices, but I sometimes wonder if we don't read too much into the text. I can find little in this essay that smacks of offensive racial or ethnic bias or stereotyping. I _had_ expected to find Lovecraft's argument that materialists make better writers of the supernatural than True Believers. But that wasnt there, either._Supernatural Horror in Literature_ was first published in the 1927 issue of _The Recluse_, a fan magazine edited by Lovecraft's friend, W. Paul Cook. It went through several revisions in the 1930s, and was serialized in _The Fantasy Fan_ in the early 30s-- but the magazine folded before the serial was complete. The first full-length publication of the revised essay was in _The Outsider and Others_ in 1939-- two years after Lovecraft's death. The first separate book edition was in 1945. The Dover edition follows the 1945 version.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKREYKKR12TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486201058#wasThisHelpful","RAKREYKKR12TB","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The Walton is a book about fishing. The Burton is a layman's book about medicine. Much of the advice that Walton gives about fishing is still useful today. The Burton, based heavily on the old Galen model of medicine, is almost totally useless as a medical guidebook today. No reputable doctor today would diagnose patients according to the amount of humours in their bodies, or would bleed them to relieve them of black bile in their blood, or would seriously assume that illnesses were caused by forces from stars or from witches or goblins, or would drill holes in patients' heads to relieve the pain of melancholy.I once visited a neurologist's office for a follow-up exam for something-or-other ( I have forgotten now exactly what it was for). I had a copy of Burton's _Melancholy_ in my hand. The doctor raised his eyebrows when he saw the book. I said: ""A noble work of literature... but I sincerely hope that you weren't trained on this in medical school."" He never cracked a smile. He said: ""We weren't.""Why, then, should you read a massive book that has prooved to be so spectacularly, medically _wrong_? Why, simply (as Roland Barthes would say), for ""the pleasure of the text"". First, there is Burton's near-inimitable baroque style of writing, with his labarinthine sentences, his torturous but oddly rhythmic lists and catalogues, his citations, and his Latin quotations. Next, there is Burton's originality of thought. (He might be frequently _wrong_, but he is never _dull_.) Third, it is a book that sooner or later touches on _everything_: witches and magicians, goblins, education, parts of the body, anger, greed, miseries of scholars, stars, the uses of exercise, the uses of music, lycanthropy, war, old age, fear, love, religion... Burton covers a huge range of topics. His knowledge is truly encyclopedic. And finally, there is Burton's sense of the comic. His _topic_ might be melancholy. But his _treatment_ is frequently witty and funny.Burton's _Anatomy_ provides a multitude of quotations for all kinds of topics. here he is on the upbringing of children. Children can be ruined by physical and verbal abuse. But:Too much indulgence causeth the like, _inepta patris lenitas et facilitas prava_ [the father's gentleness can be misplaced and his indulgence corrupting], whenas, Micio-like, with too much liberty and too great allowance, they feed their children's humours, let them revel, wench, riot, swagger, and do what they will themselves, and then punish them with the noise of musicians. (334)And Burton does seem to be ahead of his time in his denunciation of tobacco:Tobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which goes far beyond all the panaceas, potable gold, and philosophers' stones, a sovereign remedy for all diseases. A good vomit, I confess, a virtuous herb, if it be well qualified, opportunely taken, and medicinally used; but as it is commonly abused by most men, which take it as tinkers do ale, 'tis a plague, a mischief, a violent purger of goods, lands, healtth; hellish, devilish, and damned tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul. (229)One wonders what Burton would have written about various states today legalizing marijuana! Like his countrymen, Sir Thomas more and sir Francis Bacon, Burton toyed with the idea of a utopia, though perhaps not in quite so much detail:I will have convenient churches, and separate places to bury the dead in, not in churchyards; a _citella_ (in some, not all) to command it, prisons for offenders, opportune market-places of all sorts, for corn, meat cattle, fuel, fish; commodious courts of justice, public halls for all societies, bourses meeting-places, armouries, in which shall be kept engines for quenching fire, artillery gardens, public walks, theaters, and spacious fields alloted for gymnics, sports, and honest recreations, hospitals of all kinds, for children, orphans, old folks, sick men, madmen, soldiers, pest-houses, etc., not built _precario_ [as a favor], or by gouty benefactors...

"""We'l rejoice with my brother _Peter_ and his friend, tell tales, or sing Ballads, or make a Catch, or find some harmless sport to content us, and pass away a little time without offence to God or man.""-- Izaak Walton, _The Compleat Angler_Izaak Walton (1593-1683), ironmonger, biographer, and fisherman may be said to have been a man who valued the contemplative over the active life. In today's world of hustle and bustle and time clocks, there is something to be said for a man like Walton, who knows how to take it slow and easy. His masterpiece, _The Compleat Angler_ (begun 1653), is in part a practical guide to fishing. For many years, it could be found in fishermen's creels. But it is also in part a praise of the pastoral life, which contributes to its charm:Look! under that broad _Beech-tree_, I sate down, when I was last this way a fishing, and the birds in the adjoyning Grove seemed to have a friendly contention with an Eccho, whose dead voice seemed to live in a hollow tree, near to the brow of that Primrose-hill; there I sate viewing the silver streams glide silently towards their center, the tempestuous Sea; yet, sometimes opposed by rugged roots, and pebble stones, which broke their waves, and turned them into foam: and sometimes I beguil'd time by viewing the harmless Lambs, some leaping securely in the cool shade, whilst others sported themselves in the chearful Sun; and saw others craving comfort from the swoln Udders of their bleating Dams. (79)Shortly after this scene, we hear a young milkmaid sing Christopher Marlow's ""The Passionate Shepherd to His Love,"" which begins: ""Come live with me and be my love/ And we will all the pleasures prove..."" Her Mother sings Sir Walter Raleigh's ""The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd,"" which begins: ""If all the world and Love were young/ And truth in every Shepherds tongue..."" Yes, _The Compleat Angler_ is steeped in a vision of the pastoral. And this in turn is related to Walton's philosophy of the contemplative and fishing:And first, I shall tell you what some have observed (and I have found it to be a real truth) that the very sitting by a Rivers side is not only the quietest and fittest place for _contemplation_, but will invite an angler to it: and this seems to maintained by the learned _Pet. du Moulin_, who (in his discussion of the fulfilling of Prophesies) observes, that when God intended to reveal any future events or high notions to his Prophets, he then carried them either to the _Deserts_, or to the _Sea-shore_, that having so separated them from amidst the press of _people_ and _business_, and the cares of the world, he might settle their mind in a quiet repose, and there make them fit for Revelation. (40)For this reason, Walton says, ministers are forbidden to hunt but allowed to fish. Angling, it is recognized, can be a source of divine inspiration.Some modern readers may be enchanted by some of Walton's geography, especially when he relies heavily on Aristotle, Pliny, and Lucian:As namely of a River in _Epirus_, that puts out any lighted Torch, and kindles any Torch that was not lighted. Some Waters being drunk cause madness, some drunkenness, and some laughter to death. The River _Selarius_ in a few hours turns a rod or wand to stone: and our _Cambden_ mentions the like in _England_, and the like in _Lochmere_ in _Ireland_. There is also a river in _Arabia_, of which all the sheep that drink thereof have their wool turned into a Vermillion colour. And one of no less credit than _Aristotle_, tells us of a merry river, (the River _Elusina_) that it dances at the noise of musick... (41)When he relies on more modern sources, his accounts may have seemed equally fantastic to contemporary readers. But they were actually fairly scientifically accurate for their day. Here he draws from Montaigne's _Essays_:The _Cuttle-fish_ will cast a long gut out of her throat, which (like as an Angler doth his line) she sendeth forth and pulleth in again at her pleasure, according as she sees some little fish come near to her; and the _Cuttle-fish_ (being then hid in the gravel) lets the smaller fish nibble so near to her, that she may leap upon her, and then catches and devours her: and for this reason some have called this fish the _Sea-Angler_.The only correction I would make is that it is the Sea-Angler, not the Cuttle-fish, that angles for other fish. Even when Walton is engaged in straightforward description of angling, you can find a kind of baroque elegance to his prose:First, let your Rod be light, and very gentle, I take the best to be of two pieces, and let not your Line exceed (especially for three or four link next to the hook) I say, not exceed three or four hairs at the most, though you may fish a little stronger above in the upper part of your line: but if you can attain to angle with one hair, you shall have more rises, and catch more Fish. (105)Perhaps it would do well to back up a bit and give a bit of background about the book itself. The first edition (by Walton) was published in 1653. It went through three more editions by Walton in 1655, 1661, and 1668 respectively. In 1676, Walton approached his friend and fellow angler, Charles Cotton to write some material on trout and grayling fishing. The fifth edition of 1676 features Charles Cotton's ""Part Two"". Most modern versions of _The Compleat Angler_ are the Walton-Cotton fifth edition, the most complete version.The general format of the book is that of a dialogue. In Part I, it is between Piscator (the fisherman), his brother Peter, Venator (a hunter), Auceps (a Faulkner), and various shepherds, milkmaids, and hostesses (conveniently skilled in cleaning and dressing fish). They talk about the beauties of nature, the wonders of the elements, the virtues of their favorite sport, or the teachings of the Bible. And they frequently break out into rounds of song. Here is a verse of a song sung by Piscator:""_Of Recreation there is noneSo free as Fishing is alone;All other pastimes do no lesseThan mind and body both possesse:My hand alone my work can doe,So I can fish and study too._"" (90)Pages 190 and 191 contain an angler's song set to music.Part II (the section by Cotton) is also in the form of a dialogue. This time, it is between Piscator, Junior (adopted son of Piscator) and Viator (the one-time hunter of the first dialogues). There are no songs or bursts of poetry, or stylized pastoral scenes with Lambs and Maidens and Shepherds. But there are some lovely descriptions of the English countryside and English rivers: ""Why this Sir is called _Bently_ Brook, and is full of very good Trout and Grayling; but so encumbered with wood in many places, as is troublesome for an Angler"" (250). Later, ""the river _Wye_"" consists of ""a black water at the fountain"" but ""becomes a most delicate clear River, and breeds admirable Trout and Grayling"" (252-253). But Piscator Junior's great love is the River _Dove_, ""which divides the two Couties of _Derby_ and _Stafford_ for many Miles together"" (250) and is known for ""the swiftness of its current"" (250).But the primary value of the section by Cotton is its practical value to serious fishermen: It's a wealth of information about how to tie flies, what flies to use during what months of the year, and angling strategies for outwitting the craftiest of trout and grayling._The Compleat Angler_ belongs to a very old form of writing called Menippean satire that includes works as varied as Francois Rabelais' _Gargantua and Pantagruel_, Robert Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_, Jonathon Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_, and Lewis Carroll's Alice books. Northrup Frye (1957) states that Menippean satire is characterized by its ""ability to handle abstract ideas and theories"" (309), its use of stylized characters who are ""mouthpieces of the ideas they represent"" (309), and a loose structure that loans itself to digressions and discussions.It has been said that next to the King James Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, _The Complete Angler_ is the most frequently reprinted seventeenth century English book. Well, perhaps. But how much is it actually _read_ today? That is much harder to ascertain. Do yourself a favor. Read this charming classic of Menippean satire. Let yourself be carried away to a world of ease and contemplation. You don't have to be a fisherman to enjoy the book. But it helps._Addendum_: I daresy that there are several excellent editions of this classic in print. But my favorite remains the Oxford World's Classics edition (1982), with the original introduction from 1935 by John Buchan and more up-to-date notes by editor John Buxton. From them, you may learn that Vergil wasn't really buried in Rome; that Charles Cotton had a cave on his property in which he hid from creditors; that according to Albertus Magnus (1193?- 1280), a certain type of frog did not eat at all in August; and many other vital pieces of information.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAHU4ES0RQAMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199538085#wasThisHelpful","RAHU4ES0RQAMT","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roger Zelazny's _Jack of Shadows_ (1971) was originally a two-part serial in _Fantasy and Science Fiction_ that year. It was nominated for the Hugo in 1972, but lost to Philip Jose Farmer's _To Your Scattered Bodies Go_. _Jack_ remains  an interesting, quirky, and (ultimately) somewhat grim fantasy. It's not quite as entertaining as some of Zelazny's later novels like _Doorways in the Sand_ (1976) or _Roadmarks_ (1979). But I believe that it is a bit more substantial. I would place it alongside _The Dream Master_ (1966), _This Immortal_ (1966), and _Lord of Light_ (1967)-- Zelazny's best.The novel is set on a future Earth that no longer rotates and is watched over by the demonic Morningstar, who says that he is waiting for the sun to rise. The ""brightside"" of Earth is governed by the rules and laws of science, while the darkside is governed by the rules and laws of magic. Shadowjack the thief from the Dark Side is captured, beheaded, and resurrected. In short order, he breaks the Compact under which all Dark Side magicians abide, and now finds many hands against him.After engineering a near-impossible escape from his archenemy, the Lord of the Bats, Jack escapes to the Bright Side of Earth. Shadows are not so plentiful there, but the forces of magic are not so powerful, and he is able to lose them for a while. There he uses computers to aid him in his next steps toward widespread revenge.Jack is brave, and Jack is clever, and Jack is determined. But Jack has no soul. He will readily use people and toss them aside, and he thinks nothing of bringing the whole world to ruins simply to satisfy his own notions of revenge.I am reminded of an old folktale about Davy Crockett. It seems that during one bitter cold winter, the gears of machinery at the North Pole that made the world turn around iced solid and froze. Davy trudged up to the North Pole, gave the gears a solid kick, and started the Earth a-turnin' again. Jack is something like that. But he causes a _lot_ more chaos along the way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1THJLBPWYGUCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451135768#wasThisHelpful","R1THJLBPWYGUCU","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I once talked a bit with the essayist Sam Pickering about how he came to be such an expert on flowers and plants. He said that when he vacationed on the family farm in Nova Scotia, there was often nothing to do except walk around and look at the plants. He has become a collector of nature books-- ""the field guides, not the Annie Dillard kind"". Some of them are new. Some of them, I know from his essays, are very old.I haven't got the slightest idea whether Sam Pickering has read _Wicked Plants: The Weed That Killed Lincoln's Mother & Other Botanocal Atrocities_ (2009) by Amy Stewart. But I do believe that it is the sort of book that he would enjoy. It is not overly mystical or transcendental, it is loaded with colorful facts, and it has realistic etchings of the plants which are labeled deadly, illegal, painful, intoxicating, destructive, or merely offensive. The etchings, by Briony Morrow-Cribbs, are in the style of old-fashioned nineteenth century nature books.The plants themselves are arranged alphabetically, from _Acondite_ (deadly) and Ayahuasca Vine_ (illegal) to _White Snakeroot_ and _Yew_ (both deadly). It is the White Snakeroot that is belived to have poisoned Nancy Hanks Lincoln via infected cow's milk. An Illinois doctor named Anna Bixby determined the cause of ""milk sickness"" as early as 1834, but few authorities listened to her (after all, only a _woman_ doctor). It was not until the 1920s that the plant was widely recognized as dangerous.The yew tree, with its roots ""wrapt about the bones"" of skeletons in European churhyards, has a wood that during the time of ancient Rome made drinking vessels intended for suicide-- or murder. Today, some chemicals from the yew are used in the treatment of cancer.A few states today (like Colorado) have made Marijuana legal since this book was written. I am not sure that all will be well as the result of this Great Social Experiment. The human capacity for folly is ever present in ventures of this kind. In any event, there is a section on Cannabis Sativia and its history, concluding ""98 percent of the United States' eradication efforts are directed at weeds"" (111).Anybody who has lived in the South any length of time knows about Kudzu, originally from Japan, which _seemed_ like a great idea for gardeners and farmers back in 1937. Nobody predicted how much the vine would run rampant. Stewart says that it now ""covers seven million acres in the United States"" (88). The city of Chattanooga once invested a small amount of money in some goats to crop hills of kudzu in the city limits. But now the politicians (always penny-wise and pound foolish) cut off the funding. The goats (popular with the public and with tourists) are gone. The kudzu is still there.Other plants of interest include arrow poisons, betel nut, castor bean (the source of a famous murder), mandrake, opium poppy, tobacco, and the suicide tree. There are sections on fatal fungus (such as death cap and false morel), the devil's bartender (plant sources for intoxicants), carnivorous plants, and the lawn of death (on destructive grasses). I had long known that Johnson grass was a formidable weed. To get rid of it, do not chop it. You must uproot it and lay it on a rock to bake in the sun. But I had not known before that it was poisonous.There are many more plants of interest. I promise that you will read this delightful book much more quickly than you expected. There is an excellent bibliography of plant-related books, all fairly up-to-date. And there is information on six famous Poison Gardens, for those that like such things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RORQ36WLJNU0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565126831#wasThisHelpful","RORQ36WLJNU0O","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Keith Laumer's _Retief: Ambassador to Space_ (1969) is the fifth Retief book and the third Retief collection. If you want to keep a rough chronology in mind (these things can probably never be _too_ exact with the retief tales), it was preceeded by the novels _Retief's War_ (1966) and _Retief and the Warlords_ (1968) and was followed by the collection,_Retief of the CDT_ (1971)._Ambassador to Space_ consists of seven adventures of Jaime Retief from _If_ between 1964 and 1967. Over the years, various artists had a go at illustrating Retief stories: Dick Francis, Virgil Finlay, Nodel... But the champion Retief illustrator was Jack Gaughan, whose pen-and-ink style was perfectly suited to the light, dashing stories. Only one of the stories in this collection was a cover story-- ""Trick or Treaty,"" in the August, 1965 issue. But it was a spectacular, Halloweenish affair by Gaughan showing Retief and some centaurlike aliens dodging about some colorful off-world architecture.The stories are: ""Giant Killer,"" ""The Forbibben City,"" ""Grime and Punishment,"" ""Dam Nuisance,"" ""Trick or Treaty,"" ""Forest in the Sky,"" and ""Truce or Consequences"". The first story recounts how Ambassador Pinchbottle refused to listen to Retief and consequently contracted to fight a dinosaur by the next sundown. Need we say that the Ambassador was not quite up to the task? We need not. In the second tale, the Groaci and the Blugs are planning a planetary takeover during a peace conference. (Is nothing sacred?) Retief enlists the aid of some scrappy denizens from an underground city to spike the plot. In the third story, the decisive Mr. Raisinger orders some rats poisoned-- which breaks an ecological cycle and leads to an onslaught of mud. Lots of mud.The fourth tale involves some double crosses by the Groaci involving the uncalled-for present of a giant dam. In the fifth tale, it is some centaurs who are the bully-boys. They are delightfully put down by Retief and a family of carnies before they can start their invasion of the planet they had targeted for plunder. The penultimate tale is about a very strange gaseous planet with a most unusual ecosystem and an ambasadorial expedition that goes onward, upward... and out of control. The last story involves two sides in a Civil War enthusiastically fighting one another... until Retief reveals who their revered ancestors really were... and that unbeknownst to each other, the factions switched sides!Fans of the Bad Boy Diplomat of the _Corps Diplomatiques Terrestrienne_ will not need me to recommend these stories, but I do so anyway. They are first class entertainment; and as I have stated elsewhere, the novelette is the ideal length for a Retief tale. They are a perfect balance of action and wit.Perhaps it might be useful to close with a note about the spelling of Retief's first name. Early stories and books used the spelling ""Jame"". The Berkeley paperback that I used for this review uses this spelling as well. For a long time, that was the spelling that I used in my reviews. But later reprints, for reasons best known to God, jazzed up the spelling to ""Jaime"". This seems to be the more common spelling now, and so I have (somewhat reluctantly) modernized my spelling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y06GNXCG8CMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425018296#wasThisHelpful","R1Y06GNXCG8CMV","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fritz Leiber's _The Green Millenium_ (1953) was a satire on many of the darker sides of life in the early fifties. Leiber then fell silent for four years (largely, he has said, the result of his battle with alcoholism). But in the late fifties, he came back in force. One of his comeback works was the two-part _Galaxy_ serial, _The Big Time_, in 1958. The serial won the Hugo for best novel that year-- the fourth novel to do so.As numerous critics have pointed out, and as Leiber himself has confirmed in an introduction to the Collier Books edition to the novel, _The Big Time_ is in effect a kind of prose play, observing the unities of space and time. Thus, Leiber has characters from millions of years up and down the space-time continuum meeting in a single setting: the Place, a rest & recuperation center ordinarily removed from the fluctuations of time.The action of the plot covers only a few hours of time-- but a period of increasing suspense as elements of the Change War are brought into the Place, thus complicating the lives of all who live therein.The novel opens with a bang when three soldiers enter the Place from three different times-- a Nazi soldier from World War II, an English soldier (and poet) from World War I, and a Roman legionaire. In no time at all, insults are exchanged, there is a swordfight, and blood is shed. The verbal dueling does not stop.A second round of _very_ unusual soldiers comes a bit later with a tale of grim defeat before the Snake forces at Crete. Their not-so-bright commander rigidly follows orders and brings with them a tactical nuclear bomb. In the midst of the hysterics and dramatics that follow, the Major Maintainer-- the device that keeps the environment of the Place running-- vanishes. (The bomb is still very much there.) Where is it? Who took it? And Why?Leiber stated that he wanted his characters to be markedly individualistic, with recognizeable voices of their own. Here is Greta Forzane, party girl, formerly of Chicago, who narrates the novel:""The place outside the cosmos where I and my pals do our nursing job I simply call the Place. A lot of my nursing consists of amusing and humanising Soldiers fresh back from raids into time. In fact, my normal title is Entertainer, and I've got my silly side, as you'll find out."" (7)The Place is run by Sidney Lessingham, originially an actor in Elizabethan London:""Look you, masters this is a Recuperation Station and I am running it as such. A plague on all operations! I care not if the frame of things disjoints and the whole Change War goes to ruin, but you, warrior maid, are going to rest and drink more wine, slowly, before you tell your tale and your colleagues are going to be properly companioned... Beau, and you love us, give us a lively tune."" (42)Bruce Marchant, the English poet, is in love with words (especially his own) and old things slipping away. Here he is, inciting a revolt against the Spiders:""Perhaps there are some sentimentalists who would rather die than live in a world without the _Summa_, the Field Equations, _Process and Reality_, _Hamlet_, Matthew, Keats, and the _Odyssey_, but our masters are practical creatures, ministering to the needs of those rugged souls who want to go on living no matter what.""

"Ah, yes. The bicentenntial was a pretty good year for science fiction novels. Roger Zelazny made a strong return with this three-part serial in _Analog_, along with some handsome John Schoenherr illustrations. And _Doorways in the Sand_ (1976) was nominated for the Hugo and the Nebula. But Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ was the impossible-to-beat juggernaut that year.Still, _Doorways_ is really a pretty good science fiction entertainment. I have read it at least half a dozen times over the the years without tiring of it, and I will read it again in the future. I grew up in the University of the South at Sewanee, famed for its Neo-gothic and Georgian architecture. A lot of the buildings that I grew up among are surely a lot like the university buildings of Zelazny's fictitious university that his hero, Fred Cassidy, loves to climb. Ah, well. Surely these fictitious buildings are taller. Steeper. More crooked. More numerous. And the buildings at Sewanee didn't house mysterious machines attended by not-too-efficient guards. But the basic architecture would be the same, with the spires and towers and turrets and battlements. And we did have our share of eccentric professors and unhelpful faculty advisors.Fred Cassidy is a perpetual undergraduate. Because of a peculiarity in his uncle's will, he will recieve money for his education _until he recieves a diploma_. He has managed to postpone that evil day for  thirteen years, outsmarting a series of faculty advisors determined to see him graduate. The one thing that gets Fred in trouble is his acrophilia-- his love of open places-- which takes the form of climbing university buildings.Fred's world might have remained fairly ordered and peaceful. But suddenly, everybody decides that Fred has acquired an alien artifact called the starstone, and everbody seems to be after it or after him-- a disreputable geology professor, a couple of gangsters, a government agent, several alien cops, some alien baddies, an AI ""recorder"" that pipes information to Fred, and a mysterious player in the background. Noboby seems to believe Fred when he says that he doesn't have the stone and doesn't know where it is. In order to survive one or more of these factions, Fred finds himself becoming involved in one madcap caper after another... and getting in another mess more complicated than the last one he was in.Readers may notice a certain ""jerkiness"" or ""jumpiness"" to the chapters. One chapter will end in what seems to be something of a cliffhanging scene. The next chapter will open with quite a different dramatic scene. Chapters often seem to begin _in medias res_-- in the middle of the chapter-- and sometimes there is nothing to do except to hang on and figure out by flashback how the hero got out of a cliffhanging situation. But eventually, it all does hang together.I believe that it was Ben Bova who first noted that _Doorways_ is the sort of novel that Raymond Chandler might have written had he lived to write science fiction. _Doorways_ is a touch more tightly written than your typical Chandler novel. But it has a Chandleresque hero and a Chandleresque plot. And there is a bit of poetry. But the poetry is all Zelazny, not imitation Chandler. That is all to the good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34S4B0UIMAGUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NX5IVU#wasThisHelpful","R34S4B0UIMAGUJ","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will admit it. Norman Spinrad's _The Iron Dream_ (1972) is a wicked and devastating satire that has affected how I read a lot of science fiction today. It is based on a very clever joke. Imagine an alternate world in which Adolph Hitler dropped out of politics when young, emigrated to the United States, and became a science fiction author. Here we have his 1954 Hugo-winning masterpiece, _Lord of the Swastika_, complete with rather pompous scholarly commentary.The hero is Feric Jagger, the blond-haired, blue-eyed ""genotypically pure human"" (13) who is concerned with keeping his home country of Helder free from ""mongrelized mutations"" like ""Blueskins, Lizardmen, Harlequins"" (14), ""Toadmen"" (14), ""Eggheads"" (15), ""Parrotfaces"" (15) and worse-- most of them slimy.In short order, Jagger has headed up a mob and killed a despised Dominator (something like a Jewish plotter). Then he takes charge of a gang of petrol-driven motorcycle thugs whom he renames Knights of the Swastika. From there on, we have a series of increasingly bloody victories as Feric leads his leather-garbed SS followers under the sign of the Swastika and using phallic weapons against the mutants. The last sentence of the novel is a masterpiece of triumphant awfulness.Spinrad's devastating point: There is not really a lot of difference between the tasteless, violent, and immoral novel written by ""Adolf Hitler"" and many ""space operas"" being written by modern writers today. Maybe there should be a time when in evaluating science fiction-- even space opera-- when our moral compass and sense of good taste should kick in. Several space operas that have struck me as offensively bad-- of the sort that Spinrad is satirizing in his novel-- are E.E. Smith's _Skylark DuQuesne_ (1966), L. Ron Hubbard's _Battlefield Earth_ (1982), and Colin Kapp's _Patterns of Chaos_ (1972).The novel does have a weakness. While it is an _effective_ joke, it is also a rather _tiresome_ one. It does go on and on to make its point. Yet at the same time, I don't see very well what else Spinrad could have done. Once he set up his satire, he pretty much had to ride it out to the end. _The Iron Dream_ should serve as a reminder that even space opera, even military science fiction, should have a moral content. Too many readers nowadays forget that basic truth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJV5F6IYIUBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1490439455#wasThisHelpful","R3EJV5F6IYIUBH","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original notes for _The Demolished Man_ in Alfred Bester's Commonplace Book had something to do with police who could read the future with television screens. Horace L. Gold, the cantankerous but brilliant editor of _Galaxy_ magazine, suggested a telapathic police force in a telapathic society. Bester took the idea and ran with it.The result was a dazzling, three-part serial that ran in _Galaxy_ early in 1952 and was snapped up in book form the next year. It was the first novel to win the Hugo, and it is hard to imagine a better choice. The novel remains a real classic in the field, one of the all-time classics of science fiction.Bester plunges us into a world unlike any other that we have experienced before. A world where some characters have names like Samuel @kins, Duffy Wyg&, and Jo 1/4 maine. A world where time is told for all planets of the solar system on a watch at the same time. A world where a sizeable minority of the population is telepathic and can weave fantastic mental webs of conversation with one another, one-on-one or at parties. A world where most of the police are telepathic but are governed in their rules of evidence by a computer named Ol' Man Mose.In this world, we watch Ben Reich, a non-telepathic millionaire who swears: ""I wouldn't change looks with the devil. I wouldn't change places with God"" (12). Nevertheless, Reich is haunted by nightmares of a Man With No Face. Reich is convinced that the No Face means that it is the Face of Murder-- though his peeper psychiatrist says that it isn't so. Reich plots a murder against his business rival, D'Courtney. He carries out his plan, it goes somewhat askew, but the crime is committed. And, incredibly, Reich, a nontelepath, manages to stay a jump ahead of the telepathic police.Pitted against Reich is the determined ist-class telepath and cop, Lincoln Powell. Powell finds himself repeatedly frustrated from building a case against Reich. To Powell, this is more than just a murder case. Reich is a dangerous force who can play havoc with society if he is allowed to succeed-- if he escapes demolition.When I first read the novel, I thought that I had caught Bester in a small slip. I should have known better. It wasn't a slip at all. It was a clue to the solution to the novel. But I wasn't clever enough to figure out that solution the first time that I read _The Demolished Man_. Maybe you will. But my money is on Bester.When I reread the novel for review, I was not surprised at all to rediscover favorite sections. There were the opening paragraphs (which I had long ago memorized because of their operatic punch): ""In the endless universe there is nothing new, nothing different. What may appear exceptional to the minute mind of man may be inevitable in the Infinite Eye of God"" (10). There is the nonsense verse that Reich uses as an aid to murder that comes to haunt him:""Tenser, said the Tensor.Tenser, said the Tensor.Tension, aprehension,And dissention have begun.Tension, apprehension,And dissention have begun."" (48)There is the telepathic party at Lincoln Powell's house that must be witnessed by the reader to be appreciated. There are the assassination attempts on Powell that go askew-- but not by much. And there is Reich's final, surrealistic showdown with the Man With No Face.What _did_ surprise me on rereading the novel were several sections that I had not really noticed before. There was the marvelously funny scene at Sam @kin's therapy clinic on Venus, where he is desperately trying to train nontelepaths into telepaths. And there is the manhunt on Spaceland, a kind of outer space theme park, where Reich is on the run and in danger of killing again.A terrific novel, full of dazzlement and style and suspense. And, as I found, something new on repeated rereadings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2P0UAPZLMAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679767819#wasThisHelpful","R1I2P0UAPZLMAP","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert A. Heinlein's _Double Star_ (1956) was initially a three-part serial in _Astounding_ in 1956, with some marvelous illustrations by Kelly Freas. It was the third novel to win the Hugo for best novel. And while some critics have grumped a bit that _Double Star_ is a touch ""lightweight"" for a proper Hugo winner, it is really rather hard to dislike the novel. It is first-class entertainment.The title refers, not to the double sun of an extra-solar planet-- all the action takes place within our own solar system-- but to the rather complicated relationship between acting and politics. Heinlein envisions a Solar System Government of the future that is a democratic government. But not a democracy modeled on 20th century America. It is a parliamentary system with an Emperor and Empire, much like 19th century Britain. Citizens in the Empire have some individual rights... But they are limited and by no means equal. Martians and Venusian natives have no rights.There are two political parties vying for power: A majority party called the Humanists, and a minority libertarian party led by a fellow named John Joseph Bonforte. The Humanists are Earth-firsters in their politics. The libertarians favor making Martians and Venusians citizens. Bonforte is about to undergo an important ceremony on Mars that could turn the tide in favor of his party. But before the ceremony can occur, an extreme wing of Humanists kidnaps him. Did I mention that politics in this future society is _very_ down and dirty?Enter Lorenzo Smythe, stage left. Into a bar. Lorenzo (Larry to his friends) is a moderately talented, out-of-work actor who looks just enough like Bonforte to impersonate him. Just for a little while. Until, hopefully, Bonforte can be rescued. Only, of course, bit by bit, things become more complicated. The impersonation has to be extended. And the role becomes more tricky.In lesser hands, we would have had a routine melodrama. But Heinlein understands that this is a story of character. Everything rests upon Lorenzo Smythe, the first-person narrator of the story. There is much to like about Lorenzo. He is charming, smart, talented at his trade, and full of a certain degree of worldly experience. He is full of anecdotes about the acting life. But he is also an alcoholic. And he is vain, selfish, egotistical, apolitical, and ignorant of a great many things outside of his profession: ""The long-jump ships such as the _Tom Paine_, torchships that is, are (so they tell me) the real thing, making use of E equals MC squared, or is it M equals EC squared? You know-- the thing Einstein invented"" (73-74). He has spent a great many years Looking Out For Number One. He finds it hard to understand others who do not live by that code.Here is Lorenzo Smythe (the self-styled ""Great Lorenzo"") fairly early in the novel:I had never meddled in politics. My father had warned against it. ""Stay out of it, Larry,"" he had told me solemnly. ""The publicity you get that way is bad publicity. The peasants don't like it."" I had never voted-- not even after the amendment of '98 made it easy for the floating population... to exercise franchise. (54)We know people like Lorenzo. People who say that ""all politicians are crooks"". People who never vote. People who get the politicians that they deserve. People who loudly complain about the politicians whom they get. Yet when Lorenzo is told that he will probably be replaced by another actor-- is in effect given a chance to ""get out of politics""-- he becomes furious and demands to know why. And a spaceman takes Lorenzo down a peg:""You asked for it, shipmate. See here, a man in my profession contracts to take a heap to Ganymede, that means he will pilot that pot to Ganymede or die trying. He doesn't get fainthearted and try to welsh while the ship is being loaded. You told me you would take this job-- no 'ifs' or 'ands' or 'buts'-- you took the job. A few minutes later, there is a fracas, you lose your nerve. Later on, you try and run out on me at the field. Only ten minutes ago you were screaming to be taken back dirtside. Maybe you are a better actor than Trowbridge. I wouldn't know. But I know we need a man who can be depended on not to lose his nerve when the time comes. I understand that Trowbridge is that sort of bloke."" (45)Lorenzo is able to translate this into show business terms: ""He was telling me that I was not a trouper"" (46). And he knows that the criticism is just. He becomes determined to be a trouper. And slowly, as he learns to play the role of a lifetime, he learns how to become a greater man than he was. When I reread the novel, a lot of favorate scenes came back to me: The byplay between Lerenzo and Dak Broadbent in the bar, the takeoff from Earth under two gravities (not as tough as it could be, but tough enough), the therapy in which Lorenzo is cured of his prejudice against Martians, the Martian ceremony, the scene in which Lorenzo learns that winning an election isn't necessarily good, and the audience with the Emperor and the electric trains. Finally, there is the ending. This is what a politician should always remember (but which all too many of them forget).Yes, indeed. This is a novel worthy of its award.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GP0BAZB4K7X7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050OVMWG#wasThisHelpful","R2GP0BAZB4K7X7","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was serious science fiction that dealt with religion in mainstream science fiction back in the 1940s. But it was fiction that was always treating religion religion as a sociological movement: Robert A. Heinlein's ""If This Goes On--"" (1940) and Fritz Leiber's _Gather, Darkness!_ (1943). As James Blish (1964) noted in his classic essay on religion and science fiction, by the 1950s, we had the atomic bomb. Suddenly, we began to realize that Armageddon was not a distant prospect. It was something that we could bring upon ourselves today. Science fiction writers began exploring other aspects of religion, such as myth and theology.Blish's own novel, _A Case of Conscience_ (1958) was a serious attempt to explore Catholic theology against a science fictional background (though Blish himself was not Catholic). It won the Hugo for 1959, against some stiff competitors. It is not hard to see why. It was one of the greatest pieces of religious science fiction to emerge from the fifties, and the sophistication and subtlety of Blish's ideas are still challenging to the modern reader.Nevertheless, I am not completely satisfied with the novel. The problem is not with Blish's profoundity of thought but with the structure of the novel. It is composed of two parts. Part One is the title novella (originally published in a 1953 issue of _If_) set on an alien planet. Here, Father Ruiz-Sanchez, a Jesuit priest, is working as a biologist on a scientific team on the planet Lithia, populated by a strange, ethical, peaceful reptilian race of creatures. Their mission is to determine whether Earth and Lithia should maintain contact with one another. The physicist on the team favors contact, but not for a very good reason; he believes that the planet would make a good ""weapons dump"". Ruiz is against contact. But he admits that his reasons are rather nebulous. His religious training has started to trigger alarm bells. He becomes convinced that Lithia is in fact a vast, demonic trap.At the close of Part One, we know _why_ Ruiz-Sanchez thinks the planet is a trap. And because his reasoning is based upon a long discredited line of Catholic theology, he is at this point expecting to become excommunicated by the Church. We are left to wonder: is he right or wrong? Part Two centers around what happens when an alien egg is taken to Earth from Lithia. We see it hatch into an alien, who becomes a demonic, rabble-rousing alien. He causes no end of trouble on Earth. We see that Ruiz-Sanchez was right in every particular, we see all hell begining to break loose... and there is finally an ending that even the most charitable of critics must allow was pulled out of Blish's hat. It completely strains credulity.I have no way of knowing for sure, but I rather suspect that most readers who admire _A Case of Conscience_ tend to think in terms of the first half of the novel, when questions are being raised, rather than the second half of the novel, when all the questions are answered. It is certainly the better half of the novel by far._A Case of Conscience_ was the first of a ""thematic trilogy"" called After Such Knowledge. The trilogy title comes from a line from T.S. Eliot's ""Gerontion"": ""After such knowledge, what forgiveness?"" The later two novels in the trilogy are the historical novel, _Doctor Mirabilis_ (1968) and the fantasy, _Black Easter and The Day After Judgement_ (1980). All of these works deal with the issue of whether the pusuit of secular knowledge is a waste of the mind or even evil. Well, I suppose that it can be. But before we all start jumping up and waving our fists and ranting against Secular Humanism, perhaps we should remember another truth: The same could be said of religious knowledge as well._References_: Blish, James (1964).""Cathedrals in Space"".

"Mark Clifton and Frank Riley's _They'd Rather Be Right_ (1956) was the second novel to win the Hugo award. It is on many people's lists as the _worst_ novel ever to win a Hugo. There is perhaps some justification for this claim. Much of the science is dated by now. (The computer Bossy has vacuum tubes rather than transisters.) Much of the dialogue is in the form of rather long, didactic speeches. And there are times when the authors tell a bit more than they show.And yet... Is the novel really all that bad? I'll grant you that it isn't a deathless classic, but I don't see that it is an outright stinker, either. _They'd Rather Be Right_ (aka, _The Forever Machine_) is the third of a series of three stories. The first two are ""Crazy Joey"" (_Astounding_, 1953) and ""Hide! Hide, Witch!"" (_Astounding_, 1953).* The first tale introduces the telepath Joe Carter as a boy. The second tale introduces the supercomputer ""Bossy"" that must be hidden (along with two of her creators) from the mobs. The title refers to the verse:""Hide! Hide, Witch!The good folk come to burn thee,Their keen enjoyment hid beneathThe gothick mask of duty.""The novel extends the story. It was first serialized in _Astounding_ in 1954, along with some lovely Kelly Freas illustrations. As the the novel opens, the scientist creators of ""Bossy"" are on the run from both the F.B.I. and mobs of common people. They are being aided by the telepath, Joe Carter, once a graduate student of theirs, to disappear into the underworld. Bossy has been disassembled but not destroyed, and the plan is to reassemble her.Bossy does get reassembled. She now has the power to answer virtually _any_ question given the adequate amount of data. This alone makes her valuable-- and dangerous. But Joe has discovered another power for Bossy as well. She can treat people in a kind of therapy that can ""rejuvinate"" that person and give them youth and virtual immortality. There is, however, a price. To undergo the therapy, one must ""relax"" and release one's basic prejudices-- admit that you could be wrong about your most basic beliefs. Most people, Joe says, would ""rather be right-- and die"" (53) than live forever.Bossy's first patient is the elderly prostitute Mabel, a woman who has comitted many sins but who has few illusions about herself. (Mabel is harboring Joe, the scientists, and Bossy in her establishment.) I found the episodes in which Mabel's friends engage in criminal activities to keep her alive during the rejuvination process to be fun. And the later scene in which the rejuvinated Mabel makes a monkey out of the pompous psychiatrist at the police station was hilarious.The authors envision a near-future society governed by a mob mentality and love of conformism that is accepted across the country (much like the McCarthyism and H.U.A.C. and witchhunting that were still fresh when the novel was written). One of the scientists, Hoskins, reflects on the disasterous effect that this has had on science alone:Now, for almost half a century, there had been nothing new. There was apparent progress, of course. The cookbook engineers were able to mix up new batches from old ingredients. There was still enough gadgetry invention to confound any criticism. But there was no exploration of new areas, hunting for new frontiers. (22)Clifton and Riley use images of blindness and visual impairment to dramatize man's lack of capacity for self-awareness. Early in the novel, the scientists are hiding out in a skid row flophouse and are discussing some of their theoretical ideas. Another bum even joins in the dialogue. But their conversation is hampered by the ""chicken wire"" (12) strung as a barrier between the bunks. Later, Joe tells Dr. Billings: ""Every man surrounds his mind with a framework of screen mesh... composed of his own prejudgements, preconceptions of what is acceptable to him. Everything he receives must filter through it"" (27). Later, Joe reflects that the human race ""was like a universe of material bodies, each with its own eccentric orbit, blindly crashing into one another, carooming off"" (55).But, like the blind man, the human race has learned how to do certain types of ""cane tapping"" (55) to help feel its way along. One type of cane tapping is science, with its ""measurement of exteriors"" (55). Two other potential canes for mankind are Bossy and psionics. But in order to use them, man must, bit by bit, abandon the mental mesh that blinds him.Joseph McCarthy is long dead. The House of UnAmerican Activities (HUAC) has long been disbanded. The McCarthy witch hunts are a thing of the past. But we have massive amounts of anti-intellectualism and ignorance in America today. There is still pressure to conform to this or that mass ideology. And much of the hypocrisy skewered by the authors is an ever-present evil. It really would not take much to bring about the world that Clifton and Riley satirize._They'd Rather Be Right_ has an undeserved bad reputation. It is well worth a look, and it still has something worthwhile to say to modern readers. Highly recommended. There have been several editions of _They'd Rather Be Right_ over the years, but my favorite is the Starblaze Edition. It is sturdily bound, with good print and good illustrations by M.W. Carroll.* The first two ""Bossy"" stories were written by Mark Clifton in collaboration with Alex Apostolides. They may be found in _The Science Fiction of Mark Clifton_ (1980), ed. Barry Malzberg.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GDPPRJZXNEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CQCQTA#wasThisHelpful","R2GDPPRJZXNEJ","A5A25SHEUX6ZK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5A25SHEUX6ZK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was sold this product at a deep discount in exchange for an honest review, and I can promise you that this will be an honest review.I have been using this product on my Australian shepherd/wheaten terrier mix dog for the last week. My dog, Monkey, came to me with lots of allergies affecting his ears, nose, lungs, and paws. Most of his ailments are under control now, but his paws are still something he relentlessly chews on. I have to say that this spray seems to work pretty well. The chewing and whining is pretty much gone.The only thing I would like to see different with this product is to be able to administer it from a dropper bottle instead of a spray bottle. I may end up transferring the solution into one of my own dropper bottles. Monkey hates the spray, so applying this is a bit of a chore...and kind of messy. Monkey thinks I am assaulting him, but we get through it and he is feeling better these days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PIT6KK7HKNZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSRBDHE#wasThisHelpful","R1PIT6KK7HKNZU","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was sold this product at a deep discount in exchange for an honest review, and I can promise you that this will be an honest review.THE BELT: I absolutely love this belt. It is soooo comfortable. I am not a fan of purses, and women's clothes often lack practical features like pockets (don't get me started...), so this has been a godsend. I wear it around the house so that I don't have to carry my phone around with me in my hand and I wear it to the store sometimes, because this hot summer weather makes wearing a hoodie (which has pockets!) a rediculous sort of venture... but I still won't give in to lugging around a purse. I'm a minimalist, and so this is AWESOME for me!FEATURES:1.) Adjustable belt.2.) Large packet that is open both from the left and right sides, so that you can add or remove items quickly, without struggling with zippers or buttons. Think of this pocket as a very snug hoodie pocket that is on the inside of your clothes instead of on the outside. Smaller items fit in easier than larger items, but I had no problem fitting in either of my two phones, the largest being 5""x3"".3.) Simple plastic hook, with closure for keys.CONCLUSION: Five stars, baby!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294A452MH64B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8Y09EY#wasThisHelpful","R294A452MH64B5","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was sold this product at a deep discount in exchange for an honest review, and I can promise you that this will be an honest review.THE CASE: The outside of the case is made up of a man-made material that is meant to mimic a leather-type look. The black interior feels soft and a bit fuzzy, almost like velvet, though I would not call it velvet. The case holds the tweezer very nicely, but lacks the suppleness that real leather provides. This is appropriate at this price level and the pocket case adds significant value to the product, making the tweezer easier to find in a purse or drawer. The color is a dark purple, and is aesthetically pleasing enough for this price level. The tweezer fits very snuggly sideways. Ample room is given for the tip of the tweezer where the case folds over, and the case seals with a firmly adhered velcro closure.POSSIBLE ISSUE FOR THE CASE: Due to the lack of suppleness of the case material, the end of the flap closure lays FLAT instead of molding over the body of the case, increasing the likelihood of the corners catching on things in one’s purse. The issue is not severe, but I thought I would point it out since some individuals carry a plethora of items at the bottom of their purse. I would likely slip this tweezer case into a side/slender pocket of my purse to avoid any such issues. Aside from that possible small hitch, the benefit of the accessory case is a big plus at this price level, and so I won’t be deducting points for this maybe-it-is-maybe-it-isn’t-an-issue.THE TWEEZER: That’s what we’re here for, right? This tweezer performs very well. I had a mini-learning curve at first, thinking that the tweezer was not picking up the finest hairs around my brow. I was wrong. This is a precision tweezer, requiring precision handling as well. With less than a minute’s practice, I was able to pluck any size of hair, no matter how fine, with this tweezer. Afterwards, I slipped it sideways back into its snug little pocket case, and felt quite impressed.THE SPARKLES: Yes, this tweezer has them. Because of the darker purple color, the sparkles don’t appear overwhelming. If you have an aversion to looking overly Rainbows-CandyCanes-and-Unicorns, this should suit you well enough. Obviously, if you don’t like purple, you might be on the wrong product page.RATING: This tweezer performs very well, is a good purchase at this price, and is rated as a strong buy in this price category.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S75FOEJM02F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3JE84I#wasThisHelpful","R3S75FOEJM02F7","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The liquid gel capsule was a brilliant idea. This small, easy-to-swallow pill works well and it works fast. The first time I used this product, I was on a business trip to China. The effects were subtle and natural, but I definitely felt myself falling asleep quickly.Before trying this product, both my husband and I separately used our own favorite melatonin brands. He liked to use a tablet form and I was using a sublingual form. After trying this product, we both agree that this melatonin works better than either of our other products, which we have been long-time users of (years). I would guess that the liquid solution is part of the reason for this product’s efficacy. The fact that this melatonin beats out two other top melatonin brands, as far as our family is concerned, is significant to us.

"Review of smarter rest sleep sublime eye maskThe Sleep Sublime Eye Mask by Smarter Rest claims that I will get better, more restful sleep, and can maximize the healing effects of REM sleep. I rarely feel like I get enough rest, so I was eager to give this product a try.The eye mask comes in a nice drawstring pouch, and the strap is made with two little loops to hold a pair of earplugs; great for keeping everything together, especially when travelling. This one came with the earplugs, so I was all set.The easy to understand instructions tell how to adjust the strap for a comfortable fit; the strap is extra long to accommodate different head sizes, hairdoos, etc. I was a little concerned that the velcro on the strap might stick to my pillowcase, but it didn’t.In addition to the soft cotton material that touches your eyes, the mask has a flap that folds down to block more light from getting in around the sides of your nose; very effective.I put the earplugs in, pulled the mask over my eyes, adjusted the nose flap, and it was off to dreamland. The mask is very comfortable, I hardly noticed I was wearing it after a very short time. The earplugs are great at keeping out sound, and I was still able to hear my alarm go off when I did need to get up. The mask blocks pretty much all of the light, and I felt like my sleep was deeper and with more dreams.I’d recommend this product to anyone looking for a sleep aid that blocks light and sound and allows you to get a better nights rest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36EZLSNVS6ZK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQ3IKCQ#wasThisHelpful","R36EZLSNVS6ZK3","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NORI: These nori sheets have less added salt and are significantly firmer than expected. Hence, these sheets are a wonderful replacement for bread. They hold wet, soggy veggy mixtures better then pita bread!! For making sushi, I wet the inside side of the paper and lightly apply oil to the outside, rendering a far more plyable sheet for rolling and cutting.

"Review for Attmu Brush, as used for dry brushing (not bath/shower use):BRISTLES: I am a little shocked by the usability of this brush. I have body brushes ranging in prices between $15-$40+ dollars, and this is hands-down the best body brush I have used yet. What sets this brush apart is the short, firm, equal-height consistency of almost every brush strand. The outcome of this design is that every stroke I make across my skin has the same amount of pressure under the full area of the brush, side-to-side and end-to-end. This made my jaw drop. The pressure is fully uniform: as long as the brush firmly touches my skin, my skin receives relatively the same level of treatment, whether or not my skin is massaged under the middle or the sides of the brush.MASSAGE NUBS: Again, very usable and effective. Gives the right amount of pressure without causing damage to skin.RECOMMENDATION: I am rating this brush as a “strong buy” for dry body brushing. I will absolutely be buying more of these brushes myself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXZ1L5N3I1DJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHJZ81I#wasThisHelpful","R1IXZ1L5N3I1DJ","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am definitely blown away by the level of detail given to the design and packaging of this product. If you are looking for something in this price range, especially something worthy of giving as a gift, this may be it.SOUND QUALITY: Good. Nothing lacking, in my opinion, regarding the sound quality expected in this price range.MICROPHONE: Good. Simplistic on/off design.COMFORT: Good, but made for larger ears due to the size and weight of the ear buds. Consider this for the man or young adult/teen son in your life.AESTHETICS: At this price level, this is a bit of a show stopper. It is unexpectedly beautiful, and that's why I would heartily recommend this on your gift-giving list for work or as stocking-stuffers. I hope my photos give it justice.ISSUES: The extra ear bud covers are supposed to come in two sizes, but as shown in one of my pictures, I received one large pair (this is good) and one mismatched pair (one large and one small earbud cover -- this is not good). But, please note that this does not change the usability of the device: I do not believe that these earbuds are appropriate for smaller sized ears (see above), so the extra rubber for the smaller bud cover is a bit of a waste. Thus, only the original translucent ear bud covers in medium (beautiful) and the extra set in large standard black are what you want anyhow.RECOMMENDATION: For this price range, I rate this as a buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R9VYTHHQW4PD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MHKTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3R9VYTHHQW4PD","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I purchased the probiotics I ordered this probiotic exactly one month ago, when my dog ""Monkey"", who is still less than one year old, had an ear infection, was listless, was suffering from allergies, and was having diarrhea every 1-2 hours!! (especially throughout the night...it was like taking care of a sick newborn!!!). I purchased a well-regarded OTC ear medication (Zymox Plus), I bought these Pet Ultimate Probiotics, I bought a nutritional supplement, and I started making homemade food for Monkey.The ear infection was the first thing to clear, which I am certain can be credited to the Zymox. The ungodly cycle of diarrhea took about a week to clear, which I am fairly certain is credited, at least in part if not in whole, to these probiotics. The allergies have also been greatly reduced. And now, oh joy, Monkey has boundless energy, far more than he ever has. Instead of waking me to go potty, he wakes me to go play (after a long, restful night :). Changing Monkey's diet and having access to OTC products that actually work has completely turned my little guy around for the better.I am making sure to put these probiotics in one of his meals each day, which significantly helps to keep his diet plan complete, and I am sure aids in keeping his digestive system functional. I appreciate the quality of this product. I was not pleased with what I was finding online regarding probiotics until I came across this one. I feel very confident in giving it to my puppy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QYSYVU8A7QOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LNQQ85Q#wasThisHelpful","R2QYSYVU8A7QOT","ABAT3R1T8QZ5L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABAT3R1T8QZ5L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This replaces almost every tracking journal I have, except my HealthMinder and BodyMinder journals. It is great for jotting down appointments and brilliant ideas throughout the day in the left-hand page (as well as reminders and trackers), while the right-hand side serves as a document page for more comprehensive notes. If my ideas run past the space allotted in the right-hand side, then I can easily just add some more college-ruled or graphing paper to continue my designs/thoughts/ideas, as it sensibly fits the pre-set format for this product. The monthly calendar pages allow me to visually track progress month to month, as well as allowing for summary and cross-referencing of more detailed notes written in the daily journal pages. The tabs for each month are helpful, but I will be adding magnetic bookmarks to the pages that I am working on each day.I have tried going digital for my documentation over the last few years, but honestly it hasn't worked out. Inevitably, an app becomes outdated, more difficult to use, I switch apps, or even worse, I somehow lose the data I have input (computer failure, phone upgrades, software upgrades, hacks, malware, etc.). Ya, I guess my house could burn down and then I could lose all my hard-copy journals, but that hasn't happened to me EVER, so my hand-written journals are still the safest most secure place for me yet. Not to mention that I find that I can access my hardcopy journals more quickly. I also write more in this format, verses when I am entering info via data entry style, as I don't have to wait for an app or program to open up for me or try to press tiny buttons. Finally, it hardly ever seems rude when I jot down notes in hardcopy when I am with people, but whipping my phone out constantly when I am brainstorming ideas can seem insensitive in some situations (such as during conversations, meetings, classes, etc.).Man, did I just go off on a tangent.

"Books by ER workers are plentiful, so there is no good reason to read this amateur-ish book instead of one of the better written others.  Most of the stories in this book are pretty common to this type of book--the woman who turns out to be male, the drunks, the liars seeking pills, etc.  There are no really unique stories that you can't miss.  Two things really bothered me about this author.  First, much of this book is really disrespectful of her patients.  She makes fun of peoples lack of medical knowledge, spelling mistakes, fears, etc.  I wouldn't want to be this woman's patient because of this attitude.  Second, she reports an incident where a police officer who brings an injured suspect to the ER tells her where he chased this suspect, and where he was throwing stolen jewelry out of his pockets to rid himself of the evidence.  The author and a friend go to this spot and find the stolen jewelry.  She thinks this is funny/cool.  I think this makes her almost as dishonest as the person who stole the jewelry in the first place.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCZAF9MMUL90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3TNZYI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCZAF9MMUL90","A2WJCE8VF3STFW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WJCE8VF3STFW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While there were some interesting facts in this presentation, I felt it ultimately failed.  The pictures are cartoonish, and do not move.  It's like panning a picture book.  It would have been better if they had gone to Monticello and filmed it.  Sometimes what they were trying to get across was unclear.  For instance, with his bed that was between two rooms, I understood how the bed was set up because I've been to Monticello, but it wasn't clear on this DVD.  You almost had to know a lot about Jefferson in order to understand the video because so much was just mentioned in passing that needed more explanation.  This DVD also suffers from too much political correctness.  It dwells a bit too long on slavery.

The pictures are static.  The camera simply pans the pictures from the book--nothing moves.  It's a lot like watching a filmstrip, for those of us old enough to remember filmstrips in school.  My experience as a children's librarian is that 21st century children aren't satisfied by these DVDs with still pictures.  They are used to more pizzazz.

"Jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd has been a pioneer in many ways, but his the body of his work shows that he is one that likes to challenge himself. During his hard bop period, he's had a massive body of work but it's his 70's period that's his most recognizable and most influential work. In the early 70's he decided to experiment with the jazz fusion movement. With the aid of The Mizell Brothers, he created some groundbreaking and innovative sounds- much to the chagrin of purists. It all started with 1973's ""Black Byrd"", where he landed the hit ""Flight Time"" (The song would later be the inspiration for the name behind Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis's production company, Flyte Tyme). He later followed it up with two albums in 1974: ""Street Lady"" and his best work ""Stepping Into Tomorrow"". In 1975, he issued his best known album ""Places & Spaces"" - which contained the heavily sampled tracks 'Wind Parade"" and ""(Fallin' Like) Dominoes"". 1976's ""Caricatures"" was his final album for Blue Note and marked the end of his collaboration with The Mizell Brothers. As he wanted to make a change, he settled in at Elektra Records - a label that would later become known for jazz musicians such as Lee Ritenour, Patrice Rushen and Grover Washington, Jr. In 1978, he issued the album ""Thank You For F.U.M.L. (Funking Up My Life)"", while it was one of his rare self-produced projects, in the end he decided to let someone take the reins on the production side for his next album.In 1981, Byrd enlisted former in-house Stax producer/songwriter turned singer Isaac Hayes. Fresh off his Polydor stint, Hayes produced ""Love Byrd"" shortly before he decided to take a break from music to make a foray into acting. The album sounds noticeably different from Hayes' work at Polydor, which had taken a blatant slant towards disco. A couple of the songs on here try to stray from disco influences, but are very blatant in their dance music origins (See: The first single ""Love Has Come Around""). ""Love Byrd"" also contains probably the first and only time a Cole Porter ballad has been covered as a funk record: The virtually unrecognizable ""Love For Sale"". The romantic ballad ""I Feel Like Loving You Today"" is best known as the sample behind Group Home's song ""Baby Pa"" from their 1995 debut ""Livin' Proof"". There are some great ballads on here, such as ""I'll Always Love You"" and the album closer ""Falling"". However, the best ballad comes in the form of the six minute ""Butterfly"", where a man pines for a lost love. Though ""Love Byrd"" is a decent offering from Donald Byrd, it wasn't without its flaws. The most obvious is that Donald seems to be a guest on his own album. Hayes' writing, production, arrangements and background vocals dominate the album to the point where Donald barely had any wiggle room to show off his playing skills. Despite that mishap, it's not as revered as his earlier work but still worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R117XJCDL6E37O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QJLQOY#wasThisHelpful","R117XJCDL6E37O","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After he split with his partner C.L. Smooth, Mount Vernon native Pete Rock decided to focus on putting out his artists InI and Deda. That plan would come to a screeching halt when Elektra decided to shelve their debuts after not seeing commercial potential in their releases. Pete then focused on releasing his solo debut ""Soul Survivor"" through Loud Records. While Loud meant well, they were nearing the end of their distribution deal with RCA Records and as such, they were gearing up for distribution with Columbia. Although he did respectable numbers, he ended up getting dropped from their roster by the time the Columbia distribution deal went through. A few years passed on by the time he released his next recording ""PeteStrumentals"". Ironically, the same fans who craved an instrumental album from Pete Rock unfairly trashed the album during its initial release. Since then, the public has reversed their opinion on the now hailed project. Shortly after that, he issued the long-shelved debuts from InI and Deda - ""Center Of Attention"" and ""The Original Baby Pa"", respectively - ""Soul Survivor 2"" and another instrumental piece, the outtakes album ""The Surviving Elements"". In between those projects, he continued to produce - including the Edo G. record ""My Own Worst Enemy"", while working with Redman, Method Man and Keith Murray and making random appearances on albums by Northern State and Keyshia Cole.In 2008, he released ""NY's Finest"" and did joint albums with Smif-N-Wessun and Camp Lo. Pete then signed with Arizona based hip hop label Mello Music Group to release yet another instrumental album ""PeteStrumentals 2"". While the sequel's title is a clear nod to the 2001 album, this one has very little in common with its predecessor. ""PeteStrumentals"" was basically a jazz fusion record with hip hop drums, while ""PeteStrumentals 2"" is less focused on melody and heavy on groove. The album starts off with the most mellow song on the album, the spiritual ""Heaven & Earth"". He does a dramatic reworking of the often sampled James Brown tune ""Funky President"" on ""PR 4 Prez"". He takes an ethereal approach on the first single ""Cosmic Slop"" while paying tribute to the B-Boy culture on ""Clap Ya Hands (I Feel Good)"". On ""I Wish"", he incorporates the hook of the 1976 Rose Royce classic ""Wishing On A Star"" as well as working in some Isaac Hayes on ""One, Two, A Few More"". He makes great use of Eddie Kendricks' song ""Can I"" on the retro ""90's Class Act"" and pays tribute to his biggest fan, the late J Dilla on ""Dilla Bounce (R.I.P.)"". He brings in a sinister sound for ""Play Yo Horn"", while delivering the dancehall sound on ""Roots, Reggae, Kulcha"" and afrobeat on the album closer ""You Know Dat"". Although ""PeteStrumentals 2"" is a great listen, there are a couple of songs that are filler. ""My My Baby"" seems to meander without really going anywhere and ""Gonna Love You"" just comes off as repetitive. Despite those shortcomings, Pete Rock shows that he's still got it after being in the music business after two and a half decades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S11YXO1LJ190/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X43VRUC#wasThisHelpful","R2S11YXO1LJ190","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although New Orleans is best known for the launch pad for the No Limit and Cash Money labels, the city has also spawned some notable talent in the R&B world. Names include the instrumental act The Meters, gospel trio Trin-I-Tee 5:7, Ledisi, early 80's funk group Windjammer and songstress Teedra Moses. Back in the late 90's, she was in a relationship with underground rapper Ras Kass (She was even thanked in the liner notes to his critically acclaimed debut ""Soul On Ice""). However, they called it quits by the time the new millennium was approaching. Teedra then became a stylist to the stars while working on her music career. She was signed by an unlikely label - TVT  Records, a company more known for their hip hop and rock acts, and barely known for rhythm and blues. In 2004, she released her formal debut ""Complex Simplicity"", an album that was mostly produced by Paul Poli (Best known for the Black Eyed Peas single ""Joints & Jam"") with additional production by Raphael Saadiq and her then-labelmate Lil' Jon. The recording received generally positive reviews, but TVT's lack of history with R&B sunk the project before it got off the ground. While recording a follow-up, TVT Records folded due to a lawsuit over copyright issues and as such, Teedra went out to record a series of mixtapes and working behind the scenes as a background vocalist and songwriter.In 2011, she was thrown a lifeline by signing to Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. It seemed like she was going to reach a mainstream audience, however label issues continued to put a halt to her career. After her appearance on the first ""Self Made"" compilation, she dealt with creative differences due to the label wanting her to sound and look a certain way. She left and then went to Shanachie Records for her release of her long awaited second album ""Cognac & Conversation"". This time around, she works with producers such as her longtime engineer Donnie ""Cash"" Whitmore, Charles ""Uncle Chucc"" Hamilton of the production collective 1500 Or Nothin', Trackademics, Thaddeus Dixon and Virginia based producer Bink. Musically, she takes an honest approach with her songwriting as she looks at love from the point of view from a woman nearing middle age. She issues come-ons on the opening track ""R U Scared"", while being unimpressed with material things on the Dynasty sampling ""All I Ever Wanted"". She addresses her current priorities in a relationship on ""Get It Right"", while duetting with Anthony Hamilton on ""That One"". There are a couple of songs that previously appeared on her mixtapes: ""International Playboi"" from 2010's ""Royal Patience: A Love Journey"" and the acapella ""Wish You Were Here"" from her lone release on Maybach Music Group ""Luxurious Undergrind"". She decides to be committed to someone on the ballad ""Only U"", while being frank and open about her personal life on the album's best track ""Yesterday Ain't Tomorrow"". ""Cognac & Conversation"" is a great album from Teedra Moses. She may not be as known as some of her female contemporaries, but her music holds up better than one would expect. Hopefully, she will get the recognition that she finally deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PSHVL4JR7RHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X4U2ZUG#wasThisHelpful","R2PSHVL4JR7RHC","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philadelphia singer Vivian Green got her start by helping write the song ""Dear God""- the closing track on Boyz II Men's 1997 album ""Evolution"" while she was still in high school. She received an offer from a major label, but was rebuffed by her parents who insisted that she finished high school first. After graduation, she paid dues by touring as a background singer for Jill Scott. While in the neo-soul circuit, she ran into independent soul singer Eric Roberson, who mentored her when she wanted to give another shot at a singing career. She signed with Columbia Records to release her formal debut ""A Love Story"". The album yielded her first single- and signature song ""Emotional Rollercoaster"". Three years passed when she decided to follow it up with her sophomore effort ""Vivian""-  a recording largely inspired by her recent divorce. She then went on a five year hiatus to change labels- which saw her move from Columbia to E1 Music for the release of 2010's ""Beautiful"" and 2012's ""The Green Room"". Despite her success and her personality, she was always perceived as being ""the sad girl"" due to her best known songs being about heartbreak. Although her later recordings showed her trying to distance herself from that, it was hard for her to shake that stigma. To that end, she decided to do a full on makeover- both in her music and her looks.Her first order of operations was to adopt a more sexier image- which she had been cultivating on her previous album ""The Green Room"". The second one was a label change, with her moving to Caroline Records. In her corner is the rapper turned producer Kwame (Raheem DeVaughn, Algebra Blessett, Tweet, Lloyd Banks), who insisted that she made music that reflected her true personality. The end result is her 2015 album- the aptly titled ""Vivid"". With Kwame producing the entire album, ""Vivid"" sounds like Vivian really wanted to be a dance diva. This is reflected in the first single- the Maze featuring Frankie Beverly sampling ""Gotta Get Back To My Baby"", the surprisingly sexual ""Work"", the Motownesque ""123"" and the closing track ""Leave It All Behind"". She duets with Raheem DeVaughn, who interrupts the mood with his slightly raunchy guest appearance on the ballad ""All I Want Is You"". She adopts a more positive outlook after a breakup on ""Broken"" and desires to live free without regard to rules on ""Just Like Fools"". After collaborating with her twice before, she connects with fellow singer Treena Ferebee on the introspective ""Count Your Blessings"". Vivian Green's ""Vivid"" is a decent offering from the veteran singer. Although the production could have been a little better, it's commendable that she decided to step out of her comfort zone and take risks in her career.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNI0SMH5PUWUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZ6MZD0#wasThisHelpful","RNI0SMH5PUWUI","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original lineup of Dynasty consisted of singer and songwriters Nidra Beard and Linda Carreire with keyboardist Kevin Spencer being brought in at the last minute by Solar Records head Dick Griffey. In 1979, they released their formal debut as a trio ""Your Piece Of The Rock"", which yielded the hit ""I Don't Want To Be A Freak"". That same year, Spencer helped write the smash hit for his labelmates The Whispers ""And The Beat Goes On"". In 1980, they released the follow-up ""Adventures In The Land Of Music"" - which keyboardist William Shelby's appearance introduced the group as a quartet. That album contained their biggest hits ""I've Just Begun To Love You"" and ""Groove Control"" as well as the title track- which was best known as the sample behind Camp Lo's 1997 hit ""Luchini AKA This Is It"". Their longtime producer Leon Sylvers III became the fifth member of the group for their third effort ""The Second Adventure"". However, his profile in the group did little to to help with their fame. Also not helping matters was the issue surrounding all of the 1981 releases on Solar Records. Around that time, label founder Dick Griffey rush released recordings on Solar to get out of their distribution with RCA to enter into a partnership with Elektra, where he continued to rush release recordings. As a result, all of the albums by the acts on the roster suffered marketing and promotion problems.It's unfortunate that Dynasty was one of the acts caught up in the the label distribution mess, as ""The Second Adventure"" contained some of their best work. With Leon Sylvers III at the helm with co-production by Kevin Spencer and William Shelby, their album has songs that could have easily been a classic record. Starting off the album is the song ""Here I Am""- a song about still wanting to be in love despite being hurt which was co-written by Midnight Star members Melvin Gentry and Belinda Lipscomb. A man that fancies himself a ladies' man gets his comeuppance on the funky ""Pain, Got A Hold On Me"", while ""A Man In Love"" shows someone who cannot hide their happiness and feelings over their significant other. A man pledges to give himself to someone on ""Give Your Love To Me"". Singer Nidra Beard takes the lead on the song ""Love In The Fast Lane"", where she takes a more careful approach to dating after being mistreated. Beard pens the Spencer led ""Revenge"", where a man finds out that his former love has moved on with someone else. Pleading with a lover to make a commitment is the theme of the ballad ""Give It Up For Love"", while a relationship comes to end due to excessive infidelity on ""High Time I Left You Baby"". Overall, ""The Second Adventure"" is a great yet overlooked album by Dynasty. Sadly, the group would never reach the level of success that their labelmates achieved- mostly because they gave away songs that became huge hits for their peers The Whispers and Shalamar. Despite not being recognized, ""The Second Adventure"" is a great album from beginning to end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJWBD9OIVYEDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JP2K#wasThisHelpful","RJWBD9OIVYEDU","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philadelphia native Jill Scott originally got her start on film soundtracks, of all places. In 1999, she either appeared by herself (See: ""Dreamer"" from the LL Cool J and Omar Epps film ""In Too Deep"") or alongside someone else (See: Her duet with Common ""8 Minutes To Sunrise"" from ""Wild Wild West"" or Fredro Starr's rewrite of the 1986 Cyndi Lauper hit ""True Colors""). When she did make an attempt to get noticed, she was sidetracked by a record company who wanted a more familiar name on a song she helped write- that said song being The Roots duet with Erykah Badu ""You Got Me"". By the turn of the millennium, Scott was lending her talents to other artists (Musiq Soulchild, Common) and was preparing for her chance in the limelight. She signed with the Michael Jordan owned smooth jazz label Hidden Beach Recordings, where she would release a trilogy of albums under the ""Words And Sounds"" set- 2000's ""Who Is Jill Scott"", 2004's ""Beautifully Human"" and her final recording for the label, ""The Real Thing"". When Scott made plans to leave Hidden Beach, it didn't go off without a hitch. The company still felt she owed them more albums despite the fact that she actually met her obligations. After the dust was settled, Scott moved to Warner Bros. Records for 2011's ""The Light Of The Sun"". Released shortly before Warner Bros. endured corporate shakeups, the album did fairly well- but wasn't as successful as her previous efforts. To give her a fresh start, Warner Bros. moved her to their sister label Atlantic Records to work out the kinks in their restructuring issues.Within that timeframe, she reunited with Andre Harris of the production duo Dre & Vidal, who produced the bulk of her debut. She envisioned an experimental double album, which became her fifth full length recording ""Woman"". While the subject matter was meant to show off the numerous sides of a woman, musically, the album plays out like a history lesson on R&B. The album goes from spoken word (like the Warryn Campbell produced intro ""Wild Cookie""), to the 60's inspiration with the taking care of business themed ""Run Run Run"" and a cover of Carl Hall's 1967 hit ""You Don't Know"". Stax and Hi Records are the primary influence for the sensual ballad ""Can't Wait"". Scott also goes contemporary with the production team Oak & Pop (Ginuwine, Elle Varner, Mayer Hawthorne) on the SBTRKT sampling ""Lighthouse"" as well as on the mellow ballad ""Cruisin'"". She gets blindsided by a lover's deception on the uptempo single ""Fool's Gold"", while delivering the ultimate kiss off on the footstomper ""Closure"", which was surprisingly produced by David Banner. She channels Aretha Franklin during her Leiber-Stoller years on the heart mending ""Back Together"" as well as the big band sound of ""Coming To You"". Lastly, she works with hip hop producer 9th Wonder on the BJ The Chicago Kid duet ""Beautiful Love"". ""Woman"" is a great album from industry veteran Jill Scott. With nearly 20 years under her belt, she continues on the path to make music on her own terms without any hint of trying to compromise. It's always interesting to see where she's going to go next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BOPTEKDFKYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010GJTXV6#wasThisHelpful","R38BOPTEKDFKYL","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The indie rock band modest Mouse has come a long way since their humble beginnings in a small town in Washington. The band- fronted by the eccentric Isaac Brock- got their start by releasing an EP in 1994. After that, they issued their 1996 formal debut ""This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About"". The following year saw the release of ""The Lonesome Crowded West"" which became their final recording on the Seattle based label Up Records. In 2000, they signed to major label Epic Records for the release of 'The Moon & Antarctica"". Although the project was critically acclaimed, it wasn't successful- save for one of the songs being used in a commercial for a Nissan vehicle. After the issue of another EP ""Everywhere And His Nasty Parlour Tricks"", Modest Mouse saw their greatest success with their 2004 effort ""Good News For people Who Love Bad News"". The album contained the huge hit singles ""Float On"" (which would later be sampled by Lupe Fiasco for his record company bashing ""The Show Goes On"") and the harsh look at death ""Ocean Breathes Salty"". In 2007 came ""We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank"" which yielded the singles ""Dashboard"" and ""Missed The Boat"". However, by that time, original drummer Jeremiah Green returned to play on the album as well as getting help from former member of The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. Another EP ""No One's First And You're Next"" was released before the band went into seclusion by the turn of the 2010's.Modest Mouse spent the next few years doing live shows and constantly recording. Before they could release a new record, the group dealt with changes once again. The first of which was having to make a new album without their longtime bassist Eric Judy (who has since been replaced by Russell Higbee). The second change was more of a corporate nature: Pop music executive L.A. Reid had just become the CEO of their label Epic Records during the recording of their new album ""Strangers To Ourselves"". The recording was produced by Issac Brock with help from Tucker Martine (who also produced Tift Merritt's albums ""See You On The Moon"" and ""Travelling Alone"". Musically, it's a surprisingly upbeat effort, but its lyrical content have an edge of dark humor- look no further than the danceable ""Pistol (A. Cunanan, Miami FL. 1996)"", which retraced the beginnings of serial killer Andrew Cunanan- the shooter who ended up killing fashion designer Gianni Versace. The album starts off with the title track ""Strangers To Ourselves"", while they mock the current generation of millennials on the first single ""Lampshades On Fire"". He sings about going on a search party to find his lost brother who turned up missing on ""Ansel"" and relaying the message of the burial of a lost package on the ballad ""S**t In Your Cut"". They tell a dark story of ghosts and larceny on ""The Tortoise And The Tourist"" and close the recording with the ballad ""Of Course We Know"". Modest Mouse delivered a great album with ""Strangers To Ourselves"". It took them nearly a decade to make it, and let's hope that it will not take almost another decade for a proper follow up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5YYXLKZ1G5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXRNC0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3E5YYXLKZ1G5Q","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"California native Tyrese Gibson made his debut on, of all places, a Coca-Cola commercial. Oddly enough, that advertisement was the same thing that got him a recording contract. He signed with RCA Records to release his 1998 self-titled debut ""Tyrese"". While sales were slow initially, by the beginning of 1999, he had two huge hits under his belt: ""Sweet Lady"" (which was composed by a then-unknown Johnta Austin) and ""Lately"", which has since been covered by Anita Baker. 2001 saw the release of his second effort ""2000 Watts"" as well as a starring role in John Singleton's film ""Baby Boy"". That role led to another starring role in the franchise ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", while he also released another recording ""I Wanna Go There"". Despite his singing chops, he became in demand as an actor- appearing in films such as the military drama ""Annapolis"", the remake of ""Flight Of The Phoenix"" and another John Singleton film ""Four Brothers"". By the time he released the 2006 double disc ""Alter Ego"", he lost his passion for music and swore that it would be his last album. However, that turned out to be untrue- as he was constantly bombarded with questions of recording another album. In 2011, he returned with the underrated ""Open Invitation"" followed by the long-talked about TGT album ""Three Kings"" with Tank and Ginuwine.Even though his comeback did respectable numbers, in the end Tyrese just lost the passion and desire to record. Taking a cue from Kanye West on the recording of ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"", he wanted to make a bold artistic statement. Ironically, his best album would also turn out to be his last album ""Black Rose"". He is joined with longtime producer Brandon ""B.A.M."" Alexander- who produced much of the album, as he previously did with ""Open Invitation"". Also along for the ride are Busta Rhymes protege Seige Monstracity (who produced the lamenting first single ""Dumb S**t""), Tim & Bob, Rockwilder, Eric Hudson and Warryn Campbell, who produced the Jennifer Hudson backing ""Shame"". He sticks to being committed despite detractions from naysayers on ""Picture Perfect"" and duets with Chrisette Michele on ""Don't Wanna Be Alone"". Tank contributes background vocals on the ballad ""Prior To You"", while dealing with an abrupt breakup on ""Without My Heart"". He throws in a few sensual ballads for good measure (See: ""When We Make Love"", ""Gonna Give You What You Need"" and ""Body Language"")  before teaming up with Brandy on the song ""The Rest Of Our Lives"". Lastly, he closes the recording with the song about dealing with relationship troubles ""I Still Do"". ""Black Rose"" is a great album from Tyrese. It shows that he put his heart and soul into this album- sadly, we may never get another one like this from him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NJ1A7EJPVOD9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZQUP38S#wasThisHelpful","R1NJ1A7EJPVOD9","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brooklyn rapper Skyzoo was once known as one of the emcees who lost to Jin on BET's 106 & Park segment ""Freestyle Fridays"". However, his loss turned out to be his gain, where he established a prolific recording career. After becoming an honorary member of the North Carolina collective the Justus League, he set out to record the 9th  Wonder duet album ""Cloud 9: The Three Day High"". That recording led to Skyzoo being signed to 9th's label Jamla via a joint venture with Buckshot's independent label Duck Down Music. 2009 saw the release of his formal debut ""The Salvation"". Despite the critical acclaim, Skyzoo felt that he wasn't becoming a priority at the fledgling Jamla Records. He sought out to rectify that situation by moving directly to Duck Down and establishing his own imprint The Faculty. In 2012, he issued his sophomore effort ""A Dream Deferred"", which was excutive produced by Illmind, with whom he previously collaborated with on 2010's ""Live From The Tape Deck"". After that recording, he issued two EP's ""Theo Vs. JJ: Dreams Vs. Reality"" and the Jay-Z tribute ""An Ode To Reasonable Doubt"". Skyzoo delivered yet another duet album: A collaboration with fellow Brooklyn rapper Torae as the duo Barrel Brothers. It became the formal debut from his Empire distributed label First Generation Rich.2015 saw the release of his new album ""Music For My Friends"", an album which Skyzoo calls his most personal to date. While most of his albums contained his usual lyrical based content, not much has been said about his upbringing or his inner circle, who introduced themselves during the interludes. The album is heavily littered with references to the HBO series ""The Wire"" (See: The struggling themed ""Ask Bodie For A Package""), but the storyline also plays out like a couple of Spike Lee films- notably ""Clockers"" and ""25th Hour"". He starts the recording off with ""All Day, Always"", which leads into the first single ""Suicide Doors"". On ""The Moments That Matter"", he speaks of getting to lead a better life, while getting assistance from Westside Gunn on the wealth themed ""Luxury"". He dabbles in street narratives on ""Everything's For Sale"" as well as on the Jadakiss featured ""See A Key"". The Roots frontman Black Thought and singer Bilal appear on the pensive ""Money Makes Us Happy"". ""Playing Favorites"" shows Skyzoo having a romantic side, while he desires a beautiful woman with great culinary skills on ""Women Who Can Cook"". He looks back on his upbringing and his friendship on ""The Experience"" while honoring the fallen on ""Things I Should've Told My Friends"". Overall, ""Music For My Friends"" is a great recording from Skyzoo. Though the album is his most reflective, in the end he remains consistent with his approach to making music on his own terms.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEEBB0R96BLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VM5HIC0#wasThisHelpful","RSEEBB0R96BLP","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Canadian singer Tamia got the public's attention by appearing on the first two singles from Quincy Jones' 1995 album, ""Q's Juke Joint"". Her formal debut came by way of a cover- the Rod Temperton penned ""You Put A Move On My Heart"", which was originally recorded two years prior by British singer Mica Paris on her third album ""Whisper A Prayer"". After appearing on a couple of songs from soundtracks, the released her 1998 self-titled debut, which yielded the hits ""Imagination"" and ""So Into You"". Despite having steady radio and video rotation, Tamia felt she wasn't given enough promotion by Quincy's label Qwest Records, so she moved over to Elektra for the release of her sophomore effort ""A Nu Day"". Things got off to a slow start with the release of the first single ""Can't Go For That"", but she more than made up for it with the release of her now-signature song ""Stranger In My House"". She then took an extended hiatus- and that's when things went haywire. She recorded an album's worth of material- only to have it shelved and start again. Not helping matters was her label was going through several internal changes. By the time she released her next album ""More"" in 2004, Elektra Entertainment was folded into Atlantic Records. Not one to let label issues stop her, she quickly rebounded with the independently released ""Between Friends"". A six year absence ensued prior to the release of 2012's ""Beautiful Surprise"".After 20 years in the music business, 40 year old Tamia is now back on a major label. This time, it's Def Jam Recordings- an unusual place for someone like Tamia- whose material tends to lean on the ballad heavy side of music. On her new effort, she works with a few familiar names form her past, a couple of newcomers and a few big names, but they don't stray too far from what she's known for. She gets production help form the likes of Warren ""Oak"" Felder and Andrew ""Pop"" Wansel (Ginuwine, Elle Varner, Mayer Hawthorne), Lil' Ronnie, Chuck Harmony, Tricky Stewart, Polow Da Don and her longtime producer Shep Crawford. On ""Love Life"", she sounds rejuvenated and inspired- and it's reflected in the overall mood of the recording. She starts the album off with the Minneapolis inspired ballad ""Love Falls Over Me"", while leading into another ballad- ""Chaise Lounge"", where she expresses her sensual side after missing someone. She goes for sultry on the funky first single ""Sandwich And A Soda"", while The Dream lends his pen to the uptempo ""Nowhere"" as well as the melodic ""Special"". Polow Da Don writes and produces the ballad ""Stuck With Me"", while Tamia aims for pop stardom with the piano driven ""Day One"". In the past, Tamia and Shep Crawford have tackled cover songs with great precision: DeBarge's ""Love Me In A Special Way"", The Winans' ""Tomorrow"" and Aretha Franklin's ""Day Dreaming"". This time around, they take on the 1983 Deniece Williams inspirational ballad ""Black Butterfly"". ""Love Life"" is a great recording from veteran singer Tamia. Though she's always had great material, this is the first album she's done where she sounds like she had a lot of fun doing it. Given Def Jam's long track record with their R&B acts, one has to wonder if she will get the recognition that she deserves. The only way is to wait and see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XZNNXU4O0V9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGEA5G2#wasThisHelpful","R2XZNNXU4O0V9X","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brooklyn, New York native Evelyn ""Evie"" Sands had one of the most heartbreaking stories in the music industry. As talented as she was with her voice and songwriting duties, she couldn't catch a break. When she was about to, other artists became famous from songs that originated with her. She was the protégé of Atlantic staff writers/producers Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller. She recorded one of their songs ""Take Me For A Little While"", but her song made it into the offices of Chess Records- where singer Jackie Ross had a hit with the song. A couple of years later, another song she recorded ""I Can't Let Go"" became a hit for The Hollies. Shortly after, she recorded the song ""Angel Of The Morning"", but the label folded by the time the single was released (The song later became a signature song for country singer Juice Newton in 1981). In 1970, she moved to A&M Records for the release of the album ""Any Way That You Want Me"" and endured a shelved album for Buddah Records in 1971. She then decided to go on hiatus to focus on being a songwriter. She revived her career after a five year period of dormancy to record for Capitol subsidiary Haven Records.In 1975, she released her album ""Estate Of Mind""- which was produced by Dennis Lambert & Brian Potter (The Four Tops, Tavares, Glen Campbell)- who also wrote a few tracks as well. Though her desire for success was dwarfed by label issues, Evie certainly didn't make it any easier with her music- which was, admittedly, difficult to categorize. She moved through rock and roll, jazz, rhythm and blues and pop as if it were second nature. She starts off the album with the hard rocker about  the woes of an ultra-busy girlfriend ""A Woman's Work Is Never Done"". She sings about midday sex on the ballad ""Love In The Afternoon"", while thanking a reformed bad boy on ""You Brought The Woman Out Of Me"". She desires romance on ""One Thing On My Mind"" (Which would later be covered by The Ebonys, Linda Clifford and Phyllis Hyman while also being sampled on ""We Rollin'"" from Tanya Morgan's 2011 album ""You & What Army""). She thinks thoughts of inspiration on ""Early Morning Sunshine"" and wonders if there's second chance with an ex on the closer ""(Am I) Crazy 'Cause I Believe"". As great as ""Estate Of Mind"" is, the album barely gained any traction. She recorded one more album for RCA and decided to call it quits by the time ""Suspended Animation"" was released in 1979. Sands is an unsung hero of the 70's blue-eyed soul movement and her album deserves an honest listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSB2UG01IFQU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UJOTHI#wasThisHelpful","R2VSB2UG01IFQU","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"West Coast rapper Xzibit made his initial debut on 1995 albums from King Tee and Tha Alkaholiks. He appeared on the former's lone album for MCA Records ""King Tee IV Life"" on the song ""Free Style Ghetto"" and the latter's sophomore effort ""Coast II Coast""'s album track ""Hit & Run"". It was only a matter of time before the emcee released his formal debut and he did just that with 1996's critically acclaimed ""At The Speed Of Life"". He followed it up with the noticeably commercial ""40 Dayz & 40 Nightz"" with the creative music video for the first single ""What U See Is What U Get"". 1999 saw him make high profile appearances on Dr. Dre's ""2001"" as well as Snoop Dogg's comeback album ""No Limit Top Dogg"". As such, it led to Dr. Dre executive producing two of his albums- his multi-platinum ""Restless"" and 2002's ""Man Vs. Machine"". Despite the success, his career took a hit when Dr. Dre left and his longtime label Loud Records was folded into its parent company Columbia Records. The end result was the wonderful but poorly promoted ""Weapons Of Mass Destruction"". In the interim, he starred on the hit MTV series ""Pimp My Ride"" and done numerous acting gigs here and there.After releasing 2006's ""Full Circle"", Xzibit quietly disappeared from the music scene and made random appearances in films. It was thought among fans that he decided to leave music alone. However, in 2012, he released his album ""Napalm"" on his own label Open Bar Entertainment. ""Napalm"" contains production from the likes of M-Phazes, Illmind, Focus..., Rick Rock and even Dr. Dre. Some of the songs have a feel good vibe, such as ""Everything"", The Game and RBX assisted ""Dos Equis"" and ""Enjoy The Night"". However, the tracks that really stand out are the ones where Xzibit gets open and honest in details about his personal life. On ""1983"", he gets candid about his stint on MTV, his current relationship with his family and his fallout with Eminem and his manager Paul Rosenberg. He recalls his early life and career with Slim The Mobster on the inspirational ""Stand Tall"" and perseveres through struggle on ""Spread It Out"". On ""Meaning Of Life"", he celebrates living life with vocals from wounded Retired Staff Sergeant Shilo Harris. ""Napalm"" is a surprisingly great album form Xzibit.

"Jazz and R&B have a long history of co-existing- much to the chagrin of music purists. Back in the 1970's, the jazz and R&B worlds would collide to form jazz fusion. Also, very notable jazz musicians became famous after their transitions into the R&B world. The list reads rather long, as the artists involved were Roy Ayers, Norman Connors, Ronnie Laws, Patrice Rushen, George Duke and George Benson, among others. By the turn of the 1980's, jazz and R&B would align again- this time under the subgenre smooth jazz. At times polarizing, it spawned the likes of Kenny G, Jeff Lorber and Pieces Of A Dream. At the turn of the century, there were blatant forays into R&B from jazz musicians Roy Hargrove and later, Robert Glasper. Joining this list is Lil' John Roberts- a drummer with 20 years of performing under his belt. Initially starting as a musician on Janet Jackson's ""janet."" tour, the Philadelphia native turned Atlanta transplant has been affiliated with some known and respected musicians in the music world. He later appeared as a musician on television shows such as ""American Idol"" and ""Saturday Night Live"". After going on tour with singer Ne-Yo, Roberts began recording his debut. He then signed to the neo-soul label Purpose Music Group- a record company best known for their signings of Bilal, Algebra Blessett and Anthony David.  A year's worth of work was created to form what became his debut album ""The Heartbeat"".The album is a star-studded affair, with some fellow musicians (Chris ""Daddy"" Dave, Pino Palladino, and James Poyser, among others). With the plethora of guests ranging from hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock and jazz, the records reads like a neo-soul version of Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". Starting off the album is the song ""Space"", which features vocals from Eric Roberson, Anthony David, Mint Condition's Stokley Williams and Musiq Soulchild. Musiq appears again- this time alongside singer Chantae Cann on the ballad ""It's Your Time"". Former Prince protege Ashley Tamar Davis appears on the Minneapolis influenced ""Gimme Sumthin'"". Byron Sowell appears on the rock infused ""Grand Scheme"", while George Duke makes one of his final appearances on ""In A Duke Kinda Way"", before his passing during the recording of the album. Rappers Kev Choice and Sa-Roc guest on two songs- the former on the inspirational ""The Struggle"" and the latter on ""Get Right"". Trumpeter Nicholas Payton on the funky instrumental ""The Power"", while smooth jazz saxophonist Walter Beasley shows up for ""Forgiveness"". Despite the abundance of original material, ironically the album's best track is a cover. In this case, it's the take on Leroy Hutson's 1978 song ""Closer To The Source"" with lead vocals from former Tease member and songwriter Kipper Jones. Lil' John Roberts' ""The Heartbeat"" is a great recording that plays to its strengths. Although the album is all over the place musically, it shows Roberts' extraordinary musicianship level and skill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXAZ30CSYS0QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0NAPTI#wasThisHelpful","RXAZ30CSYS0QC","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maryland native Logic grew up in a turbulent household as a young child. Due to the nature of his upbringing, he sought solace in hip hop and formed a crew called the Ratt Pack. After initially going by the name Psychological, he soon shortened it to Logic before releasing his first mixtape ""Young, Broke And Infamous"". Shortly after the mixtape, he was sought after and signed by the independent label Visionary Music Group. After the succesful mixtape triolgy ""Young Sinatra"" (""Young Sinatra"", ""Undeniable"" and ""Welcome To Forever""), he recieved press from the likes of Billboard and XXL- with the latter putting him on the cover for their annual ""Top Ten Freshemen List"". A few months after the cover, he was signed to Def Jam Recordings by producer/A&R executive No I.D. (Best known for his work with Common, Jay-Z and Kanye West).  Since recording the album for nearly a year, Logic finally released his major label debut ""Under Pressure"" at the end of October 2014.What's noticeable about ""Under Pressure"" is the huge influence that rappers like Drake and Kendrick Lamar had over the album- despite Logic's allegiances to groups like OutKast and A Tribe Called Quest  (The skits between his songs are an obvious tribute to Tribe's 1993 album ""Midnight Marauders""). The Drake and Kendrick Lamar comparisons are inevitable, but what sets Logic apart from them is the instrospection and candor in his songs- a theme that's fairly constant in the recording. Logic and his longtime producer 6ix handle the bulk of the album, with additional production from Strange Fruit Project's Symbolyc One, Austrailian beatmaker M-Phazes and DJ Khalil. He expresses thoughts on his career on ""Intro"", ""Never Enough"" and ""Metropolis"", while speaking on his difficult upbringing on ""Soul Food"". He celebrates his current position in life on ""I'm Gone"" and records the third installment of the maturity themed ""Growing Pains"". He has conflicting emotions toward smoking on ""Nikki"" and speaks from his own point of view as well as his parents on the nine minute title track ""Under Pressure"". Lastly, he traces his start from humble beginnings to getting a recording contract on ""Till The End"". ""Under Pressure"" is a great album from newcomer Logic. Despite the criticisms toward him, he crafted a well-produced and introspective freshman effort. The question that now remains is will Def Jam get behind him? There's only one way to find out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V38WPIW6YK6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NW2ZQ66#wasThisHelpful","R1V38WPIW6YK6H","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Oakland, California quartet Souls Of Mischief's origins started in elementary school. As two of the founding members entered into high school, they acquired two additional members and ran into Del Tha Funkee Homosapien. He founded the collective the Hierogylphics while still being under the guidance of his cousin Ice Cube. When Del decided to record his sophomore album ""No Need For Alarm"" with a different sound, the album introduced the group- as well as planting the seeds for the West Coast underground rap scene. The group obtained a deal with Jive Records to release their debut. While it started slow with the first single ""That's When Ya Lost"", it was the title track ""'93 Til Infinity"" that put the group on the map. As a result, it made their follow-up become highly anticipated. Unfortunately, a couple of setbacks threatened to derail their path to success. An on-air battle with Hobo Junction member Saafir proved embarrassing for them and sample clearances caused their second album to be pushed back repeatedly. In 1995, they finally released ""No Man's Land"" and due to the poor reception, they were dropped from Jive. In 1998, they went independent and recorded three albums as part of the Hieroglyphics. They recorded a couple more albums- including 2009's Prince Paul produced ""Montezuma's Revenge""- before laying low for the remainder of the 2010's.In 2014, they got a call from producer Adrian Younge to record a new album. As such, they worked with him on the live instrument and sample-free concept album ""There Is Only Now"". Nararrated by their onetime labelmate Ali Shaheed Muhammad, the album is set in the past in 1994- several months after the release of ""93 Til Infinity"". The group deals with a kidnapping which later turns into a revenge tale. The album starts off with ""Time Stopped"", where they deal with the unexpected kidnapping. Busta Rhymes appears solo as the protagonist on the brief ""Womack's Lament"", while they search for member Tajai on ""Panic Stuck"". William Hart of The 70's group The Delfonics guest on ""Another Part Of You"" and Snoop Dogg makes an unlikely appearance on the title track ""There Is Only Now"".  On the song ""All You Got Is Your Word"", they take to task to other emcees who plagiarize their work. They detail an unfortunate encounter with a woman on ""Miriam's Got A Mickey"" and seek the need for a savior on ""Ghetto Superhero"". However, the album takes a rather dark turn with ""Narrow Escape"" and ""Finally Back"", where the members exact revenge on the kidnapper. Overall, ""There Is Only Now"" is a good album from the Souls Of Mischief. Adrian Younge's production may be an acquired taste, but works well with the film noir vibe of the recording. It's not as great as it should have been, but it's still a worthwhile effort from the West Coast underground hip hop veterans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NJOZT6QUGK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLPXLJ6#wasThisHelpful","R30NJOZT6QUGK7","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The R&B group Tease was a Los Angeles based band that contained some very notable members. The most memorable are the lead singer Kevin ""Kipper"" Jones and keyboard players Chuckii Booker and Rex Salas (The latter known for producing Vanessa Williams' hit single ""The Right Stuff"") and former bassist for Patrice Rushen Cornelius Mims. Originally signed to RCA Records, they released their first self-titled debut in 1983. Their debut had appearances from Ray Parker, Jr. and Gene Page and production from Ollie E. Brown (best known for his work with Parker's former group Raydio). Although the album tanked, they found a fan in former Capitol Records executive Larkin Arnold- who took the band over to Epic Records to record a follow up. In 1986, they recorded and released their sophomore effort (which was also self-titled) and featured production from Lakeside member Stephen Shockley. Musically and lyrically, their second recording is stronger than its predecessor.Even though they had been tagged as clones of The Time, a few songs on their second album don't exactly help their case. The most obvious examples are the songs ""The Note"", ""Total Control"" and ""Better Wild (Than Mild)""- the latter Booker would reference on the title track to his sophomore album ""Niice & Wiild"". The best known song from the album- the single ""Firestarter"" could have easily been a Lakeside song, as it was penned by Shockley. They do a passable cover of James Brown's 1976 song ""Body Heat"". Aside from Shockley, another Solar Records connection comes by way of The Deele member Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds penning the ballad ""Soft Music"". Lastly, on ""Baby Be Mine"", the band interpolate the song ""Nobody's Gonna Get This Lovin' But You"" by their then-labelmates Krystol. The band would record one more album before calling it quits in 1989. Since then, Chuckii Booker released two albums on Atlantic Records, wrote and produced for the likes of Troop, Lalah Hathaway and Angela Winbush and became and in-demand musical director. Brothers Thomas and Derek Organ followed suit with Booker to assist with various projects. Finally, Kipper Jones released one album for Virgin Records and wrote songs for Vanessa Williams and Brandy- the latter of which he penned the hit songs, ""Baby"", ""I Wanna Be Down"" and ""Brokenhearted"". Despite being fairly derivative in their work, Tease's album is actually a good listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RKF9IBJQI7FQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000091K53#wasThisHelpful","R3RKF9IBJQI7FQ","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Singer Dave Hollister made his initial debut in 1991 as part of the Digital Underground spinoff group Force One Network. They recorded the song ""Spirit (Does Anybody Care)"" for the soundtrack of the John Singleton film ""Boyz N The Hood"". An album followed called ""The MME Program 1"", but Hollister's best known stuff came from his work outside of the group. He was featured on two songs by 2Pac- 1991's ""Brenda's Got A Baby"" and 1993's ""Keep Ya Head Up"". Although his previous group failed to gain any traction, he was summoned by Teddy Riley to join Blackstreet after the abrupt departure of original member Joseph Stonestreet. He appeared on their 1994 debut, while also writing and/or producing songs for the likes of Usher and Hi-Five member Tony Thompson and even contributing background vocals to Bruce Hornsby's album ""Hot House"". After leaving Blackstreet, Hollister linked up with Erick Sermon's Def Squad Records and ""Ghetto Hymns"" was originally slated for an early 1997 release. Plans were thwarted when Def Squad's distributor EMI Records was folded. He moved to DreamWorks for the formal release of ""Ghetto Hymns"" and his biggest album to date- ""Chicago '85...The Movie"". An ill-fated alliance with Motown came about for 2002's ""Things In The Game Done Changed"", while moving back to DreamWorks the following year for ""Real Talk"".A series of personal issues forced Hollister into finding solace with his Christian faith and he surprised everyone by recording two gospel albums for Verity Records. He also teamed up with neo-soul singer Eric Roberson and gospel singers Fred Hammond and Brian Courtney Wilson as part of the supergroup United Tenors. After appearing on the title track to Roberson's recent recording ""The Box"", Hollister announced his return to R&B with 2014's ""Chicago Winds...The Saga Continues"". A sequel of sorts to his classic sophomore effort, he decides to pick up where he left off and show off a personal and professional growth. Joining him for the album is producer Warryn Campbell (Mary Mary, Musiq Soulchild, Kelly Price, Dru Hill), who produces the entire record. Starting the album off is the commitment themed ""Spend The Night"", which also has a remix courtesy of Hollister's onetime mentor Teddy Riley. On the ballad ""I'm Different"", he serenades a woman with the premise of offering her something different from what she's experienced romantically. He gives his girlfriend some space on ""I'm Waiting"" and lacks the courage to end a relationship on the Tristan Wilds penned ""Cold"". Dave harbors no ill will toward an ex on ""Wish You Well"" and gets help from Jimmy Jam on piano and string arrangement on the ballad about balancing a music career with parenting ""Chicago Winds"". Two songs contain a direct influence from the Minneapolis sound: The ballad ""Afraid To Lose"" and the uptempo ""Neverland"". Overall, Dave Hollister's ""Chicago Winds...The Saga Continues"" is a good listen from the Illinois veteran. While it isn't as memorable as his earlier work, it's still a decent effort.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VZVM7O49P2XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CP4S0OM#wasThisHelpful","R1VZVM7O49P2XP","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Akron, Ohio duo The Black Keys had several albums under their belt by the time they broke through in 2010. The duo- comprised of drummer Patrick Carney and lead singer/guitarist Dan Auerbach first met and young children in the same neighborhood. Both would later grow up and attend the same college before dropping out to seriously pursue music. After several years of honing their craft, they recorded a demo which lead to recording their 2002 debut ""The Big Come Up"" for a small label. Though it was a modest seller, the band quickly attracted the attention of blues label Fat Possum Records. From that deal, they completed their sophomore effort ""Thickfreakness"". After releasing two EP's, they released two more albums: ""Rubber Factory"" and a Junior Kimbrough covers EP. They signed with Elektra subsidiary Nonesuch Records and issued 2006's ""Magic Potion"" and their first recording with producer Danger Mouse ""Attack And Release"". After a couple of side projects (Carney's band Danger and Auerbach's solo album ""Keep It Hid""), they returned with the project ""Blackroc""- a recording which had the duo record songs with their favorite hip hop artists.Later on, they released their breakthrough recording ""Brothers""- followed up a year later by 2011's ""El Camino"". Auerbach then lent his production talents to other acts- notably dong three songs on Grace Potter & The Nocturnals 2011 album ""The Lion, The Beast, The Beat"" and Lana Del Rey's sophomore record ""Ultraviolence"". They returned in 2014 with ""Turn Blue""- their fifth album with Nonesuch and their fourth recording with Danger Mouse. Musically, the band moves away from the blues-rock that everyone knows them for and attempts a more experimental sound in the vein of psychedelic rock. Lyrically, the album is a breakup album- spurned by Auerbach's divorce from his wife The album starts off with the nearly seven minute track ""Weight Of Love"", followed up with their trademark sound on ""In Time"". The first single ""Fever"" takes cues from 60's British Invasion, while ""Year In Review"" chronicles the demise of a relationship. Auerbach blames himself for the outcome on ""Bullet In The Brain"", while the ballad ""Waiting On Words"" works in the riff of Kool & The Gang's often-sampled album track ""You Don't Have To Change"". ""10 Lovers"" bears a noticeable commercial sound, and the album closes with the uptempo ""Gotta Get Away"". Overall, The Black Keys made a listenable effort with ""Turn Blue"". The change in sound may be an acquired taste for some, but no one could accuse them of staying inside their comfort zone. It's not for everyone, but it's an entertaining listen nonetheless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K22UO5GF82TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7UL8QY#wasThisHelpful","R1K22UO5GF82TU","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prince enjoyed a very successful run at Warner Bros. Records for the first fifteen years of his career. His contributions to the label hadn't went unnoticed and as such, they rewarded him a lucrative multi-million dollar contract. However, shortly after the deal, Prince's attitude towards the label shifted from enthusiastic to disdain as he felt they tried to stifle his creativity. To make matters worse, he also found out that he didn't own the rights to his name. He later changed his name to a symbol and released several albums within a short amount of time to get out of his contract with Warner Bros. In 1996, he was free from contractual obligation with Warner Bros. Records, but he was still bound to their publishing company. Still using the symbol moniker, he signed with EMI Records to release the three album set ""Emancipation"". His tenure with the label would be short-lived, as EMI folded a few months after the album's release. A few years later, he signed with Arista Records after meeting with its founder Clive Davis. His time there would be short as well, as Davis was replaced by L.A. Reid- who suggested that Prince outsource songwriting and production duties from other producers. By the 2000's, Prince decided to go independent.The independent phase didn't last long, as he found himself back on a major label- starting with Columbia (for 2004's ""Musicology"" and 2007's ""Planet Earth"") and later, Universal (for 2006's ""3121""). After another independent release issued solely through Target (2009's ""Lotusflower""), Prince surprised everyone with the news that he was going to sign with Warner Bros. again. In 2014, he released his newest recording- the funk based project ""Art Official Age"". The album has one foot in the present, while the other foot is mired in the past- recalling songs that wouldn't sound out of place on ""Controversy"", ""Purple Rain"", or even ""Sign O' The Times"". On the opening track ""Art Official Cage"", he expresses his attitude towards the future, and deals with heartbreak on the pensive ballad ""Breakdown"". He hands in a throwback track ""The Gold Standard"", while issuing sexual come-ons on ""Breakfast Can Wait"". On the ballad ""This Could Be Us"", he taunts a woman who's scared of commitment. He duets with his all-female band 3rd Eye Girl on ""What It Feels Like"" as well as the song ""Funknroll"". Lastly, he reflects on his life and looks toward the future on the poignant ""Way Back Home"". ""Art Official Age"" is a great album from Prince. After 35 years in the music business, he still makes great music without compromising his integrity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XNSJGS7R827/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0YIQFE#wasThisHelpful","R23XNSJGS7R827","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bronx rapper and producer Diamond D. originally got his start in the group Ultimate Force in the late 1980's. The group would disband after their debut album was shelved by MCA Records- which led him to start the role as a producer. He then started a collective- Diggin' In The Crates, or D.I.T.C.- which also included Showbiz & A.G., O.C., Buckwild, Big L and a pre-Terror Squad Fat Joe. In the Fall of 1992, released his classic debut ""Stunts, Blunts & Hip Hop""- an album that was anchored by the singles ""Best Kept Secret"" and ""Sally Got A One Track Mind"". In between albums, he continued to produce songs for the likes of Illegal, Busta Rhymes, Tha Alkaholiks and the song from the ""Panther"" motion picture, ""Freedom""- which he produced with Dallas Austin. By the time he issued his sophomore set ""Hatred, Passions And Infidelity"", he was five years removed from his debut. He had a very lengthy battle with his former label- the Stock Aitken Waterman owned Chemistry Records- which delayed the album. When it was released during hip hop's materialistic stage, it was barely noticed, and the Universal-PolyGram merger that was right around the corner didn't help matters either. In the 2000's, he released three albums independently- a mixtape and his long-shelved debut with his former group the Ultimate Force. In 2011, he surprised everyone by producing the song ""Shine"" on Pharoahe Monch's album ""W.A.R. (We Are Renegades)"". That gave Diamond D. the sign to proceed with a new album and he did just that by releasing ""The Diam Piece"" in late 2014.Unlike most of his recordings where he did the majority of the rapping, he decided to focus on production while letting the guests takeover and delivering the occasional verse and chorus here and there. He reunites with a couple of old friends (such as Fat Joe and A.G.), fellow producers (Pete Rock, Nottz) and works with newer artists that he admires. Starting off the album is the Pharoahe Monch featured ""Rap Life"" while Talib Kweli, Elzhi and Skyzoo question loyalty over a sample of Yes' song ""Starship Trooper"" on ""Where's The Love"". Fat Joe, Freddie Foxx and former child rapper Chi-Ali trades verses on the rock inspired ""It's Nothin'"", and Pete Rock lends his voice to the track ""Only Way 2 Go"". The Pharcyde guests on ""Hard Days"", as Black Rob delivers a club ready song in the form of ""Take 'Em Off Da Map"". Female rappers Rapsody, Boog Brown and Stacy Epps trade verses on ""Pump Ya Brakes"", as West Coast emcees Kurupt and The Alkaholiks team up for ""We Are The People Of The World"". Dilated Peoples member Evidence and producer The Alchemist appear on the brief ""It's Magic"", and the former Biz Markie protégé Grand Daddy I.U. shows that he still has it on ""The Game"". Diamond D. teams up with Masta Ace on ""Ace Of Diamonds"" and closes the album with the only song he didn't produce, the DJ Scratch helmed ""Superman"". ""The Diam Piece"" is a great album from Diamond D. He shows that he is still capable of doing what he does best and staying true to his art for almost 25 years- not many in the industry can lay claim to that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWMA2QRK0WP9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZ3VKRW#wasThisHelpful","RWMA2QRK0WP9Y","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most artists who've had a bad experience with a record label would either quit or immerse themselves in working behind the scenes. The same cannot be said for New Jersey singer-songwriter and occasional producer Eric Roberson. When Warner Bros. Records shelved what would have been his debut album 20 years earlier, Eric became a man about town in the music industry. His songwriting work landed him on albums by 112, Musiq Soulchild and the soundtrack to the 1999 Will Smith film ""Wild Wild West"", where Roberson's songs dominated roughly half of the album. After finishing college with a degree in business management, Eric and his father established the independent label Blue Erro Soul. It would be there where he would release the bulk of his most of his studio albums. Despite being on an indie, Eric managed to build a cult following and have a few of his songs receive radio spins- with his biggest hit being the Lalah Hathaway duet about infidelity ""Dealing"". A decade after resuming his recording career, he entered into a distribution deal with E1 Music for the release of ""Mister Nice Guy"". While the company meant well, E1 Music released a summer single ""Summertime Anthem"" in the middle of fall and the should-have-been first single ""Picture Perfect"" was inexpliciably released as the second single.After that fiasco, Eric Roberson parted ways with E1 Music. In the interim, he teamed up with R&B singer Dave Hollister and gospel singers Fred Hammond and Brian Courtney Wilson for the one-off gospel supergroup United Tenors. Eric soon found distribution again- this time around with the Columbia, Maryland based label Liaison Records. In 2014, he celebrated his two decades in the music business with ""The Box""- a new album that finds Eric focused mostly on live instrumentation. Production for most of the songs on ""The Box"" were handled by the team of Aaron Hardin & Slimkat 78 (The same producers behind the aforementioned song ""Picture Perfect""). He also works with longtime producer Brett Baker on a few songs as well. Starting the album off is ""Lust For Love"" featuring a rare appearance from rapper turned entertainment attorney Tracey Lee. He works with Dave Hollister on the title track ""The Box"", while working with the indie soul trio KING on ""Just Imagine"". He tries to fall in love despite having reservations on the bayou blues feel of ""Pill"". Pharoahe Monch makes a rare guest appearance on an R&B album on ""The Cycle"", where Eric tales the story of a woman and her neverending series of bad relationships. Lastly, he duets with his father on the ballad about commitment ""Do The Same For Me"". ""The Box"" is yet another great album from Eric Roberson. It's pretty much what one would expect from him, while giving the fans something new as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJGGQUEG7RSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM0H3YS#wasThisHelpful","R3EJGGQUEG7RSD","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Singer-songwriter Bill Champlin got his start with the band Sons Of Champlin. The band recorded three albums for Capitol Records- beginning with 1969's ""Loosen Up Naturally"", ""The Sons"" and ""Follow Your Heart"". The band broke up the first time and reformed in time for 1973's ""Welcome To The Dance""- their lone recording for Columbia Records. Three more albums followed until they decided to call it quits for good in 1977. Now 30 years old, Champlin became the go-to guy for session work after moving to Los Angeles in that same year. He released his debut album ""Single"" in 1978 on Epic Records. While Epic meant well, they didn't know what to do with a musician who genre-hopped like it was second nature. He would experience the same obstacle at Elektra Records- where he would release his sophomore effort ""Runaway"". His second album- much like his debut- was produced by David Foster, who also worked with Champlin as a songwriter and would eventually include him in the band Chicago.Much like his previous efforts, Bill rolls through genres like it's nothing. He goes on to take on West Coast AOR, hard rock, pop ballads and also R&B. Even though R&B seems like an out of place genre for Champlin, consider that this is the same guy who co-wrote ""After The Love Has Gone"" for Earth, Wind & Fire, ""Turn Your Love Around"" for George Benson and ""Stay With Me"" for Cherrelle. He opens the album with the title track ""Runaway"", where he sings of a small town kid with big city dreams of being a musician. He focuses his attention elsewhere after being left behind on ""One Way Ticket"", while getting songwriting help from songwriter turned actor Alan Thicke on the ballad ""Sara"". He hopes for a second chance with someone on ""Tonight Tonight"" and collaborates with Kenny Loggins on the radio friendly ""Take It Uptown"". Bill gets annoyed by his new neighbors on the amusing ""Stop Knocking On My Door"" and pleads to fix things in the relationship on ""Gotta Get Back To Love"". Shortly after the release of ""Runaway"", Champlin was recruited for Chicago and sporadically resumed his recording career. Unfortunately, the Chicago affiliation didn't help his solo career much, but he became a popular act in Japan- mirroring the same fate that also happened to one of his peers around the same time, Texas native Eric Tagg. Even though ""Runaway"" is kind of hard to come by, it's not an album to pass up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2KLHJT1FZU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E4BELU#wasThisHelpful","R2H2KLHJT1FZU1","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Los Angeles native Leela James first came to the public's attention by way of Pete Rock's third album ""Soul Survivor II"". On that recording, she sang the uplifting and powerful ""No Tears"". She worked on her debut album for nearly a year before the label she was signed to folded. As a result, her contract would be picked up by Warner Bros. Records- where she would release her debut ""A Change Is Gonna Come"". With production from high profile names such as Chucky Thompson, Wyclef Jean and Kanye West, her record was critically acclaimed, but didn't gain much traction due to Warner Bros.' very late arrival to the neo-soul movement. As such, she would leave the label and go independent by signing with Shanachie Records for her sophomore effort- the all covers project ""Let's Do It Again"". Leela would give the major labels one last try after releasing her third album ""My Soul"" on the newly reactivated legendary soul label Stax Records. That recording also stalled and Leela once again went independent for the tribute album ""Loving You More... In The Spirit Of Etta James"".One reason for her lack of success has a lot to do with her voice. Even though she was around the same age as her contemporaries at the time Beyonce and Keyshia Cole, she has a voice that made her sound much older than she really was. Not helping matters was her music being relegated to the neo-soul market- even as she tried to make inroads into urban contemporary R&B. She went to rectify that situation by taking her destiny in her own hands. The first of which was creating her own label J&T Records- the second thing was making a more accessible album. She did just that in 2014 with the release of her new album ""Fall For You"". Almost gone is her gravelly voiced growl replaced by a high pitched wail and sultry come-ons. She works with a variety of contemporary producers, such as Drew Ramsey & Shannon Sanders (Anthony David, Heather Headley) on the opening track ""Who's Gonna Love You More"" and Tim & Bob (Bobby Valentino, Donell Jones, Brian McKnight) on the Al Green sampling ""Do Me Right"". She collaborates with singer Anthony Hamilton on ""Say That"" and seduces a lover on the Mike City produced ""Give It"". She demands to be let go from a bad relationship on ""Set Me Free"" and closes the album with ""Save Me"" featuring an appearance from newcomer Joe Ryan. Though the change in sound is surprising, in the end ""Fall For You"" is a great album from Leela James. This time around, she may find that mainstream success that has forever eluded her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCT0Q35PSAF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE3B9GC#wasThisHelpful","RMCT0Q35PSAF5","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By the time Durrell ""Tank"" Babbs signed to Atlantic Records in early 2010, he was a decade long veteran with a few albums under his belt. Formerly signed to Barry Hankerson's now-defunct Blackground Records, he released 2001's ""Force Of Nature"", followed up by 2002's ""One Man"" and almost quitting music before releasing 2007's ""Sex, Love & Pain"". While he has made strides in the recording industry, his name often went unmentioned with other R&B singer-songwriters- even while working behind the scenes. He addressed his frustration with the issue on the dark and moody mixtape ""Diary Of A Mad Man""- specifically on the song ""Underrated"", where he bemoaned the fact that he wasn't being recognized the same way as his peers. Part of the problem was that people paid more attention to his looks and physique than they did to his songwriting and production skills- for which he would lend to the likes of Toni Estes, Dave Hollister and Chris Brown. Another part was his dramatic about face change to sing more about sex than love when he moved to Atlantic. After the release of ""This Is How I Feel"", he teamed up with Tyrese and Ginuwine for the much talked about TGT album ""Three Kings"" in 2013. Despite the success of that union, he felt a little uninspired- that was until he listened to Justin Timberlake's return to music ""The 20/20 Experience"". That record lit a fire under Tank and the end result is his new album ""Stronger"".He decided to make an album that paid tribute to the dance music and electro-funk of yesteryear- complete with live instrumentation, a horn section and an orchestra. He also shifted his focus back to singing from the heart and writing great songs. With that formula, he went in and recorded ten songs- all of which showcases how much work he put into this project and the risk paid off for him. The leading song is the first single ""You're My Star"", which features a sample of The Jacksons' ""This Place Hotel"" as well as background vocals from Kelly Rowland. Wyclef Jean's production partner Jerry ""Wonda"" Duplessis handles the lion's share of the album- with the highlight of one of his contributions being the Chic-esque track ""Dance With Me"". Tank also pays tribute to both Marvin Gaye and Prince- the former on ""Missing You"" and the latter on ""Hope This Makes You Love Me"". He delivers a power ballad in the form of the title track ""Stronger"", which was produced by Infinity (The same guy behind Mary J. Blige's Grammy Award winning ""Take Me As I Am""). He closes the album with the torch song ""If That's What It Takes""- a jazz ballad that was surprisingly produced by Da Internz (Best known for Big Sean's ""Dance (A$$)"" and Rihanna's ""Birthday Cake""). ""Stronger"" is Tank's best album since ""Sex, Love & Pain"", and possibly his best album period. With him showing a lot of growth and maturity this time around, the question is will he stick to it? Only time will tell.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21EL6M2P4U44J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLF5I88#wasThisHelpful","R21EL6M2P4U44J","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"West Coast rapper Blu rode a wave of critical acclaim ever since he released ""Below The Heavens"" with producer Exile in 2007. After a few collaboration albums with the likes of Mainframe and Ta'Raach, Blu was offered a recording contract. The label that offered him a deal was Sire Records- one-time label home to Ice-T, whose last hip hop album that was released on the label was Donald D's underrated 1992 sophomore effort ""Let The Horns Blow"". With the go ahead to record his major label debut, the record company hoped he was recording something along the lines of ""Below The Heavens"". However, Blu clearly had other plans. He worked on the album that was called ""No York""- an experimental and ambitious body of work. Though Blu loved the album, Sire and its parent company Warner Bros. Records was repeatedly going through internal changes- which resulted in numerous delays. As a result, Blu left the label and decided to release the album for free over the internet. In 2012, he reunited with Exile again for their second set together, ""Give Me My Flowers While I Can Still Smell Them"". After releasing ""No York"" on physical product, he released his newest recording ""Good To Be Home"" at the end of spring in 2014.The recording was released as a double album produced solely by Bombay, whose lo-fi sound is noticeably similar to another West Coast producer, Madlib. Over the course of the 60 minute recording, Blu explores everyday life in Los Angeles, California, with guests who mostly hail from Cali- save for Mobb Deep member Prodigy on ""Red & Gold"". He opens the recording with the aptly-titled ""Home"" with vocals from independent soul singer Jimetta Rose. He details growing up in a gang infested neighborhood on ""The Return"" and collaborates with Fashawn and Pac Div on ""Boyz N The Hood"". Blu trades verses with Bombay on the song about having fun on ""Summer Time"". He gets help with MED and Oh No on ""Brown Sugar"" and duets with Thurz and Casey Veggies on their relationship troubles on ""Well Fare"". He has a seven minute posse cut ""Can't Stop, Won't Stop"" which features numerous people- including The Alchemist, Evidence, Planet Asia and Chace Infinte. Lastly, he closes the album with the instrumental ""The West (Part Two)"". ""Good To Be Home"" is a great album from Blu. Despite constant criticisms aimed toward his discography, he shows that he can make his best work when he's completely focused.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8FPFW7WCTT1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3LNW1A#wasThisHelpful","R8FPFW7WCTT1Q","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The California trio Dilated Peoples got off to a rocky start earlier in their career. Originally signed to Immortal/Epic Records, they were planning to release their debut in 1995- that is, until it got shelved by the label. They went to the indie label ABB Records and released a few 12 inch singles here and there, while group member Evidence produced one-third of Defari's 1998 debut ""Focused Daily"". They raised their profile by appearing on the Gold-selling Rawkus compilation ""Soundbombing II"". That appearance led to them being signed to Capitol Records where in 2000, they released their formal debut- the critically acclaimed ""The Platform"". 2001 saw the release of their sophomore effort ""Expansion Team"" and three years later, followed the somewhat commercial ""Neighborhood Watch"". In 2006, they released what became their final album for Capitol, ""20/20"". In 2007, Evidence released his solo debut ""The Weatherman LP"", while Rakaa released ""Crown Of Thorns"" a few years later. Within that time, the group's future was up in the air- even amongst the members themselves. Things started to change when Evidence signed with Rhymesayers to release ""Cats & Dogs"". Not only did the label sign him, but also the group- and so began the journey into their first album in nearly a decade, ""Directors Of Photography"".While most of Dilated Peoples' albums were helmed primarily by Evidence and The Alchemist, this time around their production contributions amount to very little. Evidence produces the title track, the Vince Staples assisted ""The Dark Room"" and two interludes, while The Alchemist oversees the Sick Jacken featured ""L.A. River Drive"" and the track recalling their formative years in their hometowns ""Cut My Teeth"". DJ Babu produces three songs: the bass heavy scratch track ""Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)"", ""The Reversal"" and Opinions May Vary"". On ""Directors Of Photography"", they reunite with DJ Premier on the first single ""Good As Gone"", while getting production help from D.I.T.C. member Diamond D. on the search for serenity ""Let Your Thoughts Fly Away"". Madlib's younger brother Oh No produces ""Century Of The Self"", with 9th Wonder overseeing the closing track ""The Bigger Picture"" featuring Strong Arm Steady member Krondon. Though most of the album is clearly geared towards the underground, the Aloe Blacc featured ""Show Me The Way"" sounds like it was meant to become a radio hit. ""Directors Of Photography"" is another great album from Dilated Peoples. They may been gone for eight years, but they haven't missed a step- and that's a good thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUG5CZ87MBN8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5J4RN6#wasThisHelpful","RUG5CZ87MBN8E","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After spending a decade behind the scenes as a songwriter and producer, Robin Thicke decided to forge ahead with a career as a recording artist. In 2003, he released his debut ""Cherry Blue Skies""- which was later retooled as ""A Beautiful World"". The album was critically acclaimed, but was way too eclectic for some people. He sought to change that with his sophomore effort ""The Evolution Of Robin Thicke"". His next album ""Something Else"" paid a clear tribute to 70's R&B and disco, while 2009's ""Sex Therapy"" had him testing the waters by working with hip hop artists and producers. 2011 saw the release of ""Love After War"", but the album didn't break any new ground for Robin. That would all change with 2013's ""Blurred Lines""- which, to date, has given him the biggest pop hit of his career. However, in a move similar to the film ""A Star Is Born""- albeit with gender roles reversed- his career was riding high while his marriage to actress Paula Patton was on the rocks. The couple eventually split- much to chagrin of Robin himself. Instead of following up with another pop driven album, he decided to pay tribute to his estranged wife- hence the title of his new album ""Paula"".While the theme of the album centers around lost love, sadness and regret, musically it sounds like a typical Robin Thicke album. In fact, one could say it's a continuation of ""Love After War"". Like most of his albums, Robin produced it with his longtime songwriting and production partner James ""Pro-Jay"" Gass. ""Paula"" is rife with genre hopping as it moves through bossa nova (""You're My Fantasy""), as well as adult contemporary (""Get Her Back"" and ""Still Madly Crazy""). On the songs ""Lock The Door"" and ""Black Tar Cloud"", his conscience eats at him for his past mistakes. He tries to find someone new on the James Brown inspired ""Livin' In New York City"" and realizes his estranged wife's personal freedom on ""Whatever I Want"". Robin remains optimistic on ""Love Can Grow Back"", while getting help from pop group Fifth Harmony on ""The Opposite Of Me"". While most of the album is great, there are a couple of songs that could have been left behind- specifically the jazz influenced songs. The tracks in question are ""Tippy Toes"", ""Something Bad"" and ""Time Of Your Life"". Though they aren't bad songs per se, they are better suited for pop-jazz crooners like Michael Buble. ""Paula"" is a good album from Robin Thicke. Though media hype and controversy put this album in a negative light for the pop fans, in the end this album was made strictly for the people who supported him for the duration of his career.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21AMSZSETYRKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTS9ZFY#wasThisHelpful","R21AMSZSETYRKP","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan seemed to be destined to become a star. Barely one year into college, she signed a recording contract with the Vancouver based label Nettwerk with distribution from Arista Records in the United States. She released her formal debut ""Touch"" in 1989, which was propelled by the first single ""Vox"". She traded in producer Greg Reely for Pierre Marchand for her next album- 1991's ""Solace""- and the pairing would prove to be a great move for her career. 1993 saw the release for her critically acclaimed album ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy""- which contained the first single ""Possession"", a song inspired by letters that a stalker wrote to McLachlan. In 1997, she broke through with her most successful recording to date- 1997's ""Surfacing"". The album yielded major pop hits such as ""Building A Mystery"", ""Sweet Surrender"" and ""Adia"" as well s the popular album track ""Angel"". After the success of that recording, she launched the all-female tour ""Lilith Fair"" and released the live album ""Mirrorball"". After laying low for several years, McLachlan returned in 2003 with ""Afterglow"" while Arista was going through corporate changes. She would disappear for several years until 2010, when she released what became her final record for Arista, ""Laws Of Illusion"".During her four year hiatus, she dealt with a few personal changes. The first of which was changing labels- she signed a contract with Verve Records after being with Arista for over 20 years. The second change was adjusting to life without her father, whom she lost last year. That loss became the inspiration behind her new album ""Shine On"". Most of her new recording was produced by her longtime producer Pierre Marchand- with the notable exception of a few songs. She works with producer Bob Rock (Bon Jovi, Metallica, Veruca Salt) on three songs- ""Flesh And Blood"", the pensive ""Love Behind Me"" and ""Turn The Lights Down Low"", which was co-written by former member of the Eagles Don Felder. Sarah teams up with Vincent Jones to produce the sensual ballad ""The Sound That Love Makes"", which was penned by Whitehorse member Luke Doucet. On the opening song ""In Your Shoes"", Sarah offers words of encouragement to a woman who cracks under the weight of negative criticism. ""Monsters"" shows Sarah taking an optimistic point of view on being in a bad relationship, while paying tribute to her dad on ""Song For My Father"". ""Shine On"" is a good album from Sarah McLachlan. While it's pretty much what one would expect from her, it seems as if she's in a better space despite the problems she's dealt with over the years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8M9L3417YTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4DA0G8#wasThisHelpful","R1A8M9L3417YTM","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though the music industry has been known as being youth oriented, there have been many who released their debut albums in their 30's. The long list of musicians include Roberta Flack, Sheryl Crow, Bill Withers, Macy Gray, Carrie Lucas and K.T. Oslin, to name a few. Joining that list is the Chester, Pennsylvania singer Denise White- known to many as Avery Sunshine. She spent her formative years in the background as a church musician, while performing on projects like the soundtrack to the Beyoncé Knowles and Cuba Gooding, Jr. film ""The Fighting Temptations"". She also lent her vocals to a house single that was only released in Japan, and was even hired as a musician for the stage plays ""Meet The Browns"" and ""Dreamgirls"". In 2010, she independently released her self-titled debut, which quickly made the rounds in the neo-soul circuit. The album was also a calling card for her to sign with a label, and she did just that by signing with Shanachie Records to release her sophomore effort ""The SunRoom"".Employing the tactic of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"", she produces most of the album with her longtime musical partner Dana Johnson with a little help from Incognito founder Jean-Paul ""Bluey"" Maunick. The 60's influenced ""Time To Shine"" was produced by Demien DeSandies, whose best known for his work with Carl Thomas. ""The SunRoom"" has a recurring theme of positivity and spirituality- as evidenced by the leading track, the Al Green influenced ""Won't You Try"". On the first single ""Call My Name"", she makes an effort to make things right in the relationship- as there is a lack of communication on both parties. She takes an optimistic approach to living life on ""One Foot Ahead"" as well as being in love on ""Nothing To Something"". On ""I Do Love You (You Ain't Got To Lie)"", Avery rides a bluesy rhythm while delivering a hilarious rant on an ill-behaved significant other. She stays true to her religious beliefs with the jazz influenced ""Meditation #1 (Conversation With God)"" as well as the album closer ""Safe In His Arms"". ""The SunRoom"" is a great album from Avery Sunshine. Despite being on an indie label, there's a good chance that you're going to hear a lot more from her- that is, if this project is any indication. Hopefully, that will be the case in the near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5MLFRB4R29L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWKOF4#wasThisHelpful","R3L5MLFRB4R29L","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For about fifteen years, Coldplay has become the band that everyone either wants to love- or wants to hate. After releasing two EP's (""Safety"" in 1998 and ""The Blue Room"" in 1999), they made their formal debut with 2000's ""Parachutes"". Just when one thought they couldn't outdo themselves, they released the now-classic follow-up ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"". In 2005, the members  Chris Martin, Will Champion, Jonny Buckland and Guy Berryman went back in the studio for their next recording- ""X & Y"". However, the album was panned and didn't do as well as its predecessors. They sought to rectify that situation by enlisting the production talents of Brian Eno (best known for his work with U2, David Bowie and the Talking Heads). As a result, they released what's considered their best album to date- 2008's ""Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends"". 2011 saw the release of their fifth recording ""Mylo Xyloto""- which became their final recording for Capitol Records. The reason being is by the following year, their parent company- The EMI Group- had been struggling for years after losing a few of their major acts (For example: Paul McCartney and Coldplay's primary influence, Radiohead). The recorded music division of EMI was sold to Universal Music Group, while EMI's British based Parlophone Records was sold to Warner Music Group. As a result of the corporate changes, Coldplay became the newest signees to Atlantic Records.Their first project under Atlantic is 2014's ""Ghost Stories""- an album that was clearly inspired by Martin's separation from his wife, actress Gwenyth Paltrow earlier in the year. The two met when Coldplay were touring behind ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"". When they separated in March, the status of their relationship became the concept behind ""Ghost Stories"". Coldplay produced the album with longtime collaborators Jon Hopkins and recording engineers/mixers Daniel Green and Rik Simpson. Also helping out on production is Paul Epworth- who is best known for his work with Adele, Foster The People, Cee-Lo Green and Florence And The Machine. ""Ghost Stories"" explores the various stages of feelings after a breakup- ranging from shock and surprise (As evidenced on the first track ""Always In My Head"") to acceptance (See: the closing track ""O"", which features additional vocals from Chris and Gwenyth's children Moses and Apple). Another theme running throughout the recording is the blatant influence of electronica on the material. Timbaland lends assistance on drums for the track ""True Love"", while onetime Rap-A-Lot staff producer turned Kanye West associate Mike Dean helps with the overall sound. On the single ""Magic"", Chris hopes for a possible reconciliation and insists he's interested in no one else. ""Ghost Stories"" is a good album from Coldplay. It's not as memorable or as moving as their earlier work, but it's an interesting listen from a band that continues to challenge themselves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNTABSJEEYOWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0H0YN2#wasThisHelpful","RNTABSJEEYOWI","A92F571Y9MTW6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A92F571Y9MTW6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Want to start off saying I am a huge fan of Mr. Maberry's. I read a lot of books, all genres, and the Joseph Ledger series by Mr. Maberry is an absolute favorite. I have the read the books more than once, and have them in audio as well.I decided to try his other series, and am making my way through them, but I just finished this trilogy and wanted to voice my opinion.I found the first book a little slow, but I realize now, it was only because the stories in the books take place over approximately a month, and I'm glad I was able to read one book after another. It was like reading one really long book, and each book built on the one before. By the third book, I was so invested in the characters and in the story, I could not put the book down. Mr. Maberry is a wonderful story teller.The setting of the town of course was another character, and if you like horror, or just plain creepiness, I think this trilogy is a must read.I did find a set of short stories on audible that also take place in Pine Deep, I am in the process of listening to them now. Kind of going slow, don't want them to end!If you have not read Mr. Maberry, do yourself a favor and read his books. This is the third trilogy of his I have read, cannot get enough.

"I knew before I even read this book, it would be great. I remember very fondly the first book in this series, and my passion for these books is still way up there.The author always uses the setting as another character, I think that is a big part of what first attracted me. The main character has grown so much through the books and it made for such a great read this time. I was really proud of him, which sounds kind of crazy, but with this series, you get to feel as if you know the character. Mike is a great character to know. It has been so much fun watching him come into his own.I have to admit, Mr. Dorion really got me this time. Twice I thought I had the mystery figured out, twice I was wrong.If you are not reading this series, I think it would fine to read this one now, however I know you will want to go back and start at the beginning. However, this book particularly reads as if it could be an enjoyable stand alone, there is enough background to build an interest, but the story really stands on it's own.

"I sat down to write this review, and I can honestly say, i have misgivings about this book. With that said, I can also honestly say, I really enjoyed it, read it quickly because I was caught up in it, and it really is a fun book.My main misgiving? I felt like the characters were a little shallow. I didn't feel as if I got to know them enough. I also felt like the author missed out on adding more humor to the book through the main character. Toward the end of the book, the humor was peeking through from inner dialogue that the main character was having, wish there was more of that.Still, I thought the premise of the story was great (I could see this being a great beginning to a TV show) and the action scenes were well written. Again,  I read it really fast because there was enough interest and excitement to keep me reading. Also loved the kids and the relationship the main character had with them, enjoyed the stay at home dad things. A couple of things happened that I could see coming, but also a couple of things that I didn't.If you like thrillers, I think you would enjoy this, and I would like to see the character again, if not a TV show in the book's future, a book series is another good possibility.***i just read on a review of this book at bookreporter.com that the rights to this book have been sold for a TV series. I was hoping for a sequel to the novel...not sure if that will happen or not, hoping the TV show will be good!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISCNZWE37NAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250041511#wasThisHelpful","R3ISCNZWE37NAD","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great read, a beginning to what I hope will be a long series.First of all, I really liked the character. There are still a lot of unaswered questions about the character's history, but I look forward to getting to know him.  I liked the premise, a little like a Jack Reacher, a person going where needed, doing what needs to be done, and yet not infallible.The character is an expert at finding people, which is how he makes his living. This story has him working with the FBI, and all the characters were intriguing, especially the villain of the story.I can't wait for the next installment , already ordered! Again, if you like thrillers, or police procedurals, or just plain old good storytelling, this is a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OOGOT9FVHT1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K5UOBSM#wasThisHelpful","R1OOGOT9FVHT1J","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Mr. Baldacci since his first book. I have enjoyed most of them,some more than others, but I have to say, this book is one of his best. Also I don't do reviews much for authors who will get lots of readers no matter what, and Mr. Baldacci is one of those authors. Still, I felt compelled to voice my opinion anyway.I loved this book. The premise struck me as so interesting! I put down what I was reading and started this yesterday. I could not put this book down. The character was an unusual hero, physically and other wise, which made the story so much more interesting. The murderer's motive was unusual to say the least, and although I guessed a couple of things, most of it I had to wait for things to unfold as I read the book.I highly recommend this book, just give yourself enough reading time after you start it, you won't be able to stop reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SDYTUKDRQ5XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N7TDP8K#wasThisHelpful","R3SDYTUKDRQ5XW","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I have given this book five stars but I did have one complaint. The good first....this series just gets better and better. I love these characters, and I really like how the writer has added character's personalities to the series. Even the newer character that has become part of the group adds so much to the stories. This particular book had me reading really fast, the action was pretty non stop and the reader was learning about the story along with the characters. The reader did not know why everyone wanted the ""searched""  for person until the characters did.Which brings me to my one complaint. I hated parts of the ending. I am not one to complain normally about an author ends his or her book, but this ending fell kind of flat to me. So before I wrote the review, trying to decide if this was a four or five star book. I decided not to take any stars off for the ending, I could not put the book down, that is a five star! I also loved the kind of keystone cop kind of atmosphere, everyone chasing after the same person, everyone getting in each other's way. Very fun!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12RGQPAQSJLGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=150874694X#wasThisHelpful","R12RGQPAQSJLGW","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a huge fan of Brian Haig since I was first introduced to his main character, Sean Drummond. Although I am one of those leftyLiberals that Sean seems to hate so much, I adore his character. Mr. Drummond always makes me laugh, the cases he works are always interesting, and in this book, I wasn't sure exactly who the murderer was. Which of course is the reason to read mysteries and books with lawyers.It has been a long time since the last Sean Drummond book, I thought the author had given up on the character.

"I have had this book on my Kindle for a while. Well, actually just the first couple of chapters that were downloaded as a sample. For some reason I decided to give it a try today, maybe to see if it would settle my excitement for the new Joe Pickett novel that is coming this month. Boy did it work.I started the book this morning, and I could not put it down. It was not a thriller that had me on the edge of my seat, rather a slow, character driven story, that enveloped me before I even realized it was happening. I got so involved with the Sheriff, his deputies, his family...I could not stop reading.I figured out who the bad guy was pretty quickly, but with more people involved that I didn't know, and the actual crime a question mark, I found the whole book a really satisfying read.There was one incident in the book that I am not sure why the author put it in, but to avoid spoilers, I won't mention it. Not sure if there is more to that incident or not for a later book. However, it did not take away my positive feeling for the book at all.I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

"I really do not like short stories or novellas. I prefer full length novels, and lately so many of my authors are publishing short stories and novellas for the characters in their series. I really wish though, if they want to do that, they would not make it a  must read for the character or story development. I kind of resent it actually...And to me, this book, if you like the series, is important to the character. If you pick up the next book in the series without reading this book, you have missed whole spot in this characters story.With that said, I did read it, loved the story, I love the main character, and I recommend this series to anyone a fan of urban fantasy or fantasy. It may appealing to even readers of police procedurals willing to involve themselves in an Atlanta, Ga after an event that changed everything we know...still learning about that world in this book and the next, which I have already started. If you have not read the first in this series, this book would be very confusing, but I would think would peak your interest enough to pick up the first in the series and then probably become hooked liked I am!***I know a writer has a right to write what he wants, I don't have to read it, but if I like a series and really don't want to read short stories with those same characters, I just wish the story was not important to the series, I don't want to miss anything****","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V2F1NPR8B84Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0095ZMQZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1V2F1NPR8B84Z","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Andrew Gross fan so I was thrilled when I saw this book on Amazon Vine, it meant I wouldn't have to wait for the release date!! With that said...The book started out really slow for me. I was not connecting with the characters at all. There was one character I really liked and he was out of the picture early! The timelines were so confusing I was actually going back through the pages. I thought I had missed something. As I was reading, I was sad, I was afraid I was heading to a bad review.Then about halfway through the book, the timelines came together, the stores merged, and we finally had an Andrew Gross novel. Thrills, page tuner situations, and a character that came in late that I really liked. So at this point, the book went from a three star to a four. Still not my favorite Andrew Gross book, but a fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34TZ3RQQ7W2E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061655988#wasThisHelpful","R34TZ3RQQ7W2E4","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was so excited to start this book, I adore Rob Thurman, and I know I am always in for an entertaining read when I read one of her books. Although I read them again and again, I always look forward to a new one.This one does not disappoint.First of all, I love the different points of view, Niko and Cal sharing the narration. The first book she did that for, Deathwish, was always one of my favorites of this series, so I was thrilled to see it again. The story not only goes back and forth between the two narrators, it also goes back and forth between two time lines. I really like the stories of the past, all the books have a couple of snippets or stories about the past, but this one really delves into a past timeline, and it adds so much to the history of the characters. So great.....I don't want to say too much, no spoilers, but there are a couple of twists and turns that are surprising. And if you read the Trickster novels, it goes full circle in one part of the book. By the way, if you have not read the Trickster novels, you must. They are fun as well.So I will read this one again, like I do all the others, but I must say, this is one of the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ND8SG0B0RICP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451465024#wasThisHelpful","R2ND8SG0B0RICP","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love Mr. Rosenfelt. I have read all of his books, and although I am partial to his Andy Carpenter books, I read everything he writes.This book was two stories in one. The main character had to solve a murder to free his kidnapped brother, and also try to find this kidnapped brother, in case he could not solve the murder! I really liked the characters, and was so glad even with the seriousness of the situations, Mr. Rosenfelt let his sense of humor come through, and help the reader move through the seriousness of the story.

"I was not sure how to rate this book. I found myself unable to stop reading, I wanted to know how it was all going to end. Yet, as I was reading, I found myself confused, and wondering where it was all going. Not in the what is going to happen mystery way, but more...what can happen next to confuse the issue.I really liked the narrator, maybe that is what kept me reading, yet at times, I felt like he was spinning his wheels, and doing things that did not make sense. In trying to solve his brother's shooting, every one he came across was a suspect, and he was floundering so much, I felt like how did he ever pass his bar exams. Then I would forgive him because he was young, with so many issues, it didn't surprise me he was floundering. Everyone lied, and I mean everyone. It was....sad?There were no secondary characters I liked, except maybe his brother who was on machines in the hospital, and the reader was learning about him through the narrators eyes...yet even then there were so many questions about his brothers integrity, I wasn't sure if I should like him or not. I did though.So the story was convoluted, the ending seemed open ended, and I hope there will be another book with this character. I want to know what happens to him. Which explains the four stars. The author did his job, kept me reading, left me wanting me more. I will definitely read a second book from this author, hope Monkey boy is back.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZQAAWJUQW2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SAV110#wasThisHelpful","R37ZQAAWJUQW2S","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I found myself rooting for him to succeed and face it, he is not even really an anti-hero. That kind of character who lives on the edge, not quite a white hat doing wrong things sometimes for the right reasons. This character is a bank robber, a criminal, and one of the most interesting characters I have come across in a long time.The character is a ""ghost"" in his life, and he is a ghost to the reader too, but I really hope he will be back.

I started reading it, and found myself skipping sleep to finish it.I liked the author calling the main character the Gray man, an assassin, is he a good guy?  Even though he is particular about the cases he takes, still, being an assassin opens up the readers to that place the character lives, between black and white, good and bad.

"I am actually writing this review for the first three books in this series, I am on my way to start the fourth but I wanted to take time out to review the books so far.As you can see from my five stars, I really like these books. Some other reviewers have said the main character is a little over the top but that is what I like in my thrillers and mysteries. If the characters weren't extra special, the books would not be interesting! I love the main character and apparently in future books, the reader will told more about his background and how he got to where he was. Through the stories so far, there have been interactions with people that make you wonder and think about their previous relationships with the main character. Just enough to get you wondering.There is a ""sidekick"" to the main character, Boxer, and I love every scene he is in.

"Well,I just finished reading this latest book in this series and thought I would put in a review. It is such an underrated series that I thought I would give it a boost, Well, joke is on me. I just read this is the last in the series, that the publisher did not pick it up. What a shame.The characters have grown with each book, the stories have gotten better and better. These books are better than so many books out there that seem to be pushing along. Again what a disappointment, I will really miss Ray Lily.However, if you have not read these books, even knowing they are going to stop, I would suggest reading them. The world that Mr. Connolly built is very different, magic is not the benign thing that is going on in so many current urban fantasy books. This world makes magic scary and strange, and Mr. Lily, with the Twenty Palaces organization is all that stands between evil magic and humanity.I have liked this series from the beginning and if you have not read the previous books, I feel like it is a must to read them in order. Wow, still bummed no more Twenty Palaces books. Still, great reads and worth your time. Maybe the publisher will change their minds down the road.

"I was a little surprised to see another Flavia de Luce novel this year, since the third in the series had already been released earlier in the year. Also, I have to admit, I did not love the last entry as much as the first ones. I was anxious, however, to give this one a try since Flavia was going to finally determine whether or not Santa was real.Of course, she was going to do this in the way only Flavia could. With total scientific experimental clarity.I love this series so much, and this book does not disappoint. I am still waiting however, for the reason Flavia's older sisters seem to have so much acrimony with Flavia, I keep thinking there is more to the story about their Mother's death than we know so far.If you have not read any of these books, you should. Although they are billed as mysteries, it is really the characters that drive the stories. So far, I have pretty much figured out ""who did it"" even if not necessarily why, but that does not take away the enjoyment of the stories. I sit down with one of these, and find myself caught up in a world that it seems only Mr. Bradley can portray so well.This series is so much fun, I would recommend these books to everyone that loves a good story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SB11A36HNAFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X6PSCW#wasThisHelpful","R3SB11A36HNAFX","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Rob Thurman fan and could not wait for this sequel. Although I discovered her through the urban fantasy genre, this book, which is a sequel to the book Chimera, is not in the urban fantasy category. It is just an old fashioned thriller, one that has a little science fiction element, but actually reminds me of Michael Chricton. Thriller books with a twist to give it a kick.The relationship between these two brothers is at the heart of the story but it was great reading how they have each grown, together and on their own. I also love the character of Saul, and was really glad to see him back in such a major way.I don't want to say to much, I don't want to give the story away, but as usual, Ms. Thurman throws in twists and turns that turn the story on it's head more than once. (See her trickster books, The Trick of the Light, and Grimrose Path, such fun) Anyway, the action was non-stop and it is a great book for anyone who likes a thriller book with more than non-stop action, but great characters that you fall in love with as well.By the way if you read this book on Kindle, they put the line about checking out the other author's books in the wrong place, it is before the epilogue. So when you get there, keep going, and read the epilogue. Amazon goofed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20EGC3A1T5B9A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LRPDKA#wasThisHelpful","R20EGC3A1T5B9A","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I downloaded this book earlier and had not read it yet, mainly on the five star reviews. I was looking for something to occupy my time until Basilisk by Rob Thurman came out on Tuesday, and I decided to start this book. Well, surprise, surprise, I could not put it down. What a great book. A totally different world built around demons, magicians, and humans. So much fun. I loved the characters, I was surprised the way the book unfolded, and so enjoyed something different. This is a great beginning to a new series and I can't wait until the next book, unbelievable this is a debut book. I love the characters, I loved the story and I so look forward to what is coming next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQZCH6FCWPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451620527#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQZCH6FCWPZ","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first started reading this book, I had a really hard time getting into it. I am not sure why, I knew why Harry had been shot, but could not figure out where the whole thing was going. I had guessed from something Mr. Butcher said in the book before this one, and again, I just wasn't bonding with the story. Then about 38% read( I read it on Kindle) something turned and I started reading and could not put it down. It just took off, and I could not read this fast enough. I laughed out loud, we all know Harry, and I cried a whole bunch. I don't want to say to much, I don't want to give anything away, no spoilers, and of course the plot of the book has been outlined elsewhere. I will just say, if you are a Harry Dresden fan, do not miss this book. If you have not ever read any of this series, go back, start at the beginning and enjoy the ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S9TP3RJA7UWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=045146379X#wasThisHelpful","R2S9TP3RJA7UWW","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me start by saying I did not buy this product on Amazon, but now that I know they have them, the next time I purchase one, I know I will come here. This product is great. We have been having a terrible time with ants this year on our hummingbird feeder, more than any other year. Not sure why, however, we picked one of these up not expecting much, IT WORKS! It is great, I was surprised,  no ants from the first time I used it. Still no ants. The package said it will last one whole hummingbird season so we will see, but even it doesn't, I would put a new one right away.

"I really enjoyed this book, it is a great beginning to a new Urban Fantasy series. It is kind of dark, with flawed, complex characters, and the framework for a really strange world. The fairies in this book are not the sweet fun loving fairies that normally live in the urban fantasy genre, and there are things going on that have no explanation yet. The end really leaves you hanging. However, it also leaves you waiting impatiently for the next installment, I can't wait to see what is going to happen, what or who the mysterious characters are. What is really going on in the new world that is being built. The mystery was good, I had figured out who, but now why, and it was really a shocking conclusion to the mystery, so I really liked that too.I understand this author normally writes young adult novels, but this is really not for that audience at all. So if you normally read this writer, and are a young adult, maybe look elsewhere!Anyway, give this a try if you like urban fantasy and are looking for something a little different, something new. It is well worth your time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGWWX4M78DWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439189862#wasThisHelpful","R2BGWWX4M78DWQ","A2RZ9O4PSL16V4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RZ9O4PSL16V4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I could not put this book down. I am a huge fan of Mr. Hurwitz and this book is now at the to pof the list of my favorites of his books. I could not stop reading until I finished it. From the very beginning, I was hooked and at first my heart was breaking for the main character, and I could not guess where the story was going. And then, as the book took off, it just did not stop. What a page turner.I really liked the main characters, not sure if it would make sense to see them again in another book, but I would love too. I am curious, with the ending the way it is, how things in their lives turn out.

"I totally love this series. I just finished this book, the second in the series, however I really feel like to enjoy this, you need to read the first one.I read a lot of urban fantasy books and this series stands out as among the best. The series is different than most, the main character is a husband and father who is also a demon hunter. He is loving, sarcastic and really good at his job. He has good friends, a brother he helped and is now trying to rebuild his relationship with, and a demon that hangs around, not really a friend, but so far, not an enemy. It is an interesting twist in the story.This latest installment kept me on the edge of my seat, I could not put it down.

"The cover sucked me in on this story, seeing that cute little frog sitting there and then the title, ""Sharing a Pond.""The blurb pretty well covers the basics.  Corey and Shane have been together for ten years and are middle aged.  They're established in their careers, home, and community.  Yes, they are frog shifters - Both green (forgot the specifics on species)  -- Despite that their human forms are different in skin coloring.  What interesting concepts.Sharing a Pond is about Corey and Shane accepting their third in their triad:  Brent.  He is a lot younger at twenty, hasn't been to college, and comes with a lot of baggage.  Not possessions but his past which influences him.  He is handsome to Corey and Shane and they feel the mate pull as Brent does to them.  While it's understandable the three need to cement their relationship, I was amazed at how much page space was for smex.  Some of it was justified in claiming each other and developing trust without jealousy.  Personally I would have liked more communication between them because it's always a lack of talking that causes problems.  And that includes covering the whole issue and bring up that rat stink John and sticking his nose in something that was none of his business.  *sigh*  No, Brent didn't tell his mates about John.As their relationship deepens, Brent grows and matures.  He put his mates first even when he was hurting.  And it takes a lot of courage to stand up and speak of past hurts, not knowing how they'll treat you when they learn the truth.  Of course it's easier to blossom when there is love and support and Brent has that.I loved the 'frog' water scenes and wish there were more.  There were a lot of things I enjoyed about this story, but not so much the smex, which I ended up skipping.  I'd love to see another story of this threesome. . . . With Cory's job, a move or not, Brent more confident and frog stuff.  - Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CHXJ62GP67YC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0184EQ5BG#wasThisHelpful","R1CHXJ62GP67YC","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A warlock, a prophecy, a demanding father, and antiques.Conner is a talented wizard with fire talent.  He does as his father commands.  I don't know how old Conner is, but he's now at the point where he wants a relationship.  In this case a guy at work is spiking his interest, Scott.Scott has no magical ability but does have an affinity for antiques.  And it's thru his job of cataloguing and verifying antiques where he gets to know Conner.  Their relationship is slow building.  Conner has to keep his magical abilities hidden and his status as a warlock.  Scott is openly gay yet is shy, too afraid that Conner is straight, and doesn't act on his feelings.  So they hold back from each other, keeping secrets, and until courage takes over.Now.  The story interested me but the execution was glaringly bad.  There are punctuation mistakes, fragmented sentences, wrong word placement, and repeated misspelled words.  Examples are:Instead of couch it was coach.Beginning chapter:  Prophecy is wrongly spelled. Instead  it is prophesy and that misspelling is repeated throughout the story.Yeah the ears tearing up happened when Scott was confiding in Jade that Conner must be gay -- He bit my bagel!Chapter 4 opens:  ""The tram doors swung wide open.  I shuffled through a crowd of college students, finally freeing myself from metal box.""  That followed with a sentence with misplaced commas.Is hell capitalized?  It is here.  As are Warlocks, Witches, and Demons, but not mortals.  A hair style is capitalized:  "". . . black Mohawk style hair. . . ""  There are a few others but you get the idea.Fragmented sentences.  Case in point the fire flower Conner makes for Scott:  ""Or better yet."" ""A green stem, white petals, a yellow center.""It's like part of the story was passed off to someone else, someone that didn't take the time to edit.  I agree with what another reviewer wrote - It's like the work was started by one person and someone else contributed.  Someone that doesn't know English grammar.  This is a low point in Wolf Specter's work.

"Having read the first book, Prickly Business, I was excited to see another out.  This is a continuation of Avery and Dylan.Avery is a Louisiana bred, a well dressed and cute looking hedgehog shifter.  He is mated to his wolf partner Dylan.  Avery is now learning to live within his means, still values his friends, and is heavily invested in being a PI.  A lot of this story is about Avery and his PI gigs.  So Avery is putting in the hours, talks about his boredom on stakeouts, and is working all hours of the day and night.  He's pushing himself and losing weight as well as sleep.Of course Dylan is worried about Avery.  He has the wolf vibe going on, wanting to help, to protect, and be front and center for Avery.  Unfortunately Avery's schedule puts a damper on most of that.  Yes, most of the time the two guys are apart.  Dylan is understanding but over time he's more unhappy.  While Dylan and Avery aren't whiney, there is immaturity on Avery's part and a lot of the story has unresolved wallowing, in spite of Avery's epiphany.I appreciate a deeper look at a mated shifter couple and how they work on their relationship.  But.  Whenever they were together it was sex and sleep.  Or sex, food, and sleep.  Or sex.  Avery and Dylan come into this mating with expectations yet have cultural and species differences.  They should be solving and discussing things instead of all this wallowing.  Little insecurities became big and some of the angst was over stupid stuff.  Like Dylan trying to figure out when to say 'I love you.'  It kept coming up again and again in Dylan's thoughts and by the time it was settled it wasn't a big deal.This story introduces two more matings in the works and no conclusion on them.  I hate it when sideline matings are more interesting than the main couple.  I'm still wondering who Luc met in New Orleans.  And Jaden.  You know it shouldn't take a tragedy to make a mated couple communicate.  Especially a shifter couple.  I felt the angst was more human directed and not what instinct driven shifters would do.  Because a mate is everything and their shifter half should have been pressing them.  But these two rarely shift.  So then there's that.  - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K3Q46038OCV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017L5ZK7Y#wasThisHelpful","R3K3Q46038OCV4","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ricky was raised by an abusive father and has a low sense of self worth.  When this story opens Ricky is running from five years of more abuse, torture, and slavery.  Despite all this he has a core of steel to be able to survive.  Ricky has had a rough life, he's human and only 23 years old.  The story mainly focuses on him, his lack of choices, the few he can make, and how he struggles to overcome.Sandy is Ricky's six year old shifter brother.  Sandy is special and Ricky is tasked to protect him.  There are a lot of details to this sibling bond that I could go into but the short of it is they're both at risk, the last of their kind.  They are hunted, in danger, and until Sandy grows up, they're always at risk.As the story opens, Sandy and Ricky seek asylum at the Windy River Pack and meet up with Alpha Grant.  So a new chapter begins.  Alpha Grant is a fierce protector and is in charge of an extremely large pack.  He is a more settled alpha that is patient but has limits.  He's never had a boyfriend and is new to a relationship but at least he listens to advice and learns from his mistakes.  Unfortunately some of those lessons come a bit late.The world building was interesting and just enough to get a feel for the time period and setting.  The main characters are well drawn and interesting.  The many back up characters bring a depth to the pack and the story.  If this is a first story by this author, I can say I'm impressed.  There was a good flow, lots of consequences for your actions, believable dialogue and situations.  My two nit picks would be a six year old talking like an adult, complete sentences and grammar.  Even if Sandy is special and a shifter he is still only six years old.  Another is I wished the pack had a psychiatrist.  Ricky needs to talk to someone besides is six year old brother and busy mate.  He can't overcome his past without addressing it and hearing it from a trained professional.  I will note that the abuse mentioned in this story is not front and center.  There's a distance from all of that and it was well done being presented that way.I overlooked the editing and grammar - if there were problems -  because the story just dragged me in.  I can recommend this for KU customers that want a decent shifter m/m read that is longer, interesting, and well done for this first book.  - Dan's Wife","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12JYN7GT3N1S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016TRZZ48#wasThisHelpful","R12JYN7GT3N1S9","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been ten months since I read the last Renounced, Southwestern Shifters Book 10.  So I downloaded the last one to prepared for this -- Then I saw my review on Renounced and I remembered the storyline and what to expect.  So.  Retrograde is another look at Nathan and Marcus's relationship.  We've met them before, we've watched them experience their bond, their sex lives, and how they are growing into their roles.  Now they are established in their positions are together, but want to be closer to each other and to their wolf side.Because they were an established couple and their story is already written, I wasn't as invested in this story.  Sure every relationship has change and decisions have to be made.  So there is talk between Nathan and Marcus. . . . Visions of a bright future, 'down to nature' and running thru the forest.  But it's just talk!My main gripe with the story is what I griped about in my review on Renounced.  Marcus and Nathan keep getting it on and while it is nice to see an established couple and leaders of their people be so into each other, to have their sex take up 65% of the book is a bit much.  Just a bit.  So I was skipping pages because while it was hot and steamy and Bailey Bradford does deliver for her readers. .. . I wanted to get to the plot.  To the story line.  Pages of sex isn't a storyline and in this series it's already established that Nathan and Marcus have outstanding sex.  There was nothing new here.I was bored with Retrograde.  There were ideas and talk and plans but nothing was implemented.  I was disappointed.  SPOILER:  Going to be interesting to move with six babies.  Just saying.  The cover is also odd.  Is that Asher?  Malnourished Asher?  Nathan has knee length hair so it can't be him.  Odd hair there.  - Dan's WifePost note / Spoiler:  What wasn't addressed is how a foreign visitor (won't get too much spoiler details) could contact a US hunter and get the hunter to cooperate with their plans.  What did the 'spy' find in Marcus's office?  Did he call anyone?  Was he looking for pack details in the US so he or his organization could wipe them out?

"Having read two other stories by Noah Harris, I tried this one on the KU program.  Unfortunately I couldn't get past the first page.  I understand the concepts and comparisons but the phrasing is odd.  I'm not sure if it's the tenses (past vs future) or if it's the first person narrative.  Let me see if I can make myself clearer.  Standing in a childhood bedroom the mc is at a cross roads.  He is thinking of his past in that he is one personality at home and another at school.  Re-reading it I'm stumbling across the odd descriptions which now that I look at them are overly wordy.  Think 'wet water'.  (Water doesn't need to be called wet, it already is)""It was meant to be a celebration.  For me, the moment my eyes welcomed the small world that was my childhood bedroom, I was filled with both resentment and remorse.""""At home, I was expected to be reserved, and mannerly.  While at school I was expected to be flamboyant and exaggerated.  Neither of these personalities had been who I truly was at heart.""No commas in the first sentence:  At home I was expected to be reserved and mannerly.I don't know.  I've never had anyone refer to someone as being mannerly.  I think 'well behaved' is a better term.Same thing with exaggerated.  Stop being so exaggerated!  You're too flamboyant!  Flamboyant works, exaggerated doesn't.So if he wasn't flamboyant or reserved what exactly was he?  What defines him?  And what in the heck is he celebrating?""I found that the boy I was at home had been oppressed.""  Found seems wrong here.  He's talking about himself.  He knows what his last years are like, he didn't just realize it.  When you find something it's a new discovery.  I can't begin to figure out correcting it.  The sentence is past tense.  Maybe:  I grew up in an oppressed home.When ""and"" links two words there isn't a comma.  When three words are linked the commas are:  Apples, oranges, and peaches.  Apples and oranges.  Not apples, and oranges.  Yes there are punctuation mistakes errors in the sentences I quoted.So this was the opening and I'm sorry but I was so bogged down in details, I focused on those instead of the story.  I returned it after stumbling on the first page.  I'd like to not rate it and just put some comments but the Amazon powers that be ask for a rating. I was generous with three stars.  - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOW4HM744L1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016WQUL8Q#wasThisHelpful","RJOW4HM744L1Y","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"How to Walk Like a Man was pre-ordered.  I don't often do that but this time it was worth every penny.  For those that love dogs, love their little quirks, is willing to watch a guy find himself and his humanity. .. . All I can say is this one delivers.  It is wonderful.  It hit all my happy buttons and I was either snickering or smiling.  The story reminds me of a dog compared to a cat.  While the cat is secretive and sly and wanting to take over the world, a dog is happy!  Fun loving!  Loves egg sandwiches!  The outdoors!  The indoors!  And everything!  Then there's the various breeds and how well Eli Easton describes them in human form.  The breezy friendly golden retriever that runs the diner.  The English bulldog and jowels.  The border collie and the protective intensity.  Knowing these breeds I could relate.  Even if you don't, you'll enjoy them.Yes the story focuses on Roman.  His picture is on the cover - The German Shepherd.  Yup, he does go dog in the story so the cover ruined the 'coming out to Matt' for me.  Other than that, no complaints.  The town is spot on, the townies, great follow up on Tim and Lance, and an even more detailed look at how 'quickened'' happens and how it impacted Roman.  And it's a continuing process, not something that is achieved overnight.Roman is a human but also a German Shepherd.  I loved how his mannerisms reflected on his alter half, the curiosity, the obedience, the waiting for orders, the wanting reassurance and praise.  Wonderful.  Matt is just as good but again this is Roman's story.  I loved it and it's staying on my re-read list.  This one's a keeper.

"The last few books I've read by Wolf Specter I've enjoyed.  They keep improving!  So this one, Dragon Fire, is about a dragon shifter Liam.  He is an arson investigator for the fire department and at this point in his long life, his inner dragon is fighting for control.  It wants what it wants and is forcing Liam towards losing his humanity.  Yet.  There is a 'cure'.I love the way Wolf Specter writes about shifters.  Liam's dragon doesn't talk to him but reacts and influences him without words.  He's one author that does it so flawlessly and makes it believable and interesting.  No, not humans that are shifters that never shift but a shifter that has an alter ego that wakes up and takes center stage.Shane is a police detective and sent to investigate various arsons, documenting the loss of property.  He meets Liam on the job and they both compare notes.  From there we get a rich look at both men.  Their relationship is based on family, the past, and variables like Liam's dragon.  Yes, this is fiction and involves shifters and the ability of a dragon shifter impregnating a human male.  I especially loved the epilogue which took the pair a few years down the road, really nicely done and gave the book a satisfying ending.  I wouldn't mind seeing a continuation.  - Dan's WifeFootnote:  We never did learn if it was Liam's dragon behind the arsons.  My assumption is he was behind the first two (his memories and the timeline with when he forgot) but not the third although the timing was questionable.  How could his enemy know when to strike?  And why are bad dragons black?  ??","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BFNO387LON3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017O89MF4#wasThisHelpful","R2BFNO387LON3P","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking forward to this story, bought it on the day it came out on Amazon, then never reviewed it.  Now that it's gelled a bit, I'll take the time to give a few thoughts.Of course everyone wants to find their fated mate or beloved.  In this story  Gypsum, a vampire, is assisting in relocating some angus cattle shifters to New Mexico.  He's tasked with assisting and transporting since he helped rescue them.  This is a nice follow up to Not a Line of Bull (A Loving Nip Book 6).  Gypsum is the second of his coven, a strong older vampire, but patient and fair minded.  The angus shifters are pretty well dropped as Gypsum smells his mate.Lucius is a dingo shifter, one of the rehabilitated shifters from the situation in Rehabilitating His Dingo (Wolves of Stone Ridge Book 23).  He and his half brothers have been with the condor shifter alpha for a few years.  He's not fully recovered but feeling safe.  The outdoor scene of him playing with his brothers and beta was wonderful.Lucius isn't ready for a mate.  His past defines him and he's led a really troubled one.  Gypsum doesn't have hang ups and pursues with determination.  Unfortunately the story is short and there's just a few moments that define their relationship.  Just as it begins the book was over.  One area that wasn't put into a lot of detail are the characters of Lucius's pack.  Well the world building is mentioned enough but the inner circle of this pack is just touched on.  Even in that earlier story,  Rehabilitating His Dingo (Wolves of Stone Ridge Book 23, this pack was just getting started.  And the angus cattle shifters are there but now in the background.  One stands out.  Maybe we'll hear more from him.  *Note* wish all that kidnapping / fight situation / scene could have been left out and the guys getting better acquainted.  *sigh*Now a friend on a forum pointed out that it looks like the otter shifter was tossed into the fire (cover).  Nope, not true.  No otters here.  That was a hot dog and marshmallow moment!  Yes I was disappointed with this one.  To this point I've enjoyed the Loving Nip Series.

"I bought this flexi leash on Amazon over a year ago. .. . Or longer.  I'd have to go through all my reviews to figure that out.  This leash listed is for the LARGE size, for Large dogs, 16 feet length.  The tape lead is NOT reflective.  Not in this size.  It is bright yellow and easy to spot in the daytime.  The casing does have a reflective quality but I don't know how well that holds up at night.What I love about this leash is the casing is lighter weight than other large models.  Also the bright color which is easy to spot in the house when I'm searching for the leash.  Because it's lighter in weight It's easier to hang on to when out walking.  Walking with this flexi is an enjoyable experience.The negative is that there isn't much room for your hand when grasping the handle.  The handle area is smaller than my old flexi.  When I wear gloves it's difficult to grasp cause my fingers are so cramped.  If I don't have a good grasp, I can't handle my dog.  So during the winter I usually switch out to another flexi simply because I can't worry about losing my dog or dealing with cramped / cold fingers.  I'll include a picture of my old flexi - If Amazon will print share it to compare.  It isn't until you see the two leashes side by side that you notice the differences in the finger / gripping space.  (New model vs my older one)Flexi really is the way to go.  The tape doesn't get dog hair caught up in it like the cord type.  And if you get tangled or grasp it when the dog is pulling, the tape doesn't hurt your fingers or hand like a cord does.  I have had the cord type slide through my fingers and left a rope burn -- Well, almost a rope burn.  I've had fingers twisted due to a pulling dog and hauling back on the cord and grabbing it wrong while grabbing the dog.  It's those quick not thinking responses when your dog jumps or pulls or tries to get away / to another dog.  So my experience is a tape is better and the flexi retractable is wonderful.  Note that this model retracts until it stops when the metal attachment hit it.  So there is always pressure on the leash to let your dog know you are there on the other end -- No slack.  - Dan's Wife","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OCKAA92Z4R6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USGVKXM#wasThisHelpful","R2OCKAA92Z4R6A","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the story of Isaiah, a bat eared fox shifter . .. . and . . . .Tech guru for Dominic's pride.  He's the guy that sits looking at computer monitors, is a loner, and takes care of all the security computer stuff.  As he is so self contained, I couldn't place him from the other books.  He's probably in the background, doing his job, and not making an impact.Isaiah is the son of an alpha and raised to take over his skulk.  But due to Isaiah being gay, he was kicked out and resettled with Dominic's pride.  The years have passed and now there are family issues and Isaiah is called back home.The other half of this story is a human, John.  There is some back story on why he's been imprisoned for a year in a cabin on Whitedell Pride property.  Not remembering much on him . . . He was hired to kidnap Jamie for the Glass Pharmaceutical company.  I don't think he was experimented on and has no enhanced abilities.  He never offers to help Isaiah with computer stuff so I assume he isn't tech savvy.  He was asked to train with the enforcers but there is very little page space on that.The road to this relationship is problematic. Isaiah had to figure out his priorities and unfortunately he goes through a indecisive stage that was really off putting.  I expected better from a shifter!  John is the rock in this one even though he has to remodel his life and live with shifters.  He knows he's at a disadvantage and isn't sure where he stands.There were spots of humor that lightened up the story.  Keenan and Nysys are now best buds and their curiosity leads them into . . . new adventures.  A few old faces pop up and some new ones are introduced.  There is no conclusion on the Glass Company situation from the last book.  The focus is on Isaiah and John and how another mating comes about.  4.5 stars simply because Isaiah's reasoning was beyond my tolerance.  Especially if he was trained to be an alpha - You'd think he'd go thru decision making and problem solving!  And there isn't a set HEA.  *sigh*  -- Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FKIX2VRGTETP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GGC4HC#wasThisHelpful","R1FKIX2VRGTETP","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jason is 22, has left home, and decides to reconnect with his Uncle Raul.  He is unsure of his welcome, unsure if he can stay.  Since we've met Raul in another story, I thought it'd be an interesting time to reconnect.  But no, Raul makes very few appearances.  He doesn't even take the time to sit down with his nephew and have a heart to heart.Sorry, this one didn't do it for me.  Jason is part way through college.  No idea what he was majoring in, just that his mom and step-dad cut off his funds.  Of course he takes up his schooling once he's in Stone Ridge but again, who knows what field.  And while I'm on the subject, who knows what Michel does for a living.  What rank his wolf is in the pack.  There are so many blanks when characterizing these two.The kicker for me was when Jason was told Michel would never hurt him.  Yet Michel, under the influence of drugs, attacks Jason and goes for his throat.  Kill shot and Michel barely pulls back in time.  Now I know things were intense and Michel was in wolf form and couldn't talk but once they were in the hospital together, they didn't discuss this.  This involved trust and Michel should have talked about what the drugs did to his wolf.  Did that happen?  Of course not!I'm to believe Michel, a 370 some odd year old wolf shifter, a guy that has been married, raised 3 kids, and a grandson. . . A guy with this much experience and knowledge would mess up with his mate.  Miscommunication.  Assumptions.  It was all just really off.This is the first time I've heard of a wolf from this pack 'hiding' while reinventing his image.  All the other mates are living their lives and they're not getting a new image.  Carson is still the enforcer and I bet he's been Declan's enforcer for decades.  And I know Carson leaves pack lands to do his job.  Then there's Declan.  He's just as old as Michel yet I've never heard one word about him reinventing himself.So Jason agrees to live with Michel, off the grid, out in the woods.  They still have differences to overcome.  They declared their love to each other rather quickly and when the story ends they are happy for now but not a HEA.  Sad.  - Dan's Wife","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IF1K3UN5EDO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F22NSP0#wasThisHelpful","R3IF1K3UN5EDO6","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Milo is the small town sheriff and a werewolf.  Well, he's part human and wolf but can shift.  He is a dedicated lawman, working overtime, and has the town's best interests at heart.  While he does so much for everyone else, he is still lonely and apart due to his shifter half but also because he's a closet gay.Eli is the boss of a security firm called Calvary.  I have no idea what Eli looks like besides his 'being as hairy as a wolf' and that he likes to man handle Milo.  Eli is dedicated to his job and his people.I didn't read the first book in this series but didn't feel lost.  This one focuses on Eli and Milo and the situations around their growing relationship.  Of course there's drama and self doubt, at least on Milo's part.  Part of that is because Eli is human and won't feel the mate pull . . . The back and forth between the two men making it work was good but not over done.  It was nice to see these two work their jobs and communicate to make their relationship work.Unfortunately the story ended with a lot of lose ends.  I realize this is a series but as it is Milo's job situation is up in the air, the hunters are still out there, and Joe's dad is still dying.  Peter isn't contacted although I thought that might have been him on that run Cal and Milo took.  Then there was that boy in the hospital.  I mean heck.  There are so many little storylines left hanging and the main reason I gave it 4 stars is because this story was about Eli and Milo.  They aren't settled yet.  They're not living together or 'had that talk' about where they'll settle.  Everything is up in the air.  I guess it's a HFN but with the threats who knows how long that will last.  This story was written in May and here it is the beginning of November and no continuing book planned or out.

"Callum of Drakkar Coven takes a step back and shows vampires for what they really are -- Blood thirsty, violent, and cruel.  If you like your vamps of this caliber, then you will enjoy this story.Laramie is a simple young man, ready to be wed to Sara and lives in his village with his father.  He grew up with tales of  the Lord and his brothers living nearby and how humans from their village disappear within their castle and never return.  Rumors of vampires float around yet Laramie is in his own world dreaming of his girl, soon to be wife.  So innocent. . .Lord Callum is the other half of this story, the vampire, the one that captures and holds humans for his own needs.  They are like cattle -- His to use, abuse, feed from, or play with.  And he prefers men, especially for sex.  Thankfully Callum isn't a cruel master, he sees his decisions as merciful.  Culling the herd, so to speak.  After all his food source can't starve during a brutal winter.-- That impacts him.A bit of caution here.  This book is intense, morbid, sadistic, and gruesome.  And that's just the physical stuff.  Then there's the about face where  Laramie changes from this bespotted love struck youth of 18 to turn into a guy consumed with his own sexual needs.  His attraction to Lord Callum consumes him and Laramie thinks less about the other captives.  It's not quite Stockholm syndrome, but there is a change there. . . And it's a downward spiral.  He's losing his humanity. . .The writing is amazing, the characters are convincing and deep, and the situation is intense.  For all of that, I give this story five stars. It is an amazing story.  Unfortunately it wasn't my type of book.  I don't like to see main characters go through what Laramie did or the heartache he had to deal with.  But I can't drag the rating down because of my own view - Even if I did have to set it down and not finish -  That shows a great author and how deep she can write.  My loss but someone else's gain.  - Dan's Wife","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHQNJ6YPB07G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007SDKGIS#wasThisHelpful","R1GHQNJ6YPB07G","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again I'm amazed at Wolf Specter's writing. The curse with that is I'm now actively looking for more from him.  *grin*Becoming Omega goes way beyond the normal omega alpha meet, greet, and 'mine'.  Issac Ward is convinced by his old army friend Carter to 'compete' in the trials.  It's a chance to prove your physical, mental, and emotional ability.  At the end of being tested, the remaining few will be turned.  Werewolf turned and brought into the pack.Ward meets Alpha Ryan early on and knows they are mates but their situation is strained.  Ward is committed to the trials and frankly, he isn't gay.  Never been with a guy, not ever interested.  So this was a gay for you (GFY) story along with a competition and interesting pack situations.  Through it all, Ward acts like himself and Ryan is one to let him.  None of the strong arm alpha tactics.  While the story is told from Ward's point of view, I did wonder what Ryan was doing, off on those sidelines.  He's a strong alpha and that mating call had to wear on him.The term 'omega' is rarely used in referring to Ward.  Ryan never calls him that and neither does anyone that matters.  He's a strong, military trained special ops guy with a conditioned body and mindset.  He is able to stare at more dominate people / wolves and doesn't act submissive at all.  And how he was able to go thru the trials under the physical condition he was in . . .  Borderline unreal.  I'll rate this story a 4.5 stars and hope that Wolf Specter writes a follow up story.

"Charlie Richard's stories are either a hit or miss with me.  I enjoyed this one.Hess is a Kodiak bear shifter and the story is mainly told from his point of view.  He stands 6' at the shoulder -- No, not when standing on his hind feet but when he's on all fours.  That's huge.  Hess is military trained, smart, and plans out his visit like a military campaign.  With his data all done he strolls into pack territory, scratching his back, ambling along, and thinking of ways to have fun.  I loved his easy going character. That was well done.Gilbert is one of a few rescued bird shifters from a lab in Russia.  He and his friends live in a converted barn in pack territory.  While Gilbert is the main squeeze in this tale, I never got a feel for his raven.  Gilbert never has any 'attracted to shiney' moments, hording his 'pretties' or any of that stuff that are associated with ravens.  Yes, I did check Wiki --  Ravens are ground horders, playful, and love aerial aerobatics. No, none of that from Gilbert and I doubt being stubborn is a raven traint. Now I realize Gilbert is busy with his flock and still recovering from decades of being in that lab. . . But still. I wanted a bit more from him, to be worthy / a good match / fun / for Hess.Anyway, the story is cute, the relationship has a few hiccups and of course things are happening in pack territory.  I'd have liked some feedback on the skirmish.  I had a few questions tied up there and if page space was the problem with explaining everything, then I'd have liked less details on the flock.  You know, all of their birds, personalities, and what they do in their spare time.  Yeah, I felt like feathers were flying in that barn and while I appreciated the background and an idea of where the series is going, I know all those names and attributes will be given all over again in Hector and Rock's story.  Just saying.Four stars for the humor, the loveable bear in Hess and his settling down in a barn with the flock. Not quite a fox among chickens analogy, but close.  By the way, I'm sure Gilbert and Hess will learn to deal with thin walls . . .  - Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT5GSTN3W0JCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VFT3BO#wasThisHelpful","RT5GSTN3W0JCT","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shortly into the story I'm greeted with this paragraph:""Jack sighed at the German grandfather clock coming across the room and flipped the key in his register to pull a cash report.  He liked to take one every hour, on the hour, for his records.  Last year, he had ended this business day with ten dollars and forty-five cents.""As that first sentence is written, the clock is moving across the room.  Instead it should be something like Jack LOOKED at the German grandfather clock while crossing the room.  Then the next sentence is vague and I assume it links to the cash report and not the register.  Now while I get the atmosphere of his work and duties are important, this is a twenty odd something page extremely short story.  So every single word needs to be right as the plot builds.Ethan is this cute skinny blue eyed blonde that visits Jack's store.  For Jack it's instinct, the smell, that sets off his hormones and he's primed to rut.  And that's about what it is for Ethan and Jack.  They come together because of their wolf nature,  they can't fight their urges.  What bothered me is we don't have much background on Ethan and why he was out on his own camping in the dead of winter.  Was it a dare?  A request from his family?  Was he put up to it by his pack?  Did scenting Jack trigger Ethan's mating heat?  And while I'm on that topic, an omega's mating heat wasn't explained at all.  And my thought.  That homeless guy also had a key to the shop.  Right?  I expected him to barge in on Jack and Ethan. . .The premise is good, Jack is well drawn.  Ethan is lacking substance.  We don't know his reasoning or his background.  But again this is only twenty some odd pages.  I'd be curious to see if the mating takes or if this is just a passing scene to help Ethan get through his heat. This is not a HEA or even a HFN story - More of a hook-up between two men.  Of course the story ends at an abrupt halt and there's no follow up to see if Jack and Ethan can make a relationship work or not.  After all it's more than physical chemistry and that's all these two have.  Three stars.  It was okay. - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z6YLR4HLX9QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0161KA58E#wasThisHelpful","R1Z6YLR4HLX9QC","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Omega New Moon is a 50 page segment of a larger work.  As this stands it's an introduction to Nikhil, a Russian wolf immigrant.  He is a math wiz, teaches at a local university, and of all things he's an omega wolf.  He has been with his current pack for years yet somehow this situation with Mathias is just starting.Mathias is the alpha for Nikhil's pack, a strong leader.  He was brought up by his father to do the right thing and one of those is to never give in to being with a male.  Any male.  No, that's wrong.  So this attraction Mathias has for Nikhil is forbidden.  There's a lot of inner conflict and I never did get the reasoning behind Mathias changing his mind.  Was it his wolf?  Instinct?  Fate?  In protecting Nikhil did those feelings prompt the mating or was it by accident and he had to follow through?  While I wasn't sure about the WHY, at least Mathias recognizes his mate in front of the pack.In this wolf mating there is no romance.  No kind words.  A few actions but I could tell Mathias's heart wasn't in it.  It was sad because Nikhil deserved more.  The story was left on a cliffhanger with unresolved issues.  There's unrest in the pack and while it used to be only directed to Nikhil, now it is targeting Alpha Mathias.  On one front things are good but there's a lot of work to do to make the pack a safe and happy environment for Nikhil.  I'd also like to see the two grow into their mating -- More than the protection / safety aspect and more into loving and caring.  - Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E0648E7DM8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GP6PXY#wasThisHelpful","R2E0648E7DM8U","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So this is one of three quick KU short reads that I picked up and read together.  While I enjoy having a bit of selection in the paranormal m/m genre, I get tired of these segments that are longer than chapters but not a complete book.  Let me also say that I was disappointed.  No story should end on a cliffhanger.  It takes away from the story.  It's not a sneak peak into the next segment but a disregard for readers and fans.  Because a tease is just that -- a tease, and some authors take months if not years to put out the next story.  So again I tend to forget storylines and continuations when they're not available . . . and yes I did check to see if the next on in this series is out and no it is not.So on to this story.  Dylan is an omega wolf that is of age to mate.  He's currently working and going to college.  He lives with his dad and is in a stable pack.  The twist in this story is that the wolf population is declining and omegas are to be bred with or without consent.  So when the dreaded letter comes, Dylan is required to participate in a run with the 'benefit' of attracting an alpha, whether Dylan wants one or not.The situation was interesting, the writing creative.  Dylan's solution, along with a lot of magic, shows that Jamie is his true mate.  But there's a catch.SPOILERS:Like another reader, I agree that the epilogue jumped too far into the future with no explanation.  Did they adopt?  No?  Was Dylan already pregnant?  Was Jamie able to get a surrogate?  How is a strong alpha wolf able to cope in an established pack?  Do Dylan and Jamie leave the pack and start their own?  It was too confusing.  All that after a fairly decent read that showed a lot of promise and creativity.  - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ZA1YV9CTF17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015S1FWN0#wasThisHelpful","R19ZA1YV9CTF17","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For what's written, the story is sweet, sassy, and fun.  It's a surface feel for a mating between Katie, a hedgehog and Joey, a dragon shifter.  The reason the two meet is due to Joey's grandfather dying and the inheritance of his house and land.This story needs more depth.  I even looked for a continuing story, maybe about another dragon council member and. . . Nothing is out there.SPOILERS:This whole story evolved around Joey's inheritance.  Yes, he sells it to Katie but. . .The pair is now living in Miami.  So.  What happened to the house?  What about a talk about the grandfather, how much he meant to both of them, clear the air about that issue, and talk of a few treasured items Joey inherited that should be  in their new place?  As I expected the grandfather to have some sort of dragon horde, it fits with the dragon image.  After all, that frying pan is still with Katie.  I'm surprised she didn't tell Honey that it's a family heirloom now, something to 'tell the kids' when meeting Joey.  . . .  It adds weight to the story. . .I must say Joey has great self control.  Never once does he give in when she gets hers. .. No pant adjusting.  No bursting.  No nothing.  And Katie doesn't mention his needs when hers are met.  That was an eyebrow moment.  Really?I honestly wanted to see more of the wolf and cat alphas. . . .The story was fine until the ending.  I never understood how far Honey was in her pregnancy.  Was she going to deliver during the house party?  And if humans aren't supposed to know about paranormals, then why are the dragons flying where Honey and Katie can see them?  Yeah, that last scene.  I wanted to see some snark between the women and a pricky hedgehog alpha dealing with the dragons.Anyone wonder if Katie can be  a part of the 'prickle'?  Her alpha is not in Miami. . .  Yeah, too many questions with that ending and a continuing book is not available.

"Exodus is the second story in the Valen's Pack Series following Run With The Moon.  This story could be read as a stand alone or if you've read the first story as I have, you can pick this one up without being lost. The story starts with Valen as Alpha and dealing with humans and shifters interacting in his pack, their pack, rebuilding lives and the pack grounds.  As this is happening Rivvie, the Beta and brother to Valen is starting a job with Matt, Aaron's brother.  (Valen and Aaron are mates, the alpha pair).  This story focuses on their brothers.We get a lot of background on Matt but not as much on Rivvie.  Of course their relationship takes time.  The world they live in isn't stable.  Who knows why natural disasters happen but what the title states does happen.  The pack needs to relocate and amidst all the changes and confusion Rivvie and Matt become closer.There's a really interesting storyline.  Valen and Aaron are new at leading.  There is still dissent from both the humans and the shifters.  Outside forces are battering the pack so there's a lot going on.  There's struggles both physical and emotional.  It's a time of testing.SPOILERSWe never learn what it is that causes the shifter virus to change another.  I thought it was a bite done in wolf form.  But no, that didn't happen with Rivvie and Matt.  So is it blood drinking and violence and not a fever?  Is it accepting the love of your mate?  So how will this impact their new shaman when we know he is infected and no one is stepping up in his 'cure'.  If he doesn't get changed he'll die.And that shaman -- Not much is said about him.  Is he accepting of shifters?  Is he of the right mindset to handle shifter ceremonies and recognizing a higher power?  He'd been through horror and dealt out death to family and friends.  He's tormented and at a state where he wishes death before he gets any worse.  Yet he's the pack shaman.So the story ended rather abruptly.  Not a cliffhanger but with questions running through my mind.  Not just the shaman issue although that was one.  Another is how Matt's turning was vastly different from Aaron's.  What did the pack learn from that?  We don't know!  Are the humans getting sicker?  We don't know!  Just that their moral is down.  Is anyone experimenting on them?  What about those new shifters that joined?  They just show up and are forgotten.  We don't even know if Matt got sick, just Rivvie wanting to turn him.  Too many inconclusive threads made this an incomplete story of Rivvie and Matt.  - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QBXUTFWOGWOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWXI66E#wasThisHelpful","R1QBXUTFWOGWOD","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was dragged into getting this story, A New Dream, because the blurb grabbed me.  A middle aged man is seeking a new life.  He lost his wife and almost lost his own life, lived with despair and is now moving on.  Of all things he wins this green card lottery so he's flying out to the states and is lined up with a job.  On the plane he meets James.  Both are in the dark about how their lives will intertwine and that they'll be working together, living in the same building, and becoming something more.From reading a few reviews I realized this story was written in French than translated to English.  I'm glad I saw that because otherwise I'd mark the story down for odd sentence structure and this wordy verbose explanations.  The French outlook and expressions were fun and while my my high school French is rusty, I wasn't left guessing what was said.  It was well explained.  Some of the situations were odd at times.  Like having a conversation about systems of measure like miles and kilometers.  Weird.  I've been around foreigners that speak English well and that's the last thing to discuss.  Who cares?  Unless your on the road?  Now the units of measure in a bar is another matter but again odd.  That discussion wasn't presented as a discussion over work training.  And there were a few other instances were I had to wonder about the translation.While the French part was well done I didn't feel the author knew America and Boston as well.  I couldn't picture a knifing and hate crime like that in a bar, not even if the guys causing the damage were drunk.  And a wound to the gut takes a long time to recover from - But with Christmas around the corner, even a few months away, I couldn't picture anyone being able to lift that tree and help set it up.  (I deleted just who is gutted so this review isn't spoilerish)The main gripe I had was the way the story was told and not experienced.  David was explaining about his life going on and on and on and I kept waiting for a break but that didn't happen for pages.  Then he finally gets on the plane and I assume is sitting in his seat --  I did wonder how he had his face at James' waist and see his shirt ride up yet he could tell James was 3 inches taller than his own 6'2"".  How could he tell how tall James was just by eyeing him?  Oh yes, the unit measures with height were a bit off in translation too.  But whatever.  It made the story more authentic if you can get over how off it reads.  Almost forgot!  Green Card Lotteries do exist.  I had to look that one up, never heard of it before.  How weird to 'win' your chance to live in the states.As a side note I would have loved to see David give James that drawing from the plane -- Even as a Christmas gift.  And why in the heck wasn't David drawing in his spare time?  I expected him to visit the cathedral and have that inspire him. I'd say  - Dan's WifeEDIT:  After thinking about it I lowered the review a star.  When a book is translated to English the editors should step up and do their job.  They didn't for this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6WOJGVOLFQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107P4IPU#wasThisHelpful","RS6WOJGVOLFQ8","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After all the five star reviews and because I tend to read shifter stories, I decided to try this one.  Nothing to lose, it's on the KU program.  So my expectations were high even if this was a 34 page story.The top review goes into this wonderful imagination of Kit.  Is that because the story is told from Kit's viewpoint and he's bored on a road trip and is fantasizing about his step-brother Cole?  Because he can feel an evil vibe of their new town?  Eyes staring?  Well guess what, Cole felt the same way.  As the title is ""My Werewolf Stepbrother""  I realized one of the brothers was a werewolf.  I was thinking Cole had some hidden depths, maybe he was the were.  He already has the build and 'fur'.So in this short entry to the series we learn about Kit, he's younger than Cole,  I assume he's out of school since it didn't look like there was a school there in that ghost town and no talk of school.  The reason I mention that because we aren't quite given Kit's age.  I assume under 20 and over 16.  Was he driving or a passenger on that drive?Cole is big, brash, the leader, older than Kit, yet he's Kit's best buddy as the two had grown up together and bonded together.  Yes they are step brothers.  Cole has this bad boy image where Kit is the voice of reason.This extremely short story ends on a cliff hanger.  I detest cliffhangers and it's an instant reaction to lower ratings when a story ends with one.  A good writer won't do that to his audience.  My other thought is. . . .Running for your lives and there's time for smex?  The very first time together?  We're talking young adults and they have no time to process things or talk it out.  No, they're on the run and fearing for their lives.  And what was up with their mom ignoring them when they needed her?  So tired they can't talk, bloody, clothes torn, shock must be setting in and she turns away?  No, sorry.  The guys should at least have cleaned up, talked, and fallen asleep.This one may have been well written and edited but the situations to push the plot were overdone.  I couldn't suspend my disbelief  - It dropped and with the cliffhanger it died.  - Dan's Wife","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMNQB6NO4XL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZBCA4EE#wasThisHelpful","RIMNQB6NO4XL2","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I realize I'm the first to review this book.  I also realize I haven't finished this book.  What I did do was read the sample here on Amazon and it's set up completely different than the kindle download.I'm one to ignore grammatical mistakes, sentence structure and the like.  What made me stop reading this story is the set up.  I even changed the page spacing to see if another variation would improve anything.  It didn't.Opening chapter:""  Anything to drink, sir? "" The waitress smiled at me.""  Oh no thank you.  I ' m waiting until my boyfriend arrives.  ""IE:  Every contraction has space around it.  Instead of don't it's  don ' t.The floating quotes bothered me, too.There isn't double spacing between paragraphs.  Or conversations.  It just rambles on and on.  The logistics of all that took me away from the story and I couldn't get interested.  It was too distracting.  The odd thing is the sample here on Amazon isn't like that.

"Lion's Claim is the first book I've read by Briar Omance.  If this is the first published story by this author, it has a lot going for it.  The story flowed and wasn't always told from one viewpoint.  The characters were interesting and believable.  The situation between the two wasn't original because there are so many shifter stories out there but it was well thought out.So Josh's friend entices him to go out clubbing but not just to any club.  This is a shifter owned one. Josh wasn't really interested, had just about decided to give up on relationships but decided to tag along.  From the moment they're in line, Josh knew the club catered to a different type and he felt out of place, under dressed and the odd man out.Mercer is a pride leader, a lion shifter, on the lookout for his fated mate.  He has a deadline and like Josh, has just about given up.  But he is here at the same club as the last resort.  Once Mercer's gaze lands on Josh, all bets are off.Like I said I enjoyed this story.  Yes it is a common theme of shifters and finding your fated mate.  But if this is a first book as I think it is, it's written a lot tighter and seamlessly then some authors that have zillions of stories out.  There's enough background to know the plot, the characters are well defined, and the story ends when you know things will work out.  Once I was done I had to check and see if another book was out by this author and was disappointed when I didn't see anything.  I wlll be checking back to see if Briar Omance writes more, especially about Mercer's Pride and how things go.  - Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFG2LHCOICKLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010EXMS5M#wasThisHelpful","RFG2LHCOICKLX","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I enjoyed Dane's Syn and it had a lot of elements going on. . . . This is more of a overarching story with the big picture and less focus on Syn and Dane.  Even though this is their story, too.  The series expanded so much, really taking on a life of it's own.First off this series is about Leopard Shifters.  Syn and Dane are Leopard Shifters, Syn is a dominate being the brother of Alpha Talyn.  Dane is of a submissive class called the Prim.There is more action, more conclusion on what is going on with Talyn's Coalition and conclusion on the Council problem until one of the Council Enforcers wants revenge.  So the fallout happens and more is added on.  Stick in a mission for Dane and Syn and things get hopping.I'll say that Syn and Dane may be bonded now but their story isn't finished.  Dane had a complete character change from how he acted all his life.  There's going to be adjustment to that yet Syn loves Dane, regardless.SPOILERS and THOUGHTS:Dane drank vampire blood and there's no idea what this will do to him or the baby he's carrying.  The doctor was to examine Dane but that never happened.  So we're left guessing about Dane, the changes, if they're going to get worse in time, or if the baby is affected. Then there's the threat of the vampire returing to taunt Dane and get Dane to drink more vampire blood.  What a situation to have with a budding relationship!No, I didn't feel Dane's story is finished.So there's issues with the wolves on the west coast.  Issues with Salvador, Talyn's father.  Salvador's agenda.  The Council's agenda or at least two of the councilmen and their plans for Stillwater, the area where Talyn's Coalition  lives.  Then there is the threat from the Council Enforcers and wanting answers to the missing Hans.  There's the alliance with the vampires that happened without Syn saying a word about the message he was supposed to present.  And who knows just what that tow truck driver was doing.  Added to all that is a missing wolf and vampire.  How do they tie into this mess other than the vampire betrayed his brother and coven leader?  Oh yes and the wolf was the brother of the wolf alpha.  Two prominent guys that are missing.  Oh let's see. . . . Yeah.  There's more.What about what Talyn will do about his father trying to take over his territory, come back out of retirement to reclaim his coalition?  What about the Prim and their group, leader, and issues?  That was a big deal to Dane, a big part of his life and as this is Dane's story why wasn't that resolved?  Instead it's left up in the air and Dane left wondering how he'll be treated as he lives around them, still has to put up with them, even if he isn't housed with them.  As Dane is more aggressive then he used to be of course this is important.Like I said this story was enjoyable but there are so many inconclusive parts.  If it's a lead in for more answers I'm all for it.  I just hesitate because Lynn Hagen doesn't always conclude plots - I know cause I've read so many of hers and offered more than my share of reviews.  So I'm just on the fence here to see what will happen and of course if Dane and Syn's story will be concluded.  This book didn't do it. - Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YZ14OQASPL0Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNT7KZM#wasThisHelpful","R1YZ14OQASPL0Q","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rocket Man is a story set on a space station.  It's about Max, a war hero, an elite soldier that left the war without an occupation.  With time he's settled into owning his own scrapyard on this space station.  He's barely making a living, starving half the time, but unwilling to give up.  He's fiercely competitive, full of street smarts, and into this life steps his old military buddy Kyle.Kyle is with the Special Forces and they have a job for Max.  They need his expertise to capture someone in the government there on the space station.  Does Max have a choice?  No.  It's either doing the job or being arrested.  Great choice.Now Max always had an interest in Kyle and Kyle felt the same way.  But the war interfered.  Now they're back together, working as a team, not under the best conditions or circumstances but at least they can now act on that attraction.  Under the never ending heat they worked a dangerous job.  They knew they have a good thing. ..  Yet part of Max's problem is with Kyle taking away his life, his job, his reputation, his sense of security.  How would anyone feel when the person you want to build your life with is destroying the one you have?The characters were real, the world interesting, the situations believable, and the outcome wonderful.  Some of the inner thoughts shifting through Max's brain got a bit old at times but overall a really great story.  My only thought is why didn't Kyle and his boss get to Max sooner.  But I guess Max had to become his own man before this segment of his life.  - Dan's Wife","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKM29X1F6U7MM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJLT368#wasThisHelpful","RKM29X1F6U7MM","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The magician in this story is 'John', a short man with a big presence.  He doesn't look like much but he gets things done.  In his odd way he came to the town of Dustville to escape his past.  He inherited land there -- Who knows how much land or  why it's so run down or who he inherited it from. . .But that's John's reason for coming and living in Dustville.Henry is the town sheriff..  He's not trained for the job but can hit things he aims at.  Like John he also has a past, one he's running from.  This is the story of John and Henry getting to know each other, acceptance for who they are.  Add in a bit of magic, two men together, and a frontier town, set about 150 years ago.As for the writing -- Sentence phrasing was odd.  I don't know if  it was because Henry was trying to impress John or if it was the author trying for a historical feel.  As the story was told from Henry's point of view it'd make sense if he could pull it off.  But no, Henry was from a poor background in the South, I felt he didn't have the background to think or converse in those odd sentences.  The effect didn't translate well.The Magician of Dustville  is set in a frontier town after the Civil War.  Actually it was called the War Between the States back then and if Henry was fighting for the South, he would have called it that.  (Because once more this is Henry's viewpoint and he specifically said Civil War).  It isn't until our day that we call it a Civil War.  Another problem I had was that magic school back east.  Education was a lot different back then.  I bet Henry wasn't very educated.  And if there was a magic school, how did that impact the war?  Were mages used?  ??  !!I know people struggled hard back then and church attending and morals were in high regard.  It all went with modest clothing and the horror of 'girls of ill repute'.  So for a small town like Dustville to  accept John and Henry's relationship . . .  It was just a bit too pat.  The rivalries that divided the country were still going strong, even when the war was over.  So if people were upset over the outcome of the war and knew someone was in your town and fought for the other side, of course they're be problems.  That was a reality.  It was probably why Henry didn't want his desertion from the South to be known.  So yes, I had a hard time believing in this world.  There wasn't any background on why magicians are accepted, trained, and schooled or why a school is even there for them.  And yet even Henry knew of this magician school and he's been in the army or in a frontier town -- Another fact is that it's difficult traveling across country and news isn't up to date or reliable.  So I have to wonder about Henry knowing of this mage school.We don't learn why that dying magician decided to make his last stand where John would be involved.  I had a hard time justifying situations and events in that type of world it just went beyond my ability to grasp.  - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NI1L3WAE0V3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBZSTBE#wasThisHelpful","R3NI1L3WAE0V3D","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed these bear shifter books, the various series that play off each other in TS Joyce's world.  This story, Bear the Heat does it all.  It gets down to the nitty gritty of a bear shifter's life and what's important.  No, not material posessions but respect, safety, family, and love.So the saga continues after the bear shifters 'came out' to the humans.  It's a time of turmoil, insecurity, and fear --  Both on the part of the bear shifters but also the human population.  Bear the Heat is just that - The focus on their town, their bear family, and putting up with it all with the added benefit of watching Boone's mating.Cora is a reporter from a local news station.  She was mentioned in previous books.  She's always supported the shifters and of all things. . . .She's Boone's mate.  Yet due to the uncertainty going on Boone doesn't want to put her career or life at risk or 'become a monster like him'.  Such a wonderful loving bear, a firefighter, a close sibling and loyal son.  I enjoyed the back and forth with Boone and Cora yet the story is greater than those two.  It talks about preconceived ideas and how hatred exists.  It's about standing up for others and being there for them despite the odds.  It's about taking the happiness you have now and valuing it above all else.  It's about changing people's minds a bit at a time and hoping for a better tomorrow.My only little nit pick is that dream of Boone's.  It was of his family being hunted down, shot and killed.  It was intense and the way it occurred I wasn't sure if it would come true or not.  Since it happened early in the story, I saw it as an attention grabber, something for the free sample to give a 'cliff hanger' feel.  It wasn't explained if this was prophecy.  It was barely referred to when Boone talked to Cora.  It was just an odd dream of killing off all the series main characters - Something no reader ever wants to happen.  - Dan's Wife","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M6NOHNNQW5WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLQU8UU#wasThisHelpful","R2M6NOHNNQW5WM","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having enjoyed the first book in the Coyote's Call series, I was excited about this one.  The opening with Gael being homeless. .. The despair, dealing with hunger, being cold, alone, and trying to survive. . . . In his case for 20 years.  I could picture exactly how the public ignores the homeless, even when they're right there in your space.  I don't know if it's embarrassment or pity that turns help away.  It is an issue to be aware of, to do what we can in our own way to help those that are less fortunate.  Gael's plight was so well done and I appreciate an author that takes the time to talk about social issues.Then there's Iker, a detective in Del Rey, a wolf shifter that is a part of a Coyote. .. band.  Yes a group of coyotes is a band.  The relationship with Iker and Gael was fast but heartfelt.  Again, like the first book I was a bit tired of all the pages of sex.  I would have liked more plot and research into what went on behind the scenes, solving the crime, a bit more with Gael's homeless pal, and what in the heck was the relationship with Roman and the Ranger.  There's just enough hints to make me wonder about each and then . . . nothing.  Was the ranger a shifter and what in the heck was he injected with?  What about that relationship with Roman?  Then there was the shoot out and there wasn't any conclusion about those mountain lion shifters.  How come no detective work is shown when Iker is a detective?  No, the case is just dropped in favor of sex in the apartment and thoughts of buying their own place.  *sigh*A big part of this story is about the crimes done to Gael and his family -- It was the set up for the plot, the basis for this story.  So when those crimes weren't solved, the plot falls apart.  At least it did for me.  I was left with too many questions in this conclusion.  In From The Cold doesn't solve the 'cold case' at all.  Nope.  - Dan's Wife","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IBV91OXYVWYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XC1NDLC#wasThisHelpful","R1IBV91OXYVWYL","A19MXYAHMAC99A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19MXYAHMAC99A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thick and warm. Buttons are large enough and spaced enough that in the dark, you'll be able to adjust them. Cozy and comfy. I also tested the less expensive version of this (the mircofleece). This does live up to the PLUSH factor. Side by side in the packaging, the Plush was much fatter/thicker (yet not heavy).For me, there was slightly noticeable texture difference...the plush was a bit softer, spongier.Heating wise, they are identical - and have two cords, one for the right/left side so it's going to mean you'll need two free outlets. I'm not plugging in my husbands side, however, as he's always too warm anyway.If you can afford to splurge, this is a nice model and slightly more luxurious.But if you are watching your pennies (I guess more like dollars these days!) - go with the microfleece.

(that is the time zone for Eastern) and your all set. 02 for Central, 03 for Mountain, 04 for Pacific.""My problem setting it up had been do I wait for the signal to search for seven minutes or do I press the Wave button while it is searching. This makes is much more clear.It is working great now. I'd give 5 stars for customer service but 2 stars for the directions included with it when first sent out. I hope they can rework directions because it's an awesome little device once it's working.Here is my original review published on 10/28/15Very confusing directions. Went to the website for help...couldn't find the model. This is my first time using a weather forecast/monitor. But the directions should make it easy for someone who has no idea how to set it up.I honestly have no idea if this is actually working or not because of the confusing directions.I have no idea what the RF button is used for (other than as an UP function).I received this for free for testing purposes. Spent over an hour trying to determine if it was actually working - and searching for help on the website listed - had I spent the almost 60 bucks this is selling for at the time of this review, I'd be way more frustrated.Horrible directions and virtually no explanation of unit.UPDATE: 10/29/15 -I appreciate that a representative commented on my review and I will be contacting them via the email they gave. The unit seems to be working  though I have no idea how I set up it. I finally gave up and it seems to be reading the outside temp/inside temp correctly and forecast matches weather outside. However, the time keep reverting to three hours prior (ie: I'd set it for 2pm, it would be set and matching my time zone, then a few hour later, it would go back to 2pm.).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GXG55G9LZDLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016S6J794#wasThisHelpful","R3GXG55G9LZDLZ","A6SZZSMX7DQG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6SZZSMX7DQG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very interesting. This is a bit on the creative side with some poems (only a few). I was most interested in how he got his start and he does go in detail about how he got his information about Clinton/Lewinsky. It's fascinating to read this book (written in 2000) knowing the continued success he has had.It's truly an inspirational story - from nothing to something - simply for doing what he loves and doing it because he wants to be helpful - not with some end goal of having tons of money in the bank at the expense of misleading/taking advantage of people.We need more Drudges in the world - though it's becoming increasingly more difficult with the political regulations created to stifle the Matt Drudges of the world.The last quarter of the book was mostly about the media corporations merging - and they have morphed and merged so much more in the last 15 years, yet the bottom line remains true: It's a monopoly - with a few pulling many strings and it's about power and control, not about enlightening and empowering people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26B2XYWP9UKPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451201507#wasThisHelpful","R26B2XYWP9UKPL","A6SZZSMX7DQG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6SZZSMX7DQG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are a few good nuggets of info in this book, but my word, Michael Port is a bit pompous and though he speaks about being humble, really does not practice it.The only valuable part of the book (for me) were in the back half of the book that talked about how to divide a speech/focus points.Everything else was just Port tooting his own horn about how wonderful he is.After reading this, I heard him on an EOF podcast and my personal observation that he is a bit of peacock was verified.He admonished the host of the podcast and said that speaking off the cuff was frowned upon - yet, I've heard many speakers who are great on the fly (and perhaps, that's what makes them great).It's as if he was saying people can't possibly be successful unless they do it Port's way.I disliked him immensely after hearing the podcast - he was way too practiced and rehearsed and it felt like he was 'phoning' it in.I probably would have given this 3 stars had I never heard the interview. But after the interview, I thought if you end up sounding like Port, better to skip this book and just watch youtube videos of Ted Talks, Brian Tracy, Jim Rohn or (my favorite) Zig Zigler. Emulate.

"As a lifelong student of the behavioral sciences and advertising, combined with my travels and experiences of living in the real world vs academic world, I was eager to read this book but found it quickly dissolved into PT Barnum dissertation that will take advantage of easily influenced people.To his credit, Holmes did point out that the study of psychology is fragmented. Too often, researches focus on their status - their goal is to ""discover"" something new and collect the accolades that follow, elevating their status within the community. Holmes points this out in a story about the discovery of ancient species that different researches claimed as their own discovery and therefore,  one species was ""discovered"" over 20 different times by 20 different researchers. One researcher pointed out that this is like 20 different researchers claiming and renaming Newton's Law of Gravity as their own discovery.The ironic thing is that Holmes cites different researchers throughout the book, and a resourceful reader who has been exposed to the irony in the world of behavioral studies, will be acutely aware of these inconsistencies and examples.I was quite disappointed in the underlining antisemitism coursing through the book. I thought the story about Hand and Hand in Israel started off great, but then quickly dissolved into a veiled attack on Jews. There are many many instances of Jews being attacked, not just in Israel but all over the world, especially in Europe where they are fleeing in rapid numbers. A non-biased book would have included a story about Jews being taunted and discriminated against - but Holmes does not include any, which confirms his bias.If you can get your hands on a copy of any of Albert Hobbs books (check the library), you will learn something valuable about the industry of behavioral sciences and experiments and how behavioral science is not really a science as there are too many un-measurable and subjective variables.And if you want to read a great book about how marketing is disguised in medicine and science (including the marketing of researchers), read ""The Father Of Spin"" by Larry Tye; it's about the father of public relations and how he manipulated the medical and scientific community to make money or a name for his clients.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OHFYFWLO3FNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348371#wasThisHelpful","R2OHFYFWLO3FNE","A6SZZSMX7DQG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6SZZSMX7DQG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the future, the Blood Plague has crippled society and the Doctors now rule.  Ren Grant’s parents were killed by the Doctors and she has been on the run since as a Carrier of the Plague.  When Ren is finally found, it is not by the Doctors, but by Rian Sloan and his group who are looking for a Keeper’s Watch.  Ren happens to have her mother’s Watch.  Rian needs her Watch to board a ship and escape Earth.  Ren travels with Rian and his group to Myrreka.  Ren goes through an adventure that will take her through danger, friendship and new trials.Ren really captured me from the beginning of this story.  Her situation and mode of survival made Ren interesting and easy to care about.  I was intrigued by her backstory, her mother’s secret and the mystery of the Watch.  It was fascinating to see what had happened to other cities after the Blood Plague as the group travelled.  Ren grew as she found her dynamic within the group and learned more about her past and how to defend herself.  For me, some of the travelling sections dragged a little for me.  The story picked up again for me as Ren’s Watch began to show its potential.  The ending threw me for a huge loop and ended on a bit of a cliffhanger, so I am really interested in the next book.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X6H1KO1FHFEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ5TREW#wasThisHelpful","R2X6H1KO1FHFEX","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Addie Bates has retreated from her past life of abuse, secrets and a nefarious deed into the routine life and protection of the Sleepy Valley Nudist Colony.  Within the colony, Addie feels safe and protected from the mistakes of her past until Addie and the other girls from the colony are scheduled to exhibit at the 1935 World’s Fair in San Diego.  San Diego is part of the world she left behind, and where the sister, Wavey, that she has broken bonds with still lives.  Addie tries to make amends with Wavey, but instead finds her two nieces Rumor and Mary.  Rumor is determined to get to know her new found Aunt Addie and help her mother and aunt make amends.I was fascinated by the setting of this book; I honestly don’t think I have ever read anything set in a nudist colony.  I really enjoyed reading about Addie’s daily schedule, the routine and philosophy of the nudist colony, especially how it was perceived by the different age groups.  It was also nice to see the degree of freedom that this group of women had, especially in the 1930’s.  The World’s Fair was also wonderfully described and I loved getting a chance to imaging the Garden of Eden and some of the other sideshow acts.  The point of view switches from chapter to chapter between Addie and Rumor.  All of the women’s characters are very developed.  Addie’s current life as well as her past and the secret she was keeping kept me interested at every turn of the page.  Rumor stole the show at some moments with her vibrancy and tenacity.  There were some parts for me where the pacing seemed slow waiting for the big reveal of the secret, but it is worth it in the end.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36REKT7KPOONX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XB1TJIE#wasThisHelpful","R36REKT7KPOONX","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Josephine Breaux makes her living as a newspaper reporter; however during the Civil War she must write under a male pseudonym.  As a female, she is able to get information from both the Union and the Confederacy.  When her cover is blown, Josephine is arrested at a traitor and spy.  To her surprise, Pinkerton Agent, Franklin Gray takes her instead to Washington where she meets President Lincoln himself.  Lincoln wants Josephine on a mission in New Orleans collecting information for the Union.  Josephine arrives in New Orleans during the height of the fighting.  Josephine’s past helps her get through the battles, but some other people from her past want to bring her down.I love reading about women in the Civil War.  The Crescent Spy offered an exciting account of another brave woman who gave her all during the war.  Josephine’s character is very intriguing with her past as interesting as her present.  Josephine is intelligent, fast-thinking, brave and compassionate.  I loved seeing her perspective on the battles and her news stories.  Josephine acts truly selflessly in all of her actions throughout the war.  I was very impressed with Josephine’s decisions and thought process in her determination in the Union taking New Orleans.  There was very realistic battle scenes and historical information, also.  I loved that the romance took a back-burner to the plot, but was still a great part of the story.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWN4RHF6EEBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503945588#wasThisHelpful","R2AWN4RHF6EEBC","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Friends, Leah, Nicole and Hayley are looking forward to their beach vacation.  When they arrive, they find an unappealing surprise.  A whale has washed up on the shore and the police are investigating!  Someone has poached teeth from the whale.  When the girls notice some men acting strange, they decide to act.This is a great story for middle readers.  It brings to light the  important issue of poaching that isn't usually discussed with kids.  The writing is simple but exciting, helping kids dig into the issue.  The characters in the story are easy to relate to and go through the process to ultimately make the right decisions and bring the poachers the attention of the authorities. With a great message and great characters, A Sandy Grave makes an exciting and educational story.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RWJWJIC6LPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161633455X#wasThisHelpful","R2RWJWJIC6LPX","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ellen Hale is now a fighter, after surviving repeated traumas; she is now a master with a machete and can dispatch the undead with ease.  She is now a fully functioning, contributing and trustworthy member of her compound.  Along with her adopted sister, Mellissa, she has built up a life for herself.  So, of course a threat to their way of life is not far off.  However, the threat is not zombies.  The compound leader has overheard that a band of marauders is looking to take over their compound next.  He asks for volunteers to move to fallback positions so not all of their people and materials will be compromised.  Ellen and Mellissa join up and are chosen as assets to go.  On route, the fallback team picks up a stranger, Tyler, a blacksmith with skills the team could use.  Some of the team is wary, but Ellen’s first instinct is to trust him.  When a traitor is discovered within the ranks, Ellen’s trust will be tested.Ellen has definitely grown by leaps and bounds in this book.  Now she is a strong female fighter who is able to protect herself and be an asset to her community.  I was really glad to see the logical thinking of the compound leader when trouble arrives; many times this goes by the wayside in times of panic.  As the team is on the move, there is a lot more action present than in the first book.  Ellen really gets to show off her new machete and survival skills.  Also, the behavior of the zombies is described a little more in this book and I think that there will be some interesting things with that.  Tyler is a nice addition to the team and his blacksmithing skills and a plus.  I really liked how he and Ellen are moving slowly and gaining trust.  I can’t wait to see where the story goes next.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37XOCUAJWR8EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZT2A09A#wasThisHelpful","R37XOCUAJWR8EN","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ellen Hale is a graduate student in library science when the zombie apocalypse begins.  Things get even worse when a band of marauders kills her brother and captures Ellen.  Ellen is then subjected to torture and rape by the marauders, who are keeping girls as a commodity.  Ellen and her roommate, Mellissa are eventually freed by a group from a nearby compound.  Ellen’s scars from her capture run deep, though and she has a difficult time recovering even within the relative safety of the compound.  When a few guys from a nearby halfway house show up, Ellen begins to pull out of her funk and gets to know one of the men, Quinn.  However, just as her trust in men is returning, a zombie attack takes it all away.This was an interesting and quick zombie read, perfect for Halloween time.  While the zombie threat is even present, the focus is more on the human threat and how people choose to act in times of crisis.  Ellen is an interesting character who goes through a lot of trauma in a very short time.  She deals with it all in a very realistic way, going through all the stages despite the zombies surrounding her.  Quinn seems like just the right person to pull her out of her downward spiral.  Watching their relationship grow is great.  Ellen will definitely be a character that is able to grow and transform over time.  What I liked best of all is that this book focused on the human aspect and not just the zombies, showing that other people can be the greatest monsters or your best allies.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BA6C5TQHRTH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R706JLA#wasThisHelpful","R3BA6C5TQHRTH0","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up reading Little Women, so when I got the chance to read about its creator through the eyes of her younger sister, May.  May is an aspiring artist who also wants a husband and family.  Louisa sees herself as too old to get married and would rather help where she can and focus on her writing.  The two sisters end up clashing over many things, however they keep their sisterly bond.  Through war, travel, successes and failures a portrait of two sisters is artfully drawn.I loved learning about the sisters and their real lives.  I really enjoyed learning about May and Louisa’s relationship with each other and how that translated into Louisa’s character of Amy in Little Women.  Even though Amy is portrayed as very self-involved in Little Women, she is drawn in a new light, a struggling artist herself who had the limelight stolen from her by Louisa’s success.  Most of all, I enjoyed the realistic portrait of two influential and forward-thinking women of their time.

"The beautiful Sicilian town of Bellafortuna, Italy sits high on the countryside next to the Tyrrhenian Sea, perfect for the production of wine and olive oil.  The town was idyllic, until the Vasios moved in.  The Vasios loaned money to most of the villagers including the wine and oil producers that had crushing terms, high interest and the ability to come collecting at any time.  With this system, many of the families are in debt to the Vasios and feel their oppression.  One family of wine producers, the Sanguinettis, have remained untouched by the Vasios.  Antonia Sanguinetti and his son Giuseppe feel compelled to help pull the town out from under the Vasios control.  With a little help from opera, the Sanguinettis may have a plan that will band the villagers of Bellafortuna together to take back control of their lives.First of all, I absolutely loved the setting and beautiful descriptions of this quaint Italian village with wonderful views, wineries and even the ruins of a previous village.  The characters and their relationships also shone, Giuseppe captured me with his extreme heart and capacity to care.  I loved his friendship with Biaggio as well.  I also loved that opera was a theme throughout and proved to be the force to band the town together, what a unique unifying factor!

"Gilbert and Aoleon are hot on the trail on the Luminon’s plot to stop Martian Galact production and invade Earth for milk.  Now, the Luminon’s guards are chasing Gilbert, Aoleon, Bizwat and soldierbot Helios across the Martian desert.  They must all try to survive a dust storm and Martian worms before Aoleon’s parents are killed.Aoleon and Gilbert’s mission turns to real danger in this episode.  There is a lot of political and government conspiracy theory and secrets on both the Martian and Earth’s side, one thing we both have in common!  Some of my favorite and funniest parts were when the Martian’s went to Earth looking for milk dressed as Quakers and the soldierbot Helios, his defeatist and sarcastic attitude was perfect for defusing tense moments when the gang was in a tight spot.  As in the past episodes, the bright, digital pictures add to the story and really help me visualize the different Martians and robots.

"Melangell is a Morwyn Ddraig, a Lifebringer to dragons.  Once she accepts a dragon egg, the Creil, her life is dedicated to its protection and education.  Unfortunately for Melangell, King Arthur is set on defeating Melagnell’s entire race in order to find a capture a Lifebringer of his own in order to raise the dragon egg for his own benefit.  Melangell is captured by the King’s brother Cai and must fulfill her duty to the Creil.  While Melangell is detained with her egg she begins to notice her captor, Cai in a different way.  However, she is sworn to protect the Creil and there is where her obedience must lie.When I first saw that Sacrifice was a historical fantasy novel that blended dragons and King Arthur, I knew I had to read it.  From the very beginning, I was caught up in Melangell’s story and character.  She was obviously strong willed, quick-thinking and daring, Melangell lives up to duty to sacrifice.  With such a strong female protagonist, I did not even mind the romance between her and Cai.  It all seemed very natural and they both grew from each other’s presence.  This story also showed King Arthur in a very different light, while not really a character, his influence is that of a usurper, a conqueror and a man who will use any means to get ahead-even stealing and torturing a dragon.  The dragon Creil itself and Melangell’s bond with it was another great aspect of the story for me and I loved the combination of dragon lore with historical fiction.  The language got me at some points, with the Welsh spellings, I got some of them, and didn't get others.  My only complaint is a few slow moving scenes, but these did not detract from the overall plot, message or awesome ending.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4COP8UL2PGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0994352719#wasThisHelpful","RI4COP8UL2PGH","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kat Ryan has been called the ‘perfect mom’ by many when she goes out with her three daughters.  She seems to be the envy of other moms who can’t quite seem to get it together.  In this memoir that recounts her three births and raising three girls through their toddler years, Kat lets us in on the craziness, embarrassment, joy and love that can come from motherhood.With a whole chapter dedicated to poop, yes just to poop alone, this book offers a realistic view into what a new mother might be in for.  With a stress on the fact that everyone’s situation is different and nothing you do for your child is wrong for you, Kat gives us her down to earth insights on her forays into motherhood.  Starting from the birthing process, this book is not for someone of the faint of heart.  Kat had three very different birthing experiences that she tells us about along with three very different experiences with her newborns.  Some of the best advice in the book is the funniest, what went wrong, poop on the walls, milk squirting everywhere, toddlers that simply refuse to be potty trained until their ready, the magic words to stop sibling rivalry and potential trips to the emergency room.  Overall, this book is perfect for any mom or mom to be that needs to know that nobody is perfect, but whatever you decide for you and your child will be perfect.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19UOFLMBQRTXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1457539020#wasThisHelpful","R19UOFLMBQRTXM","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Camp Sumter or Andersonville is already hell on Earth for the Union soldiers.  Starvation, unsanitary conditions and fighting between the prisoners means that survivors are surrounded by constant death. For Barclay Lourdes, a black soldier, Andersonville provides even more struggles.  Barclay’s first objective is to survive, but he is in Andersonville for another reason, too.  Barclay is trying to figure out just why the conditions are so bad and if something supernatural is at play.  Barclay starts to notice many strange things in the camp, lead and bone in the cornmeal and strange brands on the dead.  When he finds out what is really going on, it is much worse than he imagined.At first this book sucked me in as a piece of historical fiction.  The descriptions of Andersonville, the treatment of the prisoners and some of the shady business that went on inside was written in a gruesomely detailed fashion and I had no problem imagining the emaciated men, the gross food and the array of characters that patrolled the camp from either side.  Barclay Lourdes was also an incredibly intriguing character, a black Union soldier, but never a slave.  He is hiding secrets from the very beginning, but those secrets are very surprising and layered.  The introduction of the supernatural element was definitely a slow build, but worth it.  This wasn't something I was fully expecting, or anything I had even heard of before.  It was interesting to see how this element just intensified and fed off of all the atrocities that were already happening in Andersonville.  Overall, a very well done historical fiction novel with a touch of  supernatural horror that managed not to take away from what really happened at Camp Sumter.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROG64OF8PLU08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWDZZGK#wasThisHelpful","ROG64OF8PLU08","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lady Godiva of Coventry was raised both as daughter and son and is fiercely loyal to her people and lands.  When her parents unexpectedly die, their absence leaves Coventry open to attack from the Dane, Thurkilll the Tall.  When Lord Leofric of Mercia arrives with aid, Godiva wholeheartedly accepts, thinking of nothing but her people and her home.  Godiva’s trusted knight; Edmund has warned her that Leofric’s aid will not come without a price.  When Leofric names his price, Godiva again only thinks of the safety of her people.  With a new union, Leofric and Godiva have more of a business agreement and a battle of wills than a marriage, but with Godiva’s spirit, Leofric may be the one who falls.I did not know much about Lady Godiva going into this book, other than her naked ride.  However, I was hooked from the prologue and Lady Godiva is my new hero.  I loved Godiva's spirit and personality, how she would do anything for her people. Godiva's character was created to be strong, an actual warrior who fought with her people, intelligent and a good politician during a tumultuous and dangerous time.  I especially loved that she made the best of the situation and became a peace weaver, with the beautiful term fripwebba.  The writing was enchanting and endearing, making the characters and this time period come alive.  Sometimes I find it hard to relate to people so long ago, but Godiva, Leofric, Edmund and Aine all felt like people I could relate to.  This story is about so much more than the famous naked ride, it is about a woman with immense strength, courage, and bravery that saved her people and eventually herself.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PGHUZ76TGZ7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250066158#wasThisHelpful","R1PGHUZ76TGZ7X","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a memoir of a very large French-Canadian family written by Pauline Kiely.  With the title ""No Poverty Between the Sheets,"" I figured this would provide a humorous view of growing up in such a family.  Kiely provides this looking back from when her parents first came to Canada from Ireland and France to the day she was born to her time as an adult.This memoir is filled with amusing anecdotes, comedy and raw emotion.  I loved reading about this family's experience through time, especially the 60's and 70's.  It was very interesting to see how music, the mix of cultures, drugs and the changing decades affected the family.  I really loved all of the stories about animals and the song lyrics from her family.  The story and some of the  anecdotes did seem a little disjointed at times, I never really felt a good flow.  However, it was a good book to pick up put down over the day.

"Aoleon and Gilbert uncover the Martian Government's plot led by the Luminon to starve the Martian society by depriving them of their galact, invade Earth and steal their cows.  Aoleon and Gilbert race to the Galactworks plant to try and stop the sabotage.  After a strange discovery and a close escape, Aoleon has to take her final pilot's exam where trouble catches up to her once again.This book was filled with excitement from beginning to end.  After learning a lot about Mars and the government in the second book it was nice to have an action-packed third book. It was great to finally see the Luminon and his cronies, the pictures really helped to bring these characters to life.  Also, the galact factory, I had been wondering what those Martian Cows looked like.  The events within Aoleon's pilot exam were surprising, there was more excitement with more nefarious characters and I was glad that Gilbert began to step forward as the hero a bit.  With the event that Aoleon and Gilbert uncovered in book three, I'm sure book four will hold more mysteries and excitement as well.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R214N8F4B4BYO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0979128552#wasThisHelpful","R214N8F4B4BYO6","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lady Isabella Farrah, the older and unmarried daughter of the Ambassador of New Civet happily spends her days assissting her father with his duties.  At the masquerade ball for Glause, Isabella is taken with the mysterious and magic Lord Pecus; called the Beast Lord.  Lord Pecus has been cursed have the face of a beast and always wears a magical mask in order to disguise his true face.  As the ball progresses and Isabella finds herself dancing with men too young for her, she also stumbles across he murder scene of her friend and Civet’s Head Guardsman, Raoul.  Isabella can not help but be involved in the investigation that is lead by Commander of the Watch, Lord Pecus.  However, when her father is implicated in the murders, Isabella decides to be held in custody in his place at Lord Pecus’ manor.  While she is imprisoned Isabella will not only try to solve the mystery herself, but try to unravel the Beast Lord’s curse.This is an enchanting and witty re-telling of Beauty and the Beast with a great mystery woven throughout.  I automatically fell in love with Isabella’s character as well as some of her sidekicks.  She is just as capable as the men, not to mention incredibly inquisitive, intelligent and brave, even when it lands her in trouble.  As well as her inquisitive nature, she had an incredible sense of fashion and was no fool for love.  The scenes where she and Lord Pecus interacted were always entertaining and I couldn’t wait for their next encounter.  Lord Pecus’ background and curse is still a bit of a mystery to me and I wish I could have known more about him.  The mystery was exciting as well, even though I had part of it figured out rather early.  The blending of the fairy tale and new mystery worked very well.Recommended for readers of the Parasol Protectorate series, Isabella reminded me a lot of Alexia.  Isabella and Lord Pecus’ relationship also had the same feel as Alexia and Lord Maccoon.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JAUWJBJOKDGM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1503331490#wasThisHelpful","R1JAUWJBJOKDGM","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In thirteen century Kievan Rus, which is now made up of parts of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, Princess Sofia is being sent away to Constantinople in fear of the upcoming Mongol attacks on her city.  As her party travels away from the only home and family she has ever known, Sofia’s camp is attacked by the very people she was trying to avoid.  Sofia is captured as a Mongol slave by the warrior Argamon, who raped her and kept Sofia as his own as believing she is part of a prophecy that will bring him good fortune.  Sofia is crushed, but her spirit stays strong.  As she navigates her new life in the Mongol camps she comes to terms with her relationship with Argamon, her religion, and the customs of the many different people who now surround her.  As Sofia grows and begins to assimilate to life as a Mongol, she opens herself to friendship, love and acceptance of other people.This was definitely one epic journey through a treacherous time period and setting.  I went into the story not really knowing much of anything about the Mongol invasions, so everything described was a learning experience for me.  Through Sofia’s point of view, the Mongal people, customs and her part within this very different society was masterfully detailed.  I was very interested to learn about their intake and treatment of people that they had captured, their leadership hierarchy, mix of belief systems and even their food and lack of bathing.  The beginning of the book when Sofia was leaving Kievan Rus actually felt a little slow to me and was difficult to get into, it was not until she was captured by Argamon that the pace livened for me.  Sofia was an intriguing character, she was very young when she was captured, but was fortunate enough to be educated and have a stubborn streak, both which proved useful with the Mongols.  Her and Argamon’s relationship was an absolute rollercoaster, and quite unexpected.  I would never think that Argamon would be a character that I could relate to or respect, but as Sofia grew up, became more knowledgeable and opened herself to understanding, her attitudes about Argamon changed.  Overall, an intense journey with unexpected outcomes.  I will be reading the second book of the trilogy to see what happens to Sofia next.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1934XVD542LZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1475213085#wasThisHelpful","R1934XVD542LZD","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sarah Brown, daughter of abolitionist and Underground Rail Road conductor, John Brown is invested in her father’s cause to help escaping slaves. She wants to assist in any way that she can, especially since she was left barren after her fight with dysentery; Sarah offers up her artistic skills to paint landscapes that act as maps to freedom. After her father is wounded and sentenced to death for his raid on Harper’s Ferry, the Brown women travel to the Hill household in West Virginia to see their father for one last time. While at the Hill’s Sarah learns more of the Underground Railroad from their son, Freddy Hill, as well as making a lifetime Friendship. In the present, Eden and her husband Jack look for a new start in an old home in West Virginia. Eden and Jack have been trying to conceive for years with no luck, leaving Eden feeling emotionally drained. A new home, a new dog and new relationships with the people in the small town might be just what Eden needs. When she finds a broken doll’s head in her basement, Eden and the girl next door, Cleo begin a mission to find out it’s mystery that will link them to the past.I love dual-time stories and historical fiction, so I feel that this story was made for me. Both Sarah and Eden’s stories were interesting and I felt an equal investment in each. I was happy to learn more about Sarah Brown and her father, John Brown and Sarah’s important role in the Underground Railroad. Sarah is an inspiring character; she was educated, talented and determined to help with the abolitionist cause. Her paintings may not be as remembered as her father’s raid, but they impacted many people. Sarah’s link with Eden in the future was well done, I was glad that they were not related in some roundabout way; but were two women unable to have children and feeling the constraints of the emotional and societal effects of that fact. In their stories they each eventually come to terms with that fact and find happiness in their own ways.This book was provided for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VAY7U9GI7UL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6PCX9M#wasThisHelpful","R2VAY7U9GI7UL7","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jane Austen’s love stories are timeless romances sprinkled with endless wit and intriguing characters.  Where did Jane find her inspiration for such romance and characters when she herself was never married?  Carolyn V. Murray takes inspiration from little known facts about Jane’s summer spent in the Seaside town of Sidmouth and imagines Jane’s intense love affair with Royal Navy Lieutenant Frederick Barnes.  Jane’s father is a clergyman who has fallen on hard times.  Jane is now a daughter with poor prospects, but high hopes in the romance department.  After a failed encounter due to her family’s status, Jane is apprehensive of another failed relationship and accepts her future spinster status.  However, after a chance encounter with the determined Lieutenant, Jane’s heart begins to soften at the chance for love.This was an incredibly sweet story that also felt very authentic.  I think Murray did an excellent job capturing Austen’s voice, personality and interactions.  Jane was an amazing character, full of life, complex emotions and plenty of tenacity and cleverness.  It was very interesting to learn about her family, their circumstances and Jane’s relationships with them, especially as these relationships affected her fictional characters.  I loved Jane's ups and downs within her relationship with Frederick, it seemed like such a natural progression and they were so perfect together.  I really enjoyed seeing how her changing perspective on Frederick and love itself influenced the character of Darcy in her writing.  Overall, this was a highly entertaining, sweet and quick read for any fans of Jane Austen or historical romance.This book was provided for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0NH1ACQOZ45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011E62MN6#wasThisHelpful","R3J0NH1ACQOZ45","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hazel grew up one of many children in a rural southern town, but she was determined to get more out of life and found a job in a pharmacy.  One customer, Floyd, swept Hazel off her feet with his ideas for business and outlook on life.  Soon, Hazel and Floyd are married and settled in Delphi, Mississippi where Floyd sells vehicles. Hazel is expected to be a society lady, but doesn't quite fit in.  She does, however find contentment in driving. Hazel begins a family with Floyd and has two healthy boys, but still has trouble seeing herself as a good mother.  When her youngest son dies in a tragic accident, Hazel is devastated and slips into drinking and depression. Floyd hires Vida as a maid and to take care of Hazel.  Vida takes the position to try to enact revenge on Hazel's neighbor, the sheriff who is responsible for Vida having to give up her son.  Hazel and Vida don't exactly see eye to eye, but they are able to come together over the loss of their sons and the racial discrimination that Vida and the other maids face. Together, Hazel and Vida will prove an unstoppable force in campaigned for civil rights in the Deep South.I completely fell in love with this story and the characters.  More than anything, it took me back to Mississippi in the 1950’s.  From the manner of speech, Hazel’s many “I swan’s” and Floyds motivational quotes to Hazel’s interior decorating choices and Vida and her father’s experiences made everything very realistic.  Hazel and Vida also brought this book alive.  Even more than their quest for Civil Rights, the book is about Hazel and Vida’s own growth.  Both women are broken over the loss of their sons.  Hazel turns to drinking and Vida turns to revenge.  Their struggle with what it means to be a mother and their growth as characters during this time in history is what is really highlighted for me.  The Civil Rights movement is what allows the women to move on.  I really appreciated the author’s authenticity with women being the driving force behind many of the protests and movement of information at the time.  I felt like this gave me a great look into another piece of the Civil Rights movement that I never would have known.This  book was received for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVR4W4IW6HFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940210046#wasThisHelpful","R2FVR4W4IW6HFM","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The grief is effecting her training, her decisions and the way she responds to others entering her brain, making her vulnerable to attacks.  Her training and assignments are very interesting to me and I liked seeing inside Tracy's mind and seeing her defenses and Mackenzie's way of breaking them down.

"Emil is growing up in Passau, Germany under Hitler’s rule.  He attends his Deutsches Jungvolk meetings with fervor and wants to be a pilot.  Emil begins to see the faults in Hitler’s plans as tensions arise and the hatred of the Jewish people grows.  Emil’s friends Moritz and Johann discover the truth behind the German propaganda with the BBC news broadcast over a shortwave radio, not everything is going so well for the German’s during the war and fatalities are much worse than reported.  The three friends decide to distribute the news with the help of Johann’s sister, Katharina.  As the years pass, the boys grow older and are eventually trained to fight and sent to the front for a war they no longer want to fight; even Katharina finds herself in training as the German losses mount.Playing With Matches proved to be a moving coming of age story told from the point of view of a German teen.  The history in the story really grabbed me and I learned about the German Youth meeting, the effects of World War II on the average German Home and the efforts of The White Rose resistance.  It was interesting to watch Emil’s character grow as he began to emulate his Deutshes Jungvolk leader and argue with his parents as a youth, to seeing his Jewish friends business destroyed, to taking huge risks by distributing treasonous pamphlet and eventually fighting.  Emil’s character struggles through many emotions: fear, hope, survival and love to create a realistic story of a German youth growing up during World War II.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMEM6257F0T97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=192754744X#wasThisHelpful","RMEM6257F0T97","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 14th century, England and Scotland clamor over land. The Scottish clans struggle to fill an empty throne while Edward ‘Longshanks’ Plantagenet seeks to take their land from under their noses.  Amid the chaos, one Scotsman stands out as a leader.  Named ‘The Black Douglas,’ James Douglas emerges as the hero to his people over the English. However, his story is not that simple.  As a young man, James fell in love with Isabelle MacDuff, the MacDuff clan crowns monarchs as the Stone of Destiny sings.  James also befriends Robert the Bruce, an enemy of the MacDuff clan.  Fated to fight for the friend who will be King and the woman he loves, James’ decisions will determine Scotland’s independence.An epic story filled with war, love, magic and history, The Spider and the Stone tells the incredible tale of Scotland’s War of Independence.  I didn’t really know much about this time in history going into the story, so everything was very informative and interesting to me.  I was immediately intrigued and felt the most pull towards Isabelle MacDuff’s story.  I especially liked that a recurring theme was that the women of Scotland would have to prove stronger than the men in order for Scotland to succeed.  Isabelle’s story surely portrayed this.  Much of the story was political, which can get a little tedious for me, but never boring.  The action scenes were well done, very exciting and realistic.  I was intrigued by James’ ingenuity on the field and the tactics he used.  I also enjoyed the incorporation of the legends and magic into history.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TB9I7IH8V3IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981648401#wasThisHelpful","R1TB9I7IH8V3IL","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A wealthy Swiss businessman has traveled the world and adopted six daughters, all named after the stars in the Pleiades constellation.  The sisters have grown up with a life of privelege and have all been able to go their separate ways to fulfill their dreams in adulthood.  Upon their father’s death, whom the sisters lovingly call Pa Salt, the sisters are brought back together at their childhood home on Lake Geneva, called Atlantis.  Here they realize that they do not know much of their father, or where they came from. Pa Salt has left each daughter a letter with clues to their past if they want to find out more.  The oldest daughter, Maia, who works as a translator takes the opportunity to follow her clues to Rio De Janiero, Brazil where she uncovers her past with the help of an author that she has translated for.  She finds that she is connected to an aristocratic family and through her Great Grandmother’s letters, Maia learns of Izabel a Bonifacio’s time spent in Bel Epoque Paris and her connection with the Christ the Redeemer statue.Enchanting and addicting, I could not put down The Seven Sisters.  Maia and Izabela’s dual timelines unfold much like a fairytale, two elements that I love!  There are mysteries upon mysteries that pulled me into the story.  Each sister is introduced in the beginning, and each has their own distinct personality and their own past to find. This book focuses on Maia.  Each of the characters has astounding depth; Maia is compassionate, emotional and intelligent.  Maia’s intense feelings drew me in and rooted me to her story.  When Maia reaches Brazil, her sense of adventure is tapped into and another layer is uncovered.  The story flows flawlessly between Maia and her great-grandmother Izabela, and I loved both stories equally.  Izabela and Maia’s stories parallel each other’s lives and both are strong female characters that are fighting for want they want out of life.  I love that Izabela’s story took me from Rio De Janiero to Bel Epoque Paris, where she met sculptor Paul Landowski and his assistant Laurent Brouilly where I could learn of the construction of the Christ the Redeemer statue.  I can’t wait for the other sister’s journeys.

"Jack Starling is a 25 year old ex-SEAL  who is having trouble finding a job, needs therapy and plenty of meds to deal with his headaches.  He also hasn’t had any luck with women.  At his therapist request, he hasn’t had any contact with the members of his SEAL team; but, when one of his team goes missing, Jack re-assembles everyone for a dangerous mission.  Jack’s friend, Moon, has been abducted and taken to a secret base in New Mexico.  Some strange things are going on in this base and Jack doesn’t find out exactly what until he meets an even stranger woman.  Cassandra is like no one Jack has ever met before, and for a good reason, she is not from this planet.  Cassandra has insight into the base and the aliens that run it, but what do all the aliens want with Earth?A quick science fiction read with lots of action, government conspiracy and aliens.  Jack was an awesome character with a ton of great skills and an awesome personality, but is also very realistic to the experience an ex-SEAL might experience.  Cassandra is also engrossing; she is very close to a human and a strong, female warrior of her species.  I was really intrigued by the different alien races, what they are doing on Earth and any possible threat that they might be to humans.  There is a lot to think about with what Jack finds out about the aliens and their purpose. There is a lot of science, technology and politics involved with this, but it is well explained and there is some really cool technology in here.

"Justice is having enough trouble with her life between classes at a prestigious law school, dealing with a house of her sorority sisters, and troubles with her ex-boyfriend, Calvin.  She really didn’t need a force from somewhere inside her directing her to kill herself.  Now, Justice has to convince her family and her therapist that she isn’t crazy or suicidal.  Justice is doing pretty well until her sister takes her to a psychic for her birthday and the psychic gives her a very specific reading about a man entering his life.  Her reading comes true as Justice meets two incredibly handsome and mysterious twins, Dante and Marquis, one of whom she can’t get out of her head.  Justice’s ex-boyfriend, Calvin also decides to come back into her life and tell her all about his job protecting humans from the creatures of the night, Vampyres.This was an entertaining, quick paced, paranormal vampire read.  I like that it had a different type of vampire, still dangerous, but integrated into society and known to exist by some.  Not all of their abilities and lore were explained in this book, but so far it seems really interesting; they can be out at all times of day when they wear a special piece of jewelry and they can seem to feed without turning victims.  Dante’s history was intriguing along with his potential interaction with Justice was very intriguing and I really want to know more and bring more of the past into the present narrative.  Justice is an interesting character; she is dealing with a lot of crap and paranormal stuff, but is holding it together pretty well.  There is a lot of mystery involved with the vampires themselves as well as the Cerebus agency, which is meant to keep them in check.  A lot of things still need to be explained, there is a quite a cliffhanger at the end and there were a few editing mistakes, but none that affected my enjoyment of the book.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JZL1KCPCONBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJHKVR4#wasThisHelpful","R3JZL1KCPCONBX","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The small, old mining town of Cavus, Montana holds a dark past that stems from an ancient evil.  Most of the town does not know the true events that led up to the fire that killed all of the residents of Cavus except one girl named Jessi and the now famous black squirrels.  Jessi’s husband, Pill now keeps the secret of what truly happened all those years ago, and he sees the signs of the evil coming back… just in time for the town’s annual Black Squirrel festival.  Some members of the town notice that something is just not right with their friends, family and neighbors, but for most it is already too late.  The Feeder has found a way to spread itself quickly and efficiently through the town’s brand new beet sugar plant.Consumption is a classic type of horror story with a slow burning plot and an interesting monster. From the prelude, where we first meet the monster, The Feeder, as it likes to be called, I was intrigued.  I liked that this is a smart monster that takes over people and changes them little by little, bringing out their darker side and a hunger for human flesh.  I liked that all of the characters who noticed the changes were underdogs:  John and Erma Scott are trying to move on with their lives in the face of tragedy by moving across the country, Star, a teen going through a rough time, Javier, and immigrant determined to make more of his life, and Pill, an older man whom everyone discounts.  While there are a lot of characters introduced, the characters stories are rich enough that they are easily distinguishable and the writing weaves the subtle horror aspects throughout each of their stories and eventually bringing them together.  Some of my favorite parts were of the Feeder’s past, when it inhabited Lucy in 1908, and Jessi’s journal about its reappearance in 1930’s.  The ending was very strong for me, exciting and suspenseful as the Feeder showed its full potential and those left over decided how they would act.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A6Y1BJGB3MGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O02CBJM#wasThisHelpful","R1A6Y1BJGB3MGN","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harley lives in the small town of Shadow Pines, where the town lives up to its name; Harley sees detached shadows roaming around the town from time to time.  After Harley’s mom disappears and her dad brings home Amy, her new step-mother, Harley begins slipping.  Harley is getting in trouble at school and can’t seem to shake her abusive boyfriend, Nash.  On her 16th birthday, Harley receives an invitation from the new Curiosity shop in town offering her a free gift.  Three other students that Harley goes to school with receive the same invitation, Teaghan, a loner, Gianna, an active, smart student and Brock, Mr. Perfect.  Everyone receives a strange Shadow Box, they are told that they must trade someone to the Shadows, rendering them non-existent, or a loved one will be taken in their place.  The teens must decide what to do with their new power, will they use it responsibly or will it go to their heads?This YA urban fantasy had a really interesting concept.  What teen wouldn’t want the power to get rid of their worst enemy?  The story is told through two of the teen’s point of views, Harley and Teaghan.  Each of these girls has their issues, Harley has a step-mom who clearly doesn’t understand teenagers and has plenty of issues with her boyfriend, Teaghan has extreme social anxieties, stutters when she speaks to anyone and has no friends until she and Harley are brought together.  I could identify with some of the issues that each of the teens was going through and it was engaging to see how each of them dealt with the decision they had to make with the Shadow Box.  I was intrigued by the Shadows themselves and the concept of them needing to be kept fed to keep more and more disappearances from happening.  I do wish a little more was explained about some of the other weird things in the town, such as the forced medication, drivers permits only given to those deemed worthy and the fact that no one seems to move out of town.  Also, the prologue and epilogue seemed a little disjointed from the bulk of the story and I wonder if it will be explained in the next book.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R161N6RO78NXTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOTEQWG#wasThisHelpful","R161N6RO78NXTF","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"322 years after the apocalypse, a small group of survivors have carved out a way of life on a small island in the Pacific. They dedicate their existence to Bennet Ashby, the man who found the island and created a material to contain the force that caused the apocalypse. The island is governed by a group of Elders who are tasked with keeping the delicate balance of life within the island, births and deaths, jobs and limited resources. The Elders also hold many secrets from the rest of the islanders. These secrets do not sit well with Ashley Wortham, whose constant questions have gotten her in trouble. Matched with the vile and abusive Wesley, Ashley decides to fight back. When Ashley murders Wesley, her best friend Mason receives the blame and is slated for execution. The Elder's come up with a solution that will fit their needs and deal with the accused murderer Mason and troublesome Ashley- send them off the island too determine the conditions on the mainland.This was a unique look at a post-apocalyptic society. The lies that were told and the secrets the were kept by the Elders and bothered Ashley intrigued me also. I could easily relate to Ashley's inquisitive, adventurous and determined character. Mason, though happy to play his part on the island, is also courageous and shows a deep care for Ashley. The politics on the island were fascinating and the cast of Elders added depth to the plot since they all have different intentions. My curiosity piqued when Ashley and Mason reached the mainland. There were many surprises here, one which totally threw me with Ashley's character. I was also really interested in the cause of the apocalypse and what the Elders understood about it. The ending is very fast-paced and leaves off an a huge cliff-hanger. So, I still have many questions about the founder of the island, the apocalypse itself and the fates of many characters.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IVA59F3URU16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIP1BJG#wasThisHelpful","R1IVA59F3URU16","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Adelaide's mother has lovingly nicknamed her Snow White as she tells Adelaide the story of her birth within the small village of Cologne in the 13th century.  After a fever sweeps the town, Adelaide's mother perishes.  Adelaide's father, a humble shoemaker scrapes together enough money to bribe the town priest, Father Soren, to give a proper funeral for her mother.  When the funeral goes awry, Adelaide becomes enraged at Father Soren and begins to learn of the wrongdoings of the church, she is also set on revenge and the redemption of her mother.I am a sucker for fairy tale retellings and could not wait to read this series.  Adelaide's story is set firmly in historic reality but shows a glint of fantasy and magic here and there that would lend to the stories being woven into fairy tales through time.  Through the writing medieval Cologne was brought to life along with the struggles of the people at the time. Adelaide, her family and some other townspeople are all firmly set in this installment.  I immediately loved Adelaide's fiery spirit and willingness to right a wrong.  I also fell in love with Ivo, a young man apprenticing as an armorer that Adelaide is friends with and grows fond of.  Their beginning romance is done well, and is incredibly sweet so far.  Adelaide's father and her mother's cousin, Galadriel were not as likable of characters, but their places within Adelaide's story are foreshadowed.  This is only the beginning of Adelaide's story and I can not wait to see what happens with the characters as well as how more fairy tale elements are woven in with the next book, Countess Captive.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12VXJ2R91DVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0086PD3BO#wasThisHelpful","R12VXJ2R91DVB","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Naples, Italy at the turn of the 20th century, Tommaso Labella gets the chance to photograph the medium Alessandra Poverelli.  Tommaso captures a photo of Alessandra levitating a table and Alessendra captures his heart.  Alessandra's ability to levitate tables, produces knocks and become possessed by spirits soon earns her a following along with much skepticism.  One man of science, psychiatrist Camillo Lombardi believes that there may be some scientific explanation to Alessandra's feats.  Lombardi takes Alessandra and Tommaso on a tour of Europe for shows and scientific testing; meanwhile, Nigel Huxley, head of England's Society for the Investigation of Medium believes that Alessandra is nothing but a cheat and launches a campaign to bring her down.Based on the real and turbulent life of Eusapia Palladino, Alessandra Poverelli's story is brought forth in a magical interpretation. Thorugh the eyes of Tommaso, Alessandra is placed in an enchanting but realistic light.  Tomasso and Alessandra are both from the impoverished section of Naples, and Alessandra's attitude shows it.  She is fiery and defiant and will not be put up with being called a cheat.  I enjoyed Tomasso's point of view since he didn't care if Alessandra's talents are real or not, he just cared for her.  One of the mysteries carried throughout the book was if Alessandra truly had powers.  The writing was done in a mesmerizing way that allowed the reader to decide.  Set in the age of Spiritualism, I was intrigued by the power struggle between science and paranormal and religion and the Spiritualist's threat to the church.  With all of the competing viewpoints, Alessandra's struggles made for a fascinating and engaging read.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15EOUQV6K2RXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RQPETM2#wasThisHelpful","R15EOUQV6K2RXY","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adrienne Beauvier, granddaughter to the Count of Challembelles has always had visions, a gift of clairvoyance, just like her grandmother.  To a young Adrienne, her visions are nothing but fun stories and insights into the lives of others. However, to most everyone else, Adrienne's visions cause distress and they believe her to be troubled, much like her late grandmother was.  Adrienne's Aunt Marie, a domineering and manipulative force in the family is especially unsettled by Adrienne's stories of her visions and does not want any more rumors about her family flying around their small French town.  As Adrienne grows, the two people in her life who provided security with her gift are taken away from her.  Aunt Marie believes she has the perfect solution to the her family's issues with Adrienne; she will bring Adrienne to her home in Colorado, the newly built Miramont Castle, to live with her cousin, the Father Julien Morier.  Once Adrienne arrives at Miramont, however, she realizes that there are no limits to her Aunt's meddling ways.This book was not at all what I expected, but I was still on the edge of my seat the entire way through.  First of all, this is not a story of a haunted house, but rather about how the life of a person might cause them to haunt a house.  Adrienne's story is tragic and there is no happy ending here, even though at points the story seems similar to a fairy tale with an evil aunt, a  locked away gifted girl and the hopes of prince charming coming to the rescue.  This is a story the grows with suspense and has many little mysteries, from Adrienne's first visions there is a growing feeling that something just isn't right. The writing does a beautiful job adding to the foreboding atmosphere, there is a lyrical prose and abundant detail to set the scene and create the unease of the characters surrounding Adrienne.  Most interesting to me was that the story included many true details from the actual building of Miramont Castle and the actual mysteries surrounding the building intrigued me even more.  Overall, Miramont's Ghost is an emotional, tense and unsuspected read for someone not looking for a happy ending.This book was provided for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32KBOYSARZHGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTBWMJ6#wasThisHelpful","R32KBOYSARZHGK","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rebecca has just been dumped by her abusive boyfriend; she is left alone on a bridge in the rain contemplating her life and a new identity.  She decides that she will now be Caden, a stronger version of Rebecca. With nowhere to go, Caden is glad when a car stops to pick her up.  Gabriel is a little rough and rude, but he reluctantly allows Caden to sleep on his couch for the night.  When Caden wakes up in the middle of the night, however, she does not find the Gabriel she met before.  Now, he calls himself Tom and he is kind-hearted and childlike.  Tom also invites Caden to stay forever, the exact opposite of what Gabriel told her.  Caden begins to wade through the disassociated identities of Tom and Gabriel to find the key to bringing the two personalities together, but might end of finding more about herself.The plot was really intriguing to me, not only because Tom/Gabriel had disassociative identity disorder, but because Caden decided to stay and try to figure him out when others have obviously failed him before.  Both the characters were a little difficult to get to know since they were both in the process of finding themselves.  This only made me more interested as the characters grew.  Caden seems like a rebellious teen at first, but with helping Tom/Gabriel, she seems to find her place in the world.  Caden's absent but controlling mom bothered me a bit since she was still seventeen, but not enough to ruin it. I thought I had the mystery behind Tom/Gabriel disorder all figured out, but the ending threw me for a huge loop and now I need the second book right now!This book was provided for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X12KX0RTHURF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PTYKTZ8#wasThisHelpful","R1X12KX0RTHURF","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Camille Claudel aspires to be an artist, a profession in which women did not often practice in 1890's France.  With a disapproving mother, but supportive father, the family moves to Paris so Camille can attend an art school which will accept women under the advice of sculptor Alfred Boucher, who sees a great talent in Camille.  With schooling, Camille's talent flourishes but she also becomes obsessed with her work.  When her tutor, Alfred Boucher must leave, he asks Auguste Rodin to take over instruction for Camille.  At this point, Camille's work becomes inspirational, but a love affair with Rodin causes her to loose her grip with reality.I wasn't quite sure that I would enjoy the subject matter of this book, but I liked the time period that Rodin's Lover was set in and I enjoyed Becoming Josephine, so I gave it a try.  I ended up loving it.  I was completely captured by Camille's character.  She is a little wild and fiercely independent, she does not care at all for the standards of women at her time.  At first, she just seems like a woman born into the wrong time period.  As Camille begins to become absorbed in her artwork and she begins an affair with Rodin, we see a gradual dissent into illness.  There is a created tension of what Camille believes and what is actually happening that adds a layer of suspense.  In addition to just learning about Camille's life, I was also thrown into Belle Epoque Paris as Camille and Rodin visit different Salons and encounter other artists of the time. Most of all, after reading this book I appreciated learning about Camille's life and was inspired to look at more of her artwork.This book was provided for free in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLSB0SIQDEDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFZ8JCA#wasThisHelpful","R2WLSB0SIQDEDS","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ellie Jordan is a ghost hunter with Eckhart Investigations out of Savannah, Georgia.  Ellie and novice hunter, Stacey receive a new case of a haunting at the Treadwell house.  The Treadwell family have recently purchased an old estate in hopes of fixing it up as a bed and breakfast.  Since they have moved Anna, the mother and her daughter Lexa have seen and heard evidence of a ghost.  Meanwhile, the father, Dale is in a deep case of denial.  Ellie and Stacey stake out the house and do research and find that they have clear evidence of a haunting. It seems like all they have to do is trap the ghost and collect their fee, but this haunting is not an open an shut case.First of all, the cover does not fit this book at all.  It makes the book seem like it is a young adult novel and that it might be a little kitschy.  This is really a new adult aged novel with no romance and it offers up a solid haunted house plot with engaging characters.  I especially liked that for a story about ghosts, it was rooted in reality as much as possible; if you love any of the ghost hunting shows out there, you will like Eillie Jordan.  Ellie Jordan is a serious ghost hunter, her past had led her to want to help the living rid themselves of the dead and she takes her responsibilities in earnest.  Her partner, Stacey is fun-loving and has great one-liners, offering a good balance. The haunting and ghosts were wonderful.  The history of the house, the events that happened there and the purpose of the ghosts made for a suspenseful and gripping story.  Though I guessed part of the twist early on, there was more to it than I expected.  I will definitely be checking out the rest of the Ellie Jordan books.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHZB0MK2FIL0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NO4S94I#wasThisHelpful","RHZB0MK2FIL0T","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Maggie is beginning to feel insecure about her age and her relationship.  On a birthday dinner date Maggie decides that she needs a break from Doug, which quickly turns into a break-up.  Now, single and less than a year from 40, Maggie has to try to figure out who she is and how she knows what true love is.Maggie is a very real character. She is clumsy but fun and her favorite pastime is watching TV.  Her journey from love lost to self-discovery is one many women could relate to.  Maggie's friends and family add comedic relief and drama, I'm sure we all have an Aunt Helen in our lives that is blatantly honest and seems to bring up topics at the worst times.  As I followed Maggie through her year until she turned 40, there was a great amount of insecurity about her ticking biological clock, the age itself and all of her friends and family members that were her age and married with kids.  At some point, this became a little overwhelming to me, but as Maggie began to discover who she really is, there was a great relief.

"Years ago, humans destroyed most of the planet creating a world of harmful UV radiation and scarce food.  Under the dome of the Purenet, the wealthy live a carefree life with engineered food and protection from the sun.  Skylier and her family live in Cueva, an underground system outside of Purenet.  Skylier and her brother want nothing more than to be able to raise enough money to buy medicine for their mother's cancer.  To do this, they must go to Purenet and be chosen for the Sanction Games or to be a Host and bear a child for a Purenet family. When Skylier gets to Purenet, she realizes that there are many secrets hidden from her and that everything is what it seems.This was a quick, fun dystopian read.  After the initial info-dump about the Cueva, Purenet, the Sanction Games and some of Skylier's family history, I was able to actually get to know the characters a little more and get a feel for the setting.  Things picked up for me when Skylier was in Purenet and realized that she could read the thoughts of someone other than her brother and that the leaders of Purenet were harming the outsiders.  I didn't feel an instant connection with Skylier, but the book was pretty short.  Some of her decisions were good, some not so good. There is a lot of action going on through the last half of the book and some unexpected twists that kept me excited.  I actually could have used a little more information about how the world came to be so volatile and some more background on some of the people that Skylier met in Purenet, just not in info-dump form.  I would be interested in the next book to see what happens to the characters and what they decide to do with the information that they have learned.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R371RZKLW8JEVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1505665019#wasThisHelpful","R371RZKLW8JEVA","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Princess Eglantine of Cray has been trapped in a world of sleep and dreams by a Witch who was forcefully separated from her own daughter.  The Witch has cursed Eglantine to sleep forever, unless her brother frees a terrible beast.  In her endless dreams Eglantine has found that she can visit the nearby Kingdom of Fallund and that one of the Princes of Fallund, Prince Henry can hear and see her.  Meanwhile, Prince Duncan becomes engrossed by a prisoner, a beast that turns out to be a young woman sentenced for murder. How will all of these events unfold to create a happily ever after?So, I'm a huge fan of fairy tale retellings and I obviously loved this combination of two different fairy tales.  The merging of the two tales was done very creatively and not at all what I had expected.  I was not expecting Eglantine to be such a prominent character since she was asleep; however, her ability to dream herself into Prince Henry's life made her an important figure.  I was surprised that Prince Henry acknowledged the woman that only he could see in his everyday life, making many of his advisers and subjects think he was crazy.  The beast was also unexpected to me, not a man, but a terrible past trapped inside of a young woman.  I was most intrigued by the beast or Ovinia's character and I would have loved to learn more of her past.  Of course, in the end and in true fairy tale fashion, love finds a way to break the curse.This book was received for free in return for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WN4M13XYTQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5Q7R8Q#wasThisHelpful","R5WN4M13XYTQL","ARRKLOBORSZ0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARRKLOBORSZ0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are not sight reduction tables for general use. They are special use only and they are the only tables that go out of date. They are quite useful for certain applications (see the other 3 star review and my appended comment.) Don't buy this volume of this publication if what you are hoping for is a set of sight reduction tables you can use in marine navigation and keep for a lifetime.If you are learning c-nav from one of the many great books that use H.O. 249 as their basis and want to follow their lead you need H.O. 249 Volumes 2 and 3 of this publication. You do NOT need Volume 1. Furthermore H.O. 249  Vol's 2 and 3 are better if acquired in the government spiral bound versions. The paperback (commercial) versions won't lie open to the selected page and surely will not last as long.

"The author tries to make the subject matter a little more approachable and fun. If you like that sort of stuff the effort is laudable. Unfortunately the text has several errors particularly in jargon and in underlying principles. e.g. The mean sun isn't the one you see in your sextant. Homonym humor aside, (""mean"" as in nasty as opposed to ""mean"" as in the mathematical average) his handling of this subject is just plain wrong. The whole constellation of Aries isn't the 0 point of celestial positions. That would be the First Point in Aries, which is the spring equinox, which is a very specific point.  Or his description of circle of position deduced from a star sight as a ""great circle"" which except in very special cases it most certainly is not. Great circles extremely important to celestial navigation, and clearly he doesn't know what one is.He corrects some of these misstatements after going on in absolute error for a few pages by adding foot notes, but by then you are more confused than if he had just laid it out properly to begin with. Other things he never straightens out. PLEASE DO NOT try to learn celestial navigation with this book. You will learn much of it incorrectly and that will lead at a minimum to confusion and disappointment in the future, and possibly much worse.In the end he falls back to the same old same-old of all the other books I have read on the subject: ""I don't really know why this works or what I am doing, but if you follow the forms and fill in the blanks you should get a solution somewhere close to your position.""I would love to see the author take another try at the subject but with a ""geek"" (as he refers to those of us who take the math and science seriously) looking over his shoulder to assure his errors get straightened out.

"Pretty much what you expect from a vinyl kitchen or exam glove. Decent weight and durability. The size at extra large is only very slightly longer in the fingers than the  usual ""large"" size I can get locally (different brand.)  The wrist diameter is about the same so they these are a little hard to get on over my hands. When I do get them on the extra length in the fingers makes for a poor fit. I could have used a bigger wrist diameter and about the same length in the fingers as large. Frankly if both sizes are going to be a struggle to get on then between the two I'd rather have a good fit on the fingertips. They are also packed so tightly into their box that you can't get them out one at a time (like a tissue box.) I struggled and wound up tearing the box so badly that the gloves were everywhere.

"Great coverage in a concise manner of the concepts of celestial navigation, but you had better be up on the jargon before you delve in. They do cover the acronyms, but rather quickly and not in depth. However if you have come to the point in your studies where you are comfortable with terms like:  GMT LAT GP  LHA  GHA  AP  Ho  Hs  and so on , this will put the theoretical principles together for you in a concise explanation better than any other resource I ever seen. Easy and quick to follow and fun to watch though a bit ""Campy"" because of the 1960's vintage animated characters.I second what the other reviewer has to say about the added feature of ""History of Navigation.""  It may be a little interesting but it is not at all related to the study of celestial navigation. It is far more interesting in terms of what we were thinking about for high tech navigation ooptions in the days before GPS became a reality. Still I would have given the overall DVD 5 stars because the C. Nav instructional part is excellent and no one says you have to watch the extra feature;  and unless you are just curious or bored I wouldn't bother.Here is my rub:THERE IS NOTHING SPECIFIC IN HERE ABOUT CELESTIAL NAVIGATION AT NIGHT !In fact only the LISTING says ""....Navigation at Night"" the ACTUAL package for the DVD makes no such claim. So it isn't the producer's error, it is Amazon's listing error. Celestial at night is a subject that no one seems to pay any attention to other than to say the horizon is unreliable for regular sextant sights without ever offering much insight as to why that would be so or what accuracy could be expected in moonlight conditions. If you are offshore away from city lights then three weeks out of four there is plenty of moonlight to see a horizon, so I was curious about why isn't it done? I have made passages when the availability of a clear sky and a clear horizon has eluded us for days on end. If my only opportunity was a night sight after a time like that you can bet I would take it.... but it would be nice to know what considerations/limitations/corrections to apply to the result. When I stumbled on this listing I thought there might be some subject mater on nighttime c. nav and I wanted to see what insights might have been offered. After all the Polynesians and the Arabs did it at night.... or so the lore tells us... so why not present day navigators? Of course night sights are possible if you have a bubble horizon as would be always be used in aircraft and sometimes used as an accessory to marine sextants. Since this DVD is about aircraft celestial navigation I suppose you could argue that it would apply to night sights... but it isn't specific about night sights.In summary;If you want a concise explanation of what the heck you are actually doing as you thumb through the almanac and the sight reduction tables, as well as a great explanation as to how to thumb through those tables, this is the best resource I have found to date. It really pulls it all together in a way that makes it make sense and instructional part is only 50 minutes long total.  I'd bet you couldn't read and understand Mary Blewitt's fine and popular book on the subject in an hour!

"These are pretty good quality for clip-on flip-up shades.  Better than most. My only disappointment is that the tops of the tinted lenses are even with the top of the clip mechanism which then means that they HAVE to be above the tops of the clear lenses of the glasses they are clipped onto. Obviously the clip mechanism can't go lower than the top of the frames or lenses, and so the top of the clip mechanism is above that.... so you see what I'm getting at here. In my particular case the amount they are too high is exactly the amount they don't cover at the bottom of my lenses. I even tried cheating them down below the cross-lenses top bar on my aviator style readers to clip them to the lenses directly. That's better, but not perfect.This design flaw means a less than perfect fit on just about any pair of glasses I can imagine.... unless the spot where your shades are going to clip on  is lower than the tops of your lenses. That's too bad because other than that they are first rate.

"Replaced a broken ice maker in my Viking bottom freezer fridge.  I did have to swap out the full bin sensor bale and transfer a couple of clips off the old unit as well as re-use the wiring harness but even so the entire repair was done in about 15 minutes. Aside from those clips, harness, and the bale the ice maker itself is identical to the original. Now its making ice just fine. All at a fraction of the price of  ""Viking"" parts which aren't made by Viking anyway!Why only four stars? Because these types of ice makers use a thermostat to initiate cube harvest and re-start the entire cycle. At a certain temperature it starts things off.  Turns out this model's t'stat kicks things off at 12 deg, not the ususal 17 deg. This made it slow to cycle in my fridge, but I swapped the t'stat out with the one from the old ice maker ( very simple operation using only a phillips head screwdriver ) and things are up to speed now. Still a great deal on an ice maker, but too bad it is so slow to cycle because of the extra-cold initiation point. Maybe your freezer is colder and it will work fast enough for  you... or maybe you can just use your old t'stat like I did... Also replacement t'stats are about 10 bucks right here on Amazon.Another heads up: The test points between L and M measure 72 ohms on this model, not the generaly stated 4-8 k ohms.The supplier answered my questions promply and accurately.

"I needed this to clean up parts of my outdrive during a spring service. These chucked into both my standard corded electric drill with a 3/8 chuck and into the standard collet-like chuck of my Dremel flexible shaft.They took the punishment without shedding too many bristles and made short work of getting into otherwise impossible to reach crevices. For this sort of work the size is just about right too. Not too large a diameter for getting into tight corners, and not too long so that you don't inadvertently wire brush stuff you didn't intend to. After a few minutes use holding at about a 45 degree angle to the work the bristles did take a set such that they extended past the end of the wire shaft (but let me stress the brush did not fall apart or self destruct.) That meant I could use just the tip in some places.I just ordered some more of these to keep handy in my shop.

"Sierra changed hands lately. Sierra parts are dropping fast in quality. In the past I always had good luck with them as replacements for Merc or Quicksilver OEM, but lately they do not impress.This shift shaft mounts in your bellhousing. It goes through two seals which keep the seawater out of your shift cable cavity in the bellhousing which is also open to your U-joint bellows interior. A leak at the shift shaft seals causes the water to get into the shift cable where it wicks its way up to the engine end of the cable and rusts the cable end clamping screws. This is usually a syptom of this seal failure.  The water also gets into the U-joint bellows where it damages the gimbal bearing. From the U-joint bellows area water intrusion also rusts your U-joints on your drive shaft yoke and the land for the seal on the drive shaft into the upper gear case. That causes  water to enter your drive. Repairs of all this stuff is labor intensive, fussy, and expensive......and it all starts with an absolutely CRITICAL sealing point around this shift shaft.Therefore the surface of this shaft should be nice and smooth and polished so that the critical rubber seals (and in this case they are doubled up for redundancy in Gen 2 drives and retrofit to be doubled in Gen1  drives) can do their job.My shift shaft arrived with a sub-standard surface. Not shiny and smooth. It looks as if the entire thing was media blasted (sand blasted) after manufacture. I would reject raw stock if it was in the sort of condition the surface of this shaft exhibits. Garbage. My choice is to polish it myself before installation, a process that is labor intensive and may result in an undersized diameter shaft which now won't seal properly for a different reason, or to send the Sierra part back and buy OEM.If you have ever done the entire job of repairing the damages from an upper shift shaft seal leak you will NEVER cheap out on the parts. As expensive as OEM parts are they represent a small fraction of the cost of doing the job twice because of inferior aftermarket parts.I am very dissapointed because Sierra used to be good but this is not the first Sierra part I have gotten in 2015 that is simply garbage.Peter","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FF214UJS59Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XBB1P4#wasThisHelpful","R3FF214UJS59Z7","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Star 12-point end did not fit hinge pin properly. Other end is a hex and takes a 1/2 inch socket. The tool actually works better backward with the hex end in the hinge pin and 12 point end in a 12 point socket. Once I got it to fit it sheared off with only moderately-strong force on an 18 inch breaker bar.  Like 80 lbs pull so 120 ft-lbs.Thats not that much! Used a vice grips and a tie rod ""pickle fork"" to get broken end out of hinge because it had deformed. Thankfully the tool was so weak it didn't mess up the hinge pin.Merc puts these hinge pins in with generous red Loctite. You gotta ""gorilla"" them off! Why Merc assembles them  with red Loctite no one can say, just generally bad engineering typical of Mercury Marine....like the same way they make it so you need a special tool to remove 'em.....but tight they are, and anyone who has done the job will tell you the same.Here is a link regarding red Loctite and how to diassemble red Loctite-ed parts.http://www.us.henkel-adhesives-blog.com/post/All-About-Threadlockers/How-to-Remove-Red-Threadlocker/Bottom line heat to 500 F, which is hot but no where near glowing. Most kitchen ovens go up to 500 F.  Red Loctite is supposed to be permanent and intended to be used for non-servicable parts, ONLY heat re-liquifies it. Blue Loctite is what is intended for servicable parts..... like these hinge pins. This Sierra tool is NOT up to the job. Look around Amazon for other suppliers that have reviews of being up to the task. Heartland Products and Tungsten marine being a couple I found. FYI  a half inch hex (Allen) wrench socket fits the 12 point hinge pin and you can get one of those in a half inch drive impact socket, but you DON'T want to use an impact gun to remove the hinge pin. Too easy to bugger the 12-point head.BTW if you are about to begin this job you also need to remove the trim sender pucks, also screwed on with red Loctite. You need a hand-held impact screw driver ( the sort you whack with a hammer, not the version that looks like a power drill..... If the power tool version driver-bit slips or cams out you will destroy the screw head faster than you can let go of the trigger! ) to start those puck screws b/c heat will cook the pucks.  Buy a decent one 'cause it is a tool you will use a LOT on your Mercruser products.

"I have used many a Purdy brush while painting but I generally pick up less expensive brushes for less demanding work or general priming where the brushes tend to not get carefully cleaned daily; or for work where I know I won't be able to clean the brush properly so I'll probably wind up throwing it out after the job. (That happens to me a lot as I often do very small repair jobs for customers from carpentry to finish, including putting the few strokes paint onto my repairs at the end of the job. ) and  I had done just that with these 1 1/2 inch Wooster Golden Glo sash brush.Now paint brushes are deceptively complex tools. They need ""pick up"" or ""load"" the generous amount of paint without causing it to drip all over; they need to lay that paint down on the surface you are painting; then they need to spread it around. Finally they need to tip the paint film off so that you don't get brush marks. Not surprisingly there are many brushes that excel at one of these tasks but not at the others. There are trade off's in the bristle stiffness, the way the bristles are formed at their tips (good ones look a little like hairs with split ends, not just simple straight bristles.)  and then there is the thing about the bristles not falling out or going off in odd directions as the brush gets older so that they cause unwanted paint streaks outside of the lines you are cutting. Finally  the spreading around part wants slightly stiffer bristles particularly with heavy ""low VOC"" paints,  but the tipping off part generally wants softer bristles.  A brush that has soft bristle tips, but stiffer bristle shafts further up would be ideal.Next up is the over all shape of the tip of the brush. If it isn't formed in a neat straight line you can't possibly get neat straight lines out of it no matter how hard you try. So really cheap brushes (think disposable ""chip"" brushes here) have ragged ends, but really good brushes are made with precisely formed, neat, straight line across the bristle tips. And now that you know a little about bristles you can appreciate that this isn't as easy as just cutting them off to length after the brush is made.Last up is the hozzle. Ther are different shapes of hozzles for different tasks. For finish work you don't want too much paint in each brush load. So you want a hozzle that is relatively thin and rectangular. But if  you need the brush to hold a lot of paint, you want a hozzle that is fatter, even possibly rounded or oval. The fat oval hozzle has a lot of bristles in  the middle of the brush, so it holds a lot more paint. Good for getting a lot of paint to a big bit of work, but that much paint on a finish brush would be hard to control.Some of the best painters in the world brush paint hulls of mega-yachts to mirror finishes. Yep.. they BRUSH paint them, they don't spray them!  They have a three part crew. The first part is a man ( or men) with an oval brush and all he does is get the paint on the hull and move along. Right behind him is a guy(s) with a medium brush and he spreads the paint out into an even coat, first brushing one way, then another, criss-crossing. Then the last guy(s) comes behind him and tips everything off.  Three parts to painting, three guys, three different brushes... and a team effort that must take years of practice working together so as to get it just right and no one takes too long or goes too fast.However, for us mortals working alone we need a good compromise brush for the job at hand. Painting a fence? Maybe you want an oval brush to really get the paint on and you are not to worried about a mirror like finish.... but painting window or door trim you need a finish brush that can pick up the right amount of paint, get it to the work, spread it evenly, then tip it off, and it should also cut a clean line.This Wooster Golden GLO brush does all that, and it is deceptively inexpensive!It is also compatible with the new water borne finishes, something the natural bristle  (china Bristle) brushes, previously the most highly prized, simply can't handle. If  you use a natural bristle brush in a water born finish you will ruin both the brush and the finish. And those brushes are NOT cheap. A little tip: to get your water based paint to lay down like glass add about 1/2 ounce of household ammonia (non-foaming)  to a pint of paint. Your brush will glide the paint on the way the old oil based paints used to. It doesn't look so great immediately after you tip it off, but in 24 hours it will lay down and look like glass, provided you had good prep work under it.ALWAYS prime with oil based primers outdoors. Water based primers allow the wood to ""breath"" which means it will move, which opens up the joints and that lets moisture in and rot will begin. You can apply a top coat water based finish over a good oil primer coat. Use 20% - 30 % Penetrol in your ""high solids low VOC"" oil primer.This brush works extremely well; much better than any Purdy brush I have ever tried most at more than 2X the price. I was pleasantly surprised since frankly I had not expected this sort of performance at this price point. I just ordered a bunch more for my paint locker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ZEFDH2CN8UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQNA14#wasThisHelpful","R13ZEFDH2CN8UO","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been riding bicycles for a very long time. As a teen and a  young man I rode to get places, not in competition or for exercise or for personal amusement.  I never needed  a mirror because the traffic was lighter, I usually rode faster than most of the traffic, I never rode in groups to speak of, I had plenty of flexibility in my neck and shoulders to twist to see behind me, and most of all since I was young I was certain I was invincible.I'm getting back into cycling now for exercise and fun. But with more traffic, riding with friends, going at a slower pace so that the traffic is often overtaking me from behind,  and mostly now with the wisdom that only comes with age that I will certainly not come out well in an altercation with a cell-phone distracted idiot-automobile operator. I decided reluctantly that it was time to try a bike mirror.Here is the problem: You are a pretty compact package on a road bike. You neither have nor want things sticking way out to the sides, but if you keep the mirror in tight how do you see past yourself on the bike?  You block your own view! And you don't want an over sized wind-dragging mirror, so small and light is good, but where do you put it so you can see behind you when you need to?  I experimented with a few of the more popular concepts and concluded that a flat (non-wide angle) mirror on your eyeglasses or helmet is best.You want a small mirror because you don't want the windage or the sticking out factor. But if the mirror is already small, you really don't want to make the view even smaller by using a wide-angle mirror. So forget about the supposed benefits of a wide angle (convex) mirrors unless it is going to be on your beach cruiser and as big as the side mirror on your SUV...BUT if it is a small mirror how much can you see? Can you see enough? Well, if it is on your head like this ""Take a Look Mirror"" it turns out you quickly adapt to tilting or turning your head ever so slightly this way and that as necessary to peer anywhere you please around the vicinity of your 6 o'clock.If you try this mirror walking around the shop or home, you will not appreciate how intuitive that head tilting is, and how quickly you learn to adjust the mirror so that you can glimpse it in your peripheral vision. Or if you are deliberately looking into it, how you still have your peripheral vision engaged on the road ahead. It is a lot like using  your automobile side mirrors: You don't feel as if you have to look entirely away from where you are going, and if you move your head slightly to change your mirror-view a little, it's no big deal. I walked around the house with mine and was totally skeptical that it was going to work for me. Once on the bike it was entierly natural and intuitive.OK so this is the right design: A small helmet or eyeglass mounted mirror, flat, not convex.  But what about the quality? adjust-ability? value? and so on? Well I was absolutely floored that the quality was so good at this price point.  It is a simple thing, but it is also well made from good materials. Perfect! And it comes with a lifetime guarantee from a company that has been around long enough that you know they must mean it. There is a reason this has been such a popular product for so long.  As for adjusting it? You can move it very easily to whatever orientation you like. In my experience so far it stays put where you adjust it. It is also easy to adjust with one hand while riding for fine tuning if you need it. Size? I got the ""original"" and I think it is about right, though I suppose some may prefer the newer compact version. It is important to set the mirror up so that it doesn't interfere annoyingly with your forward vision, but isn't too far over so that you can't just glimpse it.  With so much adjust-ability in the mounting there are several options. You will have to experiment and decide what works for you. For me the ""original"" size works great. Not too big to block my forward vision, not too small to see behind. Just right.I have mine on a pair of aviator style sunglasses that have lightweight thin bows. Not quite wire bows as on RayBans, but nearly so. This is no problem for the mounting. It would also clip easily onto wide bows on wraparound style glasses. And you snap the mirror on and off easily enough to move it to other specs or to your helmet, or if you just want to use you glasses without the mirror while you are having lunch or something. I think there is an ""optional extra"" to mount it to a helmet, but I also think that for many helmets you might not need it. Just clip it to the shell which might require removing a little foam.And how do I like it? I LOVE it! I never thought I'd be the sort to say that. I'm not the spandex type, but I'm not into looking like a fool either... and I never thought that these mirrors were ""cool."" However this mirror gives me a good view astern which has added unanticipated confidence and opportunity when I'm riding. I can speed up or slow down to time my left turns when there isn't an idiot behind me trying to run me off the road; I can cross busy intersections when I know there isn't some soccer mom on her cell phone about to cut me off;  if I have to swing wide around a pothole or sewer grate I can look behind in an instant to check for an oncoming dump truck....and best of all I can look back there to see if my mates are still keeping up with me ('cause I'm still way faster than most of them *wink*)Fist off if you are on the fence about getting a mirror, just get one. Any one. You won't regret it. You will like it.Next: The ""Take a Look Mirror""  beats out the bar end mirrors, the frame mounted mirrors, and all the other wide angle helmet or eyeglass mounted mirrors hands down. Don't waste  your time with the others. Try this one first and you won't have to try anything else. There is a reason they have been around so long and why they keep getting repeat customers.Peter","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OHFEMLOXGPUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000C17M26#wasThisHelpful","R3OHFEMLOXGPUS","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This extension cord is at the short end of the spectrum for work site or shop use.  On a job site you would typically run a heavy duty main cord with an  AWG 12 or 10 gauge wire, put a 3-way on the end, and then run this  light duty 16AWG cord from that to your hand-held power tool, work light, shop vac, whatever. Because it is not terribly long and you are not trying to hang 6 or 8 tools off the end of it,  it doesn't need to be a monster gauge wire to combat undue voltage drop. The lighter weight makes it easier to store, lighter weight on the back of your power tool when you are using it, and inexpensive enough that you can afford a couple of them so that each tool you are currently using can have its own cord. That saves time and aggravation of having to constantly keep changing the cord to the current tool. EXAMPLE: I set one up on my mini shop vac and another on my DA sander. Then when I am sanding and prepping both tools are ready to go all the time.Also perfect for just running across the shop or workspace if you have a nearby outlet where once again the runs are not long and you aren't trying to run a whole job site off the cord.It is more than capable of conducting enough power to run just about any tool or device that you could run by plugging directly into the wall socket with the possible exception of an air compressor. Circular saws, sawsalls, drills, drill press, sanders, vacs, work lights.... all OK. So go ahead and buy yourself that AWG 10 or 12 gauge wire for the main power feed cord at 75 feet, but from the end of that to your tool use these.Don't waste your money paying for copper in heavy wire gauges that you don't need in a short cord.Well insulated and suitable for outdoor use;  I doubt a little rain or snow would harm it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PP1ALLKP8H7X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HEFDJW#wasThisHelpful","R1PP1ALLKP8H7X","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"****EDIT:After receiving a great batch of cups lightening quick from ""WelDun Solutions"" I wrote the following positive review and re-ordered some more of them.*BUT*The first batch came from  ""WelDun Solutions"" the second batch came from ""VetMed USA"" a distinction that didn't even cross my mind until I opened my second shipment.The second batch from ""VetMed USA"" are slightly different cups. They are still pretty good, were shipped promptly and so on, but not the same as the first batch, and significantly, not the same as the one in the listing photo. The photo shows a sharp upper lip to the cup, which is what I got in my first order. The second batch has a rolled-over upper lip.VetMed shipped via US Postal Service via DHL which added two additional days onto the ""free 2 day delivery"" to my area and does not offer any en-route shipment tracking; The shipping delay is not VetMed's problem, it is a problem with my local post office, but a recurring one. The cups are not as flexible; and the graduations are not as sharp and clear. They are made from a different material. I did not tear open the sealed plastic bags they came in so I can't determine if they are as solvent-resistant as the first batch or if they have the same handy supplemental markings on them because I may return them. I haven't made up my mind if it is worth the effort to ship them back since we aren't talking about much money here. I'm sure this second batch would be fine for dispensing meds, but since I'm using mine for mixing glues and paints I am not nearly as enamored of them. I'm being nit-picky, to be sure, but I found the first batch to be absolutely perfectly suited to my needs, which is why I ordered more immediately. The second batch is OK, but not as perfect for my particular use.****ORIGINAL REVIEW: (NOTE: This order shipped from from WelDun Solutions)Just right for mixing of paint or epoxy etc. in small batches. Shipping was lightning quick.Cups have graduations in these increments: 5 ml  (same as 5 cc;) 1/8  fluid ounces; 1 tsp; or 1 dram. (8 drams to 1 oz.)They have extra markings at: 2.5,  7.5  and  12. 5  ml (cc's);and at: 1/2 tsp, and 1 dssp1 dssp is a ""dessert spoon"" and is standardized at 10 ml which is about 2/3 tablespoon. That is also 2 tsp. (3 tsp per tbs in the kitchen!) A Brit tbs is 15 ml, a US tbs is 14.79 ml. so there is a very small difference between Brit measure and US measure, but that difference shouldn't matter for recipes, or for mixing paint or glue...... If that 0.21 ml is critical to you, you had better find a more precise means of measuring than markings on a little cup.The graduations are small but easy to read as they are sharp, crisp, clear, molded in markings. I appreciate that they are crisp and clear since many molded-in markings can be rather indefinite.  I like the multiple scales because I am usually interested in ratios, not absolute numbers, and with all the choices you can nearly always find some combination that works.The cups are flexible so you can kind of squeeze the top to make a spout to pour stuff out of them into other containers (such as loading epoxy into hobby syringes) or if you need to smush a wider brush into the tops of them you can get that done too. Top lip is about 1 3/4 inches in diameter, but by squeezing the top to elongate the lip I was able to coax a 2 inch disposable paint brush into one well enough to load the brush with paint for touch up work. It wasn't pretty, but it was the brush I had at the time and it got the job done.1 3/4"" diameter across the top, 1 3/8"" inch high,  1 1/8"" inch diameter across the bottom.I have not tried them with the more aggressive solvents like acetone or lacquer thinners, but the mini plastic ""water cooler"" cups I was using previously dissolved in the solvents of my alkyd paint (""oil"" based house paint) in about 30 minutes, and the paper version just turned to mush in about 10 minutes. Alkyd paint solvents are mostly mineral spirits and/or naphtha.  These cups do not suffer that fate.  ** update: I have since tried both acetone and lacquer thinner in them with no problem. Overnight might be an issue, but for the 1/2 hour or so I'm working with them they are fine with these solvents showing no sign of degradation. **Now that I have tried these I'll be sure to keep plenty in my shop. I can't tell you how many times I've mixed way, way, WAY more epoxy or paint than I needed just because I couldn't get convenient accurate measure in small batches, yet the ratios are critical.... so I'd mix up a big batch just to be sure to get the ratios right and then throw away about five times more than what I'd actually use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D1MYFNF6JPLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0008G1YGA#wasThisHelpful","R2D1MYFNF6JPLW","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the rest of the Campy Veloce equipment this chain works flawlessly. The 10 sp cassette that is currently offered is called ""Ultra Drive"" I believe, which is a geometry meant to work specifically with the campy 10 sp UD chain.Circa 2014 the end link for joining is not like the previous style: It uses a pin system somewhat similar to Shimano's to connect the two end links. If you get a chain that has the older system of a master link it may not be an Ultra Drive or ""UD"" chain.  I'm not sure precisely when the changeover was made, but in the past I've had Campy 10sp chains that use a master link so both systems are out there. Check and ask to be sure you get the version you want. The Campy UD chain MUST be shortened ONLY from one particular end, there is a tag on the opposite end that warns you of this. Leave that tag in place to remind you until you are ready to join the ends. Then the end links are joined with a two part pin set. You insert a little guide (supplied with the chain) from the  outer side of the chain(away from the bike frame) and press in the joining pin (also supplied and a use-once-only item)from the bike-frame side. Once the pin is in place the guide part is removed using just your fingers and either tossed out, or if you are like me, carefully set aside (squirreled away?) with the removed links. Like Shimano you are not supposed to re-use the same link or pin to remove and replace the chain. Campy sells a special little three link service kit for this. I'm not convinced this use-once-only system is a true improvement, but it is what it is and it does work perfectly well. Campy says its stronger, but I've never had an issue with a master link failure.The system claims it requires a special Campagnolo chain tool to accomplish properly, but I got by just fine with my standard one. The Campy chain tool has a system that centers the tool's drive pin onto the chain's joint pin quite precisely, I used common sense and great care to accomplish the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1QLDCCU0X34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049Z14SY#wasThisHelpful","R2I1QLDCCU0X34","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can one say about a front derailleur? Its a pretty simple device. This one, like all Campy stuff is beautiful and works flawlessly. I upgraded a sport/exercise road bike for my wife using the entire Veloce groupset to replace some low end Shim..no junk that came with the bike. I know Shim..no's low end stuff is much cheaper (in the USA) than this Campy entry level Veloce groupset, so you might think that direct comparisons may not be entirely fair, but the Campy Veloce stuff works flawlessly whereas the Shim..no stuff often simply didn't work,... period... Lots of clatter, dropped chains and missed shifts. It is a shame Campagnolo is so dear in the USA but Merlin shipped UPS International for free and there was zero hassle. The shipment arrived in a matter of days, sooner than some local suppliers got other parts which I ordered at the same time into the US mail. And it was cheaper doing it this way than the price of Shim..no's entry level Sora group. Now when I ask my wife how she likes the way her bike shifts she says ""I don't really think about it. I just DO it."" ....Perfect!If you opt for the braze on version reviewed here and you don't have a braze on lug on your seat post to mount it be sure to get the correct size Campy adapter clamp.

"""Power Torque"" is Campy's solid axle setup. The old cartridge or spindle in your bottom bracket is removed. The Veloce Power Torque drive side crank has a solid axle attached with a bearing pressed onto it; the non-drive side crank is just a crank. There are two cups that replace your bottom bracket. The one on the drive side receives the bearing pressed onto the aforementioned axle, and the one on the non-drive side has a bearing that stays put in the cup. This system is not the same as ""ultra torque"" which has a two piece axle with a joint in the middle inside of  the bottom bracket housing.This system must be specified at purchase to fit your bottom bracket threads and housing size. There are a bunch of different choices here so if you aren't sure what you have you had better give it a good look before you purchase this crankset. Still not sure? Ask your local bike shop to help.I like this system and IMHO it is a natural improvement over BB cartridges or cup-and-ball bottom brackets. The only down side I can see is that it requires some extra tools to disassemble and  service it down to the individual bearing point because they are pressed in and on, but this sort of cervice is something most of us will never have to do. Of course they sell Campy specific tools for pulling the bearings but it boils down to a two-jaw puller which is available just about anywhere cheaply. Complaining that this is a drawback is about like complaining that you need both a torx and a regular screwdriver to work on your car.The finish is very nice and the shifting on the chain rings is crisp and sure.  Too bad Campy is so dear in the USA, but Merlin shipped mine for free via UPS International with no hassle whatsoever. The stuff came faster than parts I ordered domestically, and I had UPS tracking the whole way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3UUJQ52ZFUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JKER42#wasThisHelpful","R1F3UUJQ52ZFUY","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty nice tool but it is big, awkward, and heavy for a palm sander. OK for shop or workbench use, but not so great for one hand at the top of a ladder, or over your head like on a boat topside or bottom. It really requires two hands to handle properly. Also since it is over sized for one-hand operation the switch and speed control dial are not as conveniently located as it might appear in the picture. You're going to wind up holding it low down where it says ""Bosh"" on the side opposite the dust collector. There is not enough room above the dust collector and the top ""handle""overhang where the cord comes out to get your hands in that side.... and the top ""handle"" is too wide to hold comfortably in one hand. It is about 3 inches wide and 51/2 inches long. So from the low grip position your thumb is now around the side of the sander and nowhere near the switch. ""So what?"" you ask.... Well these type of RO sanders like to be used by turning them on and off AFTER it is in contact with the workpiece, not before. So you press the tool to the work (gently) THEN you turn it on..... if you do it the other way around,( turn it on and then press it to the workpiece,)  you will most likely leave swirl marks and can easily gouge the workpiece. So a convenient location of the on/off switch is not trivial.  I also hoped to be able to exchange pads with my other Bosch 3107 DVS  (a larger random orbit sander with a handle) that I have had for years and love, but that was not to be. A new pad design for this sander precludes that. I also hoped this would be a nice complement to that older sander as one that was a bit more handy. As it turns out this would make a decent replacement for that bigger handled sander, but it is not a great complement to that tool.  The kit includes a carry bag (not a hard case), a vacuum adapter and the dust collector  I have a LOT of tools, many of them Bosch and I have always really liked every one of those Bosch tools until this one. There is really nothing wrong with this tool but the ergonomics of some of the other brands would be preferred, and they all seem to have a bit more power to boot.Peter","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GMF57I2E1RX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018Z8D64#wasThisHelpful","R2GMF57I2E1RX0","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The renovated tool looks like new. It came with a carry bag, the dust collector, and an adapter for a shop vac hose. Sadly the ""Kit"" does not mean a hard box like it used to, at least not for this item. Its a bag now.... but a nice one, kind of like a mini tool bag with nice handles and a couple of little side pockets and enough room inside for a spare pad or two and a some spare sanding disks.Seller shipped promptly, item delivered quickly, all good... etc.Why the 4 stars? Because this is a BIG tool for a hand sander. Fine for shop work on a bench, but NOT a one-hander atop a ladder unit. I have the older rear grip BOSCH random orbit 5"" sander and I love it, which is partly why I sprang for this one. I sort of hoped this would be a bit more compact, but not so much.I also hoped I'd be able to swap pads between the two since I have soft, medium and hard pads for the old one. No go on that either. The older one has a single allen head machine screw in the center of the pad, this one has four torx screws.Last, both sanders come with a ""damper"" that stops the pad from spooling up if you are not in contact with the work piece when you first turn it on. If you do that you will cause gouge marks on your workpiece.... BUT if you get used to the way these things work you can use that to your advantage. Lift up, let the pad spool up, then gently use it to cut down high spots sort of like a disk sander.... then press down firmly for orbital action to smooth the surface. Dual Action! Very handy if you have the touch, so I remove the dampers from mine.... This one removing the damper is a bit more of a project requiring that you unscrew the case a little. Those case screws are torx too, but in very deep holes so you need long, skinny torx driver to get at 'em. The sort of driver where you exchange bits won't go down into the deep holes.All in all this is a nice tool, but best suited for shop and bench work, not ladder work. Fair enough, but I had high hopes for something more compact since it said ""Palm Sander."".... No way is it a ""Palm Sander"" unless  you are King Kong......and more interchangeable with my older Bosch sander would have been nice. This one would be a great choice to replace my old big Bosh, which are now very expensive, but to compliment it as a lighter smaller tool, not so much.Peter","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AP6QYIU86QAA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDYUFIG#wasThisHelpful","R2AP6QYIU86QAA","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is what you need to change out the high side valve core and cap on some newer vehicles. I bought this one for an '09 Chevy Suburban 1500 LT V8 but it looks identical in dimensions/threads/ etc. to the one  I just changed in my '01 Dodge Dakota 4X4 sport with the 4.3L V8. As far as I can tell the only difference is the color of the o-ring seal just above the threaded part. Maybe one is Buna and the other Viton? It hardly matters. This one came with a new dust cap included and the threads already treated with a thread-locking compound. The inner valve core is integral to this piece and can't be changed out separately.Go to your high side valve and take the plastic cap off. Look down into the valve: If there is a stem sticking up in the middle like a tire fill valve you don't use this part. If you see a little rubber diaphragm instead, this is your guy. The listing picture is upside down. The threaded part goes into the aluminum tube on the high side. There is a hex on the aluminum tube with a circumferential notch that makes it appear as if that is where things come apart; ......but BEWARE!!!!...... That is NOT where to twist your wrench! Instead this valve body has a hex machined into (onto?) what the top quick-connect collar. (The first big ring above the very bottom in this listing photo.) This hex is not obvious at first but that is where you put your wrench to unscrew it while firmly holding the hex on the aluminum tube so as to prevent damage to that super-light aluminum part.The hex on the valve body is an odd-ball size. You can either use a pair of channel locks or, or grind your own special open-ended wrench, or get yourself the special socket. Amazon sells the socket. Search for the following:Mastercool (MSC98234) R134A HIGH SIDE HEX SOCETThings do not have to be gorilla-tight. The seal is made at the green O-ring in the photo, the threads more or less just hold things in place, so don't wind up the aluminum tube getting all macho torque-y with it! Snugging it up nicely is enough maybe with a teeny drop of loctite if yours didn't come with it.I do not see any way of changing this without emptying the system. If you do that you will need to recover the refrigerant that is left in the system, not just vent it to atmosphere. Also you will need to pull a vacuum on the system before you can recharge it. Recharge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant, usually a critical amount for most cars. If the system has been 100% depressurized for any time you should also replace the drier which means then you also must add oil of the right sort and amount when re-charging. If this sounds like Greek to you, take it to the shop, just don't get sucked into paying thousands for a new evaporator when all you need is a new service valve for less than 10 bucks. If the shop balks simply say ""Please start by replacing the service valves and then leak check things before you dig into the evaporator."" If the shop balks at that request, you need to find a new shop because that guy is a crook!The evaporator is just a length of tube with fins on it. Nothing would make it leak unless you stuck a screwdriver into it by accident or it was very, very old. Usually the evaporator connections and their seals are even in the engine box, not under the dash. On the other hand the service valves are notorious for going bad.Peter","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDH94IEPRE49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000DCNG7E#wasThisHelpful","REDH94IEPRE49","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this for my wife's cruiser. It has a very concave shape from nose to back. I don't know why.Here is the thing: a good performance bike *saddle* is something you sort of lean back against, the long nose of the saddle hardly contacts you at all. Your butt cheeks kind of press back against the back of the saddle (like leaning against a kitchen counter) and the nose is mostly there to stabilize you side to side. This arrangement works well for hard performance riding. That is why it is exactly what you see on all performance bikes. A bike *seat* is another story. It is a place to actually rest your weight and sit, which is why it is a style popular on beach cruisers and kid's bikes. A quality womans bike seat tends to be wider in the back than a man's for obvious reasons. For women the nose is wide and short. Men need a different fit,  generally longer and skinny-er in the front and narrower in the back with the front tilted down more. Back in the '60's and '70's the differences between mens and womens were blatant, now in our politically correct gender neutral times, not so much.This is a seat. It is wide in the back and short in the front. But it isn't' flat like a proper bike seat. It is scooped out.... if you looked from the side it would be very concave  in profile along the top line drawn from the middle of the front to the middle of the back. This means that if you tilt the nose down enough so that you are not getting excess pressure on your perineum you are now forced to be leaning against the back like a saddle, and not a great one because the scoop is too extreme and the back tilts up too much. If you don't continually press backward you slide forward...very annoying. If you tilt the nose of the seat up enough to support your bum without sliding off forward, you will be getting badly poked in the perineum by the nose. NOTE: With a properly adjusted performance bike and saddle this isn't an issue. Your saddle is higher and bike frame bigger than on a cruiser bike and you generally want to pedal harder.... so it is more akin the aforementioned leaning against the kitchen counter, which is good for performance pedaling.... but on a cruiser you want to *sit* not lean.I can only assume the design was inspired by the scoop look of a motorcycle saddle or seat, particularly of the HD variety... but motorcycles saddles are different. They are very wide in the perineum area so there are no annoying pressure points. Generally they have a flat-ish zone in the mid length where your bum goes, and the flip up in the back, if they have one, cradles your behind, but isn't where you sit your weight. They are more like riding a horse than sitting astride a fence rail, and since you don't generally have to pedal your Harley (or your horse)this is OK. But not OK on a bicycle where your thighs are close together and in continual motion.I like that it is not gel, as the gel will feel nice for a few miles, but after a long ride it all smushes away from the points where you need it most. This seat has some springs beneath which are too stiff to be of much use other than to give it a retro-look. Other reviewers mentioned adjusting the springs, but the seat I got was at the limits of adjustment. Any looser and the adjusting nuts would just fall of. So no help there.Because of the overall shape and the springs the height is greater than most stock seats/saddles. You will need a couple of inches down-travel adjustment available in your seat post to be assured you can get a comfy height after you swap out this saddle with stock saddle. The actual amount will depend on your present seat of course, but if you are nearly all the way down now you may not be able to get low enough with this seat.The quilted stitch pattern on the seat looks great but is most definitely NOT waterproof.The quality is good, but personally I dislike this seat for both comfort or performance, but my wife likes the way it looks on her bike. Who am I to argue?  If she rides less than a few miles at a time it will be fine.Peter","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZ5E45775C96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089WYUPM#wasThisHelpful","R2FZ5E45775C96","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This watch with its stainless steel band and multiple Iron Man features is a perfect work and sport watch.Rugged and good looking with all the features you might ever need.It is truly waterproof with an easy to read display, but without being too big on your wristFace is about 1 1/2 inches to the outside of the bezel; about 1"" wide across display. Band is about 3/4 inch wide.Count down timers can be set to stop when done or reset continuously from any value (Best watch EVER for timing sailing starts!)Chrono has lots of split lap times; cycling enthusiasts, workout routines, runners, motorsports, should love it.Three time zones! Great for pilots and navigation where you want quick reference to Zulu time.Several alarms which can be set for once only, daily, weekend etc.Back light for night useBattery lasts a very long time ( 2+ years)Setting the watch and accessing the features is consistent and quickly becomes intuitive. No nested menus.You DO have to adjust the bracelet to fit to your wrist without a lot of slop. If you do not you will catch it on something and the band will break. Adjusting the bracelet is fairly easy if you are a handy person, if not find a jeweler who will help. You must push out a pin to separate the links. I use a straightened safety pin with the point filed off and a block of wood underneath with a small hole to make room for the pin to come out. You will need a small pair of needle nose pliers to hold the safety pin and to push the link pin back into place.The good news is that after you beat the heck out of this watch and finally something gives up, it isn't expensive to replace!I'm on my forth one of these over many years, I wear mine daily for work (I work outdoors) and for play. Salt water, sand, surf, swimming, shop dust, paint, oil, solvents, or in the shower, its always on my wrist. No worries!

"Pros : Holds Like Crazy Once Hooked UpCons : Reliability Issues In UseBest Uses : Small BoatsI have a small ""Commando"" G-5 and a larger one for my other boat, a 26 foot power boat which is notably  heavy for her size.The flukes assemble to the stock, crown and shank with a slip together setup. Everything is held in place with machine screws through the flukes squeezing clamps around the stock. (The stock is the horizontal bar across the bottom of the flukes)If the clamps are not extremely tight that stock can slide sideways out of the clamps and ultimately spontainious disassembly could occur! I was shocked after sitting on the g-5 for an afternoon to pull it up and find I was only inches from this occurance! The stock had already slid most of the way out! A few more hours and my boat definately would have been on the beach. It was only a small Boston Whaler and I was only  a few feet away up on the beach so that wouldn't have been a tragedy, but if the wind were offshore and had carried the boat away it really could have su*ked!  I intend to modify mine by drilling two holes through the stock that will attach to some tabs I'll have welded to the flukes where the old clamps went....  This should be a design change made at the factory! They wouldn't have to weld the tabs, ( They brag that they don't weaken the structure with welds) but could incorporate them into the fluke design.** An anchor that can fall apart unexpectedly while in use and on the bottom is a pretty scary proposition!**NEXT, although the anchor holds like crazy once it sets, the close fit between the crown and the shank means it often gets clogged with coarse sand or mud. This jambs the crown from moving which prevents the flukes from falling (pivoting) properly into position to hook up. I've experienced this a bunch of times now. That is OK under normal circumstances where you can make two or three trys to hook up,... just haul up the anchor, (its nice and light) clear the jamb, and try again... but it's not cool if you are in a situation where  you need an anchor that works RIGHT NOW the first time! This jamming has happened with both the little G5 and the bigger anchor repeatedly. Maybe 25% of the time for each.This anchor is convenient, light weight, and it does hold very, very well once hooked up, so I like it a lot, but in view of the above shortcomings I wouldn't trust it as my primary anchor. I would also be very wary of using [this type or brand of anchor] for larger boats where these sorts of failures are a bigger problem. Even simply failing to hook on the first try because the flukes are jammed is a bigger PITA if you have a big boat, a large anchor, and a lot of rode.P.S. If I lost you with anchor nomenclature just google ""Parts of an anchor"" for a good diagram of a Danforth-style anchor.BTW: the kit bag is nice and the setup comes with 100 feet of line, some chain, and a shackle.Since this is a small boat anchor you probably won't want or need 100 feet of line most of the time you use it, so cut that line into convenient lengths. Coiling 50 feet of line is somehow 10 times easier than coiling 100 feet of line, and if you need all 100 feet you can always bend the two pieces back together with a good knot. The chain is too light to be of any use for weight, only to prevent chafe if you anchor in rocky spots. I don't so I set mine aside. You will want to add a stainless swivel to help prevent the rode from making hockels (those tight twisted loops) when you deploy or recover it. Don't forget to safety wire your shackles!Peter","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL20GGIOBC4SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHTT3SI#wasThisHelpful","RL20GGIOBC4SY","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To begin with let me say I am very picky about my audio components.  I will not abide inferior sound reproduction or distortion. Weak highs that are not crisp and muddy bass reproduction are my two most common complaints with inexpensive audio components. These speakers perform OK in that regard.I just installed a pair of these in my boat.  There is no point in going crazy on speakers for a boat cockpit: They simply don't last in the harsh marine environment, but I do value good sound quality.  I did not expect these to be the absolute tops in sound reproduction, but I was pleasantly surprised at how adequately they perform.  As you might expect they are mid-range biased if the equalizer is neutral. Pushing up the bass and treble a bit results in perfectly acceptable sound quality for listening to typical radio music programs like Country , Rock, etc. At moderate volume the highs are crisp and decently bright. Bass is clear and not muddy, but it won't rattle your windows. If you are after street-thumping bass these won't do it, but neither will most 5"" speakers. However, if you are listening to most broadcast music the way the artists intended you to hear it they are fine. The audio stage is remarkably good for such inexpensive speakers! The speakers come with the mounting hardware you need and they look nice installed. You get a plain looking round black grille and bezel with a small plastic ""PYLE"" logo on it, which isn't intrusive by way of size or bright color. You will see a bit of the silver colored triax speaker layout through the grille, and perhaps a peek of the blue  bass speaker cone (Is it mylar? It's some sort of plastic, not paper...); a classy look that will work fit into almost any situation.I'm going to buy another pair for inventory so that I have them when the set I just installed need to be replaced,Overall I'm plenty pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G6ZYZ7WWZF58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00022OBO2#wasThisHelpful","R1G6ZYZ7WWZF58","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right kit for '01 Dodge Dakota. The kit has three ""standard"" Schrader cores, plus one 8mm core, one 10mm core and an entire high-side port quick disconnect assembly with the valve already inside it. So that is six pieces in all.The last one is what you need if you look down into your Dodge high side service port and do not see a little valve stem but rather a rubber diaphragm.You unscrew the entire quick-disconnect collar and replace it with the new one. The quick disconnect has some odd size wrench, but I got mine off and on just fine with a big pair of channel locks. Be sure to hold the hex on the high side line firmly with a flare-nut wrench as you do this. the lines are only light aluminum. The separation point is not where it first appears. Take a good look at the replacement part before you wrench in the wrong place. Also you will need refrigeration gauges and a vacuum pump since there is no way to change the entire quick connect with the system still charged as is the case with some of these valve cores IF you have the right tools.If you have the gauges and vacuum pump this is the kit to get the job done on your Dakota or Durango.EDIT: Search Amazon for the following and read my review there for tips:Four Seasons 59946 High Side Service Port AdapterPeter","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32F7GFLBGZHGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TPPIMU#wasThisHelpful","R32F7GFLBGZHGN","A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1C1Q7OY1VESQ4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Within a few hours after application I could smell slight b.o. As the day progressed, the odor became worse. I've used it multiple times with identical results.This deodorant has an odd smell (wet cardboard & mint) and a weird texture (damp sand). The application site is a little sore as this product is pretty abrasive. It's awfully expensive, but I was willing to try it because of the natural ingredients.I will not purchase again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQMD066A8AYV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJOV6TM#wasThisHelpful","R1RQMD066A8AYV","AOWF9T81XMX2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOWF9T81XMX2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't believe no one has mentioned this soap smells like Moroccan Orange Blossom Water...which smells refreshing to me. If it is actually in this soap, Orange Blossom Water is great at hydrating, purifying and toning your skin. I cut a small piece and put it in my shaving bowl. It lathers quickly and allows my razor to glide over my skin. The shave I got was much more comfortable and close compared to other soaps, creams and gels I've used in the past. I did feel a slight burning sensation on my cheeks when I had to apply more for an additional pass with the razor, but it went away within minutes after I was done and didn't turn my cheeks red.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZB6AE9F39EZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002A5OLHQ#wasThisHelpful","RZB6AE9F39EZY","AOWF9T81XMX2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOWF9T81XMX2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used Tech Armor screen protectors on various smartphones and tablets. Their products are sized just about perfect for the specific application and are durable. I've never had to remove/replace a Tech Armor screen protector due to scratches, bubbles or any other issues. Sure, the price may be a few dollars more than other brands, but I tend to be a brand loyalist (only if their products are good).Application of this screen protector on my iPad mini 2 was typical and took only a few minutes. The protector was applied in the bathroom after a steamy shower to keep unwanted dust at bay. I find this to be a very successful method.Unfortunately, I wiped my iPad with the included microfiber cloth and it left many small particles behind. Of course these small particles could only be seen after the protector was applied. I had to lift each corner of the protector and use the dust removal tape to catch those pesky particles. Usually I use a brand new MagicFiber cloth because the included microfiber cloths are junk. This time I forgot...oops, my bad.Now that the particles are gone, the protector looks great and should last a long time.Note that the issue with cheap microfiber cloths are not isolated to this brand.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11FB0WMB1LLLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008THTWIW#wasThisHelpful","R11FB0WMB1LLLP","AOWF9T81XMX2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOWF9T81XMX2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used many products and lotions that did one of two things...they either moisturized my skin and gave me breakouts or dried out my skin and kept the acne at bay. I've even used 100% Argan Oil and products that contained Argan Oil and none work as well as this brand.The oil absorbs quickly and easily if you don't use too much. It has cleared up my acne and dry skin issues. It doesn't smell bad (assuming its fresh). Another reviewer mentioned it has a rubberband-like smell...I can see what they are talking about, but to me it smells a bit more like a Band-Aid. It's not strong, distracting or even that noticeable after applying. Family members have not mentioned that I smell any worse than normal. lolSure it's a bit expensive, but the quality of this product is definitely worth it. I will NEVER buy any other brand of Argan Oil (unless of course the product changes in some way).For great looking skin, I trade off between this and the Shea Terra Nilotic Shea Butter.

"We have bought quite a few of these over the years. Some of which gave up the ghost because of quality reasons. This one feels like better quality in my hand. The grip has a large grip my big hand fits in and has a rubber like coating layer.Although it feels solid it is light for its size and balanced in my hand for ergonomic comfort. The next quality feature i notice is the 9.84 foot flat strap in stead of it being a round cord. This recoils better and is more reactive as a leash. The weight limit is for smaller and medium sized dogs under 44 lbs. The chrome plated swivel snap is a medium size and is easy to operate better than the dinky ones but is just the right size for the size dog it is recommended for.The push button lock feature allows for easy length adjustment, with one key button to relax, tighten the tether strap.

"This is an awesome Quad copter! I have several quad copters from nano to highly advanced. I have built a few as well. I say this because I want you to know my experience level. Our 10 year old grandson can fly this copter almost better than me. I know this has a 14 year old rating. But because it has 6-Axis Gyro Stabilization System it is a lot easier to manage than any other copter in this price range that I have seen.The 2.4GHz 4 channel technology allows good performance of about 30-50 yards with decent power for wind-resistant control.The copter comes with one battery, but you can purchase more. But actually you should allow the copter to cool between flights. The controller requires 6 ""AA"" which are not included. So remember those if giving as a gift because the person your giving it to will want to go out and fly it right away.The controller has all 6 axis controls as well as trim adjustments. The props are 2 1/4"" long.

"To me a 4th generation architectural wood worker and plant engineer, it amuses me to see the strides in technology to all the trades. This level is no exception. I really like this level. The maker knows my background and asked me to rate this level with no expectations, and provided me a sample. This baby is so sweet, they had to feel no fear I would like it as much as I do. If your in the trades let me appeal to your experience, and prove it to yourself.This digital torpedo level is very well suited to the machine work, steel fabrication industry, auto alignment, satellite dish,electricians, plumbers and any other precision trades. Very precise digital measurements + - five hundredths degrees (0.05).The magnetic base is strong, and linear V groove for pipe. The read out is very bright auto rotating display, as the digits are lit and not just a LCD back light, the large numbers jump out at you, even in daylight. Two arrows indicate if you are high or low on the angle - level, plumb, or alternate.  The display can be set to read in metric, feet / inches, degrees, or percent slope. All this can be read in absolute real earth level, or angles can be also set to find relative angles by taking any angle and setting a new alt zero angle to compare the difference. It has standard level and plumb bubbles as well.The display allows you to select an audible tone for level and plumb. There is also an audible tone conformation in the calibration process.Now I have to tell on my self..... I thought the audible level feature was defective on the level they gave me. I called the manufacture and they explained to me it is so accurate the device need to be absolutely level or plumb to sound. We confirmed the device was 100% by resetting the relative alt. angle on my desk top to zero and it fired on the tone! I think that speaks for its sensitivity and precision,...... and my duh!I can see the solid build the maker claims. Their claim is backed by a one year warranty and they brag a certified water and dust proof and operating range of -4F - 140F degrees. Power source is two ""AA"" batteries (included). It has a auto off and the display is LED, for battery conservation. The body is extruded aluminum with rugged bumpers to take the test of the tool bag and time.Once I had it in my hands and understood its features I could find no faults in the device, which coincidentally is also true about my dog and grandchildren......","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R129AZWMAOC73T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0148M7OJU#wasThisHelpful","R129AZWMAOC73T","A1QVOYKF2RP9PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVOYKF2RP9PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fits my darling 5', size 6, wife well, which is why it might be best to say if one size fits all, it would be on the small size. It is quite light material, and the collar has a lovely Asian look about it.I would say the weak point is the plastic snaps which are difficult to un snap and snap as well as being poorly attached. Debbie (my lovely wife) says she wouldn't snap them any ways. It has buttons high on the arm to roll the sleeves up, and the back has a split with 5 buttons for closure.

"In an effort to clean up and organize I have tried everything. If you have ever packed a cord organizer loom with several wires then need to remove one, only to have to repack whats left you will appreciate this set up. The insertion tool is what makes the process easy.Its still visible but much better than looking at all those cords in disarray. I like this because if you need to pull a cord, or two out or add one, along the way you can.Be sure to gather all you cords up straight in one line. Open the clam shell on the insertion tool and insert the wires and allow it to close. Load the pointed lead in the tube, as the photos show in the description. Push it in from the up from the direction you are going. As you go continue pushing and try to resist pulling the down side because you will squeeze the tube and tighten the against the cord. If you can avoid squeezing its ok to pull but pushing does me better. Another tip is keep the cords straight and in line, no twists. The hardest part is getting it started but once you get the feeder all the way inside its smooth sailing.This tube is 60"" long & just over an inch diameter.I received only a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review - It’s just my true assessment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPYWJTANL484/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7QHBI4#wasThisHelpful","R1SPYWJTANL484","A1QVOYKF2RP9PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVOYKF2RP9PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a viewing monitor mirror that attaches with a couple spring clamps shown in my photos, onto and over your existing rear view mirror. The instructions (see my photo) are very poor and basically leave you to figure it out on your own. When the monitor goes on approximately 1/3 of your rear view mirror is replaced by what the camera view is. Both sides are still viewable. I would prefer a separate monitor that didn't share the mirror.It has a pig tail that have three different colored connections coming from it. Red is 12 volt DC 2.1 x 5.5mm DC Power Pigtail Female that is connected to a an included 2.1 x 5.5mm DC Power Pigtail male plug. That has two wires red for a 12 volt DC power source & black for a ground source. The idea is because it has an auto on feature that is activated by sensing power on, that you locate your back up light circuit and connect to that hot lead. The black can go to any ground source. There is no on/off control accessible. It would be possible to install a switch in the 12 volt constant power connection so you can choose to use it at your preference.The other two plugs one white, & one yellow are RCA AV plugs for cameras or DVD connection in two channels. In the case of two inputs you would need a AV selector switch.The monitors Resolution is a fair 480W * RGB * 272H and pulls, 3W of power consumption.The weight is 13.7 ounces and may be to much weight to keep held up by your existing mirror unless you can adjust the tension on it.

"It is a prudent practice to be very protective of your blades. They are the first lifeline to the aerodynamics of your copter. they are the control surfaces as well as propulsion inherent in copters. If you lose a prop in a fixed wing aircraft they control surfaces will likely still work and you can glide it down in a somewhat controlled manner. The are the wings as in rotor wing. So why take chances dropping a expensive copter because one of the rotor wings failed? This is not only a damage control issue but a safety concern. When this happens the copter cannot be controlled and it will most probably damage your equipment, and your pride it can fly way out of control and cause injury or property damage. It would be wise to inspect your blades prior to every flight closely. Never fly with a blade that had any damage what so ever, even a small chip can run under the stress of flight. DJI blades are less prone to that because of the engineered material used to manufacture them.The problem is with carbon fiber is it is great for some purposes. But I do not like them for props because they are stiff and un forgiving. They have glass like properties and when stressed to a point they just break causing a complete failure. I have had it happen. My original thought was these are stronger, but was a misconception. Carbon fiber is very strong but it needs to maintain its rigid shape. If not extreme failure occurs. Under the stress of blades I have found it to much. the stock props that come with your P3 spring better and are much more forgiving to sudden acceleration. Strong doesn't always mean unbreakable.An estimated $1.7 trillion worth of knockoffs, counterfeit and imitation products are sold to consumers every year. While it can be difficult to spot the fakes, many counterfeiters are selling products the manufacturers never made in the first place. You can see them on sale at Amazon, Taobao, a China-based website that's one of the biggest online marketplaces in the world, and on eBay. Knock offs are often made and sold before DJI can identify them.While identifying a fake product can be difficult, to counter the counterfeiters, there are several steps shoppers should take before buying online:Step 1:Buy directly from the manufacturer or an authorized dealer to make sure you're getting the real thing. I can only assume Amazon has a way to verify this, but sometimes and especially in our modern day hacker environment things can slip between the cracks before they are found.Step 2:If you look at your original DJI props you will see the DJI logo. I have seen knockoffs with this logo however. DJI props are packaged and labeled.Step 3:Two more markings are the 2 prop directions and the part number with the black saying 9450cw and the silver tip saying 9450. these are oriented with the top of the numbers on the top of the blade.Step 4:DJI blades come fairly well balanced. if yours are obviously not you probably have a knock off.Step 5:DJI props do not have metal thread inserts. If there are present they are defiantly knock offs and can cause damage to your copter. Two issues can occur. If the inserts are cheap and the threads are not precisely cut or if a thin layer of plastic is coated in them (a practice to cover up the metal to deceive you. They can lock so tight you will break the motor shaft or like in my case the balancing rod off in the attempt to remove them. The next issue is the metal inserts by some manufactures can be so loose they can un spin themselves while air braking. DJI blades are engineered to stay in place. That is why I am skepticalStep 6:DJI blades are ever so slightly flexible. If yours are rigid they are knock offs. They can be so stiff they are brittle and break in flight as well. This can be an issue with carbon fiber props as well.Step 7:If the price is too good the prop is probably not. Beware of blades that are priced below way below the manufactures suggested retail price are often knock offs.Step 8;Buy trusted blades by buying those proven by other sources. If a reviewer has spotted a knock off beware! Again I can only assume Amazon has a way to verify the authenticity, but sometimes and especially in our modern day hacker environment things can slip between the cracks before they are found. I gave this set a 2 star until I can tell otherwise, but one reviewer claims to has spotted them as fakes. That isn't totally reliable however because they could be wrong, or a unethical plant from another seller trying to degrade the credibility of this one to steer you towards their knock off or site. As a top reviewer I just can't say at this point its even OK. As a top reviewer I have seen all the nasty tricks and I checked up on the profile of the one negative review of a blade. All the other reviews were very positive but hers was bringing notice by saying some of the identifiable markings were inconsistent with a OEM product. But the reviewers profile shows only one review, 6 activities and Reviewer ranking: #32,829,985. The advantage with Amazon is if you receive a product with a suspicious blade you can return it in a timely manner. But do us all a favor and make Amazon aware of the fake so they can look into the sellers credibility.Step 9:Recently DJI has been surrounding the center of the blade with shrink wrap covering the threads. This is new so older versions may not have this.Step 10:Check against original blades for any detection such as size difference, material color, anything different.Step 11:Check the manufactures web site to confirm they make that model in construction and cosmetics. If they don't it is obviously a knock off.These blades offered seem to pass the test until seen otherwise. I have only seen three reviews so far and they point the right direction for OEM. I also am skeptical about aftermarket manufactures that offer aftermarket ""compatible or comparable"" blades. I am unaware of any endorsed products by DJI. But if one is out there how do you confirm a true endorsement? I had a qualified dealer suggest a blade design that has a through hole (required a bushing and a pointed nut holds it in place). I'm just not willing to bite on that at this point. On the Phantom Pilot forum I haven't read any OEM failures outside of blade strikes but have from non DJI and knock offs. The steps are guidelines and I hope they are helpful to your buying decision.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE01I538892B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0118A0ZXM#wasThisHelpful","RE01I538892B9","A1QVOYKF2RP9PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1QVOYKF2RP9PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This bit has three cutting surfaces and solid backing. This improves the efficiency  of standard 2-flute bits by 50% because the third flute increases the cut rate allowing more cuts per inch, reducing the work load on each flute. This results in longer bit life, smoother cuts, less if any burning. An other thing I like is the face and side pitch making this a spiral up cut bit for smoother cuts & sawdust & heat ejecting.The half inch shank is much more solid that a 1/4"" shank. The bearing is quality and should give reasonable service The company whom manufactures is a world leader in the commercial blade & bit tooling industry.The cutter head is set by the bearing to cut a square 3/8"" wide x just under 1/2"" deep rabbit.I am an consultant to wood products factories, but using this bit at my home shop, on some oak screen doors. I will not have to worry about the side cut because it is already set by the bearing used at the factory. But I will need to adjust my depth to 3/8"" + 20 + - mill (my screen thickness).

"I needed a few sets because I need to replace my wicks, and it was just about the same price for this combo as for 1 wick. These are factory parts and the only ones I will use. I removed the cotton packing with some rheostats.  This exposes the inner lighter and the old wick is still in place and wrapped around the flint chamber. I have often taken a good wick and just reversed it after cutting off the old burned end. If your lighter has sat for a long period it may be caramelized. If thats the case your best to replace. I clean the hole out with a toothpick. You need to make a clean pass and remove ant obstructions that would inhibit you from passing the wick through the hole because the hole is so deep. The wick has some wire that helps keep it stiff but sometimes thats not much rigid-ability. You can try from either end of the lighter, but I prefer the upper end because the fluid chamber is so deep. In that event I still trim the end with a point and get it started then reach in the other side to pull it through. Wrap it around the flint chamber an bring it up the side. Repack in reverse order. I like to replace the flint at this point Fill with fluid and let set for several minutes to allow for absorption. You don't want to burn a dry wick because it will just burn up.My dad told me if you send your Zippo lighter back to the factory they will rebuild it free.From Zippo:All you need to do is provide your Zippo pocket lighter toour distributor. You will bear the cost of any expensesincurred in making a claim under this Guarantee, includingthe cost of shipping the lighter to our distributor.

"Wow!  Get ready for a great new perspective to WWII and D Day specifically. This is a series of interviews of various German soldiers on the Atlantic front. The first stunning fact is they could not believe the British and Americans wanted to attack them when the real war was with the Russians. Additionally they felt like the French people supported them and didn't want the destruction. They were DEFENDING the French and the United Europe!  There was acknowledgement that not all were in favor but a specific number were. What a statement here about the Nazi propaganda and there is discussion of this.  When soldiers are encountered they are completely surprised by their resolve and anger. It is truly a fascinating read. It's also interesting to hear of their defenses: how in some cases it was very good and some, not good at all.The most SHOCKING statement was their amazement at the Ally weapons. Due to limited resources, German troops always traveled with horses to transport equipment and save fuel. The fact that the Allies had no horses at all bewildered them.The fighting here is intense and tales of the embardment from the other side shows that our weaponry and air superiority completely overwhelmed the Germans.  But listening to some of these men describe the horrific discussion of death and body destruction by flame throwers and incendiary bombs is just tragic.Like WWII literature?  Ready for a new/different perspective?  Read this very enlightening book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ZFQDMUIQ92V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX372UE#wasThisHelpful","R25ZFQDMUIQ92V","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read the first book which I STRONGLY RECOMMEND, I bought this as a companion And was not disappointed!  More stories of surprise at the ferocity of the Allied soldiers, Allied weaponry superiority and aircraft. This book touches on other individual stories of interest. For example, where was the The famous Luftwaffe and superior technology of weapons?  Well that's discussed here. A pilot describes his flight but on orders not to engage, but reconnaissance only. He also discusses their lack of spare parts and how the constant bombardment had severely limited their airports and flying capabilities.Another fascinating story is a tale of a superior weapon, not an atomic, but a very destructive kerosine-like bomb that completely destroyed a wide range of land. Unfortunately, weather conditions had to be ideal and even then the soldiers using it would probably be killed. So what happens when they attempted to use it which they felt could have turned the initial tide of the D Day incursion? Well, it's here in this book and is absolutely fascinating. Additionally it is fascinating why the soldier never spoke of this after the war.Another theme of this book is the Russian deserters who were now fighting for the Germans to protect France against the Allies. What happened to them and why is nothing really written of this?Continually mentioned by the soldiers is the previous Dieppe Attack which evidently was an incursion two years earlier that was turned back. The Germans felt this was another bluff, particularly since it wasn't at a port where they felt the Allies needed to bring in all the equipment necessary for the war. There has always been much talk of the enormity of the invasion. This book articulates this better and to a higher degree than any I have read.A final theme of this book is the German/French relationships and the many romances and babies that were born. Great historical exploration from a first hand account which I found fascinating!Like WWII literature?  Ready for a new/different perspective?  Read this very enlightening book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTPUAY7DPITN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HJK542#wasThisHelpful","R1JTPUAY7DPITN","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Written in sections of interest with comments by virtually all of the players in the movie, this is a great summation of creating magic on film.

I remain amazed that she wasn't a star of Julia Roberts' level of fame.  And of course my personal favorite Stacey Dash to this day remains absolutely stunning should also have had much greater fame.But lightening struck here by a great director and a wide eyed cast most getting their first taste of fame and no idea how this would make them famous for life.

"Well, the reviews were correct:  this is the best device on the market.  I'm an active tennis player squeaking out the last years on my knees with doctor advice to ice consistently and I do.  I keep ice knee devices and I also keep the cold pack that does not require ice depending if I am at home or away.  Normally I play tennis very early, change to work clothes at a club and can't take the cold pack devices.  this is what I use as I can fill with ice at the club and I couldn't be more pleased.A couple of things to discuss:  the ice bag is rubber but very thin.  I previously had an ice bag with a lining.  I worry about this bag sweating on my clothes.  Not a problem yet but I am watching for this.  My previous ice bag wore out and started leaking on my clothes.  Second, the connection of the rubber to the mouth of the device makes me worry if the very thin rubber will eventually tear.  If it does, I'll change my review.Another statement:  I am normal size that used a medium Moji knee icer.  this device has only one size and it is actually a little small for me.  I need to adjust my ice in the bag down which I think will help this problem.  I will add again my previous device, while not anywhere as professional as this, had a better ice bag with double lining.  Still, I can't complain thus far and am very pleased.  I use four times a week and one week in, it's better than before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35BY9D2BWBY20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKJP0G2#wasThisHelpful","R35BY9D2BWBY20","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have so many black devices.  this is easy to see in the bag, and easy to see if you are about to leave in the rental car.  Big positive for me.What are the potential negatives?  I had a bad connection one time knocking me off.  If this comes up again I'll change my review. Second, remember, since it is Bluetooth, it works off a battery so be prepared to keep these powered up for the long trips.

"This novella starts very slow. It seems to want to demonstrate the tedious nature of Vietnam fighting: boredom followed by MASSIVE Adrenaline rush. But the payoff of the novella is very worth the read. You will finish this in one plane ride. Stick with it as the second half of the book is exceptional!Allen Tiffany attempts to quickly describe his Vietnam experience through the most seminal occurrence: his training of a new ""cherry"" who looks at the war from a different perspective and the massive war event that occurs. Reading the ""action event"" I was so astounded I had to challenge whether it was real or fiction, particularly as it describes future reunions.Unfortunately the buildup is too slow for me to rate a 5 but I do strongly recommend this short book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QU1FCS1BOVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6WXVF2#wasThisHelpful","R2QU1FCS1BOVA","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read to be entertained. But sometimes you need to read to learn. This book details the date/acquaintance rapes happening on the U of Montana campus, many involving football players. What separates this book from this exceptional author is the great research and storytelling of various incidences and their entirely different outcomes which allows the reader to have a greater knowledge of this subject. And more of us should read both sides of an issue to understand. This book details the hard job of law enforcement and prosecutors, the damage to the victims, the misunderstanding of the men who commit these crimes and infractions and sadly, the fans who want to ignore that their football players may be bad people.One of the top books of the year where you will learn and be entertained while learning.

"As a restaurant owner I'm reading more books about the business but still trying to be entertained and this book clearly did that. You will get great setup information of the roles of the different players in the restaurant industry and great descriptions of how this service can make a difference. This is what I came for.But what makes this book entertaining is this ""almost rock star"" who enjoys his high paying bartender job which turns in to a top waiter job at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills. Or at least that's my guess. I've made stops there but always for drinks, never for dinner which I will definitely do soon due to this great description. Ok, if you want to hear about stars, who is good to wait on, who is not, this is the book for you. He has personal favorites and does a good job in great detail showing how so many stars are really good people and, some who are not.  And I must admit, some of the bills for dinner absolutely astounded me. I've paid $4,000 dinner bills for business. But I cannot imagine taking a family of four to dinner and a bill of $8,000!  I think I'll pass on the expensive $4,000 bottles of wineBut what is very compelling is the pride in this distinguished restaurant which eventually turns in to disdain as he views their foreign corporate owner as destroying  their previously great culture. How this plays out and how well he conveys this in words is exceptional and I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend. Favorite part?  The author looks up to one professional waiter who after hours turns in to a sexual/drug enduced deviant. Well, at least in a good way and these stories are very entertaining.I strongly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUBJWWHAXK6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXA0TX4#wasThisHelpful","R2FUBJWWHAXK6Z","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An interesting, fast read of dating women on vacation from China. As Anglo men, knowledge of Chinese and a love for women, these guys attract women and describe in detail all of their movements thru late night disco, food and all activities. And that was some of the problems of the book. It becomes very mundane as he tries to weave their special talents for meeting women but do I need to now every minute of your day?It has many enjoyable parts and probably will be more appealing to others younger than me or with particular interest in China and Thailand. But part of writing is presenting a compelling story concisely with great character build. This didn't build the characters as well as I would like and was too detailed. Still, it was enjoyable and I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading, just not one of my favorites.

"Great story that many will think is similar to the Wolf of Wall Street, a book I did not like due to the author's writing ego. Mark Yagalla does not have that ego and recognizes his crimes and feels very badly as he effectively stole money from his investors to fund a lavish lifestyle.Some highlights in this very interesting and very fast read:His business start - the book does a great job of showing a young bright guy who also fortunately met influences that allowed him to expand his contacts and business. Many of these were conservative people like the Fulton Bank Director, a bank I have worked with, have great respect for and am a shareholder. Just another investor duped although he did remove his money. But in addition to the business start he also met a person who fed his insatiable appetite for high end call girls.His Ponzi Scheme and business practices - the interesting part here is his establishing relationships to become an early investor for the penny stock companies and how he was making money getting out before the losers. This is simply and quickly laid out and is interesting.His Love of Beautiful Women even if they were all generally Call Girls -  starting small and getting big the amount of money he was paying was unbelievable and he was clearly addicted to this and could not stop. Some of the names are familiar like his relationship with Michelle Braun, the madam who later supplied Tiger Woods. This addiction eventually feeds his lavish lifestyle to impress the women including Gulfstream planes and helicopters.  But read these chapters and look up the girls in Google. Very, very beautiful women that he idolized or disclosed their money grabbing weaknesses.Overall I could not recommend this book higher if you have interest in Wall Street business and the love of beautiful, but greedy women.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7XI21VGRF11Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPLU4Q8#wasThisHelpful","R7XI21VGRF11Y","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Engaging historical perspective that while dragging and repetitive at times, has so much information that frames our world now, and generally NOT in a positive way, that it should be required reading. Yes, I was aware of the name as a 61 yr old. But I was not aware of their roles. Not aware of brothers. Not aware of Allen's involvement in the CIA. Nor aware of their careers at the massive law firm of Cromwell and Sullivan.But reading this was stunning and made me angry. George Dulles was more responsible for the Cold War than anyone. And documents after the war shows the Soviets were not near as devious as we give them credit for. But our fear painted a view of a hidden enemy bent on our destruction. We missed opportunities with Khrushchev. More importantly and totally unaware to me, these guys we responsible for government overthrows and were actively involved in the 1950s with alienating Vietnam leading eventually to a horrible loss of civilian lives and more importantly to me, American soldiers who were led in to the wrong war at the wrong time.But let us not forget the documented CIA overthrows of Congo, Guatemala,Indonesia and Iran. Is this America? Well, in the post WWII world, we lost our values and stooped to such tactics.There are stories here America doesn't study and they should. How the interface of commerce, politics and war can lead to disastrous results that haunt us today.Read this book to learn. Not all of it will make you proud. Yes, I learned.

"Elvis' last girlfriend tells her story. And it's a very brief story since they dated under one year with Elvis proposing. Her honesty comes through loud and clear so if you want to know a lot about Elvis, read this book!!  And he's better and more normal than more people will imagine. And she doesn't cut corners. Yes, he shot out a TV. Yes, he gets irritated and has fits. But generally he is an incredibly nice guy seeking spiritual awareness.Probably the most interesting part of the book to me is her relationship with Lisa Marie and how normal Lisa seems. In the back of the book is a fabulous picture of her as a kid with full smile. It was great to get an inside look at her early life. Priscilla is also positively mentioned.This is not a long book. It is not here to settle any scores. It is here to tell what her life was like with Elvis and paints a great picture of him. I encourage this book for any Elvis fan or just those who are curious.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282NXE386UOPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425266338#wasThisHelpful","R282NXE386UOPB","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a solid book. Leigh Steinberg revolutionized the sports agency business. From the mid 70s with his first client UCal QB Steve Bartkowski who was only slightly younger than Steinberg to the 2000s, Leigh Steinberg was the Go To Guy. Agent who controlled the QB position. This book is very interesting in providing the backstory to his rise to fame, his philosophy on running the agency, his many relationships with athletes and specific stories of player negotiations. He eventually transcended player representation bridging into multimedia and ownership.But this book is at it's best just recounting how he got in the business, how he grew it and how he negotiated it. I had some dealings with his agency. As a CPA I interviewed to handle the finances for Walter Lewis, an AL QB who signed a million dollar contract with the USFL in 1983. We were selected by Steinberg's partner, Mike Sullivan. I specifically remember a year later when Mike called announcing he was leaving. That period is covered well in this book and needless to say, Steinberg felt mistreated by his former partner. Mike was a real pro I enjoyed meeting but I had no involvement with Leigh.If you are interested in pro football and the agency business, grab this book and read it!  But there is another part of Leigh's story and there have been newspaper articles that go into further detail of his alcoholism which broke Steinberg completely and ruined his reputation with many clients. But as you would expect of a marketing person, that is somewhat glossed over. Yes, it's covered. But relatively quickly and always with an angle to make him the hero. That's my only complaint with this book. Steinberg is a shell of his former self in the agency business but you would never know it form reading this. In some respects I wonder if he wrote this because he needs any money he can get.Irrespective to my ramblings and guesses, I thoroughly enjoyed this read and with the caveats mentioned can definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY1JAZ52FB04X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EGJ321U#wasThisHelpful","RY1JAZ52FB04X","A136YD08SCJ2LV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A136YD08SCJ2LV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Minecraft, to anyone not familiar with the franchise, is a simple yet increasingly sophisticated building game that has been equated to Legos for adults.  Players of all ages can learn and hone several skills including architecture, engineering, resource management, and broaden their overall creativity.  However, while the game is easy to pick up, it can be difficult to master, especially the red stone mechanics that gives Minecraft more challenge.There are a LOT of guides out there that claim to help assist the reader with learning the ins and outs of Minecraft.  I was particularly impressed with the Minecraft Guide for Dummies as it not only broke down the game perfectly for anyone to understand but also had a ""For Parents"" section that explained how Minecraft can be a great learning tool (albeit much more articulate than I).  The Ultimate Player's Guide to Minecraft is a great reference guide as it breaks down everything into comprehensive chapters for anyone above a 3rd grade level to read including red stone mechanics.  The chapters are organized and the language easy to understand.However, I felt as though the Dummies version gives a more conversational, yet informative, approach that everyone, including parents, can appreciate.  This isn't to say The Ultimate version is no good, far from it as it sits quite proudly next to my Dummies version on my shelf, but I would rather recommend the For Dummies version instead.Still a great read, but I'd recommend Minecraft For Dummies first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZBZ70YL5CVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0789755726#wasThisHelpful","R1TZBZ70YL5CVG","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An an audiophile I'm very particular about my sound systems as I have a Klipsch Icon surround sound and computer speaker system and a Harmon Kardon Onyx 2 speaker for my office.  The wife wanted something for the bedroom that produced good sound balance for when she's reading or primping in the adjacent bathroom.  The Panasonic SC-PMX9 is an excellent addition to our sound systems and has satisfied our prerequisites flawlessly.The SC-PMX9 supports several different input modes including Bluetooth, Apple Airplay, red-white stereo, FM radio, and CDs, giving it a wide variety of streaming options with the exception of 3.5mm Auxiliary input, but that can be supplemented with a cheap Y-Splitter cable.  I was able to sync my Samsung Note up to the Panasonic simply by setting the stereo to Bluetooth and it popped right up on my phone's BT menu.  Simple as that.The sound quality is just amazing.  I decided to christen it's first song with Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone and that perked everything up almost immediately.  The stereo has a near flawless balance between bass and clarity, allowing the listening to hear every song as it was meant to be.My only real beefs with the SC-PMX9 is I'm not certain if it's worth the hefty price tag and I wish it had a direct 3.5mm AUX input but you do get what you pay for and the latter can be resolved with a cheap cable purchase.All in all, an amazing device!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNBP0VE9ABZN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9IPRK0#wasThisHelpful","RNBP0VE9ABZN7","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Viking Oval Roaster is an excellent addition in any modern kitchen with it's beautiful, modern, stainless steel look and it's practical usage as a metal oval roaster and Dutch oven.

"Sturdiness in a case is a must but with a phone like the Samsung Note 5, which is known for being a slippery phone, having a case with good grips is a must.  Truth be told, the entire new line of Samsung are super slippery as the stage 4 gorilla glass on the back has no traction to speak of, whose responsibility falls on the case.  I usually recommend Speck gripped cases as they can maintain position even on a vehicle's dashboard, but I wanted to try the new Verus and, I gotta say, it's very durable but super slippery to the point where it's useless as a case.The Note 5, with it's aforementioned stage 4 gorilla glass, is a tank to begin with so the only reason for a case is added protection and to provide traction.  Without traction, the Note 5 can easily slip out of a person's pocket, especially if they're wearing tight jeans or yoga pants, and fall to the ground increasing the risk of a break.  The Verus case is just as slippery as my Note 5 kept slipping out of my pocket with little trouble.  It took all of one shift at work for me to retire the Verus for good and go back to my Urban Armor Gear.Again, the Verus provides excellent protection but it's too slippery to be considered since the Note 5 is a tank to begin with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VKWUMCNTWVEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQKYSF6#wasThisHelpful","R2VKWUMCNTWVEY","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I recently adopted a rescue from the local shelter named Dax, she is around one year old and requires a LOT of stimulation and attention especially now that she's bonded with us.  The Iris CLF-5 didn't really do it for us as it was annoying to build and too small for any cat other than a kitten, but the CL-021 was actually what Dax needed as it provides a good amount of scratch material and wasn't too small to use... and I didn't contemplate seppuku while assembling it.Assembling the CL-021 took roughly 15 minutes, a third of the time it took to build the CLF-5 and it wasn't that much of a chore... except for getting the ball danglers in the right post as the instructions weren't all that clear on what angle they had to be put in.  Truth be told, I broke one of them trying to figure it out but, oh well, still have the other 3.Once I had it assembled, I put it in our bedroom near the window that Dax likes to perch on and watched her react to this new marvel that came in a box.  She was hesitant at first but eventually started scratching it once I rubbed a cloth on it that I just recently scratched her head with (amazing how effective it is to distinguish their belongings with this technique).  This method marks their territory and gives them a sense of familiarity in the same way they mark people to designate family.Dax didn't use the upper tier so much as it was a stepping block to the window, which was my intention as I'd rather she takes steps up there rather than leap and knock over whatever is up there.All in all, the CL-021 is nice albeit the instructions need to be clearer on a few things.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1810L63SYG459/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY2531M#wasThisHelpful","R1810L63SYG459","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meet Dax, our 13-month old rescue and one very bored kitty that tends to get into trouble.  We usually keep her entertained with a laser pointer but both my wife and I work so we needed something keep her busy while we're away.  We tried both the IRIS CLF-5 and CLF-021 and, while the CLF-021 was very nice and Dax loves it, the CLF-5 was a pain to assemble and it's so scaled down that even out skinny Dax cannot use it effectively.Assembly was not fun as the instructions have you start from the top down and the cloth wrappings on the vertical connections do not want to cooperate.  It took me about 45 minutes to get it right as I ended up removing all wrappings from the connectors to get the bolts to line up properly.As for the product as a whole, it's not, at all, a scratching post, nor does it provide any real use as the platforms and tree house are so small that my tiny Dax cannot use it.  Dax isn't a big cat as she's still growing and when I placed her on the saucer on the right she looked cramped and quickly jumped down.  Truth be told, she only uses the bottom rung to sleep on and that's about it.This is more for kittens due to it's size and that doesn't do much for owners since you can't keep them kittens forever.  I cannot recommend this product for normal users.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K59U3Z4DMN7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY2701I#wasThisHelpful","R1K59U3Z4DMN7D","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Amidst the many battles, missions, and operations of the Korean War are numerous stories that cannot be forgotten and, from the author of Higher Call, comes another story that lives up to its namesake that evokes similar emotions as did Unbreakable and Into the Mouth of the Cat (Excellent read).Adam Makos tells the story of two naval aviators who couldn't be more different and the most amazing one-man rescue ever.  Truth be told the story seems far fetched and, while I won't give away the specifics of the rescue, it seems almost mission impossible but Makos delivers it genuinely and faithfully to where the audience believes what it is reading and roots for the characters no matter what the peril.All in all, the best book I've read all summer and I hope they adapt this one to screenplay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YIECQKZRS5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804176582#wasThisHelpful","R7YIECQKZRS5A","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With national tension with law enforcement at an all-time high and the Black Lives Matter Movement, it's no surprise that stories of alleged police brutality have become all the more poignant albeit it is putting some stories into the category of hysteria.  Don't get me wrong, stories of brutality, abuse, and fraud MUST be brought to light for justice to be served, and this motivates me greatly to read about them to form my own opinions.With this in mind, I found Ronnie Greene's story of several NOPD officers response to an officer under fire, their response, and the cover-up that followed to be very rioting, shocking, and disturbing.  Tales such as these need the light of day to bring about a better discourse on law enforcement policy and Greene does a great job investigating the incident... if only his writing skills matched his research methods.Truth be told, Shots on the Bridge has a great story behind it but it marred by poor writing and editing to the point where one has to re-read sentences and paragraphs once more to understand what Greene is trying to say.

"As an ardent fan of Legos and K'Nex, I was very curious to see what it would be like to construct a K'Nex Nerf-esque rifle and how well it would hold up.  While the construction of the K-Force rifle was mostly fun with some difficulty, the rifle didn't hold up well under even non-tactical bench shooting and is little more than a show-off piece than a Nerf rifle.Construction of the K-Force was entertaining to say the least as I had a good time seeing the mechanics come together as I would with any other K'Nex or Lego project.  The instructions did present a small issue of assuming the reader would see symmetry in the pictures as they were slanted/tilted, meaning that one had to guess the other side was the same and build accordingly.  There were a few times I had to disassemble the rifle and start a process over.  An issue, but a small one.Once I completed the rifle I tested it out on my unsuspecting wife, who immediately commented on how much force and impact it caused on her posterior, to which I was then sentenced to clean the bathroom.  Truth be told, the K-Force rifle has quite a bit of velocity on it, giving the rifle a lot of power behind it so I don't recommend shooting at people in vulnerable spots like the face or groin... unless you really, REALLY want to and have a decent enough head start.However, it didn't take all but two minutes for the trigger mechanism to require adjustment as it relies on a very primitive setup to fire.  I had to make frequent adjustments to allow the rifle to fire again, making it impossible to rely on in an actual Nerf war.  Parts of the frame also seemed to warp or twist a little despite my thorough construction indicating that it is more fragile than it looks.  Needless to say, this is a show piece and little more.I wouldn't take the K-Force to a Nerf fight but I would, and have, ambushed my wife and her cats with it but it doesn't work well under anything but controlled settings so this is a show piece that is more fun to construct than use.All in all, an OK toy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NHTJZ2UYITC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5YA2D0#wasThisHelpful","R3NHTJZ2UYITC2","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Similar to the AR-15 rifle platform, the Nerf N-Strike ECS-10 sports a modular design that can be outfitted with a wide variety of attachments from scopes, forward grips, butt stocks, etc., allowing the user to adapt the rifle to any situation... in theory.In practice, the ECS-10 is a creative design marred by a flimsy design that seems to want to break apart, and attachments that are anything but practical.  The rear butt stocks are barely held together on the frame by two plastic leads that feel wobbly when pressed firmly against the shoulder while the scopes don't really do what they're supposed to do.However, despite the shortcomings from the attachments, the ECS-10 is still a solid semi-automatic nerf rifle platform that competes decently with other similar rifles on the market.

"Just moved into a new place and it's a bit of a fixer-upper so we needed new tools to be able update and modernize our home.  We had to cut into the walls, make cuts on plywood, tiles, etc. and that requires a tool that can make consistent cuts without bringing over a band-saw or a table-saw.  We used the RotoZip SS560 and were very pleased with the results.  The RotoZip was able to consistently make clean cuts and the ""dust vault"" was able to trap all the dust, which is nice for clean-up and the operator doesn't have to wear a face-mask.The RotoZip was very easy to setup and use as the controls are very basic and the attachments come on and off super easily.  This is a definite plus for anyone with limited DiY experience.  The motor is surprisingly heavy and strong for it's size so it's powerful enough for most small tasks but I would strongly urge operators to use both hands while utilizing it for safety.My only complaints were the overall cost of additional bits as they seem to cost almost double of what one would normally cost.

"Never was a firm believer in many forms of holistic medicine/living but I always try to keep an open mind on new ideas and perspectives.  However, while I found the dietary advice and recipes genuinely intriguing, there are several scientific elements the author seemed to have missed, glossed over, or oversimplified.The first thing I noticed in chapter 1 was how the author talked a lot about stress affecting conception, and we all know stress is public enemy no. 1, and a few stress-related factors such as increased cortisol but fails to address the condition by name; Cushing's Syndrome or Cushing's Disease (two separate, but similar conditions).  I found that odd since the authors were describing it but not address it by name.  While not a true demerit on the book itself, it made me read on with a more attentive eye and I soon found other bizarre notions.In chapter 2, the author suggests that anyone having trouble smoking should ""consult an acupuncturist ASAP.""  I have read one or two studies on how acupuncture was supposed to make the taste of cigarettes unpalatable (most notably a 2001 study of 47 subjects), those studies were considered inconclusive as they failed to meet the required minimum assurances of a bias-free methodology.  For instance, in the aforementioned 2001 study, the researchers relied heavily on questionnaires and the honesty of the subjects thereof rather than any form of reliable observation thus raising the margin of error too high to be considered accurate.  While prominent personalities such as Dr. Oz, whom I do respect and agree on some issues, endorse acupuncture as a method of quitting smoking, it is not a proven science.Truth be told, the remainder of the book is filled with seemingly unsubstantiated or pseudo-science facts that stems from traditional Chinese medicine.  While the author cites studies, they cannot be found on search engines, only on the author's website or on highly-bias websites which further questions their validity.  I do agree that we put too much crap in our food and it can lead to horrific side effects in pregnancy, but there is plenty of good science behind an educated and accredited MD and OBGYN as well.Overall, I found the recipes intriguing enough to keep in my cookbook cabinet but I wouldn't take any of the pregnancy advice too seriously.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z3U2BSTQXJV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592336620#wasThisHelpful","R1Z3U2BSTQXJV0","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually keep a small fixed blade in the driver's side door of my vehicle in the event of an emergency and am somewhat particular about my blades.  I had a cheap United Cutlery Combat Toothpick there for about two years until I had the opportunity to review the SOG SEAL Strike knife, which is now my personal defense blade in my vehicle due to its superior design and durability.After testing the SOG SEAL Strike for about two weeks my buddies and I noted the knife is extremely sturdy, sharp, has excellent balance, and the sheath sports several utilitarian features albeit with one moderate flaw that prevents a perfect score.The blade is just under 5 inches making it ideal for concealment even with the sheath.  The tang is perfectly forged into the handle allowing for fantastic balance and durability since most ""survival knifes"" have very short tangs and can snap easily.  One simply needs to hold the blade to feel the heavy weight behind it but it's light enough to carry around.As for how sharp the blade is, we tested it on the usual suspects of cutting targets from twine, paper (trying to slice through a piece of paper without sawing shows true sharpness), plastic ties, summer sausage, kindling, etc. and the SOG SEAL Strike passed beautifully.  For most non-hardened objects little to no sawing was required while the serrated edge provided superior sawing for stronger surfaces with little effort.  In other words, it comes sharp, VERY sharp, and can be kept sharp with the sharpener on the sheath towards the front tip.One more great feature I liked on the blade itself was, at the bottom of the handle, the knife sports a rugged 'bashing' edge for applying a little brute force trauma to your intended target, giving the user more than one way to enforce order.The sheath, I found, was a source of great utilitarian features but also of the blade's largest flaw.1:  The sheath has a sharpener that works.2:  The sheath also sports a line cutter for twine, nylon cords, cables, etc. and it works great.3:  A frustrater that I cannot seem to figure out (never could) but I handed it to a hunter friend of mine and he nodded in approval.However, the sheath does have one design flaw regarding how it is carried and the knife removed from it.  The upper portion of the sheath that supports the handle of the knife is wider than the width of the knife's handle.  The width is due to the belt clip being located at the top of the sheath whereas most other sheaths have them located towards the middle such as my USMC Kabar.  This doesn't sound like an issue until you try an unsheathe the knife and realize that you have to use your fingers to do so less you grab the whole thing and yank the sheath off your belt.  The sheath is also hard polymer so one has to either grip the whole thing or use their fingers with relative delicacy.  Also, the sheath is very bottom heavy which means that the knife, when clipped to one's belt, will flop around and that is quite a nuisance when out and about.  Even if you had the knife attached to your suspenders facing downwards, one would have to exert some delicacy with the fingers to remove the knife from the sheath.This may not seem like an issue and it isn't in a casual sense.  However, in the field it prevents rapid deployment from the sheath to an open hand and that can be a problem with soldiers, Marines, law enforcement, etc.  This makes the SOG SEAL Strike more of a casual knife and not something for the field but IT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT BLADE.Despite the flaw with the sheath, the SOG SEAL Strike blade is still an amazing blade that I will keep on me while driving.  I'd recommend it to hunters and enthusiasts but not anyone serving in the field.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G01LWGB3KVXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4N5Y32#wasThisHelpful","R1G01LWGB3KVXB","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For over 100 years mankind has perfected the art of flying (not air travel) and the romantic appeal of taking the skies is still as striking as it was during the Pan Am years of aviation.  Author and 747 pilot Mark Vanhoenacker masterfully talks about the romance of flight by talking about himself, a former academician turned pilot, his journey to become an aviator, and the science and joys of flying without too much technobabble to confuse the general audience.Indeed, at times, Vanhoenacker discusses the science behind flight but does so in a way that does not baffle the general audience.  While I consider myself an aviation fanatic since my days working the public affairs office as a civilian intern for the USAF, I'm no astrophysicist, so reading about complex terms broken down for us dummies in the audience really made my experience with Skyfaring a good one.I really enjoyed reading this one as it excites the imagination with it's romanization of flying and it's articulate, yet simple, prose that makes Skyfaring a read for everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5Q5DU1JZGWV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038535181X#wasThisHelpful","R2T5Q5DU1JZGWV","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've heard of KIVA and have nothing but admiration for their work with micro loans.  There is no doubt in my mind that the author, Jessica Jacklay, is a true believer in what she does and I commend that, however, Clay Water Brick is marred with disjointed narratives and poor prose that makes the book difficult to read at times.  I had to put the book down once or twice as I had to gather my thoughts on where Jacklay was going, which always ended up with me forcing myself to continue and I didn't care for the payout.Jacklay has a knack of jumping from topic to topic with no real sense of direction and, if there is one, it isn't adequately explained and it doesn't start to come together at the end like a Quentin Tarantino film, either.  On top of that, Jacklay also exhibits poor prose in her writing with poor sentence structure and a LOT of redundancy that seems to ramble on a lot.Either way, while Jacklay's story is interesting and, indeed, heartwarming, the poor organization and prose makes the book nearly unreadable and requires serious revisions before being a 4-5 star.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C62SJS03L65D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679643761#wasThisHelpful","R2C62SJS03L65D","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having grown up in a suburban area north of Seattle I find myself loving to read any local or regional history regarding the small area I call home that doesn't have to deal with Twilight, Grey's Anatomy, or a nameless romantic flick with Tom Hanks.  However, after reading the collection of stories from Jack Nisbet, I find myself wondering what I just read beyond a bunch of seemingly loose narratives, whose only commonality is the region they resided in.Nisbet treats the audience to a series of stories involving various people living across the Pacific NW from Oregon to Idaho but, beyond that, there's no real connecting factors and, if there are any, Nisbet makes no effort to link them.  This leaves the reader wondering what it is they're reading beyond a bunch of narratives so the book lacks cohesion and that's not a good thing.If anything, if Nisbet made an effort to weave a narrative or focal point into the stories than Ancient Places would be a much better read but, for now, it's merely a table-top reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B6RZ9IT8X4BN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570619808#wasThisHelpful","R2B6RZ9IT8X4BN","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alzheimers is one disease that should scare the living hell out of anyone not because there is no cure but the notion of losing your mind bit by bit and being cognizant of it as it happens would be enough to drive me mad.  Alzheimers literally is the theft of memory as author Jonathan Kozol so eloquently puts it in his book regarding his father, a renowned psychiatrist, and his eventual downfall caused by the horrific disease.Kozol spares no description as he and his family struggled to understand and live with his father's ailments despite having comfortable financial status.  It reminds us that life with coherence is precious and that we REALLY need to appreciate what we have while we have.I experienced some difficulty reading Theft of Memory given Alzheimers runs in my family and I am one that is considered ""at risk"" of catching it but, we all face reality at some point and fight to keep our whits and health in the meantime.

"Needless to say that I, a male, did not take this test.  My fiancé took the tests as her period is late and tensions are high so the Clearblue tests were more of a Godsend than I care to admit as the results from taking two tests over the course of a few days (just to be sure) put us, particularly me, at ease (see title).My lady, after using both tests, was happy to report that the Clearblue are easy to use as the grip provides decent... distance between the hand and the... um... stream, allowing her to use the test in a clean manner with spillage.  The instructions were simple enough, consisting of a PG version of a dog's solution to anything (urinate on it), and wait up to three minutes for results.After carefully examining the test after the allotted time elapsed we're proud to announce that she's not pregnant (again, see title) so our parents will refrain from being basket cases on the matter till AFTER we get married (Friday).  The pluses mean you are pregnant and the minus means no so there's little room to speculate, a definite plus.Overall, we're very pleased with Clearblue and SHE will continue to use them while I sit in the other room saying we won't be in THAT situation again but, then again, who am I kidding?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LOL7SQG7V6C8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GXEHL8#wasThisHelpful","R2LOL7SQG7V6C8","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My lady loves to experiment with different nail colors and polishes and had an absolute ball trying out the Essie Nail Colo as the silver glittery look just shined in just about any light.  The color allowed her to experiment with different kinds of applications for different effects.  Again, she really enjoyed it.However, one small issue was that the polish kept clumping in globs preventing an even coat.  This is due to the thickness and multiple glitters inside each application creating a nice big glop, which makes it tricky, but not intolerable, to apply.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to experiment with different nail colors and polishes but issue care when applying.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBBMJA6UH205/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H94HAY4#wasThisHelpful","R2MBBMJA6UH205","A30IP5D5DLHRPA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30IP5D5DLHRPA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The clear coating with black trimming looks really good with the white S6 so I wouldn't recommend it for the black sapphire.Also, unlike most cases, the UAG does not interfere with the buttons so, while it may seem stiff at first, one can still operate the buttons with ease and not worry about any ""runoff"" and, by that, I mean having your fingers accidentally hit other buttons while touching the home button.  One of my biggest gripes on open-faced cases is that the case overlaps onto the screen too much so when you hit the home button you repeatedly hit another button cause you have to hover half your thumb over the case.All in all, the UAG is an excellent case and the clear is perfect for the white S6.

"Most ruggedized cellphone cases are either too bulky (Otterbox Defender, Lifeproof, etc.) or provide the worst possible traction possible (Otterbox Symmetry) as they can easily slip out of your hands or pocket.Having worked with a LOT of cellphone cases, one of my favorite brands are Speck as they are military-grade, drop-tested, have excellent anti-heat and impact insulation, and sport some of the best rubber grips for the price.  The S6 case is no different as the grips provide fantastic traction on any surface including a vehicle dashboard, is easy to put on, is super tight with the S6 inside it (which you want), and the buttons are not restricted by the case itself.The dragon green color is an interesting choice, one that only seems to work well with the black sapphire S6 cool and not so much with the white or gold colors.I recommend Speck cases to anyone seeking a nice budgetary case that provides excellent protection.

"I have tested out the Vysk and Mophie cases before and, while the Incipio holds up very well, it is not as high quality as the Vysk.The Incipit is, essentially, a battery backup case that provides up to 120% additional charge for the iPhone 6 and charges via a mini USB cable when in need or a recharge.  The Incipio sports a good battery, easy to set in frame that is one piece as opposed to the usual two pieces (Such as the Vysk and Mophie), and the frame provides good protection from drops or impact.However, there are two things to note about the frame.First off, the outer shell is smooth and rubbery suggesting that it may wear out after prolonged use.  One of my biggest complaints against case manufactures such as Otterbox (the Defender in particular) is that consistent removing of the case can wear out the rubber and it looses it's grip.  This can lead to poor protecting and a bad grip on the phone.My next issue is the texture/traction as it's too smooth to remain in one place.  Slippery cases can slip out of a person's hand, pocket, or off the dashboard of a vehicle and go where ever gravity takes it.  Rubber grip marks, such as those found on certain Speck cases, make cases a LOT harder to slip up with and they, typically, don't fall out of a person's pocket or slip out of their hands.All in all, the Incipio is good, but there are better ones out there.

They can be scratched off, but I don't suspect they will just start randomly peeling off on their own like cheaper quality stickers would. The red color is muted, not shiny.I'm annoyed that for the price this stapler doesn't even come with a complimentary strip of staples. Seriously, this thing retails for $40 and you don't even provide a strip of staples? The price is also outrageous. I'm glad I got this for free through Vine as my boyfriend is a big 49ers fan.

So I didn't have high expectations here but I wanted to give them a fair shot.Since March, I have been using the MyFitnessPal app to help monitor my calorie intake. I have also been using an exercise bike three times a week. Between these two activities, I have been consistently losing one to one and a half pounds a week. Nothing exceptional, but it has been consistent and I have not been hungry at all. This supplement is the only change I have made to my routine. I've stuck to my same diet and exercise regimen.If you have trouble swallowing pills, this product is not for you. Each pill is slightly less than an inch in length. And you need to take three of them, twice a day. You are supposed to take three a half hour to an hour before either breakfast or lunch, and three a half hour to an hour before dinner. That is a LOT of pills to have to take each day if you have issues swallowing pills to begin with. I usually struggle with taking supplements or medication on an empty stomach as it sometimes makes me nauseous. Fortunately, I had no such issue with this supplement so I would say it should be safe for those with sensitive stomachs to use.The bottom line is whether or not it does anything. After ten days, I lost 2 lbs. A week later, I had lost slightly more than 1 and a half pounds. So this reflects a small increase in weight loss over what I was losing before taking the supplement. My appetite hasn't really changed at all, but I haven't been starving myself anyway on my existing diet plan so I didn't expect that to change.For me personally, the impact of the supplement is too minor for me to add this to my regular regimen. Is it worth $30-$40 a month to lose an additional one or two pounds a month? For some people, it may me. For me, I'm in no hurry to reach my goal weight. I'm more interested in being able to maintain my goal weight once I reach it than rushing to hit the goal. If you are struggling with your diet because you always feel hungry, this nay prove useful. It does seem to work, but for me the results are too minor to get overly excited. But if you are fighting for every pound, it may be worth it to you to at least try this for a month or two to help your body adjust to a lower calorie intake.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LC24MCWY0YJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VE9B9L0#wasThisHelpful","R1LC24MCWY0YJF","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Star Wars: The Force Awakens X-Wing Miniatures Game Core Set is a complete game that can be enjoyed without having to buy additional expansions. This is never a forgone conclusion in the miniature games hobby, so it is a big deal. Everything you need to play is in the box. You can, of course, buy expansions if you wish, but they are not needed to enjoy the game. The pre-painted ships are gorgeous and have exceptional detail. Rules are clearly written and easy to follow. This would make a great gift for a Star Wars fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKU5LQQVU61J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014TKHEPA#wasThisHelpful","RBKU5LQQVU61J","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grabbed this for the nieces, as they love DIY projects. The set comes with six spools of thread, which is plenty to keep the kids busy for several hours wrapping anything and everything. The spools are about the same size as a standard spool of thread that you would buy at a craft store, which means you could expand your color repertoire with pretty much any thread you wanted. Which is a bonus, since the official refills for this thing are $12-$13 for 3 spools!  Much cheaper to buy a few dozen different spools of thread at a craft shop for your kids.As some others have noted, getting parts on and off can be a bit problematic. From my perspective, the primary fear was that, because the unit is comprised of cheap plastic, too much force would break it. Once everything is hooked up, however, it is very easy to use and you can use it to decorate all sorts of small items: pens, eyeglass frames, watches, lipstick cases, hair accessories, the dog's collar...whatever they can get their hands on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CI8SIZB1RC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFWOXHU#wasThisHelpful","R18CI8SIZB1RC3","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teen Titans Vol. 1: Blinded by the Light is another reboot of the popular Teen Titans team.  Apparently nobody ever explained the concept of “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” to D.C. This new incarnation of the team isn’t bad. In fact, if this was an all-new team formed for some specific purpose, it would feel more interesting.  But the problem is that this isn’t an all-new team. It is still supposedly the Teen Titans but with a fresh coat of paint and a few parts moved around.  The entire reboot feels like change just for the point of change, with no real direction. Sort of like when a cereal company promotes “ALL NEW PACKAGING” but the actual product ingredients don’t change all that much.There isn’t a lot of character build-up in volume one. The story jumps right into the action. But the action is fairly standard and feels phoned in. It is action for the sake of action and to show off some of the new characters’ powers, but doesn’t really do much for moving the story along.  The team dynamic never really fleshes out in this volume. Hopefully. we’ll get more of that in future volumes.Note: I was given a copy of this through NetGalley for review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QEDSEIAUW8KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401252370#wasThisHelpful","R1QEDSEIAUW8KS","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This multi-cooker has been a wonderful addition to my kitchen. It would be easy to dismiss this device as a glorified rice cooker, but it is a versatile and highly useful appliance. Takes the place of multiple appliances.Included: Detachable electrical cord, poacher/steamer basket, measuring cup, ladle, and spatula/scraper, and cookbookOverall design: Sleek and sturdy design. Quality construction across the board. Carry handle and cool-to-the-touch exterior allow you to use this to carry meals with you for potluck dinners and office parties. The non-stick interior unit is ridiculously easy to clean. Plenty of products claim to be non-stick, but you still end up with difficulty safely cleaning them without damaging the non-stick surface. After two dozen uses, the interior unit cleans up in two minutes tops with regular dish soap and water and no scrubbing.Ease of use: The appliance comes programmed with ten preset temperatures and cooking times to let you easily prepare rice, stews, sauces, steam vegetables, even saute and roast. We have a gas stove top and normally I have to constantly adjust the flame and continuously stir or monitor pots and pans to prevent foods from boiling over or sticking. With this multi-cooker, you set it and walk away until it is done, freeing you up to do other things while dinners cooks.Quality of results: Even cooking temperatures make recipes come out perfect. So far, I've used this to make beef stew, pineapple chicken with rice, chicken and quinoa with cashew nuts, scrambled eggs, chicken alfredo, ziti with meat sauce, and a bunch of other recipes. With pasta dishes, you don't even need to boil the pasta first. You can prepare the sauce and pasta all at once with the simple instructions provided in the included cookbook. The only things I haven't attempted yet are baking or making yogurt. Every meal I've created in this, from my own recipes from scratch to recipes from their cookbook to pre-packaged foods like Hamburger Helper, has come out perfectly.I confess that I am one of those people who never would have spent this kind of money on a multi-cooker and would have just dismissed it as a fancy, overpriced rice cooker. But I just love this appliance. If you enjoy cooking but want to make your life easier in the kitchen, this appliance will become your favorite.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0EIBWZL0PLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R2P0EIBWZL0PLL","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since we have been giving this to Chewy, our 13 year old Doberman/German Shepard mix, we have seen a noticeable improvement in his mobility. He's able to get up and dow the basement stairs on his own again and once more wants to play instead of just sitting around all day. He's still slower than he once was, but he's 13.Pills are very tiny. For Chewy's weight, we have to give him 3 a day. So a bottle is a 20 day supply. This makes the product exoensive at the list price of over $25. But it is an acceptable value at the Amazon sale price of $11. If the price started to go up, I would probably start looking into other brands.

"We ordered two of these dressers and they arrived today. I am pleased with the delivery speed, as we weren't expecting them for another week.Like another reviewer noted, the color of the dressers in person does not match the photo. The photo indicates a vibrant blue. The actual color is a black-blue. It looks black to my boyfriend, but I have better color definition than he does and can see the slight blue hue. It is definitely NOT the vibrant blue in the image.There was also a faint turpentine smell when we uncrated the dressers, but it went away after a few hours and as of this evening I no longer smell it. I'm going to chalk that up to the dressers being made recently, perhaps, and not having time to completely air out before being shipped.The overall construction of the dressers is adequate in relation to the price we paid ($137 each). The dressers have heft to them. They aren't going to get knocked over easily. They sit flat on the floor with no wobbling. The drawers open and close easily and are fairly roomy. You could sit a small TV or other device on the top of one of these units and not worry about the top buckling.But while the overall construction is sufficient, the company drops the ball on the little things. The company that manufactures these dressers needs to get their QA dept in line. One of the dressers arrived short screws to attach a handle.They are standard screws so we'll find some to add the last handle. Two of the drawers have scuff marks on the interior edges. They are only visible when the drawer is open. I'm not necessarily mad about either issue as they are minor, but it does reflect poorly on their QA that we ordered two dressers and both had problems.Overall, these dressers will serve our needs. Not particularly impressed but not upset either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W14RT7INNBQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WNJXFO#wasThisHelpful","R3W14RT7INNBQM","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using this product with Chewy for 20 days, I have to say the jury is still out on whether or not it actually does anything. Based on Chewy's weight (70 lbs), we have been giving him two per day. He likes them and responds to them like treats. The list of ingredients doesn't include anything that would set off alarms. It is a relatively straightforward list. But truth be told, there has been no real change in his behavior. He's never been an aggressive dog (unless he thought I was in danger) but he barks at the drop of a hat and gets worked up over random noises. We had hoped this might tone him down a little. He still barks his brains out at the neighborhood cat whenever it walks across the lawn. He still goes nuts at random sounds. He's not begging and mooching as much anymore, but I associate that with the recent changes in his dog food (we switched him to grain-free food). It is possible that he is just too old and set in his ways (he's 13) for this to really do much to him.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5DJN4F8BLX5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001WOOC9S#wasThisHelpful","R5DJN4F8BLX5Z","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Varney the Vampire is a Victorian-era gothic serial that was first published from 1845-1847 in what was known as the “penny dreadful” format. Authorship of the original work is still a matter of some debate; though most acknowledge James Malcolm Rymer or Thomas Peckett Prest (or possibly both) as the actual author(s). Varney is considered by many the original vampire story on which all others are built. Varney didn’t play to the vampire horror tropes. It created them. By modern standards, the narrative is woefully inconsistent, poorly edited, and occasionally (all right, more than occasionally) downright soap opera. But it is important to appreciate Varney in relation to the time it was written. It was a surprisingly revolutionary work.These Dover Publications editions are not a retelling or a revision. These are reproductions of the original text with all the warts. While this edition does reproduce some of the original art, not all of the art is included. It is important to note that the actual penny dreadful serial ran well over two hundred chapters. I can understand why the publishers made the decision to limit the number of images included. Even breaking the serial into Parts One and Two, as Dover has done here, still results in two huge books without all the images. It is important for readers to understand what they are getting. This is not a modernized retelling of the original story. It is the original text, in Victorian English, with all the grammar and spelling errors and plot holes included.My review copy was a PDF of the print book. While the pages are high resolution, because they are reproductions of the original work the text itself is at times hard to read due to inconsistencies in the original source material. I cannot speak for mobi or epub versions of this book; though I have to image formatting them was a nightmare!I’m glad Dover Publications took the time to restore Varney the Vampire for its historic and literary value. Those of us that are book buffs appreciate the care required to restore a classic like this. But casual readers are going to struggle with trying to actually read the text and may not really appreciate the story because of it.Reviewer Note: I obtained a copy of this book through Netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAT9X0HWZDCE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486228444#wasThisHelpful","R1FAT9X0HWZDCE","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A is for Arsenic: The Poisons of Agatha Christie by Kathryn Harkup is a delightful, entertaining, and thoughtful look at how one of literature’s greatest mystery writers used poisons. Some might consider the topic a bit morbid, but Harkup’s approach to the material is actually educational and fun.For mystery and suspense writers, this book should be required reading for both the historical perspective it offers and as a matter of craft. For fans of the genres, the book provides a unique insight into Agatha Christie’s body of work.This isn’t just a list of which poisons are used in which stories. Harkup presents the science behind the poisons as Christie would have understood it. Christie was well versed in the science behind her preferred method of murder, having worked extensively in pharmacies during both world wars. She also understood the logistics of poison: how easy or difficult they were to obtain, how easily they could or could not be traced, and how investigators would go about identifying them.Instead of taking a dry, academic approach, Harkup adopts a more conversational tone that will make the book more accessible to casual readers. The approach, however, may put off those expecting a straightforward scientific discussion. This isn’t a science book and it certainly won’t tell you how to poison anyone today. But it does offer an extensive historic look at the use of poisons throughout history and how that knowledge was used by Christie.A is for Arsenic is a wonderful look into the mind of Agatha Christie and would be a welcome addition to the library of any fan.Reviewer Note: I was given a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for a review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28C1AQHTTYRX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147291130X#wasThisHelpful","R28C1AQHTTYRX9","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is possible that if you have really damaged hair, that this shampoo may actually do something. But for me, there has been no positive change to my hair condition from using this product. I don't use curling irons or hairspray or even conditioner. I do use an anti-frizz product. So my hair is pretty healthy to begin with. I haven't been using my normal anti-frizz product while using this shampoo so I could accurately assess if it was accomplishing anything.First, this shampoo has a weird smell. I can't quite put my finger on it. It smells a little like vegetable oil but there is something else there as well. Thankfully the smell doesn't linger long after rinsing, but it is noticeable. Second, it doesn't lather very well. You actually need to use quite a bit of it to get any sort of real lather going. I needed almost twice as much product as I do with other brands to get the same level of lather. Third, after a few uses I started to notice waxy residue building up in my hair brush. As I've never had that happen before, I have to assume it is residue being left behind from the shampoo itself. And this doesn't really seem to be all that effective with frizz. Maybe after a few months of use I wouldn't need to use a separate anti-frizz product. But seriously after a few weeks if a shampoo is going to deliver on the hype you should see a significant improvement.My hair feels clean after use. So it is a functional enough shampoo. But I don't feel that, for people with normal hair anyway, this is of much value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKXIO9D2BM45/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI4VZWW#wasThisHelpful","RAKXIO9D2BM45","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It looks like a toy. Yeah yeah I know. It IS a toy. But no, the Easy-Bake Oven is still supposed to be functional oven. I had one as a child (amazingly avoided burning myself or the house down in the process). The ""fresh, modern look"" looks like a generic toy. I have concerns about the overall construction of the item. Outside the box, it doesn't look like it can withstand a lot of use. Also, for the size of this thing, the actual tray that is used to bake is ridiculously tiny. What am I doing, baking for elves?I'm trying to put my own nostalgic disappointment aside because I understand nothing is made like it was ""in the old days."" The included recipes are simple enough to follow. The finished baked goods were okay (and if I'm honest, that was also true with the old EBO lol). But there are a lot of missed opportunities here.Like why isn't there a real timer/clock on this item? At first I thought maybe I had gotten a demo model or something (wouldn't be the first time, Vine!) but another reviewer noted the same issue. Baking is all about timing. WHT IS THERE NO TIMER? Also, with the conversion to electric from the notorious light bulb, why doesn't it have multiple settings. The included spatula doesn't give me the warm fuzzies. Seems to be cheap plastic that probably should not be exposed to heat.But then the nieces saw this and freaked out wanting to use it.

"Massimo Montanari’s Medieval Tastes is a detailed, well-researched, and insightful look into the evolution of the culinary arts and how our modern concepts of “Medieval” food are, frankly, hilariously wrong. This is not a cookbook, but rather a historical account of the development of cuisine during the medieval period. Montanari discusses not only how our modern ideas of what foods were eaten during the Medieval era is flawed, but also how the foods items themselves were fundamentally different centuries ago.Much of our modern thought on medieval cuisine is rooted in entertainment media and the romanticizing of the time period courtesy of medieval festivals and events. Montanari digs deep into the actual historical records to reveal how complex and at times controversial certain culinary movements were during the time period. It is an intriguing look into the day-to-day lives of both commoners and nobles and how food played a role beyond mere sustenance. The book is weighed down, however, by the academic tendency to over-explain and use cumbersome language and sentence structures to make a point. Casual readers interested in the topic will not find the text easily accessible. Part of this may be the fault of the translator, as sections of the book do in fact read like literal translations instead of conversational ones. Perhaps a more careful attempt to make the work readable for English speakers would have made the text easier to follow. I should also note that my review copy was an unedited proof, and some of this awkwardness may have been rectified in the final, edited version.Reviewer note: I was given an advance copy of this work for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMWU673MLI1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231167865#wasThisHelpful","R1BMWU673MLI1I","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Force For Good is a nuanced and insightful call-to-action. The Dalai Lama offers a holistic approach to overcoming the many issues we currently face. For me, the most important part of the book is the discussion regarding the ""us versus them"" mentality that has put a stranglehold on modern society. In truth, most people know what needs to be done to achieve greater balance and equity in the world, but we are bogged down by worries of the other side ""winning"" at our expense. His Holiness points out that it is not a matter of winning or losing, of us versus them. It is a matter of putting out into the world what we want to see in return. It is a call to finally move beyond the primitive, tribal mentality that rears its ugly head in times of crisis and prevents us from examining the root causes of problems.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JSS8YHH7G2DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553394894#wasThisHelpful","R3JSS8YHH7G2DF","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Easy Caulk ""Press in Place"" is a quick fix for cosmetic issues in dry locations like cabinets or counters, but not ideal for areas subjected to moisture such as sinks and windows. The caulk is attached to a piece of vinyl so that when you press it into place you have the vinyl surface that looks nice but is not waterproof. If used around a sink or other area that is subject to a lot of potential moisture, you run the risk of mold getting behind the vinyl. Ended up using this in the kitchen in the cabinets and it looks lovely. But I wouldn't use around sinks or places that are likely to get wet often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LJMLWB9Q2SIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RBGZ48#wasThisHelpful","R1LJMLWB9Q2SIH","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These nutritional shakes have a similar taste and texture to SlimFast. Not bad, but nothing to croon over. Taste better when cold, but is drinkable without refrigeration. I've found them useful as a meal replacement at breakfast if I am running behind schedule or if I get hunger pangs mid afternoon and want to avoid unhealthy snaking. With only 70 calories but 12 g of protein, it is surprisingly filling and keeps me from being tempted to indulge in the break room snack machine.The product is soy based, and as such people with soy allergies should avoid. One bottle covers 10%-30% the RDA of most vitamins and minerals, so assuming you eat an otherwise balanced diet the rest of the day this will help you meet your nutritional goals.Sodium content is higher than I would like (300 mg) but it has 0 sugar.

"I've used other variants of Natural Instincts before. This was my first time using the new Crema Keratina formula. Most hair coloring has that weird chemical smell. This particular formula actually had a pleasant scent. I have very long hair (goes all the way down my back) so I often worry if one bottle will provide enough coverage. Had no issues at all with this formula. I only have a few gray hairs, and the color blended in perfectly. Not sure if the coverage would be sufficient if you were trying to cover a lot of gray. But if you just have a little gray showing or if you are just looking for a new color, this hair coloring is wonderful.I wish the conditioner that came with the hair coloring was sold separately. My hair felt so soft after it was dry.Usually when I color my hair, I ruin a t-shirt because I'll get some of the hair color on it. This time was no exception as I ended up with some color on the back and shoulders of the t-shirt I was wearing. Was surprised when I pulled the t-shirt out of the washer and it wasn't stained. Not sure if I just got lucky this time of if it is the new formulation.Only downside is that, like most of these color-at-home kits, the gloves they give you are woefully insufficient. I don't even have long nails, and my fingers pinched through during the coloring. Use your own gloves instead.Otherwise, would definitely use this color again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEBEP0H76NM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP23GN2#wasThisHelpful","R2BEBEP0H76NM9","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE:This is an update to my original review. I am changing my score to reflect recent updates to the app.1. Rebates now rely less on video, making it easier to claim rebates on items,2. Most rebates now can be activated on the site instead of through the app. Some rebates still require app to be used for activation, but the majority can now be activated from the website. This makes it much less cumbersome to select and activate rebates.3. App is more responsive and not as laggy. You still have to take a photo of the entire receipt, which is still a pain when you have a long receipt, but the app seems to process the receipt faster now.The above updates make the app easier to use and less time consuming. I feel much better about this program than I initially did. I'm glad I stuck with it long enough for the app to be updated.PREVIOUS:I downloaded the app directly from their site. The app is cumbersome, buggy, and HIGHLY INVASIVE.To get deals, you go through the app and find the items that you are interested in. The one saving grace is that they have a huge selection of products, including many products that are good for any brand. Unlike similar apps, it actually provides discounts on lots of household staples like milk, eggs, and bread. So that is the one good thing.But, the app is time consuming and requires too much work for too little gain.For example, to earn a 30 cent discount on milk, I had to complete two tasks. Both tasks included watching a 15 second ad on my phone. Many of the tasks can ONLY be performed from your phone and require watching some sort of video. This means you will be draining your battery and, if you aren't using wi-fi, draining your data plan, for 10-15 cent discounts. Not all tasks require a video. Some require a one question survey or answering a trivia question. But most of the bonuses are tied to using your phone to watch ads.Once you purchase a qualified item, you have to complete two additional steps to claim your redemption. The first thing you have to do is scan the barcode. Again, battery drain and possibly data drain. But then you have to take a photo of your receipt, the ENTIRE receipt, and send it to them from your phone. My first time doing this, it look me almost 20 minutes to scan the products and then get a complete photo of the receipt because you have to take multiple images of long receipts to get the entire thing.If the app doesn't recognize a barcode, you have to take a photo of the front of the product and send to them. I had an issue where the app didn't recognize any of the cases of soda I purchased, despite them being Pepsi products and not off-brands. And then when I took the obligatory photo of the front, the app wouldn't connect to actually send the photo. Lost out on that 20 cents, I guess.So I spend 30 minutes on the app completing tasks, and another 20 minutes scanning barcodes and copying my receipt all to earn...wait for it...$2.10!In addition, if you don't manually go in and change the defaults, the app constantly spams you with messages about everything. Every time a new item is added, or it wants to ""remind"" you of something you already completed a task for, or anything. The app sent me six alerts within a span of a few hours before I realized the default was set to SPAM-CRITICAL.You could easily, if you aren't careful, even up spending more on your phone's data plan overages than you would ever possibly earn.A better suggestion for deal seeking shoppers is Savingstar. I linked my grocery store loyalty card to the savingstar account and it automatically deposits my credits to my account without me having to watch videos, answer trivia, or fill out surveys. I've redeemed over $20 from them so far and money is transferred in only a couple of days to your Paypal account. It is a much easier, faster, and less invasive alternative to Ibotta.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QVV6ZN5W137K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GXO2AGY#wasThisHelpful","R3QVV6ZN5W137K","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the interest of disclosure, there is no way I would ever spend $200 of my own money on a keyboard. I didn't even realize how pricey this was when I saw the keyboard available through Vine. But IF I was going to throw down that kind of money on a keyboard, it would be this one. It is a thing of beauty. When it arrived, I thought there was a brick or something in the package because of the weight. I'm accustomed to keyboards that weigh about as much as a stapler. This thing has serious heft to it. The steel casing is streamline and sturdy.I confess to being a little confused at first because the wrapped cord included two USB cables and two audio plugs., which all need to be plugged into your computer.  One USB powers the keyboard, while the other is for the two USB ports on the keyboard itself. This is very convenient for charging devices or if you are using multiple thumb drives (like I often do when I am working on non-gaming projects). The audio plugs allow you to quickly switch between your speakers or a headset directly from the keyboard. Though the design threw me off at first, I quickly appreciated the ease with which I could switch between speakers and a headset.The keyboard also includes a set of extra keys and a tool to easily remove and replace keys. Besides the utility of customizing your keyboard, the tool will make cleaning the keyboard easy. (Admit it...I am NOT the only person who eats at the computer and sometimes gets crumbs on the keyboard!). The key design is highly responsive. There is a noticeable difference in performance.I didn't think I would like the backlighting, as I have sensitive eyes and I was worried the red backlight would be irritating. Instead, I find it a nice touch. You can set the backlight bright or dim or turn it off completely, based on your own preferences. There are also different settings that will only backlight certain gamer-centric sets of keys (like WASD and Function keys).I take back my initial statement. Before actually playing with this keyboard, I would never have thought to spend this much money on a keyboard. But if you consider how often the average hardcore gamer has to replace a keyboard and the exceptional performance of this unit, it is actually a good buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DEWHP8KU9I60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1SKM7U#wasThisHelpful","R3DEWHP8KU9I60","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Note, Vine requires reviewers to review items within 30 days. This is not always enough time to really discover problems with a product. While I used the pruners for some light use before writing the review below, I didn't have a chance to really put them to the test until this weekend.Original review:I started gardening seriously last year and was thrilled to see this available in Vine. This is a well-constructed pruner with an easy to use safety lock and powerful, non-sticking blades. The handle design offers incredible comfort without losing pruning power...if you are right handed. The lower portion of the handle is set on a gear that partially rotates to alleviate stress on the hand. The problem is that the handle's movement is specific to the right hand. When trying to use the pruner in the left hand, the movement is awkward. Most of us lefties are accustomed to having to adapt to right-handed tools. But the unique design of the handle just doesn't work for lefties.Revised review:This weekend, I spent several hours using the pruners. Unfortunately, they do not hold up to sustained, heavy use. I was using these to prune back blueberry bushes that I had just planted and cut back some thin branches (1/4"" diameter) on a flowering tree and bushes in the front yard. By the end of use, the sheers would not close properly to cut without wiggling the handle.Revised decision: pruners are fine for occasional light pruning, but serious gardeners that need a trustworthy pruner for more intensive work may be disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IJBMVES4TP1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QMWA5AA#wasThisHelpful","R1IJBMVES4TP1G","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I went to the store and bought three more (one cherry tomato and two peppers) and put them in containers to start in my windowsill. The original pod later withered, and the three additional ones that I bought never grew.So people don't think it is just me killing plants: at the same time I put these in the windowsill, I also started snap beans and broccoli from seed.

"When this item appeared on Vine, it did not specify it was for a specific camera system only. I was under the impression that it was a generic carry case for electronics.

The case is very sturdy and will hold up to being dropped, stepped on, or falling down a flight of steps (it was an accident. I swear). Interior zippered pouch adds to storage convenience. You can use this to create an ""emergency"" kit of first aid supplies, batteries, and other misc items to keep in your car, for example. Or use it to store cosmetics and other personal items that you don't want to get crushed when traveling. And of course, you CAN use it to store electronics even without the insert. Just wrap them in something with a little cushion and the case will do the rest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15QT25NFDVCJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8K8WHI#wasThisHelpful","R15QT25NFDVCJ0","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Emissary is a poignant and artfully crafted science fiction story that examines what it means to be human and the nature of free will. Author Chris Rogers paints a vibrant tale of loss, hope, struggle, and finding redemption where you least expect it.Ruell is an emissary, trained to merge his consciousness with a human host in the hopes of convincing humanity to offer his people sanctuary after their own planet was destroyed. He first merges with the president of the United States. But when that situation takes a turn for the worst he finds himself merged with an alcoholic cop named Kirk Longshadow. This is where the plot really takes off as the developing relationship between Ruell and Kirk is the best part of the story.Reviewer Note: I was given a comp copy of this book for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L3CFQ6V8TBT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLMSTS4#wasThisHelpful","R1L3CFQ6V8TBT1","A2QSBOAAGW1I1H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QSBOAAGW1I1H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For phones, I prefer Android to iPhone, but until the S2, the iPad Air 2 was the best tablet I could find. But now I've replaced my iPad with this tablet and I'm totally happy that I did.Compared to the iPad Air 2, the Samsung is a hair smaller and thinner and lighter, but the screen looks to be the same size and resolution. Performance seems equally good. Although the base memory is limited to 32GB, you can add an SD card to get more memory.Battery life seems a little shorter than the iPad Air 2, but there are a few settings you can change that will improve it; you can enable power saving mode (it dims the screen a little and slows the processor down a bit), you can make Wi-Fi turn off when the tablet is sleeping, and you can also use the built in Smart Manager app to ""optimize"" apps that you don't use often so that they don't run at all  in the background until you need them again.There are a bunch of built-in Samsung apps that I didn't want but couldn't uninstall, although you can disable some of them. None of them seem to really be useful except for the aforementioned Smart Manager app.Samsung's TouchWiz skin on top of Android is not as ugly or clunky as on earlier products, but by default the first page on your home screen is the Flipboard ""briefing"" news page, which luckily you can turn off. Of course you can also replace TouchWiz launcher entirely if you want to; I installed Google Now Launcher because it puts all the contextual cards from Google Now on the first home screen page where you can get to them with just a swipte.Sound quality is good, the fingerprint reader works well, the screen is sharp and bright, and it runs every app I've tried just fine. It'll even let you run two apps side by side, similar to what you can do on newer iPads - but also similar to iPads, that feature only works with certain apps.Overall I'm very satisfied.P. S. If you do add an SD card, just plugging it in isn't enough; you then need to do two things make the system use it: First, for any apps that use a lot of storage - mainly ones that do a lot with photos, music, or video - open the app, go into its settings, and if there's a choice to use SD, make sure it's on. Second, go into system settings for apps and make sure that you've moved as many apps as possible to SD (this is only available for some apps and only lasts until the next time the app is updated).Also P. S. I ran into several apps which insist on running in portrait orientation instead of being able to handle both portrait and landscape. Luckily there's an app called Rotation Manager by Meerkat which will let you force any particular app to work in either or both orientations (there are actually several similar apps, but this was the only one I found that was both easy to use and which worked).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9LPUBRV661O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0134RE54W#wasThisHelpful","R3S9LPUBRV661O","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used this with my Android tablet. I loved the full-width keyboard and the fact that it's substantial and sturdy. It's ideal for use in a lap or on a desk (it's heavy enough that it won't tip, but not uncomfortably so), but I think it's too bulky and heavy for something you would want to travel with. The only other downside I found, and it's minor, is that if you use it with a thinner-than-average device, the angle may tilt back further than optimal.I only used it with one device so I didn't' test the rotating selector switch although I think it's a nice simple and obvious way to switch. But there's also a pair of buttons on the other side of the keyboard that lets you select the device type; the problem is that if you accidentally tap the wrong button after setting up your device (which did happen a few times - they're near the backspace/delete keys), you might find that some keys act differently. The fix is easy however - just tap the other button.P.S. It came with batteries (two AAA) but they were dead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AIILM2KE6N5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUTWLW4#wasThisHelpful","R1AIILM2KE6N5R","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never tried this type of case before, so maybe some of the things I didn't like about it are just ""the way it is"". First of all, the case itself is a bit heavy, I think because it's got magnets or metal in it so that the keyboard (which just sits on it when it's open) can ""stick"" to it. The next problem is that if you set up the keyboard and case for typing, you have to lift the keyboard off the case, move it, and set it back down before you close the case, so it's not a one-step process to close or open the case. Finally, the last thing I didn't like is that the keyboard layout puts the ""Open Browser"" button exactly where I expected to find the delete key. After opening the browser about 7 times instead of deleting, I had had enough. To be fair, on the plus side, the material looked and felt good inside and out, so if you don't mind the above issues you'll probably be happy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13A6FXM5AQP59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013XXM7LU#wasThisHelpful","R13A6FXM5AQP59","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This battery includes a built-in Motorola Keylink accessory, which is also available as a standalone smaller gadget. I purchased a Keylink a few months ago and it was a big disappointment. Its key- and phone-finding abilities only work over a short range (claimed to be 100 feet but actually less), it frequently disconnected from my phone even when they were close together, and the coin battery only lasted about a month instead of the year advertised.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LWFJECCC7D1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STVJGLQ#wasThisHelpful","R1LWFJECCC7D1F","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even when it's working perfectly, the Keylink really can only do two useful things in a limited way. First, if your phone and keys are within range of eachother, you can make the Keylink beep. Second (also if they're in range), you can skip needing to use a PIN to unlock your phone. According to Motorola the range is 100 feet, but I found it to be a lot less when indoors through walls and floors etc.There's a third thing you can do too, which is to use the Keylink to make your phone ring if you've misplaced it - but you don't need a Keylink to do that; just call your phone or use the Android Device Manager app/site to find it on a map - and that will work even if your phone is miles away.I already knew that the locating features were very limited, but I didn't mind since I really only was looking for the convenience of not needing to enter a PIN whenever I wanted to unlock my phone. At first that worked well with my Droid Turbo phone, but after a month, the feature became unreliable and I found I was often entering my unlock PIN, even though I had the Keylink in my pocket less than two feet away. If after PIN unlocking my phone I opened the Moto Connect app, the Keylink would show as disconnected, but then it would reconnect within a few seconds.Aside from the unreliable connection, another letdown was that I experienced nothing like the  one year advertised battery life. After a month of use, the battery level reported by the Moto Connect app was 8% - despite the fact that I kept the Keylink's ""find my phone"" setting turned off because that's supposed to save power. Maybe the connection started to degrade once the battery got too low, but if that's true, then I would have expected the Moto Connect app to warn me about the battery level, which it's supposed to do but didn't.I purchased from Motorola's website; all of these problems started just a few days after the 30 day return period, so I had to do a warranty replacement instead. Dealing with Motorola support to request a replacement was tedious. It took two email exchanges (containing some incorrect/vague info) and two phone calls (both involving being on hold and being transferred) over 4 days - and as far as I can tell this is their normal process!When I got the replacement unit, the first thing I did was discard the pre-installed generic battery and install a new name-brand one - to see if battery life will improve. I'll update this review when there's new info to report.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPNN0M14DT1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QY45GC8#wasThisHelpful","R1MPNN0M14DT1P","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We got this thermostat as part of an all-new furnace and AC install - all I had asked the installer company for was a ""wireless thermostat"". I'm glad and lucky I got this one!My favorite part is the optional assistant for programming the schedule; it asks a few easy questions (like ""Is someone home all day"", ""When does the last person go to bed"", etc.) and sets up your schedule that way - but you can also do it the old-fashioned way which isn't that much more difficult.The screen is large and clear and touch-sensitive all over. Information is easy to see and navigation is simple. Even though there are a lot more options, it's a lot easier to use than my old programmable thermostat. Clearly a lot of consideration and thought went into the design of this product.For convenience you can temporarily snap it off of its wall mount and use it in your lap, or at your desk, etc.Other things I like are the option for ""circulate"" on the fan, which will not only run it when heating/cooling, but also just at random times to keep the air from getting stale. And I also really like the compatibility with optional wireless REDLink accessories - I've added the Internet gateway so I can control the thermostat from anywhere from my smartphone, and I've also added an indoor remote temperature sensor (which I've put upstairs - the thermostat averages the temp from both locations to determine the ""current"" temp).P.S. Some advanced users will want to mess with the installer options - if you do, you'll need the password - it's a 4 digit number and the default password is printed on the model number sticker inside the battery compartment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJ31GP0HQNBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLNNR6I#wasThisHelpful","R1OJ31GP0HQNBQ","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's small and unobtrusive, about the size of a travel computer mouse. It uses 2 AAA batteries that are included. Connecting it to the thermostat was easy, there's a connect button inside the battery compartment (no other controls other than a LED light that I've never seen turn on). It seems like once it's connected, the thermostat uses the average of the temp at the sensor and the temp at the thermostat to figure out the ""current"" temp.P. S. Some reviews have said that this will ""even out"" heating/cooling in your home, but it doesn't work that way; if your HVAC system has problems getting heat or cold to some parts of your home, that will not change. By adding this gadget all you are doing is making your thermostat get a more accurate - but still AVERAGE - reading of your home's temperature. So for instance if you install this someplace that's always too cool in winter, that area will get warmer in winter, but so will every other part of your house; similarly if you put it someplace that's always too hot in summer, that area will get cooler in summer, but so will the rest of your house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O8ULLRMYXYF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Y0VTB0#wasThisHelpful","R3O8ULLRMYXYF0","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's amazing what you get for $50, but I still wouldn’t recommend this as anyone’s only tablet - mainly because of the screen’s low resolution, the so-so battery life, the lack of voice input (except inside apps that offer it), and the mediocre cameras.Another downside is that the Amazon app store feels like a time warp compared to Android's Google Play store: Amazon has fewer apps and games, and sometimes only older versions (but on the plus side, more of them are free).Still, there are unexpected benefits considering the price, including decently snappy performance, bluetooth, SD card slot, and parental controls. Although it looks simple and chunky, it doesn't look cheap and it feels sturdy and well put together.The operating system and user interface is based on Android, so another benefit is that it's simple to use, and if you have used Android on other devices it'll feel familiar.The main differences compared to Android are 1) there are no official Google apps - but there are mostly decent substitutes preinstalled and available in Amazon's app store, and 2) once you flip past the first home screen with the usual grid of app icons and folders (but no widgets or shortcuts), the remaining screens are storefronts for Amazon products and services (such as music, books, etc.).Overall this is a great tablet for what it costs, but it shouldn’t be your only tablet unless you're on a severe budget. However for the kids, or for grandma, or as something cheap to travel with, you can't really go wrong.P.S. I bought one mainly out of curiosity and ended up returning it. I was thinking it could be handy for travel compared to my more valuable and bulky iPad, but I decided that a basic unlocked Android phone is even better as a travel device: it's smaller, has a better selection of apps, and it can work as an affordable phone if you put a local SIM card in it. Yes it costs more than $50, but it's still cheaper than an iPad and many tablets (for instance as of late 2015 the basic Moto E is under $100 and the nicer Moto G is about $150).","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RE5E3575QCXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TSUGXKE#wasThisHelpful","R3RE5E3575QCXB","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There's no explanation of how this button works together with the dial, so I ignored the button and just used the dial since it works as I expect - plus the ""comfortemp"" button turns on a bright green light that I don't want at night in the bedroom.P.S. To people who are confused about this being an oil heater - this heater is electric and has to be plugged in. The oil is not burned - it's just there to help spread the heat around evenly inside the heater, and it increases the amount of heat given off while the heater isn't actively running. The oil is sealed inside; you can't see it or smell it and there is no way to get at it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWJIZWBDWAKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TGDGLU#wasThisHelpful","R2GWJIZWBDWAKM","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for the rare occasions when I'm in a hotel that has ethernet but no WiFi (or bad WiFi). I haven't tried it in that situation yet, but it was cheap enough and small enough that I figured it was worth grabbing one and keeping it in my travel bag.I did successfully hook it up to my home router via ethernet just to make sure it worked, and yes I got it to create a WiFi network that my iPad could connect to and get online.The instructions are a bit vague, and the device's setup web page - although attractive and simple looking - is also a bit unclear about some settings - but it wasn't that hard to figure it out eventually.To get it to work as a basic wireless access point i.e. plug it into ethernet and use its WiFi (which is what most people will use it for), you have to move the switch on the side to the ""wired"" position (it shipped with it in the other position).I haven't tried the mobile app or the USB storage options and I probably won't.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2T6X0SEYC6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZWOQZ6#wasThisHelpful","R1U2T6X0SEYC6J","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Regarding other reviews for this item, I find it very suspicious that most of the people who got it for free liked it, but most of the people who paid their own money think it's junk. Draw your own conclusions about what that really means. ;-)Anyway... I bought this (despite the sketchy reviews) because I needed a big, realistic looking model of a plane for a stage production, and I didn't want to pay an outrageous amount of money (seriously, a good quality real model this size will cost something like $200 if you can even find it).Pros: it's big and it looks realistic (except for the lump under the wings with the motor and wheels).Cons are pretty much everything else:- The electronics were dead. I tried two different sets of batteries but couldn't get any lights, sounds, or motor operation.- Fit and finish is poor. Parts don't line up perfectly, some surfaces look grungy or scuffed.- One wing is more curved/bent than the other.- The motor under the wings is mounted slightly off center so the whole thing sits slightly tilted to one side (and the bent wing doesn't help).- Each wing has a big sticker on it that says ""AIRPLANE"", which looks very dumb (the other stickers look OK).- The stand is thin plastic (not metal as some other reviewers have stated), and it's kind of teetery.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M13W233AWT52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SLXGZ5M#wasThisHelpful","R3M13W233AWT52","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These put out a very warm light, so they're most suitable for ""relaxing"" type areas like bedrooms or living rooms, but less so for kitchens, bath, etc.Unlike previous dimmable LED bulbs I've used, the light color also gets warmer as you dim them more, the way an old-school incandescent bulb does. The previous LED bulbs I used just got less bright but kept their cool color, which looked weird although it made sense.But unlike incandescent bulbs they don't dim down as far; at a certain point where I wish they would get a bit dimmer, they just turn off. But it's a low enough level of light that I'm OK with it.Another minor issue is that I have two of them in one fixture, and when I dim them all the way down, one will shut off before the other. I think this is pretty common with LEDs since I had the same thing happen with the previous LED bulbs I was using in the same lamp.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38FAS938SYEHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ904Q2#wasThisHelpful","R38FAS938SYEHL","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a small hernia that only bothered me sometimes. I was going to be waiting a month until I could get surgery, so I got this to tide me over.At least for me, I found that whether I was happier with or without it on was unpredictable and depended on whether I was active or not, whether I was doing a lot of standing and moving or lying around and relaxing, etc.I still would recommend it since it did help me sometimes, and when it did cause discomfort, it was easy to remove.It's got a pocket with a removable rounded dense foam insert that presses on the hernia bulge area. For my small hernia I was happier without the insert.P.S. I wear 32 or 33 waist pants, so I ordered the medium size, but it's almost too small. If your waist is closer to 34 or 35 you would be better off with a large.Also P.S. If you are planning to use the belt before and after surgery, there is another sizing consideration: It's not uncommon to experience abdominal swelling after hernia surgery that can add an inch or two to your waist, and which can take months to fully resolve. That happened to me - nearly a month later and I'm still swollen although it's getting better slowly.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18E2N7STFNZCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNNJNQ8#wasThisHelpful","R18E2N7STFNZCG","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: After 3 months I decided this wasn't the right tracker for me and I replaced it with the smaller and simpler Fitbit Zip. Here are the reasons I switched:- It needed to be recharged every 3 or 4 days, using a proprietary cable that I always worried I would lose (the Zip's battery lasts 6 months).- The clasp to close the strap was always a hassle - difficult to close, and it occasionally unexpectedly opened (the Zip just clips on).- I didn't end up using any of the extra features like caller ID or sleep tracking or silent alarms anyway (the Zip doesn't have those - that's probably why its battery can last for months).- I just wasn't crazy about how it looked on my wrist (the Zip is more unobtrusive).---------------------Here's my original review:I got this as a Christmas present in 2014. I started with the small size and exchanged for the large after a week. Here are my impressions after about 3 weeks:Pro tips:- If your wrist size is exactly in between needing a small vs a large (as indicated by the size guide on the box), go with the large; otherwise the fit will be very snug and it'll be difficult to close the strap.- Make sure you set your ""dominant wrist"" in app settings, otherwise your step count will be less accurate.- Similarly, it's a good idea to measure your stride length and update that too (on the fitbit website), because until I did that it underestimated my walking mileage by about 10%.Pros:- It's light and has a comfortable fit; I usually don't even notice I'm wearing it.- The display is bright and easy to read.- The app is attractive and easy to use, and even if you have your fitbit synced to your phone, you can still install the app on a 2nd device (iPad for instance) and manage your fitbit from there too.- The sleep tracking is cool and it starts and stops automatically (although it's not perfect, see below).- The stair-climbing detection seems to work most of the time, and it's eye-opening to see how many times I'm actually going up and down the stairs at home (more than I thought).- Battery life is good and as advertised; I wear it all the time and have to charge roughly every 5 days.Cons (experienced with both units):- The clasp is difficult to close (unless you want a very loose fit) and comes too easily undone (today I thought I'd lost the fitbit but found it in the sleeve of my jacket).- The double-tapping gesture is unreliable, but it seems to have the best chance of working if I double-tap above the display window.- Caller ID is slow.- If you lie in bed a while before you fall asleep, it can still count that as ""sleeping"". Similarly, if you don't get out of bed right after waking up, it can count that as ""restless"" sleeping.- After a workout there's sweat inside the charging connector which is a small recessed hole with corners that are hard to reach to wipe it out - I'm wondering if long term that's a spot where crud will build up.- The latest updates to the android app have lost a few minor useful features like adding foods to your favorites (or if the feature is there, I can't find it).- Fitbit support is friendly and responsive, but fairly clueless. I asked for help with the Android app and they responded as if I had asked about the website, then when I clarified they referred to features that were only in an older version of the app.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXXT134EFF39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2BVTJU#wasThisHelpful","R1GXXT134EFF39","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the third - and so far best - indoor antenna I've tried. Before this one I had tried two other similar flat & amplified (but not flexible) antennas - a Terk FDTV1A and an RCA ANT1650R (the Terk was a little better).My house is on a hill about 50 miles from most of the local transmitters, and the TV is on the 2nd floor. All three antennas pulled in the same number of stations (roughly 20), but the Mohu is the only one that's able to usually (but not always) get every channel with no glitches - with the others, there were always 2 or 3 channels that almost always had glitches, if they would come in at all.The Mohu came with a longer cable than the other antennas, and I think that helped a lot with the reception; it allowed me to locate the antenna higher up on the wall - but even so, I did need to reposition it several times before I found a satisfactory location.Besides the longer cable, the Mohu's got several other benefits compared to the other antennas I tried:- The amplifier is USB powered, so if your TV has a USB port in the back (mine does) you don't need to use up an extra outlet for yet another USB power adapter (but one is included if you need it).- The antenna is very flat (no thicker than maybe 3-4 sheets of paper), so you could stick it to a wall. They include sticky velcro mounts and pushpins; I tried sticking it with carpet tape but it didn't hold.- It's white on one side and black on the other, so if you mount it white side out it's not that much of an eyesore (I'm not sure why they didn't just make it all white - how many people have a black wall?)------6 MONTH UPDATE: There were always a couple of channels that never came in clearly, especially during bad weather. So I finally bit the bullet and installed a GE attic antenna. Even though it's only about 3 feet higher up, it's about 4 times larger in ""intercept"" area, and the fringe stations are now rock solid. Moral of the story: unless you're already getting perfect reception, a higher/bigger antenna will always be better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRV411PK2FHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APPDX86#wasThisHelpful","RWRV411PK2FHY","A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This pattern/flush trim bit has a lot going for it.  To start with, it has a 1/2"" shank and the cutting diameter is 3/4"", which is much more useful for pattern work than the typical flush trim bit with a 1/4"" shank.  The cutting length is 1 31/32"" and it has bearings on both the top and bottom.  This is great because sometimes it's you can have the pattern on either the top or bottom, depending on the design and fixture you're using.Yes, it's expensive, but the carbide cutting knives are replaceable.  Strangely, the replacement cutting inserts (P/N 790.500.00) are not available in Amazon, but you can get them, along with bearings (P/N 791.007.00 and 791.011.00) and other replacement parts, from Router Bit World.Each carbide insert has 2 cutting edges and they cost less than $4.00 each.  So, first of all, you get the equivalent of 2 first class pattern bits with the initial purchase and then you can renew the edges for about $4.00 a pop.  If you do a lot of pattern work, this bit will quickly pay for itself.I'm using this bit with a PORTER-CABLE 75182 Variable Speed Router Motor in a router table with an INCRA Mast-R-Lift-II Router Lift.  The bit is smooth and stable.  I've used it for about 8 hours, cutting hundreds of 3/4"" thick pieces to a pattern.  The cut surface is extremely smooth; completely free of chatter.  The inserts are still new, but I've had zero trouble cutting with or against the grain.  No chip out climbing out of a dip against the grain.  This may change as the inserts dull, but so far so good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I3X16VEIHDEG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9A3ZJ4#wasThisHelpful","R3I3X16VEIHDEG","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Porter-Cable 7518 for use in a custom router table that I had built, equipped with an INCRA Mast-R-Lift-II Router Liftand an iGaging DigiMAG 6"" Magnetic Remote Digital Readout.  I wanted a powerful, precise motor capable of driving both large diameter panel raising bits and very small precision bits.The first thing I did after I unpacked the 7518 was to set it up to measure the Total Indicated Runout (TIR) of both the spindle and the collets.  I was surprised to find a runout of 0.0015"" on the spindle, which IMO, is not acceptable.  I was even more shocked when I measured the runout of bit shanks held by the collets.  Bits held in the 1/2"" collet had TIR ranging from 0.006"" to 0.012"".  Bits held in the 1/4"" collet had TIR ranging from 0.002"" to 0.005"".  Again, this is not acceptable IMO.  The problem with excessive runout is that at the speeds these motors turn, it produces vibrations that can make the router difficult to control, noisy and cause the bearings to fail prematurely.  It can also cause bit breakage if the TIR is 10% or more of the bit diameter.I consulted with someone in the industry who has a great deal of experience with PC (and other) motors and collets.  He had never seen a 7518 with a TIR as high as I had measured.  So, I guess it was either an anomaly or my measurement was off.  He did agree that the TIR I had measured for the PC collets was typical of what he has seen.  I decided to return the 7518 for a replacement.The replacement arrived a few days later. Thank you Amazon for shipping the replacement before receiving my return.  This time, my measurement of the spindle TIR was less than 0.0005"", so I figured the first one was just a bad apple.  The 1/2"" collet that came with the router was no better than the first one, with TIR's measuring up to 0.012"".There is another problem with the PC collets.  I had a great deal of difficulty getting bits in and out of the 3 examples I received (two 1/2"" and one 1/4"", which I ordered separately).  The final straw came with the last bit I tested on the second 7518 I received.  It was a brand new, 1/2"" shank Whiteside bit, with the protective coating still in place, covering the cutting edges.  I struggled to get it into the collet and when I tried to remove it, I had to use so much force that the protective coating came off the bit and my thumb slid along the cutting edge, cutting it very deeply.  After dealing with the medical emergency, I looked closely at the interior bore of the collet with a loupe.  I was surprised to see a significant number of burrs attached to the slots in the bore.  I went to work on the collet with needle files and some 1000 grit wet/dry paper and eventually got it to the point where I could get bits in and out without too much trouble.I was so disappointed with the PC collets that I replaced them with after market collets made by precisebits.com.  I won't go into detail here, but these collets have about one tenth the TIR of the PC collets and are truly precision parts.  Check them out if, like me, you find the PC collets lacking.My experience so far with the 7518 motor couldn't be more different than my experience with the PC collets.  It has the power to do anything I've asked of it.  With the new collets, it runs very smoothly.  When I run large diameter bits, it's also noticeably quieter than with the PC collets, although it's still a pretty noisy machine.  Hearing protection required.Since I immediately installed the 7518 in the router table I haven't used the base that comes with it, so I can't comment on it.I was in a quandary about the number of stars to award the 7518.  I decided not to penalize it for the lousy collets, since I'm not going to use them.  I do like the motor and decided to give a split rating in the title.  I only have a couple of weeks experience with the 7518, but I will update the review in a year or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J1PMBTXME7B4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000222V3#wasThisHelpful","R1J1PMBTXME7B4","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the Bradshaw International 19880 3 piece measuring cup set to use in my hobbies, and gardening.  It's a set that I use when mixing paint, mortar, fertilizers and so on.  There marks are easy-to-read and are in both OZ and ML.  Unfortunately, those easy-to-read markings are not terribly accurate.  I checked the 1  QT/1 L cup by filling it to the top line and weighing the contents.  The amount of water poured to the 1 Liter line was 2.4% higher than it should have been.  The results on the 1 quart line were worse: 7.8% high.Another negative for these cups is the way the handle is molded into the body, there is a dip in the edge of the body that follows the contour of the handle.  That means that you can't fill the cups anywhere near to the top without liquid spilling out along the top of the handle.  Take the example of the 1 Liter cup.  When you fill it to the 1 Liter line, the lip of the cup is about 1 1/16"" (27mm) above the liquid.  However, the outlet at the top of the handle is only 3/16"" (4.8mm) above the liquid.  This means you have to be very careful moving the cup or the liquid will run out over the top of the handle.I would not choose these cups to use in my kitchen because of the inaccurate measurements. I also prefer to use glass measuring cups in the kitchen because I trust that glass is less likely to add unwanted substances to my food.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QIEOUC33UQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004281PDC#wasThisHelpful","R21QIEOUC33UQR","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The MSI-PRO 225-D 51120 toggle clamps, are sturdy and well made.  There are no sharp edges and the action is smooth.  The rubber foot has an adjustment range perpendicular to the clamp of about 1 1/8"".  The slot in the clamp allows an adjustment of about 1 1/8"" parallel to the clamp.  The base has holes for four 1/4"" attachment bolts.  I drilled mine out to fit the 5/16"" bolts I had on hand and didn't run into any problems.  The clamps will exert a lot of force which can be increased or decreased by raising and lowering the rubber foot.I'm using a pair of the MSI-PRO  clamps to attach a sacrificial fence to the Biesemeyer fence on my Delta Unisaw.  I recently added a router table to this saw, so I'm using the fence for the router as well, and router fences often need to be milled or split, something that's not recommended for the Biesemeyer.If I needed a tall or sacrificial fence in the past, I would attach it to the Biesemeyer with some bar clamps.  This works, but it's slow to set up and the clamps are often in the way.I made a fence with a piece of MDF and made some 3 3/4"" x 1 1/2"" x 3"" blocks to attach the toggle clamps to the MDF with bolts (the bolt holes in the MDF are counterbored for the bolt heads).  It's pretty slick: I can attach the auxiliary fence in a few seconds and remove it just as quickly.Bottom line: the MSI-PRO toggle clamps are well made and useful around the shop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IO0DOFXQIA8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000224BJ#wasThisHelpful","R1IO0DOFXQIA8Z","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I exaggerate only slightly.  I recently converted my carport to a garage with an overhead door.  There were a couple of issues with this.  First, the carport slab had no little step down at the overhead door line, as most slabs poured for a garage would have.  Second, the slab had a slope built into it from side to side, so it was 1 1/2"" higher on the left side of the door than on the right.I talked to the manufacturer of the door about the slope issue.  They said that the door had to be installed level, not parallel to the slab. To fill the gap on the right side of the door, they advised me to stuff the right end of the U shaped gasket on the bottom of the door something like a slice of a pool noodle to compensate for the slope.  I did my best to a cut a tapered wedge out of the noodle about 6 feet long and pushed it into the gasket.  It did look pretty good.  I could see just a sliver of light under the far right end of the door, but other than that, it seemed to fill the gap.The next day, we had 2"" of rain and water flowed under the door along almost the entire length and there was a torrent on the right side, between the door and wall.  I looked outside to see what was going on and saw that the rain pouring off the roof and falling in front of the door was ponding almost an inch deep along the whole length of the door.  Part of the trouble was the slab itself.  Because it was not exactly as smooth as glass, the seal really couldn't do its job.  I live in South Florida and torrential rainfall is a common occurrence in the summer months.  I had visions of my newly created garage workshop flooding several times a week.In a panic, I did a search and found the Storm Shield Garage Door Threshold.  It looked like it might help, so I ordered it immediately.  My door is 12' - 2"" wide and the 16' threshold I ordered measured just over 17'.  I cut it to length and installed it according to the instructions.  The 2 tubes of liquid nails that came with it were just enough to make the beads described in the instructions.  If you have a 16' door, I recommend that you pick up an extra tube of liquid nails, just to be sure you don't run out.  In addition to the liquid nails, I ran a bead of silicone caulk along the edge of the threshold to seal it.  I also cut up some pieces of leftover threshold and made a dam at each end of the threshold, blocking the space between the threshold and the wall, and caulking the spaces as needed.Since I installed it, there have been a number of downpours, but not a drop has entered the garage.  I am so happy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D525CDAFE420/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008WFT7#wasThisHelpful","R1D525CDAFE420","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our delightful kitty 'Skittles' will not be contained by ordinary window screens.  She's shredded 4 of them that blocked her favorite escape routes.  In about a minute, she can make a cat-sized hole and she's outta here.  It's been a nightmare here in South Florida.  We can't open our windows on hot nights because every flying and crawling critter comes right in through the giant holes in the screens.In desperation, I bought the NY Wire Pet D-Fence Screening to see if it would help.  Installation was pretty easy, but you really do need a screen roller tool.  I got mine from a big box store, but you can also get them on Amazon: New York Wire 90611 2-Wheel Wood Handle Screen Tool.  For the first 2 screens I reused the old retainer spline, but that was very tough because the Pet D-Fence Screening is thicker than normal screen material and it required a LOT of force to push it in place.  For the second 2 screens, I bought a length of 1/8"" (0.125"") screen spline from a big box store  (you can also get it on Amazon: New York Wire 1/8-in x 300-in Black Screen Spline- 98015 ).  This made the installation process a lot easier.To do the installation, first pull out the old spline and remove the old, shredded screen.  Set the empty frame on a surface large enough to support the whole frame.  Next, unroll the Pet D-Fence screen, lay it on the aluminum frame and trim it to overhang 1"" - 2"" on all 4 sides.Place the spline on top of the screen, over the groove in the frame and begin pushing the spline into the groove at one corner.  It will help the installation and the final appearance if you carefully line up the strands of screen wire (not the cut edge of the screen) parallel to the groove.  Work your way around the frame, lightly pulling the screen taut with one hand while pushing the spline into the groove with the tool in the other hand.  Make sure the hand you are using to pull the screen is in the same line as the tool and do not pull hard.  You only need a light touch to keep the screening straight.  Depending on the design of the frame, you may be able to go completely around the frame with a single piece of spline, meeting up at the original corner.  Once the spline is installed, carefully trim the excess screen with a sharp box cutter.If any leg of the aluminum frame is bent and kinked, just throw the whole thing away.  For $10 you can get a frame kit at one of the big box stores or Amazon and make a completely new screen.  I had to do this with 2 of my screens and it was no problem.I installed the Pet D-Fence screening about a month ago.  Little Skittles has made a couple of runs at it, but so far, it's completely unscathed.  I have a good feeling about this.  The Pet D-Fence screening is slightly more opaque than regular screening, but that means nothing to me because regular screening won't survive one night.  So far, I'm very happy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZCW0N936OAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CSGFAY#wasThisHelpful","RGZCW0N936OAL","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I will qualify this review by saying that I've only had the Freud SD508 Dado stack for a few weeks.  In that time, I've used it to make dado cuts in Baltic birch plywood, HD 'sand ply' plywood, hard maple, yellow birch, poplar, MDF and MDF with laminate.  In all of these materials, I was impressed with the flatness of the bottom of the dado and the clean edges at the top of the cut.  The outside blades do leave a light scoring mark in the bottom of the cut, but that's about it to my eye.I made some dados that were wider than the maximum stack, requiring multiple passes to get the width.  Even with these dados, the only visible-to-the-naked-eye marks were the light scoring of the outside blades.I am very happy that this set includes a 3/32"" chipper.  Cutting dados to fit 'standard' plywood thicknesses is much easier.  I also like having perfectly sized steel spacers in increments of 0.004"".  Much better than using paper or plastic shims.  The first thing I did was to mark the thickness on each shim and chipper with a sharpie. I can be a bit dyslexic at times, so I also marked the 2 outside blades with an L and R.  Makes it much quicker to set up a stack.I was particularly impressed when I cut a 1 1/4"" wide X 1/2"" deep dado for an INCRA Miter Channel - 32"" in a 27"" x 36"" router table top.  I made the top from a double thickness of 3/4"" MDF edged with 3/4"" poplar and with 1/16"" laminate glued to it.  I checked the surface flatness of the  laminate with a straightedge and feeler gauges before I made the cut and it was flat within 0.010"".  The cut with the Freud dado stack produced no chipping of the laminate at all; the edges were sharp and clean.  I want to qualify that a bit because I did take some precautions with these cuts.  I used a zero clearance insert on my table saw, and cut the exact slot width with the cutters I was using.  I also used a sacrificial board clamped against the exit side of the dado to prevent any blow out of the poplar or laminate.  And of course the dado stack was quite sharp, being relatively new.  I also took the precaution of running the first 3/4"" wide cut down the center of the slot, checking the edges, and then enlarging the slot in both directions.  After that first cut, I ran a piece of blue tape across the corner of the exit end, for extra insurance.  It all worked and the bottom of the dado was very smooth, with 2 light score marks.  From end to end, the width of the slot varied by 0.004"".Other reviewers have dinged this set because of the low quality of the box it comes in.  I agree that it is poor quality, particularly the red, blow molded insert, which arrived cracked and a bit shredded, but still useable.  Personally, I would prefer to have Freud put their money into the dado stack, not the box.  These things are expensive enough; I don't really want to pay even more for a better box.  If it really bothers me in the future, I might make my own *really beautiful* box, but I probably won't.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCI7YKNB4N0JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004RK0P#wasThisHelpful","RCI7YKNB4N0JB","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't expecting too much from the Hyundai HPA-TIG tire inflator, given it's relatively low cost.  When it arrived, I was impressed with the fit, finish and heft of it.  It just feels well built and solid in my hand.I used it to inflate the tires in my Savana van, which calls for 80 PSI in the rear and 50 PSI in the front.  The attachment clip did an excellent job of holding on to the tire valve while I was inflating the tires, so it's an easy one-handed operation.  The action of the trigger and valve was smooth and positive.Other reviewers have complained about the 0 - 180 PSI range of the included gauge, but I didn't find it to be a deal killer.  I checked the 8 - 10  pressures I read against my digital gauge and found that the HPA-TIG gauge read consistently 2 - 3 PSI low.  I don't really know if my digital gauge is any more accurate than the HPA-TIG's  analog gauge, but at least there was a consistent difference between them.  I suppose that I could replace the gauge with a better one, but I doubt I will, unless it breaks at some point in the future.This is only day 1 with this inflator and I have no way to know how it will stand up over time, but right out of the package, I'm very happy with it.  I gave it 5 stars not because I think it's the best tire inflator out there, but because it's great value for the money spent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TFBGMRU3X2WB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009409K0I#wasThisHelpful","R3TFBGMRU3X2WB","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to have a box fan in my bedroom window when the weather is right for it.  Set on low speed, the white noise of the fan masks distracting sounds and the air movement is helpful for sleeping.  When my ancient box fan developed an alloying ticking sound on low speed, I knew it had to go.I got the Lasko 3720 because of the good reviews, low sound rating and weather resistant construction.  I've had it for a week now, and I like it quite a lot.  The one thing that bothered me at first was that, when set to low, the fan turns faster than my old box fan.  I think this may be due to the size and shape of the fan blades.  The blades on my old fan were larger and rounder, so I imagine it could move more air at a lower speed.  The higher speed of the Lasko means that the woosh of air movement is a bit louder than I would like.  I'm getting used to it, and have no intention of looking for a fan with a slower turning low speed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RT3VBTVQWG1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BOCD1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1RT3VBTVQWG1R","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE 05/15/2014:  The jury has returned and the verdict is: I hate this hose.  I gave it 3 stars in my original review and now I'm reducing it to 1 star.  The 2 1/2"" adapters I mentioned in my initial review only barely fit.  It takes way too much force to insert them and with almost no effort, they pop right off.  The snap-out/snap-in nature of the hose it just annoying.  It just won't go where I want it and stay put.  When the hose coils snap shut, a flap of clear plastic protrudes into the ID, making it impossible to insert a fitting and inhibiting air flow.  I was so put out that I bought a 15' length of 'normal' 2 1/2"" clear flex hose and I an much happier with it.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I ordered this hose to use with my shop dust collection system, thinking I would be receiving the item shown in the Amazon photo: a clear, flexible plastic hose about 10' long.  What I got was something very different.The hose that Peachtree is now selling is what I would call a 'snap open', 'snap closed' hose.  It it's collapsed state it is about 32"" long.  When you pull on it, the coils snap open, one by one.  You can open as many as you want, at any place along the length of the hose.  Fully extended, my hose measured just over 11 feet long.The ID of the hose is difficult to measure.  When collapsed, I measured approximately 2.4"".  I was not able to  get the hose ID over the OD of my 2 1/2"" X 4"" adapters, which measure 2.535"".  I was able to use a Woodstock W2046 2-1/2-Inch Hose Adapter for W2049 Cyclone Separator from Amazon that measures 2.480"" OD on one end and 2.244"" on the other.  The large end of this adapter can be pushed into the ID of the hose and the small end will fit in a typical 2 1/4"" shop vac port or in the ID of a 2 1/2"" x 4"" adapters.  If you buy this hose, I suggest you get 2 of these adapters, one for each end.I gave the hose only 3 stars because it isn't the product depicted in the photos and it's a bit difficult to use.  I do like the fact that it is sort of self-storing.  If the hose were fully 10' long all the time, in some situations I would either have to cut it or deal with the excess hose.  With the 'snap out' design, I can pull out only the amount of hose I need for a given situation.  I have no idea whether the hose will lose this ability over time.For me, the jury is still out on this hose.  I would have preferred a more typical hose, but I am willing to give this one a try and see how it goes.  I will update the review then I have more experience with it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TMYKSYIGO537/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087ORNZG#wasThisHelpful","R3TMYKSYIGO537","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Oneida Molded DIY Dust Deputy Cyclone to collect the sawdust and shavings in my garage workshop and needed a drum to go with it.  The Eagle 1610MB was the right size, capacity and price.  It's pretty heavy duty and has no trouble coping with the vacuum produced by my shop vac.The top is sturdy and has a tapered edge shape that forms an excellent seal with the drum.  The steel band will keep the top firmly in place, but for my use, I really don't need it because the negative pressure generated by my shop vac holds the top firmly in place.  I did reinforce the underside of the top with a piece of 1/2"" plywood, but that was more to stabilize the Dust Deputy than to add strength to the top.I used an old dolly and some scrap wood to build a frame-on-wheels to hold my shop vac and the drum and posted some photos of the results.  The system works well and 95+% of the sawdust and shavings end up in the drum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REK1FBMR1A3V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026GO5CA#wasThisHelpful","REK1FBMR1A3V7","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a small garage woodworking shop.  With only about 250 square feet to work with, space is at a premium.  I need dust collection, and for a for a few years I've been using a 6 gallon Rigid shop vac to collect the sawdust and shavings from my table saw, planer, jointer, band saw, and various hand tools.  There are a couple of problems with this solution.  The small capacity of the shop vac means that I have to empty it frequently, especially when using it with the planer.  Because it is a single stage, the filter becomes clogged quickly.  I've had larger shops in the past, with central dust collection, so I know how effective cyclone separators are at reducing the load on filters.After a bit of research, I settled on the Oneida Dust Deputy.  It seemed a good match for my Rigid shop vac, but I didn't like any of the Oneida options for collection buckets.  The 5 gallon plastic bucket seemed too small.  The 10 gallon steel drum seemed like a better size, but both seemed way over priced.  I decided to go with the DIY option and find a suitable drum.The drum I chose is the Eagle 1610MB Blue High Density Polyethylene Lab Pack Drum with Metal Lever-lock Lid, 14 gallon Capacity, 26.5"" Height, 15"" Diameter.  I like the 14 gallon capacity and the relatively small 15"" diameter.  Because of my limited floor space, I chose to locate the drum above my shop vac, rather than beside it.  I built a frame to support the drum (which has a convenient step in the OD about 2/3 of the way up the side) and attached it to the an old 18"" x 22""  dolly that I wasn't using.  The vac rides on the dolly and the drum is suspended 1"" above it, with the Dust Deputy on top.  The whole thing is about 19"" x 24"" x 66"" high (75"" with a loop of hose into the top of the Dust Deputy) and fits easily in a footprint not much larger than the shop vac alone.  I'll post some photos.My results with the Dust Deputy and 14 gallon drum are very good.  The system seems to be very tight (no leaks).  I tested the system by using it to clean out the base of my Delta cabinet saw, which hadn't been cleaned completely in quite a while.  I vacuumed using a Bosch VAC005 5-Meter Vacuum Hose 35mm, sucking the sawdust as fast as the system would take it.  There was enough sawdust to fill the drum nearly to the top.  I estimate that it contained 12-13 gallons when I was done.  I then opened the shop vac and found about 1/2 gallon of sawdust in it, so the Dust Deputy separated about 95% of the material and left it in the drum.I've noticed that some very light shavings, like the ones from my jointer, have a tendency to become suspended at the top of the cyclone, spinning and spinning.  They don't go into the shop vac, but they don't go into the drum until I shut the shop vac off.  I haven't made enough of these light shavings to know if this will overload the cyclone eventually.The Dust Deputy is simple and well made.  It is made from 2 pieces of a thermoplastic material that appear to be welded ultrasonically.  It does flex a bit at the flange when attached to the drum top.  It probably will survive well in my shop, but I doubt that it would take a lot of abuse.  I knocked off one star because, IMO, the selling price is too high for this item.  That said, I didn't find anything else in the market that would do the same job at a lower cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KC3NI6SM6SGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JP315K#wasThisHelpful","R1KC3NI6SM6SGN","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've seen plenty of piano hinges that were too flimsy for nearly any purpose.  I needed some hinge for a chop saw stand in my workshop and liked that this is stainless steel, so I tried it.  I used it in 3 places on my stand and so far, it's working well.  Since it's stainless, I know that it won't rust in the places I cut it.If you buy this hinge, you may also be interested in Stainless Steel Sheet Metal Screw, Plain Finish, Flat Head, Phillips Drive, Self-Drilling Point, Right Hand Threads, Inch.  The table listing the screw sizes for the hinge say to use #4 screws, but you should ignore that because the #6-20 screws work perfectly with the hinge.  I used the 3/4"" length, but they are also available in a 1 1/4"" length.  They are called sheet metal screws, but they worked well in plywood.

"I needed a 24"" high stool for occasional use in my workshop.  I have little space to spare, so I wanted something compact and foldable.  The TG82-0827 does the trick for me.  Note that the 24"" seat height is right for a 36"" high table or bench, but too high for a 29"" - 30"" high dining table and too low for a 40"" - 42"" high bar.When I opened the box, I noticed right away that the cardboard label was sandwiched between the seat and the frame.  In order to remove it completely, I turned the seat upside down and removed 2 of the seat screws and slipped the label out.  Then I replaced the screws and all was good.I can't say what the weight limit is for this stool, but it is sturdy enough for my 175 pounds.  Anything over 200 pounds might be risky.  I like that there is a spring loaded pin that snaps into place when you unfold the stool.  It will prevent an accidental collapse.There isn't much padding on the seat, so it isn't too comfortable for long periods of use.  If I needed to use it for hours at a time, I would probably either use a cushion on top or remove the seat and add some padding to it.It's a decent, no frills stool that's great for occasional extra seating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2060U0ULYTTBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006H0XEIW#wasThisHelpful","R2060U0ULYTTBL","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought 4 sets of these slides to use in a rolling cabinet in my workshop.  They work smoothly and support all the weight I could put in a 30"" W x 23"" D x 8"" H drawer with ease.  To remove the drawers from the slides, there is a lever that must be depressed.  The levers are very effective in preventing the drawers from coming off the rails unless you want to remove them.I wanted to make the drawers as deep as possible.  My cabinet is 23 and 3/4"" deep, so I made the drawers 23"".  Since the only slides I could get were 22"", I wanted over-travel slides.  The over-travel on these slides is about 1"", so every bit of the drawer is visible when fully open.My one quibble with these slides is that the ""positive stop"" that is supposed to prevent accidental roll out is very weak.  It doesn't take much for the drawers to overpower this stop.  In my application, a rolling cabinet, these stops are completely inadequate to prevent drawer rollout when I move the cabinet.  I made a more effective drawer lock by making an L shaped piece and attaching it to the side of the cabinet with a piece of piano hinge.  To lock the drawers closed, I swing this piece so that the L shape rests against the front and side of the drawers.  I swing it out of the way when I want to open the drawers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2561A1IG4V6LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ASA8U0#wasThisHelpful","R2561A1IG4V6LA","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use a lot of very loud woodworking and construction tools and equipment.  I also suffer from hearing loss that happened with I was younger and wasn't very careful about using ear protection.  That damage isn't going to heal, but I want to do everything I can to prevent further noise-related hearing loss.I've used many different types of earmuff and ear plug protectors.  I've mostly bought less expensive earmuffs and never thought that they worked as well as the plugs, so I've tended to use the plugs.  Although they're effective, I find wearing ear plugs uncomfortable.  I also tend to lose them when I remove them periodically when I'm working.I recently bought the 3M Peltor X-Series Over-the-Head earmuffs, hoping that, with a NRR of 31, it would be more effective than the muffs I've used in the past.  I've been using it for a couple of days and I'm very happy with it.  The Peltor is very light weight and comfortable.  It seals extremely well around my ears, even while wearing Dewalt DPG59-115C Reinforcer Rx-Bifocal 1.5 Clear Lens High Performance Protective Safety Glasses with Rubber Temples and Protective Eyeglass Sleeve, which I also recommend highly if you use reading glasses.  The noise reduction is extremely effective; subjectively, I would say that it is as good as with the ear plugs I've been using.  The 3M Peltor is bulky, but not heavy.  I've worn it for several hours at a stretch without tiring.Bottom line is that I probably won't be using ear plugs very often any more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84HFG5Y2WUZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPCHBCQ#wasThisHelpful","R84HFG5Y2WUZ7","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I replaced a Creative Home Satin Splendor Metallic 2.8 Quart Whistling Tea Kettle, Cranberry with the Chef's Secret.  After 3 years, the old tea pot looked terrible, with heat marks and chips in the finish.The Chef's Secret Stainless Kettle looks amazing.  The shape is beautiful, the handle is comfortable and for the most part remains cool enough to handle without a pot holder.  The kettle seems well designed and constructed and it heats water to a boil on the large burner of my gas stove very quickly.  The spring on the pour spout closure is quite firm, but it snaps open easily when I pull the handle.  My one concern when I first got the kettle was that there is no way to leave the spout closure open, but this hasn't been a problem for me.I've had the kettle for about 6 months and it's still just as beautiful and functional as it was on the first day.  Due to the materials and build quality, I'm pretty confident this kettle is going to last a long time.The fill top fits well and requires a little push to get it all the way on.  If I don't push it all the way, sometimes enough steam will escape from the gap to prevent the whistle from sounding.  Since you can't leave the spout closure open, leaving the fill top slightly ajar will kill the whistle, if it annoys you.A few months after I bought the kettle, I accidentally let the water boil away completely.  When I came back to the kitchen, the kettle was extremely hot and there were heat stains on the stainless surface.  Fortunately, the stains cleaned up very nicely with some Bar Keepers Friend® Cleanser & Polish: 12 OZ and elbow grease.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15XBB9JFUY0JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00407HE3U#wasThisHelpful","R15XBB9JFUY0JY","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I replaced an older head light with the Energizer Pro 3 LED Headlamp.  The old one used 3 AA batteries, was very bulky, weighed a ton, was uncomfortable and ate batteries like crazy.The energizer pro is everything that my old one was not.  First off, it uses AAA batteries, not AA's, which reduced the weight considerably.  The lamp head is light, compact and very comfortable.  The light and switch housing pivot so that you can put the light exactly where you want it.  Light itself is quite bright and the built-in lens does a good job focusing the beam.  At a distance of 6 feet, the spot diameter is about 34"", and it plenty bright for walking at night.  The L:ED bulbs mean that battery life will be improved.

"I'm using the Dell AX510 sound bar on a Dell UltraSharp U2413 24"" LED LCD Monitor - 16:10 - 6 ms , replacing a pair of speakers that I've had sitting on my desk.Installation is very quick and easy: just snap it in place, plug the power cord into the back of the monitor and plug the signal cable into your sound card.  Note that the power cable is for 12V.  There is no line voltage cord.On the right side of the bar is a combo on/off/volume knob.  In the center of the bar is a discrete white LED indicator that is lit when the bar is powered.The sound quality isn't going to blow you away, but It's at least as good as the desk top speakers I replaced and fine if you keep the volume down.  I really like not having the speakers on my desk.I'm giving it 5 stars not because it's the best speaker I've ever heard, but because it's very well designed and for $20, I don't think you can beat it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDYMF3OMTAXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008D2IHES#wasThisHelpful","R1KDYMF3OMTAXV","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used the Dico 120 grit brush to clean the tile grout and fixtures in my bathtub/shower surround.  There was plenty of mold on the tiles and grout and the handles and spouts had mineral deposits.  The brush was effective in removing the mold.  The polished fixtures came out looking like new.I also wanted to remove and replace the existing caulk at the tub/tile joint.  Removing the caulk was a lot more work than I would have thought.  I cut it with a box cutter and used a scraper to remove the bulk of it.  The Dico Nyalox brush was almost useless when it came to removing the last stuck on bits of caulk.  I ended up using a wire brush for that, and even then it took a lot of pressure and time.The Dico Nyalox Cup Brush 120 grit is great when you want to scrub and polish gently, without scratching.

"The knives are very sharp, well machined and do what they're supposed to do.I have 2 quibbles with these Delta replacement parts.  First is that the price is pretty high for the product, but I guess that's what you're going to find with an OEM replacement part.  Second thing is that they could supply these with a sharpened edge on both sides so that you could just flip them over when they need replacement.I recommend using a Rockler Magnetic Jointer Jig (or equal) to set these knives.

"UPDATE: I can confirm that I went through the initialization process described in the dimmer instructions and that the tiny slide switch on the dimmer was in the ""CFL"" position during my test.The first CFL bulb I tested was a 13W ""Bright Effects"" brand.  I also tried a 14W CFL bulb with the ""Revision"" brand, with similar results.  I purchased both of these bulbs several years ago, and I saw in the dimmer instructions that ""dimmable CFL bulbs"" are recommended/required.  I went to my local big box store to buy a CFL bulb specifically identified as dimmable, but of the dozens they had, none claimed to be dimmable.  I don't know what to make of that.I also tried the dimmer with a Phillips LED bulb and it worked well with that; similar to its performance with an incandescent bulb.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this dimmer because it said that it would work with incandescent, CFL and LED lights.With incandescent bulbs, the light is dimly visible at the minimum setting and smoothly transitions to full brightness in proportion to the position of the slider.With CFL bulbs, I had 2 different results.  With only a CFL in the fixture, the bulb flashes on and off when the slider goes from 0% to 50%.  From 50% - 100%, it was fully on, no dimming.  With a combination of one incandescent bulb and one CFL bulb in the fixture, the CFL bulb stayed very dim from 0% to 50% and then was fully on from 50% to 100%, while the incandescent bulb behaved normally.I bought 2 of these and one of them had a defective slider, which did not move smoothly, but stuck at several points.  I returned that one and received a replacement with a working slider.  It still will not work with a CFL though.I will keep the dimmer because I do have a use for incandescent dimming, but I am disappointed that it will not work with CFL.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KEHKB73RVFBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3613ME#wasThisHelpful","R3KEHKB73RVFBS","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of words of caution.  A jointer is inherently dangerous.  BE SURE TO UNPLUG IT BEFORE DOING ANYTHING WITH THE KNIVES!  The knives are very sharp; don't touch the cutting edge with your bare hands.  Be sure to double check the locking bolts on all the knives before starting it up.  After replacing the knives, make sure to replace the guard before starting the machine.  Stand behind the machine fence when starting it for the first time after changing knives.The following is not a complete description of every aspect of replacing and setting jointer knives. Read the owner's manual for your jointer and the instructions that come with the Rockler jig.  I have a Delta 6 inch jointer and use the Rockler jig to set the knives.Setting the knives on a jointer has some aspects that are not precise.  One of the first things you do, whether using the Rockler jig not, is locate the 'top dead center' of the knives.  That is, the point at which the cutting edge of the knife reaches its highest point while the head rotates.  The usual way to do it is to place a straightedge on the outfeed table, projecting out over the cutter head and rotate the cutter head by hand until the knife edge just touches the straightedge.  With the Rockler jig, the straightedge is replaced by the magnetic bars, but the principle is the same.Finding TDC sounds pretty straightforward when you read about it, but the reality is a bit different.  First, the outfeed table has to be exactly level with the knife when it's at TDC, something that's inherently not exact.  Second, the knife is going to be approaching the straightedge tangentially, which means it's difficult to say precisely when it touches the straightedge.  Third, it's difficult to see the spot where the knife touches the straightedge, no matter how much light you use and how you position it.  Once you think you know where TDC is, you scribe a mark on the fence to locate it.  The fence itself is not a precision device.  The next time you want to use that TDC mark, the fence will probably not be in the exact same position that it was when you made the mark.In a word, mushy.Once you locate TDC, the Rockler jig does make the inexact process of setting the individual knives much faster.The process is fairly simple. Loosen and remove the knives and locking bars.  Thoroughly clean the cutterhead slots and locking bars.  At this time I also spray Boeshield T-9 Lubricant on all the parts to prevent rust and to ensure that the new knives will slide freely in the slots during the setting process.  Loosely place a new knife and locking bar in a slot, making sure that it's centered from side to side.  The locking bolts need to be in very light contact with the cutterhead slot, just to keep the knife in the correct position.  The knife must be free to slide up and down, and if it doesn't, that means the locking bolts are too tight.Tip: With the Rockler jig, you don't need to use the jacking screws under the knives as you do in conventional knife setting.  Back them off a bit so that they won't inadvertently limit the travel of the knife in the slot.Place the Rockler jig in position, with the scribe line on the bar aligned with the TDC line you made on the fence.  Rotate the cutterhead until the cutting edge of the knife is right at the TDC line on the jig.  If all is right, the knife will snap up to the magnet on the bar and stay there.  I suggest using a small piece of wood to push down on the knife edge, letting the magnet pull it back into position a couple of times to make sure that it moves freely and that it's exactly where it should be.  You can't do this unless you've backed off the jacking screws.  Lightly snug the 2 locking bolts closest to the center of the knife.  Rotate the cutterhead back and forth and observe the knife when it reaches TDC.  It should just barely touch the Rockler jig bar, but not move it.  If the jig bar moves, the knife is too high; loosen the locking bolts and reset the knife.  Once the knife is in the correct position, snug all of the locking bolts and then tighten them with force.  Double check the knife position with the Rockler jig.Go through the same procedure with the remaining knives.  Double check every locking bolt on every knife to make sure they are tight before plugging in the machine and turning it on.Once you get the hang of using the Rockler jig, the process is fairly fast, compared to setting the knives with only a straightedge. The end result may be no more precise, but you will get there faster.  I'm happy to have the jig and there is no doubt I will use it because it is faster.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLMEFF44MRMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AJYQIO#wasThisHelpful","R2RLMEFF44MRMG","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE 30 March 2014:I bought a second iGaging DigiMAG 6"" DRO to use with my INCRA Mast-R-Lift-II Router Lift. The installation was pretty easy, but you will need a 3mm tap to do it.  I bought the Irwin Tools 2712- 3 Piece Set - 3.0 mm - 0.50 mm because the holes drilled in the top plate should not go all the way through so at least 2 taps are required, one tapered and a bottoming.  I drilled and tapped 2 holes in the router clamping piece and did the same for 2 holes in the backside of the main plate and used the 3mm screws that come with the DigiMAG to attach the scale to the plate and the slider to the clamping piece.  Be very careful not to over torque the tap when you tap the holes in the plate.  It's very easy to strip a thread in aluminum when tapping a blind hole.The advantage of using a DRO in a router table is that you can zero the readout at any point and then make your cutter bit height adjustments from there.  You also have the option to use decimal inches, mm or fractional inches with the push of a button.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've had a Jet 15"" planer (similar to JET 708538 JWP-15DX: 15 CS Planer with Quick Change Knives, but without the quick change knives) for about 14 years and recently I installed new knives and adjusted the cutter head, feed rolls and chip breaker.  After the adjustments, the thickness across a 12"" board is within 0.001"" from edge to edge and the planed surface is like glass.I've been thinking about putting a DRO on the planer for a long time, and once I had it running well, it seemed like a good time to do it. I didn't do a ton of research, but the iGaging DigiMAG seemed to be just what I wanted, at a very reasonable price.  I particularly liked the remote readout and preferred it to the DRO designs that have the display on the sliding unit.  It's just much easier to read the display when you can put it anywhere you want.Installing the sensing unit on the Jet planer was relatively simple because I was able to use existing tapped holes in the base, movable platen and top unit to attach brackets.  I used a piece of 1 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" x 12 1/2"" long aluminum angle to span between the top and base and attached one of the Z brackets supplied with the DigiMAG to the platen. I mounted the measuring scale and attached the sliding unit to the bracket.  The readout display has magnets on the back, so it will stick securely to almost any part of the planer.  I have mine stuck to the top, where it's easy to read.Another reviewer pointed out that for a planer, the product you want is 35-706P, not 35-706 because of the 'preset' function (thank you Ronald Haefner ""Haefdog"").  IMO, this feature is essential for getting the best use out of the DRO.  In practice, it works like this: plane a board to any thickness; measure the thickness with a digital or dial caliper to the nearest 0.001"" (average of the readings for both edges); enter this into the display with the 'preset' function (explained in the instructions); press 0/Set and that calibrates the entire system to the cut you just made.  After that, you can choose to have the display show MM, fractional inches or decimal inches.I installed the unit with the cable attached to the sliding section facing toward the planer, to keep it out of the way.  When I did this, the display reads the movement of the platen as negative, so a 3/4"" thickness will show up as - 3/4"" or -0.750.  No problem with this, but it meant that I have to enter the 'preset' thickness as a negative number, not positive.After going through the preset procedure, which takes just a couple of minutes, I am easily able to have my planed boards come out with in +/- 0.002"" of the DRO setting.  I am so happy!I've only been using the DRO for a couple of days, so I can't speak to the durability in my shop, but I will update the review in the future, when I have more experience with it.I'll post a photo of the installation when I figure out how to do it.UPDATE 28 SEPTEMBER 2014:I've been using the iGaging DRO on my planer for about 9 months and it continues to be the best thing ever.  In the 9 months I've been using it, I've calibrated it just one time.  Ever since then, I just turn on the display before I use the planer, crank the thickness to where I want it and run the boards through.This week, I planed a bunch of 2"" Western Red Cedar to a thickness of 1 9/16"" (1.562"") in several stages, removing about 1/32"" with each pass.  After the final pass, I checked several boards with a digital caliper and found them all to be within +/- 0.002"" of my target.Having the iGaging DRO on the planer has changed the way I use it.  Before I had it, setting the thickness was a hit-or-miss (mostly miss) proposition.  It usually took so long to get it just right that I did everything I could to minimize the number of times I had to change the setting.  I have a small shop and if I had to plane long, wide, thick boards, I sometimes ran into real problems trying to move and stack the boards as I worked them down to the final thickness.  With the DRO, changing the setting is so quick and easy, that it's no problem to work a single board through several thicknesses and then go on to another one, which makes material handling much easier.Another thing that's very nice is that I no longer have to think about backlash in the adjusting gears as I change thicknesses.  Without the DRO, I would have to be careful to move the platen in the same direction every time because of the backlash.  With the DRO, the measurement on the display is always accurate, whether I'm moving the platen up or down.  So slick!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D8V3EINYBFB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003JU46J4#wasThisHelpful","R1D8V3EINYBFB8","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've wanted a Record 52 1/2 vise for years, but never could justify the cost.  I finally decided to get one, only to discover that they're no longer made.  No problem I thought, I'll find one on Ebay.  Unfortunately, the Record vise now seems to be a collector's item and a decent used one commands a higher price than they were when sold new.  After some more research, I discovered that the Record tooling for the vise had been sold to an Indian company, and the Indian product was being distributed in the US by Woodcraft at a very reasonable price.I ordered one and waited, hoping that the product would be well made and fully functional.  The package arrived a bit beat up, which is what you might expect when you put a 35 pound, cast iron and steel vise in a cardboard box.  The vise itself was undamaged and looked good, if a bit oily.If you do a search for 'installing an eclipse vise', you will find a great article on how to install this vise on a bench.  The author suggested disassembling the vise to clean and install it and I highly recommend doing it this way because of the weight and size.  I used the flush-mount method and am very happy with the results.At one point during my installation, the rear jaw of the vise (which probably weighs 7-8 pounds) fell off the bench and hit the concrete floor with a loud bang.  I winced and wondered if I had broken it.  Not to worry; there was a little chip in the paint, but the only damage was a chunk taken out of the floor.  Solid!The Eclipse vise works very well and seems to be a worthy successor to Record.  The fast action is smooth and sure and the screw does what it's supposed to do.  It's huge! Even with 3/4"" thick wood jaws added, the opening is 14"".  One nice feature of this vise is that the jaws are not parallel from top to bottom when they are not squeezing something.  As you apply pressure, the support rods bend slightly as they are loaded.  When this happens, the jaws deflect slightly and become parallel.  Genius!I'm using the Eclipse at then end of my bench and so I drilled a series of 3/4"" holes for bench dogs, in line with the retractable dog in the movable jaw of the vise.  I used Kreg Tool Company KKS1070 Kreg Bench Dogs and am very happy with them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZWTEGZDACJKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OCH206#wasThisHelpful","R1ZWTEGZDACJKL","A5PG7USCONTTR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5PG7USCONTTR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
