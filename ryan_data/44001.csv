"This is a nice little oil diffuser and humidifier.  It is about the size of a softball.  The only way to plug it in is through USB.  I love this for a few reasons.  First it does not use much electricity.  2nd, every humidifier I have ever used is made in a way that the water holding tank can not be opened to clean.  What a pain!  I have thrown away quite a few.  This one can be.  The water in it lasts about 2 1/2- to 3 days. The only essential oil I have right now is peppermint.  When this oil diffuser/humidifier arrived, I filled it and added 6 drops of peppermint oil.  In a few minutes, the entire house filled with peppermint!  The smell lasted about an hour.  Peppermint oil is very strong to begin with which I am sure helps, but I imagine any other oil would not be too different.  For such a small humidifier, I am very impressed!

"I have honestly been through about 6 different kinds of mops in the last 6 years and it has been frustrating.  I first saw the spin mop a few months ago and really wanted to try one, but never got around to buying one.  I finally had the chance to try this one and I am incredibly happy!  I understand there are electric ones.  I am pleased this one is not.  I think an electric one would probably end up dying at some point when there really is no way for this to fail.  However, if you are older or if you are buying for someone older who will have trouble pushing down on the handle, electric would probably be better.  There are 2 spin areas, 1 in the bucket and 1 on top.  The spin basket takes almost no effort at all to use, but the spin area in the bucket does take some effort, most likely because of the water.  The spin area in the bucket cleans off your mop head  while the spin basket dries the mop head for you.  The microfiber mop head could not be more perfect.  I have been able to get in and around places that I normally have to handwash like along the walls, in corners, under the heaters.  I have washed the mop heads in the washer, but I washed them by themselves and they held up great.  I left them hang to dry.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this mop!!

"I really love these!! They look great with the stainless steel tops and glass bottoms.  They make it so easy to put oil and finger on my subs, salads, vinegar on my fries, oiling my pans and so on.  They spray more of a mist I think is the right word for it.  Not too much comes out, so there are no worries about too much coming out. Since oil is thicker, it has a slightly harder time spraying, but still works well.  Filling the bottles is easy and so far I have had no issues with filling, using or cleaning.  I love these little bottles and hope to have them around for a long time!

"This is a strong, very durable bike lock!  The 6 ft length provides enough leeway for wherever you need to lock up your bike while the 1/2 inch in diameter cable (including the thick, heavy duty tubing) makes it harder than normal for your regular joe with regular tools to cut it.  The lock is a little shaky when connected to the mounting bracket.  I did put it through a pretty hard test and it held pretty well.  I love that you can choose your own combo, and it is easy to set (4 steps - included instructions).  Great bike lock!

"I have had quite a few of these hoses.  This one is actually the best quality I have had so far!  They are equipped with nice brass connectors.  The hose is itself uses a thicker material than the ones I have used in the past.  The sprayer is not bad either.  The trick with these hoses is to ensure that all the water is emptied from the hose when you are finished with it at the end of the day.  I figured this out with the first couple that I had (not this brand).  Leaving the water in seemed to weaken the hoses.  I have not had left the water in this one to see if it would weaken it.  I just have not wanted to take that chance.  I do love how light and portable these are.  I have used this one quite a few times and it still shrinks and works great.

"This is a great little water filter.  I love that it is compact, makes it perfect for hiking, camping etc when you usually do not want to carry a lot of weight.  Our family, like a lot of other families is preparing for the unthinkable.  We like to have enough supplies for whatever may come to ensure we did everything possible for our kids.  A way to have drinkable water at all times is on the top of our list.  Unfortuneatly, I had no way of testing the water after being filtered, so for now, I tested it on our tap water.  For reasons unknown, once in awhile our tap water turns brown.  Needless to say, we do not drink the tap water.  I waited for that time to come, to finally test out the filter  (took about a month).  The filter did great!  The brown water came out clear and tasted great!  I do plan on finding a way to test the water before I buy one for each member of the family, but for now I am convinced!

"This is a great little light! It is about the size of a softball, maybe a little smaller (It has been some time since I have held a softball).  Incredibly easy to use.  Once you receive it, just set it in water and it will light up. To turn it off, take it out of the water.  No actual buttons mean less chance for the inside to get water in it.  There are 2 sensor like buttons on the bottom.  I tried to get the battery cover off, but failed miserably, it is on there very well.  Hoping when the time comes, that my husband can get it off. I have not yet hit the 30-hour​ mark, so I can not verify the length of use, however, it is very bright.  The mode and colors change while in use.  This is a fun little toy at a decent price.  Depending on the size of the pool, pond or whatever you want to put them in, you may want more than one.  Great product!

"We wanted these more for camping than on the grill.  Since I received these after we were finished camping for awhile, I did get a chance to try them on the grill.  They are plenty big enough, which is great.  We cooked pork chops and steaks on them and had no issues.  The meat had grill marks, cooked quite well and tasted delicious!  The downside for us was that the packaging states you should not use metal on them.  We did not own plastic or silicone spatulas/tongs.  The feel of the mat made me think I could get away with our metal ones on it, but decided not to chance it. We went and bought new utensils and I guess we will just pack them with the rest of our camping gear.  Other than that, very impressed.

"This light travels a long way.  It took some time to get here (about 3 weeks) but did arrive in perfect working order.  I got the 18 cm long light.  It is not that big, but it is very bright and It work great. I am using it in my laundry room right now.  I have the light plugged into a USB plug in a regular outlet.  There is an on/off switch which I loveI  It is a simple push of a small button. My only downside is the cord length is not very long.  They are currently selling this light for about $4 which is a really great price for what you get.  These are perfect for any space that needs extra light  They are thin, so the light itself is not an eyesore.  Aside from the cord (With a little effort you can find a way to conceal or hide the wires, depending on the setup you have at home.) I will be adding pictures in a day or so.

"These body wraps are fairly easy to use, once you get use to them and the process.  I have used several different wraps in the past and I really like these for how they leave my skin feeling afterward.  I guess refreshed would some it up.  The thing about wraps is, they are temporary weight loss, but they do work! I like to use them right after a shower to make sure the area is clean.  While the bandages were soaking, I mixed the clay.  I wanted to make sure I pulled the bandages, rung them out and put them on before they had a lot of time to cool.  I like to pull the bandages from the water while they are still hot (just not to the point where it would burn my skin).  I then used saran wrap and wrapped myself as tight as I could.  Having someone help you do this, works to your advantage.  It is not that easy wrapping yourself tightly with saran wrap.  The saran wrap helps keep the area warm and the mess from the clay getting on your furniture or clothing.  That is pretty much it.. Leave on about an hour and wipe off.  Smell is not terrible and leaves your skin feeling great!  After a few uses, I could really start to see a change.

"This is a nice air compressor.  I love that it comes with all the tips needed to fill several different air filled objects.  It can be plugged into a regular outlet or into the car cigarette outlet.  Both wires are plenty long enough. It is loud like an air compressor.  Seems to be well enough made.  I first used it to top off my kids balls that have been losing air the past couple years.  I then tried it on my 2 of our pool floaties just to see how it worked (It is getting to cold for swimming).

"My husband is a woodworker, carpenter and all around handyman.  He comes home often with caked on muddy shoes and speaking as the one who cleans our floors, I love this little guy!!! I was slightly worried that it would be to big and take up a lot of space, but it does not.  The base of the cleaner is solid and very durable with thick wooden sides and bottom with a metal surrounding.  The bristles are tough and long.  I had a somewhat hard time bending them to try and get a good picture of how thick they are.  I have no worries that they will wear out anytime soon. The center of the bottom is left opened.  There is mounting hardware included so you can secure it to the floor and not have to worry about it sliding around as you drag your shoes through.  If you need to clean mud, I recommend letting it dry first.  It does an awesome job getting the majority of the dirt and dust off of his shoes with minimarl effort.

"The reason I really wanted this was because my husband started to hand make the  handles for our basic kitchen knives.  He bought very expensive blades for these knives.  You can see in the pictures the handles are not quite finished yet.  When your knives get thrown around in your kitchen drawer or in a knife bin, they get dull.  If you place them on the wall on a magnetic knife holder, they do not.  Unfortunately when I ordered this, we were supposed to be moving.  At our current house, we have no great place to put this where our younger kids can not get to it.  We later decided to wait another year before moving.  This means it will be another year before we can use it. I did try the holder out.  I placed all of our basic HEAVY kitchen knives on the holder, but I am holding it.  This is a really nice magnetic knife holder.  It is very heavy duty.  After having all the knives on it, I shook it around, played with it and pulled the knives on and off.  The magnets are very strong. The knives held great!  I can not wait until we can get this on the wall to use all the time!

"This is the first kind of pan like this that I have ever seen.  The design is brilliant.  You first add water, wine, etc to the ring, place your pan on the burner, then heat your stove to medium and place your food on the pan to cook.  I love that you can (should) add water, or flavored liquid in the ring.  I am not 100% sure why you need to do this, but I do know that it does help keep it moist and is an awesome way to add flavoring.  So far we made cilantro chicken and pork chops on it.  Both came out delicious! Tender, juicy, and flavorful. The pan is made from a thin metal.  But has not made a difference.  I do not see the non-stick coating lasting to long (I am used to this, happens to all my non-stick pans)  I just eventually scrub it off to ensure that it does not get in my food.

"I tried these and the 1 foot cords and I love them both!  They are heavy duty, so they are able to handle bigger appliances.

"Just in the past year or so, I have learned the importance of a great coaxial cable wire.  We only use analog TV and streaming services.  The cable wires outside were installed when the previous tenants ordered cable, so they were somewhat new.  I used those and a couple old cable wires that we owned to hook up to an antenna in the attic.  It was a great setup, or so I thought.  We had gotten more channels than ever, they all came in more clear and we did not have the terrible sight of an antenna and cable wires all over our rooms that needed to be adjusted every time we wanted other channels.  We used that setup for 3 years.  About a year ago, we decided to switch to an internet connected through cable (just internet, no cable).  We installed it ourselves, but they sent new wires and such.  I decided to use the coaxial cables sent to connect our TV to the antenna setup and the current coaxial cable to connect to the modem.  Just by switching that one coaxial cable, I we got a few more channels.  I know it was the cable wire because none of the other TV's had any sort of change.  I was thrilled!This is a very nice kit.  I love that they include a splitter and an assist wrench.  I do not know about anyone else reading this, but trying to screw them in is a pain in butt.  Everything is nicely packaged and easy to set up.  If these are hand packaged by tech professionals, they took care of their products which is a good sign.  You can tell that nice, durable materials are used. I used the splitter where my outside cables connect, and one of the 6 foot cables in the attic to connect from the wall outlet to the antenna.  Everything works great!  The only downside for me is that the coaxial cables are only 6 feet.  Depending on where your setup is and what you are connecting, 6 feet could be a good or bad thing.  If your setup is close to where you connect, great! Less cable mess.  If you are like me and change up the rooms in your house often, then 6 feet doesn't give you to much room to go on.  Now if you didn't plan on using both cables at the same time, you could use the splitter and both 6 foot cables to make a 12 foot and give yourself more room to work with.

"I really love this bowl!! I hate pouring my noodles and hot water with the strainer in the sink.  The steam pulls up really gross bacteria from in the drain.  I do not always have my husband to help so this is perfect for me! You have to start slowly pouring the water out or it will splash up on you when the noodles it.  The only issue we have had with it, is that it is not big enough to pour a family sized pot of noodles in.  We have fixed this problem by placing our regular strainer in the bowl, this way we can still pour from the side of the sink and fit all the noodles in.  I have used this bowl for rinsing grapes, lettuce, potatoes, noodles, blueberries, and raspberries.  It has worked well for all.  My only complaint was that I could not remove the strainer so I thought it was glued in.  Apparently you can, so I guess my problem is that I was not trying hard enough :-).

"Oo I really love these!! Such a cute ideaI just started homeschooling my 1st grader, where my 4 year old participates and my 1 year old sits in, colors and yells out words whenever she sees fit.  The first 2 weeks of school got really messy.  Books and papers everywhere, pencils in various places.  Dry erase markers, erasers, glue, etc. I would clean things up at night, then the next night would look like another tornado ran through.  I needed an organized area for her.  When I saw these, I thought how perfect! The ceramic is well made with chalkboard paint on it.  They do provide 4, individually wrapped waxy-like crayons, maybe chalk.  One for each cup.  The lids have an okay suction to them.  I LOVE that they are all in a different color.  The colors are vibrant and look great.  I have pencils in 1, dry erase markers with eraser in another, scissors in the 3rd and glue in the 4th.  They bring a certain something to the ""classroom"".  If I hadn't needed better organization for the classroom, I would of gladly used these in the kitchen.  The colors chosen for the lids would look great in just about any kitchen and though I would not want a jar to fall off the counter full of sugar, I feel confident that the lid could keep out dust and possible bugs lurking.  Other great uses that I could see would be candy or in the bathroom for cotton balls, q-tips etc... Very versatile!

"It works! We have deet based bug spray for camping and mainly ticks.  The deet based states on the bottle to only use on your clothes and that it will burn your skin.  Well I can not in good faith put that on my children, so we would only use it while walking through the woods on the bottoms of our pants.  I was more than thrilled to try out an all natural bug spray.  I have to admit, I was skeptical as I have tried ""all natural"" before and it did not work.  We finally had the chance to try this out the other night at gramma and grampas.  I put it on all 3 kids and myself.  It almost smells like murphy's oil and lemon pledge put together. To me not awful, but I could see how others might think so. Then again, I think our deet based spray stinks, so why wouldn't I at least choose the one that would not burn my kids.  It is thick and you do need to rub it in.  It dries on skin without an oily residue.  It really does work!  While others would complain about getting bit here and there, or I would watch them swatting gnats, we were fine.  I did get the occasional bug in my face, but it didn't stick around long.  I checked my kids when we got home, and no signs of being bitten.  Quick showers, and we could no longer smell the bug spray.  Great Product! My only downside is I think the price could be a little lower, but at least a little does go a long way.

"I read a bunch of other reviews for these that said the cushions fell off easily.  I can not believe that many customers would be wrong or exaggerating, so I am thinking that maybe they re-did the design of the headphones because I have not had that issues at all.  I even messed with the cushions, to try and get them to fall off and I could not.  These are the first pair of kids headphones that my kids can wear comfortably, without having them fall of their heads a hundred times.  The padding is thick and large.  It covers their entire ear.  I actually used them a few times and they do sound pretty good.  We have had these over a month, have used them several times and have had no issues at all.  Great pair of head phones!

"We are using this on the back of the front seat of our car and I really like it! The strap to wrap around the seat is detachable and comes unattached, tucked into a pocket.  The straps are adjustable and I had a nice fit around my seat.  The pockets at the top are pretty big and can hold whatever is necessary for the car ride.  The reason I keep it in the car is for the insulated bag.  A lot of our car rides run an hour or more long.  Having this attached to the back of the seat makes it easy for us to store snacks and drinks for the kids, in a place where they can grab them without my help since it is hard for me to continuously reach back there.  I keep it in front of my oldest child so she can handle passing out the stuff for me.  The insulation of the bag is like what you would in those grocery store insulated bags and I will post a picture of what I mean, but it does do the trick and leave are drinks and suck cold until we need them.

"These are pretty nice kick mats.  There is a pattern on them but it blends into the mat so you can only see it when looking from certain directions.  There are 2 pockets near the top, so It is pretty easy for my kids to grab things out of them and they are high enough to where if my kids put their shoes on the mat, the yuck from their shoes doesn't get on the items in the pockets.  They do use a thin, durable material.  We have pretty big front seats (suburban) and the mats just fit the seats.  I was able to place the bottom elastic in the crack of the seat and have it stay, and the tops were just long enough to fit around the headrest.

"I am a sock fanatic! I especially love new socks.  How they smell and feel (weird I know),  but I can also say I am somewhat of an expert.  You should always wear a nice pair of quality socks.  You feet take the most abuse out of your entire body and deserve to be pampered.  These are really well made.  The fabric feels great on your feet.  They are not big and bulky.  They are stretchy, soft,  and breathable.  They are not however, so stretchy that they lose their form after wearing.  The prints on them are really cute.  I like how you get 2 different prints.

"I have wanted one of these for years and am very pleased to have gotten this one.  You have to watch when you first open the package because they have it super wrapped with the ""wings"" together.  When I unwrapped it, the thigh master kind of hopped out and went flying.  I suppose that also answer the question about the resistance.  Yes it has quite a bit of resistance.  The ""wings"" are about 9 1/2 inches long and are fully padded.  I really like using it!  I did a quick search online for different ways to use and found MANY videos.  You can work your belly, thighs, arms, chest and so on.  One of favorite ways to use it is to lay on the couch with my kids while they are watching tv (we have a pretty firm sectional)  It is also like laying on the floor without the added pain of laying on the floor.  I can work my thighs, arms and chest while using their shows to time myself.  It is also the first piece of exercise equipment that I have owned that I can use without my kids getting in my way.

" 0:17 Mins This is a decent little camera.  It is not movie theater quality and I have never used a gopro, but considering the price difference I would imagine the quality is better on the gopro.  That being said.  This action cam is a few hundred dollars cheaper and does do the trick!  I will be able to capture my children in all their glory without my videos looking like smears across the screen.  The camera itself is about 3 cm tall and wide.  There is a strong magnet on the bottom for accessories and mounting.  It is very easy to use.  Hold in the button on top to turn it on.  Once it is on, hit the button once for a picture, twice to record.  When done recording, hit the button one more time to stop.  The camera is not waterproof, but IS splash proof and I know you can buy an accessory (a clear box) to put it in if you wanted to use in the water.  It also works pretty well in the house.  It was not sunny out when I took that short video, so you can the quality is not that bad.  The only things I do not like is the fact that without the accessories, there is really no way to secure the camera.  At the very least, you should be able to attach a lanyard and you wouldn't have to worry about losing it somewhere. I also do not like that the videos come in .mov format.  I had to convert the video (converting software was free and easy to use)in order to watch it on my computer.  I could however plug the camera in my TV without problems to watch the video on there.

"We used these when we went to a local amusement park near our house.  It is a pain to grab toilet paper, set it out, lift my kids up to put on the toilet paper so it does not fall off in the process and all this before my kids pee themselves.  I was more or less desperate for a better solution.  These are really nice.  Since they are thicker, if there was something on the toilet that I did not see, I didn't have to worry about it soaking through the cover.  The ""grips on the back kept it in place through the whole ordeal (I still lifted my kids and sat them down just in case).  They covered the entire seat without a problem.  I also like that they fit in a small, thin pack.  I easily kept them in my purse for easy access.  They are a great price for the quality!  My only suggestion is if you decide to buy,  please think of how many people will be using them and for what you are using them for.  We are a family of 5 and only 2 of my kids used them.

"So so happy I got this light!! Our bathroom is at the top of the steps and because of that, at night I get really scared about my kids going to the bathroom. I really do not like having the hall lights on because that light switch controls 2 ceiling lights for 2 separate hallways and I feel that is to much light on and completely unnecessary. Also when my kids go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, they tend to not turn the light on and go to the bathroom in pitch black.  My son did that the other night ( I just happened to be up).  My SON.. Where is he peeing if he can not see!?!?  This light is perfect for my problem!  I have it where the 2 halls meet each other with the light facing towards the bathroom.  When they come out of the hallway into the other,  the light turns on and they can see their way to the bathroom and to turn on the light. Plus when they leave the bathroom this light will turn on and stay on just long enough for them to turn off the light and walk into their hallway and I no longer have to worry about them not seeing the steps.  It has been working perfectly.  You can turn the light in any direction and it will stay.  The light comes out of the fixture for easy replacement of the batteries.

"They're comfortable and work well-enough. I prefer my tongs to have a longer gripping area for better, um, gripping. When in gripping position, the silicone tips touch each other, but where the silicone tips end, there's almost a gap of 1"". I wish the tips stayed more straight, instead of curving out so much; therefore, more of the the scalloped parts would touch each other.Speaking of the tips, I couldn't get them off. Granted, I'm not the strongest person in the world, but any stronger, I felt like I'd rip off the silicone tips that may never stay on afterwards. There's a very slight gap where the silicone tips end, especially on the inside side of the tongs. There's a chance that food or liquidy stuff might get in there. Of course this isn't an issue if I can remove the tips, but I cannot.Otherwise, the tongs work well.

"I've been a Macbook Pro user for over a decade, but getting another MBP as another computer seemed too pricey, so I was happy to receive the Zenbook UX305LA to review because I was looking for a PC laptop.This looks a lot like Macbook Air. It works well, looks great and has good battery life, with a good amount of RAM and hard-drive capacity. However, it falls short in a few areas:- The keyboard is not backlit. I didn't realize how crucial this feature was until I was typing in the dark.- The power button is the same size as the delete button which is located next to the power button. It has a small light, but it's easy to hit ""delete"" accidentally, especially when the keyboard is not backlit if you're typing in the dark.- (I use a laptop stand, so this isn't an issue.) The laptop's four corners have rubberized feet. Unfortunately, when the laptop is being used on a flat surface like a desk and is open a little beyond 90-degrees, the back/bottom part of the screen-containing lid lifts the back part of the Zenbook, so the rear two rubberized feet don't come in contact with the surface, i.e. only the front two rubberized feet keep it from moving around, which doesn't keep things as stable. This is a design flaw.- Opening the Zenbook takes some thought. There's no indentation to allow a good, easy position to lift up the screen/lid.- The touchpad takes a while to get used to. It's definitely different from Macbooks.This isn't a negative - just an FYI: The Zenbook does NOT have a touchscreen.The price is pretty good and much lower than a comparable Macbook Air. It works fine for today's computing needs, with everything being on cloud. If you plan on buying this, please be sure to familiarize yourself with an unlit keyboard. I didn't realize how annoying that'd be that I'd rather pay a bit more for that feature, even though I rarely type in a dark or semi-dark environment. With a backlit keyboard, this would be a solid 4-star machine, possibly 5 if the price stayed the same.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15UXHRJ7R8JCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013KKANTE#wasThisHelpful","R15UXHRJ7R8JCD","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I especially appreciate all the thoughts that must've gone into to make this printer because it's not excessively large for what it offers: flatbed scanning, multiple feeders, lovely results. My last Canon had a paper tray which always stuck out because it couldn't be stowed away. Annoying.The setup took a while - you might need to visit Epson's website to download some updates.This is great for printing colored documents and photos on the go. It prints black-and-white documents too, but I would get a separate laser printer for that due to the higher cost of toners for inkjet printers. I also wouldn't print several gigs of photos stored in my computers and cellphones - I'd use a photo-printing company for such huge volumes.It's a great value for a well-designed printer which produces colorful results.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FMCU0U682ETY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","R1FMCU0U682ETY","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a basic microphone for musicians, comparable to the classic Shure SM58. This is not a condenser mic which picks up every nuance or background noise. A dynamic mic (like this one) can be more useful if you're not in a completely silent studio environment for recording your music.I don't have a high-end brand's dynamic mic like a Neumann to compare this, but this serves the purpose for an all-purpose general mic. It should also be a good performance mic at a club, though my gigging years are long gone.You need an XLR cable to use this. (That's a typical microphone cable.) I don't know why this product is listed under ""wireless,"" as of the time of this review because this is not a wireless mic.Overall, a good, affordable, basic starter microphone for recording and performing. My 5-star rating considers the price because it provides excellent value for what you pay.

"My review is for Husky size 8. These are sturdy and classic-looking with an adjustable waist, which should be a must for all pants. They wash up nicely, and the denim feels thick, i.e. not flimsy like so many jeans these days.The waist measures 27"" at the largest setting, with 5 notches in the elastic band on each side to make the waist smaller, though at the smallest setting, it might look a bit bunched up.

The wearer of these sneakers has narrow feet, but the tabs that came with the order were fine. Actually, the sneakers felt a bit too tight because of the removable insoles, but the wearer got used to the feeling after wearing only Merrell sneakers for several years.I can't believe I paid so much for a pair of children's sneakers, but I'm grateful my financial situation allows me to pay a premium for comfort, ease of use and style.

"These size 14-husky pants seem sturdy and well-constructed. The fabric feels heavy enough to withstand the abuse.After washing (and please wash only with other dark-colored clothes, unless you want your whites to be tinted with blue-gray), the inseam measures about 27"", and the waist is about 30"" at the biggest setting. The waist can be narrowed by adjusting the elastic band inside the belt line - there are 5 button holes on the elastic band on each of the side, though stretching to button at the 5th/last hole would make the waist bunch up a bit. Still, I wish all pants, including adults', had that feature. (Btw, these can also fit a petite adult female who's a little over 5' tall - of course I had to have other people try these on.)The look is classic. I love the adjustable waist.

"I have the older version of this laminator (TL-901) which works great, but I didn't like how bulky it was, with some design elements that could have used some thought. This works very well but comes in a nice-looking compact format, mainly because it doesn't have a feeder tray. Also, the power cord can be stored at the bottom.I thought I'd miss the tray, but it works fine, probably because this is a great laminator which is very generous if you make minor errors.

"If you want a compact sleeping pad for car-camping, this is fantastic. It's efficiently designed with excess material trimmed away, so it rolls up to a small size, though not as small as high-end backpacking pads. Some people don't care about size while car-camping, but I still like well-designed products that offer better features at reasonable prices.The pad inflates nicely, then you need to blow it up the rest of the way - be sure to watch for the little raised bumps on the pad to appear to know you've inflated enough for maximum support. Once, I didn't do a good job at manually inflating, but it was still comfortable.In case you don't read the direction, be sure to over-inflate before use to help the pad retain its shape better. For storing, do not keep it rolled up in the small stuff sack which will crease and weaken the foam pad material inside. Instead, keep it unrolled with the valve open.

"Sonicare keeps offering new brush head options. These look closest to the ""regular"" (for now called Simply Clean) with a few bundles of stiffer bristles from Intercare and other brush heads that offer better removal of plaque.I was wondered out clean my teeth would feel because I'm used to the forceful Intercare, ProResults and Diamond Clean lines, but my teeth feel very clean! This could be because I'm using a new brush head, but these feel gentler on the gums.The brush head is about few millimeters longer and wider than the usual Sonicare non-compact sizing you're used to - imagine a bristle-bundle longer and wider. The brush head uses softer plastic and has more ""give"" than old (now non-adaptive) brush heads. As an excessive brusher, I can probably use less force.One thing which might take a bit of getting used to is the back which isn't flat like other brush heads. These have a small ridge/spine down the middle, so you'll feel with your tongue. Nothing you can't get used to.The result is a combo of Standard/Simply Clean and Sensitive brush heads, with few tougher, longer bristles for better reach. I think these might be my go-to brush heads because I realized how much pressure I applied to my gums while I brushed my teeth. I don't know if the decrease of residual post-brushing sensation with these has to do with the ""adaptive"" design or the stiffer, plaque-removing bristles are tougher on your gums.

"From the product description, these gloves seem like replacements for tongs. I disagree for the following reasons:- The product is only 10.5"" long, measured from the tip of the middle finger. Maybe you can withstand heat better, but there isn't enough coverage to protect your arms when handling items directly on the grill for a feeble person like me.- If I'm handling food items with these on, I'd have to take them off to handle plates and such because I don't want the plates to have food and grill residue. Taking these off is much more inconvenient than putting down  a set of tongs.Those being said, these gloves do a great job at protecting your hands from cooking heat. The fingers have added thickness when compared to the palm and top-of-the-hand areas. The gloves can sufficiently replace oven mitts but won't replace tongs. I'd wear these instead of oven mitts AND use the tongs while grilling. Inside, I use them like how I'd use oven mitts.As for the feel of the product, they're made of silicone and feel like super-thick rubber gloves, except without any lining inside.

"This towel is about the size of a regular bath towel. The generous size is nice for soaking up liquid quickly. I use a smaller microfiber towel to dry my hair, and now I have one for my body. This is also good for camping or backpacking when I want more space and less weight.One side of the towel has something like a shallow terrycloth-type loops, and the other size is flat. It is very light, much lighter than a regular towel. Held up to light, it shows some spots that are a bit sparse, like a semi-worn-out towel. However, it still absorbs well. I'm not sure how many washings this can take before becoming too thin.The towel has that staticky/prickly feeling, but it doesn't prickle at all - it's quite soft. The package claims it absorbs up to seven times its weight in water. I haven't verified that claim, but it soaks up well, and easily more absorbent than what I expected. The material is 80% polyester and 20% polyamide.

"This is kind of a cool product which has few elements packed into a very portable size. It's the kind of product you'd take if you must minimize the amount of stuff you need to carry or as a backup.

The flashlight isn't strong but works; if using with a bike, I'd rely on a dedicated light. I love the charger feature. Because this is a speaker, it's much larger than a typical portable charger, but it's always nice to have backup power source when i forget to charge my phone while not at home.Since an online shopper can't see the product, the following is copied from the box which lists additional specs that may or may not be useful to you:- Play Time: 16 hours- Rechargeable lithium-ion battery- USB out with 1.1 A for charging capabilities- Bluetooth profiles: A2DP & AVCRP- Wireless range: 32 feet- Built-in microphone- External controls allow you to adjust volume, change tracks, play/pause & answer calls- IPX 5 dust & water resistantOverall, this is a good-enough speaker with extra features like a power bank and a flashlight.

Since there's no official standard for what 6th or 8th math level is across the country (no, there isn't at the time of this review), only you can assess the appropriateness of this book's level. To me, this seems too easy for typical 6th to 8th graders.The lessons don't cover enough concepts of middle school-level algebra, and the book doesn't have enough problems for practicing. I'd say it's better to use this book as an intro to algebra or as a companion workbook to a student who may struggle with his/her algebra class.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JO7C9I58FSK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1483816648#wasThisHelpful","R2JO7C9I58FSK9","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite not feeling as fluffy, these towels dry very well. They feel a little different from cotton towels; I have trouble describing the sensation accurately, but they feel like they snag or cling but don't, almost like something between static and snaggy, though it's not like they scratch up my hands by any means. The towels wipe up dust and liquid nicely. The golfer in the household took one for cleaning golf clubs at the range.I received the dishtowel-size, which is handily sized at 16"" x 23"".

As much as I don't want to lose the beauty of this book, it's inevitable a movie will grow out of this, with at least a sequel and a prequel.The book deals with heavy themes like illness, death and abandonment, but it's all age-appropriate while capturing the complexity and depth of various themes.

"This review is for the ""Sweater Size,"" which is a small (18"" x 12"" x 8""). You get two in a package. Each bag is lightweight and feels like a softer version of reusable grocery bags made from recycled material. The label says it fits 1 king-size comforter, but I don't see how that's possible because the bag isn't that big. It can hold sheets and a flat blanket, like a bed in a bag, but that's it. A standard pillow won't fit, unless your pillow can be squashed. It's better for storing winter sweaters and such.The bag itself works. It's soft-structured, so if it's not as full, it'll take up less space, though it's easy to fill up. Only one side has the clear plastic panel. I initially thought these bags won't get much use due to the size, but I've thought of other uses beyond sweaters:- When I pack, I like having separate compartments for different items or people. With an extra-large suitcase, I can put both of these bags inside as long as each bag isn't full. For a carry-on sized suitcase, one of these bags will fit inside with a little bit of room to spare.- I can store things in the car, like emergency kits, extra baby-care items, etc...- It's good for toys, especially plush toys.- Basically, I can use these instead of plastic bins for light items.These bags turned out to be more useful than I thought, but before you purchase, please be mindful of the size. Remember: smaller than a standard pillow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXUJWL2RPTEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOEXTK#wasThisHelpful","R2TXUJWL2RPTEL","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a non-handy person, I didn't even know that there were pass-through ratchets. No more struggling with wrenches for long screws and bolts! Keep in mind that you still need the space to turn the ratchet, which is almost 8"" long.The set includes:- 3/8 ratchet and adapter for standard square drive sockets.- SAE: 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16. 3/4, 13/16 and 7/8.

Also, if the sockets are rolling around in storage, I can foresee the size markings coming off because the size markings aren't engraved, so be sure to check them occasionally so you know what sizes they are. If the company wants to improve this set, I would definitely etch the sizes on the sockets.Overall, a clever system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38WKR229X6N5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L8GEPM#wasThisHelpful","R38WKR229X6N5J","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This won't drench your target because it doesn't gush out or spray widely like one might expect from a ""Super Soaker."" However, the water doesn't get used up as quickly as other soakers that drench quickly, which makes sense. It's basically a pump-action sprayer which activates four streams, i.e. the trigger is there for show.Another item for show is the light-up tank with the aid of batteries. I don't know why Nerf invested in this feature because the light doesn't help the sprayer spray better.

Russell signs up for an adventure with his friends, except he gets assigned to a different team than his friends.

"These aren't as thick as a typical canvas tote bag which are heavier. While lighter, these are still thicker and sturdier than those flimsy reusable bags at checkout counters for $1-2 each or given away for free. These aren't very big and are smaller/narrower than a typical grocery paper bag.There's a bit of a ""base"" created by cleaver stitching, measuring at 11"" wide and 4"" deep; when you flatten the bag, the width is 15"". You can still carry a gallon of milk since the bag's cloth material isn't rigid, but the bottom isn't naturally flat. The side seems are stitched and reinforced for extra strength.The straps are about 19"" long and spaced apart 6 1/2"" at the innermost. When picking it up, my forearm does not naturally slip through the straps when the bag is full and heavy, so it's a two-handed operation, though with practice, you can pick it up one-handed.I prefer a bag with a bigger/deeper base for groceries, but these are fine for carrying laptops or tablets. I also appreciate that because these aren't as thick, they fold up nicely for compact storage. As long as you know what the limitations are and don't expect huge bags, these should serve nicely for your toting needs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QI3XQRJK81GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGQAA2U#wasThisHelpful","R3QI3XQRJK81GG","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best thing about this caddy is its ability to fit the corner of the bathtub and a floor-to-ceiling setup due to its height extendable to up to 9'. It also looks elegant and holds a lot of stuff. I'm surprised by how light this is, given all the components.Things I didn't like:- It take s a while to assemble.- The tension can be stronger or designed better. I feel like I need to adjust it every couple of weeks. If not secured strongly or your house has a tendency to ""settle"" due to seismology or geography, it might topple over; maybe if the bottom and top parts had larger corner-looking pieces to ""catch"" the caddy from slipping out, I'd feel more secure.- The shelves only go diagonally. Smaller bottles might need to lean against others, so pack your shelves with forethought.- It's expensive.Really, the ""worst"" part is the feeling of secure installation. Maybe there's a trick I haven't mastered.

It also has info about raising chickens, something I know nothing about nor care for.The story is cute with a lot of heart. For a book with several letters to deceased relatives, it's not a tragic story. The book also lightly touches on race; Sophie is half-white and half-Mexican-American.

"Everything about this system is compact. What you need is an advanced-enough smartphone with a 3.5mm headphone jack, Bluetooth and a way to connect to the internet.The initial setup was a bit challenging, and I needed to consult the manual, like for how to insert the battery in the monitor. After the cumbersome setup which I won't bore you with, the reading seemed accurate with not that much blood. The software/app seems to have some neat features, but I don't take regular measurements throughout the day because I don't have full-blown diabetes - I just want the numbers occasionally. If you are someone who likes to tinker with settings, you'd like this or get annoyed that it doesn't work the way you want it to.It worked with my cellphone, running Android 4.4.2, but I couldn't get this to work with my iPad 3, which is still running iOS 6.##.The default BG unit is set to mmol/L, but it can be switched to mg/dL (my preferred unit) under settings.It took a while to get things going.

Some issues:- My phone sometimes wouldn't recognize the device, but once I rebooted, the app worked.- Once you open a pack of strips and scan it, the countdown toward expiration date (90 days) begins. This won't matter so much to diabetics who must monitor frequently, but I always end up with leftover strips that can't be used. Technically, they're expired, but c'mon. I understand the strips have chemicals and enzymes that degrade over time, but only 90 days? Okay, fine, if these strips are more easily affected by the environments, but you're screwed from day 91. Even with new registration, I couldn't use those ""expired"" strips. It's so wasteful. It's like the food industry throwing away perfectly edible farmed food because the harvest was misshapen or not ""of size."" If these strips do expire quickly upon opening mere 90 days later, it makes me weary about how resilient these strips are in warmer or colder temperatures.The expiration issue really makes this product a 2-star item, but then most diabetics who'd use this would go through those strips within 90 days, so I gave 3 stars.

"This is the third book in the ""Princess Academy"" series. I didn't read the previous two and was turned off by the series' title, but after a recommendation by a precocious teenaged niece, I decided to forego by judging a book by its cover. I'm glad I did because the book is well-written and highlights the strengths of Miri, the protagonist.I was able to follow this book without reading the previous two, but I'm sure you'd get more out of this if you've read the other two. While still stuck in a world where females are second-rate humans when compared to men, female characters are assertive, strong and thoughtful, with real responsibilities. There are deaths, but not written in a descriptively gory manner. Another ""mature"" material is the feeling of having crushes and such.What I didn't realize that Miri has the power to ""quarry-speak"" and communicate via linder/rocks, like other people from her area, so there's a ""magic"" element to this book.

"If you're expecting a history lesson about Ancient Rome, this isn't the book for you. This is a fantasy novel set in Ancient Rome. I don't want to get all religious with with this book review, but I think it's safe to say that people of today don't believe that Roman Gods were real, but it was real to them, including to Julius Caesar who believed to be a descendent of Venus. The author ran with that idea and created a magnificent portrayal of Rome:its riches, the violence, revenge, betrayal, power, family. This is like ""The Gladiator"" with magic and Roman Gods.The story is about Nicolas Calvo who is introduced as a slave working in the mines. He is... oh, forget it. As I try to write a bit about the characters and a general synopsis, I keep deleting because the story is full of twists. The only two certainties are that Nicolas Calvo wants to save Rome, and he loves his sister. It's so exciting, and I feel petty trying to analyze it because it's that good. Okay, it's not the most philosophical book in the world, but really, depths of philosophy and ""art"" are overrated. This is a book. A very entertaining one. If you like bombastic, entertaining gladiator stories, Roman myths, magical objects and apocalyptic tales, read this book. I can smell a movie series developed from this. If I had the power to secure rights to movies, I'd snatch up this story.Warning: It's violent. The violence isn't described in an extended gory manner, but you can feel the deaths and suffering.The book ends on a ""to be continued"" note.

"I didn't expect a book featuring a magical pencil to be this riveting. Maybe that's because Ava, our 12-year-old protagonist, clearly has anxiety-ridden, and all the dramatic life events don't help her anxiety. The magical pencil can't tell EVERYthing. It initially does help Ava gain some confidence, but sometimes knowing the answer creates more questions.The book's writing is engaging and captures the feel of almost adolescence. One of the things the pencil might be useful is what so many girls worry about: if boys like her. So, there's a slight bit of ""mature"" theme. The book also deals with life's other big questions, but not so deep that they get lost to a young reader.Overall, a fun read yet full of anxiety - there's a lot of that, but who wouldn't worry about life in her environment?

"This is a tough book to read on an emotional level because the protagonist (Mark) is a kid with cancer, and no one wants a kid to have cancer. He decides to fulfill pretty much a suicide mission by running away to climb Mr. Rainier without telling his parents while tasking his best friend (Jessie) to keep that secret from everyone else.[SPOILER ALERT]The book is a description of Mark's experience and reflections. They're heartbreaking but also highlights the strengths of human spirit. Each chapter is written from Mark's perspective in first-person perspective, with each chapter followed by ""half"" chapters that Jessie experiences and told from a third-person perspective. By the last few words of the book [BIG SPOILER], this ""memoir"" of Mark is written by Jessie after Mark told her about all his experiences and opinions. Mark does live long enough to reunite with everyone, but the reader doesn't know if Mark lives much longer or beats cancer because Jessie's mission is to write down his story.I like the coverage of this ordeal from both Mark's and Jessie's sides because they provide a broader coverage of Mark's near-death experience.

"I was concerned the book's length of almost 600 pages, but wow... what a wonderful book. It's a story which begins with abandonment and magic, then delves into the lives of children from three different experiences: Nazi Germany, the Great Depression and WW2 from a US perspective. Somehow, these three experiences are held together by a special harmonica, owned by musically inclined childen. Each section is riveting while building toward our protagonists facing life-challenging situations, then ends on cliffhangers.[SPOILER-ISH ALERT]Thankfully, everything ends up okay, and you find that the protagonists all end up together as performers at a concert in NYC. I loved how each story deftly captured the historical elements of the 1930s and 1940s while woven by an enchanting theme.There are more mature materials, like prejudice and abandonment, but they were handled appropriately and understandable by a 7-year-old reader who absolutely loved the book.The task of outlining and organizing this book must've been quite monumental - it's so well-done.

"It's not a terrible game, but its title is misleading. I expected this to be more like ""Dance Dance Revolution"" or ""Just Dance,"" but it's not. Not even close. The movements mostly involve choosing the answer with your hands, such as picking out an alphabet letter which isn't displayed correctly or selecting the word which rhymes, or following the movement direction told by the game, like ""twist"" and ""spin.""I suppose this can be considered a form of kinetic learning of a sort, but that's it. Except some freestyle dance-anyway-you-want segment, there isn't much dancing or dance moves to follow. Kids capable of recognizing letters and words are typically capable of following dance moves, but the dance moves were woefully missing.There were a couple of pluses. You can set up different profiles for different ages, so the level of activity within the same gameplay when played in multiple player mode is tailored to each player's age. Another is a feature which lets the child view himself/herself on the TV screen, which was delightful to the player.As long as you know that this is more of a ""pick the answer with your body"" instead of a true dancing game, it's okay - think of it like a tablet app for preschoolers, except the player maneuvers with his or her body.Also, in case anyone's wondering, you do NOT need another remote controller to play in multi-player mode.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZ2E3LFQTH8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6NGS#wasThisHelpful","RUZ2E3LFQTH8Y","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has a dark story, with many deaths, including the protagonist's parents. So, in a way, a typical story for children! (C'mon, you must recognize how almost all Disney characters lose their parent(s).) Except, because this is a graphic novel, you see the deaths being depicted as drawings, though not in a bloody, gory manner.The story is about Herk (the amphibian Nnewt) who has feeble legs and has to leave his hometown after an invasion by the reptilian Lizzarks. His dad was a magician, and it appears that Herk may have inherited some magical skills. What completely threw me off was from page 80-85 (from the review copy), there's a scene which resembles heaven, i.e. life after death. Sure, many books feature characters that speak from the dead, but this one was really heavy-handed, with Orion portraying the role of a deity. The afterlives of Herk's parents and still-egg siblings meet, feel at peace as if everything's fine after death, then get ""carried to the bosom of the hunter"" - six pages are devoted to this sequence. SIX. Also, Orion is mentioned earlier when Herk's mom tells the departing dad, ""Orion be with you."" And, Orion reappears a couple of more times.That being said, there's a quick lesson in the book about being kind when the amphibian Herk meets a reptilian Turt. This is a world where amphibians and reptiles are enemies, but Turt decides to go against a reptilian ethos and lets the distraught Herk go. Do what's right, even if it's against a set of arbitrary rules of your community.The book has a ""to be continued"" ending. It might've been easier to read as a regular book for the younger kids, but the dark themes combined with images are a bit jarring, so the material might be better suited for older kids. And, this might be just me, but I get annoyed when I see nouns used with deliberately incorrect spelling - calling the newts ""Nnewts"" doesn't add to the story or character development. Also, (while this had no effect on my rating), this comprehensively challenged reader had some trouble keeping the characters straight (as in tracking them) and would've appreciated a glossary - I hope the retail version of the book includes one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27J1PVAJ6LJA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545676479#wasThisHelpful","R27J1PVAJ6LJA7","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, a quick review from a 7-year-old who read the book in two days and absolutely loved it: ""I can only give 5 stars? I'd give 265 million stars!!!"" This book is near the top on her list of favorite books.A page-turner, this riveting story combines Ancient Egypt, dead creatures coming alive, the exciting city of New York, a protagonist with a puzzling illness and a best friend who isn't portrayed like a lame sidekick. The story is told wonderfully, but if the reader doesn't like scary, mystical stuff, this might not be the right book; however, know that that reader would be missing out on a great book and a series!I smell a movie deal, if there isn't one already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EEVX5YA6JL6I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545723388#wasThisHelpful","R2EEVX5YA6JL6I","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very much like the current production of the ""original"" Seventh Generation (SG) wipes, except slightly thicker. Not embossed with designs on the wipes, these are now my favorite wipes because of that extra thickness.As for these being fragrance-free, I don't see any addition of artificial fragrance, but there is a a slight scent to these, probably from the natural scents from the ingredients themselves. Therefore, while the company can claim that the product is fragrance-free, these wipes are not odorless.As for being compostable, I'm not sure if these will be accepted by your composter or municipal compost bin, but if they go in the trash, at least they will disintegrate faster.Because these are slightly thicker, they are more moist than SGs, but not so moist that the wipes are excessively wet. They are slightly more expensive, but by much at all. If you wanted SGs to be more generous with the thickness or wetness, these wipes are the perfect upgrade.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5FRPGWPZ0SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXGQ8C2#wasThisHelpful","R1B5FRPGWPZ0SR","A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JXCOUGYS5Y4J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an inexpensive ""el cheapo"" (i.e. $49 Brinkmann) smoker that I spent over $100 and more hours than I can count turning it into the most fantastic and predictable smoker ever - I'd put it up against the Weber any day. I wanted a good cover for it and after going through a number of cheap vinyl covers from Home Depot etc. that sag and don't fit well - or the ""higher grade"" ones that look great for a few months and then fall apart from the sun, etc., sprang for this one. It's super! A little taller than the smoker so I used a plastic bucket under the top of the smoker to raise it a few inches, but otherwise a great fit. AND, it has held up extremely well to the elements - I'm in central Florida. Well worth spending the few extra bucks for the Ravenna sunblock fabric.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWT428KCXN213/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2VUYMI#wasThisHelpful","RWT428KCXN213","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The rubber part of the band looks good and is easy to trim to length, but it is easy to cut it too short if you're not careful. However, the problem is with the clasp and the way it fits the band. To start with, the band I got was not like the picture. The picture shows a ""nubby"" thicker texture near the ends where it fastens to the watch and a smoother thinner texture where it meets the clasp. Mine was nubby and thicker almost all the way to the clasp. I have small wrists so when I cut it to length I cut off any of the smoother part leaving only the nubby part. I could get it into the two ends of the clasp but the nubby part of the band was too thick to allow the clasp to close easily if at all. In fact I had to push very hard to close it and once I got it closed I couldn't open it with my fingers and had to use pliers to push the two protruding metal pieces together to release the mechanism. (I guess this might be good in that it shows the clasp holds really tightly!) So to fix this I first cut small slices off the textured top of the band to try to allow the clasp to close but I wasn't able to remove enough silicon material to allow the clasp to close easily. I ended up making a fixture for an arbor press to bow the top of the clasp up away from the band...and this worked, but it seems like a lot of trouble to go through. And one other issue. I have a number of mid to high end watches that have bands with this type of closure, and they all work fine. However, the hinge on this clasp has a pin that is too small allowing the two pieces to move side to side. So when closing the clasp, it will land in one of three places: 1) with the left ear overlapping the left metal piece and not latching, 2) the right ear overlapping the right metal piece and not latching, or 3) both ears inside the two metal pieces and the clasp latching. So you have 1 out of 3 chances of it latching when you close it. I'm going to try closing the hinge gap next...","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394OWKXE72C9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EYRL76#wasThisHelpful","R394OWKXE72C9Y","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We recently moved across the country. We and the dogs went by air and our cars, tools, and stuff came by truck. I knew that in the time between when we got there and our stuff would arrive, I'd be rebuilding the closets - taking down, repositioning, and adding shelves, etc. I also knew I'd be assembling some furniture. Since we flew we were weight restricted so I had to choose carefully what tools I brought. I decided that this would be my power screwdriver, nut driver, and drill for all the projects (before my ""real"" tools arrived). GREAT choice!

"I recently bought an Olympus Stylus 1 and then a Sony RX 100 II (due to the shortcomings of the Olympus but that's another story). Unfortunately neither camera has provisions for using filters and I use a polarizing filter relatively often and an ND filter not as often (but will be now considering Sony's 1.8 lens that I want to take advantage of).This is really an elegant solution for the Sony (but doesn't fit on the Olympus). I had serious concerns about fit and aesthetics initially but finally bit the bullet and ordered it. Wow, once the magnetic ring is glued on, you can hardly tell it's there without looking closely - looks great!Functionally, it also works great. The ring itself is only about 0.030"" thick and about 3/16"" wide but is magnetically strong and holds the threaded ring very securely. When mounted, the magnetic ring holds the threaded ring in place very firmly allowing the polarizing filter to turn on its own - just like in a ""real"" mount.Having said all that, the first one I got had damaged threads and wouldn't accept a filter, so I returned it and ordered another which works just fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROC3MHGAIMD7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0OVGPI#wasThisHelpful","ROC3MHGAIMD7R","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Since I wanted a relatively small coffee maker I went back and forth between this one and the Bonavita (at 6 times the price - $150 with glass carafe!) because the Bonavita was apparently smaller according to the dimensions listed (but I didn't like the glass carafe due to the possibility of breakage).First, the dimensions listed for this Brew Station are 13.5"" high x 11"" deep x 7.5"" wide. Well, those are the dimensions of the carton! The dimensions of the device itself are 12"" high x 9"" deep x 6"" wide!! Perfect - looks like it's going to work just fine...and it's smaller than the Bonavita!Second, using it. This makes good coffee although the temperature of a cup of coffee just taken from the maker after brewing is about 165 degrees; after 45 minutes of so after brewing it's about 175 degrees in the ""holding tank"". Both temps aren't has high as I'd like but usable. The coffee itself is very good. I've had no problems with loose fit, leaking, etc. as others have stated. It should be noted however that if a 10-12 cup paper filter is used, the ""swing arm"" that dispenses the water onto the coffee grounds will catch on the paper filter and not move far enough to dispense water into the grounds. Then the ""swing arm"" will dispense the hot water (meant for the grounds) onto the top of the housing under the lid and the water will run down onto the counter top. So the Melita Junior 4-6 cup paper filters (or similar size) must be used to prevent this.For my purposes stated above, this works great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7HD6Z7R481U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Z4RKYU#wasThisHelpful","RQ7HD6Z7R481U","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just ordered a 6 cup coffee maker and thought I'd need these to go with it. And, I figured ""what a deal, they're an 'add-on' product, meaning (or implying) I couldn't get such a deal without buying a $35 item"". Imagine my surprise in going into Target a day after ordering (from Amazon) and seeing the same item for 1/3 the price - and I didn't have to buy a $35 item to get that price!

"Overall impression is of really solid quality & construction. The ball head is really great and the levels, contrary to what I've read elsewhere, are spot on compared to a ""real level"". One of the problems that may have led to negative reviews on the levels is the fluid used is much more viscous than that used in ordinary levels meaning it takes a long time for the bubble to seek its level, so a reading taken before the bubble stops moving (slowly) can lead to incorrect readings.I just got done doing a fairly extensive review and analysis on the stability of 10 tripods including this one. The aluminum Sirui T-005RX was also included.There were two rankings regarding stability: 1) stability of the tripod itself without considering the center column and 2) stability of the fully extended center column as if in gusting wind. The scale was 1-5, 5 being the highest. This Dolica tripod got a 4/4 and the T-005RX got a 4/2 score. As a point of reference a Manfrotto Neotec aluminum tripod got a 5/3 score and a really old Velbon AEF-3 with U-shaped aluminum legs got the highest score - 5/5.This is now my ""go-to"" traveling/field tripod when stability of the center column is important, otherwise I'd choose the lighter & smaller Sirui T-005RX.Hope this helps.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMCZKYU8V0H55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ685M2#wasThisHelpful","RMCZKYU8V0H55","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't own this tripod but just got done doing a fairly extensive review and analysis of 10 tripods. This was not one of them but the T-005RX was. According to the specs, this is essentially the same tripod as the aluminum T-005RX: same leg diameters (small), same height, same folded height, etc., the only difference being the weight. So what it amounts to is you're paying $100 more for this over the aluminum T-005RX to get it in CF with a resultant weight decrease of around a half pound or less. They both have the same C-10X ball head.As added info, two of the rankings I gave were 1) stability of the tripod itself without considering the center column and 2) stability of the fully extended center column as if in gusting wind.

"I got this camera a few days ago so this is a REALLY preliminary look at it with some initial observations which I'll add to as I use it more.First the odd:I use panorama mode fairly often and I was surprised to see the panorama mode in the Stylus 1 is the same as in my old Olympus SP 565 UZ (circa 2008) - antiquated. Many cameras now allow you to select panorama mode, slowly pan the camera and the camera handles all the heavy lifting - it decides when the end of the first scene occurs and the second begins, and stitches them accordingly. The Stylus 1 requires the user to take picture 1, remember where the end point is, pan the camera so there is overlap at this end point, and then take picture 2. Etc. AND it then requires the individual pictures be stitched together off-camera with either the Olympus software or something like Photoshop. Very cumbersome & very old style.With all the interest in HDR, this camera does nothing to address that. I realize Canon has a patent on processing HDR shots in-camera at the pixel level, so I wouldn't immediately expect Olympus to have the equivalent feature. However, for those of us willing to do post processing of images to achieve HDR results, the camera does little if nothing to support this. For good HDR photos, you need at least 3 shots at -2 EV, 0 EV and +2 EV. The Stylus 1 has +/- 3 EV stops which can be manually set but you can only take a max of 3 BRKT shots with +/- 1 EV for each shot. Even my old SP 565 UZ can take 5 BRKT shots albeit at +/- 1 EV. But then you get the 3 shots at +/- 2EV if you discard shots 2 & 4.NO way to use filters! Even the ""magnetic"" two piece filter device won't fit. Sometimes you just need a polarizing filter to eliminate glare, so I guess I'm forced to hand-hold a filter in front of the lens when I need one - cumbersome at best...Now for the good:I took a few casual shots around the house and was blown away with the accuracy of the auto white balance - much better than a lot of my older cameras. And although I haven't done controlled testing, I took some hand held close-up shots at almost full zoom that were really crisp and clear - no noticeable camera shake. My other older cameras can't match this.The constant f2.8 lens is fantastic - big difference from my other cameras, some of which start at f2.8 but go to 4.5 at full zoom. This is a great light gathering tool.Having said what I did above about panorama, the Stylus 1 has an electronic level that can be enabled in the display that gives a visual indication of whether the camera is level or not in two axis. Nice feature and nicely implemented that eliminates the need for carrying a hot-shoe level or the need for levels on the tripod head although you'll still need one on the tripod base to make sure the panning section is level for panorama shooting.Some have said the camera has a cheap plastic feel. I have not found that to be the case and in fact think it has a very solid feel, particularly for a camera this size.Size - for what this camera does, it's really compact and one of the main reasons I bought it. As the saying goes, the best camera is the one you have with you. I won't mind carrying this around but wouldn't think of the RX-10 (often mentioned as a comparable in reviews) as being my ""go-to"" or ""take with me everywhere"" camera as nice as it might be. And at half the price, half the size, and much lighter, the Stylus 1 wins hands down as my ""go everywhere"" camera.So far very pleased.And finally, I can't wait to try out the other features like Wi-Fi, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VF71AELKI0G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZEJ3XG#wasThisHelpful","R2VF71AELKI0G5","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read in the reviews that this Ravelli (with mini-tripod) was comparable to the ""highly regarded and acclaimed"" Opteka tripod.So I ordered this and also ordered a Dolica Premium Traveler 60"" Carbon Fiber Tripod from Costco thinking I could use each for a different purpose. I returned the Ravelli because the case and tripod were covered with mold!Having said that, here are the other major differences:The Dolica is over twice the price ($199 plus tax from Costco)Center column on the Ravelli is metal - it's CF on the DolicaOverall height of the Ravelli is a few inches taller than the Dolica, but the folded length of the Ravelli is over 18""; the Dolica is 16.5""Dolica is about a half pound lighter.Dolica has 3 leg spread angles; Ravelli has 2.Both have legs that fold 180 degrees to allow for compact storage/travel.Locking mechanism for the leg spread is very straight-forward on the Dolica: press the actual metal part and move the leg. On the Ravelli you must press a plastic button which then activates an unseen mechanism which allows the legs to be adjusted.Head on the Dolica is, well, sweet - with three levels. There are no levels on the Ravelli. The Ravelli head is ""gritty"" when panning; the Dolica is nice & smooth.One leg on the Dolica unscrews so it can be used in conjunction with the center post as a mono pod. No such feature on the Ravelli.The Dolica comes with rubber feet AND with spikes that can replace the rubber feet by unscrewing the rubber feet and then screwing in the spikes - a tedious at best practice. And, with only spikes on the ends of the legs, the spikes can sink in as far as China (welcome home). Both of these guys need to solve the spike feet problem.The bag for the Dolica is much nicer.As other reviewers stated, Ravelli should not include the funny miniature tripod and use that cost savings to improve their basic tripod.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJC1O4L2XKIJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RCHX0W#wasThisHelpful","RJC1O4L2XKIJW","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Does what it says at about half the price of the (overpriced) Sony charger. Even though I get about 7-8 hours use from the Sony when fully charged, I often travel and use this during trips to recharge the Sony. I also want the brighter screen which appears on AC power (I know I can just brighten the screen under settings but it's much more convenient to do it this way and doesn't drain the battery). I use the original Sony power supply at my home office and keep this one with me for traveling.Another advantage over the Sony OEM charger, especially for traveling, is this one has a two prong polarized plug with a longer AC cord (as opposed to Sony's short three wire cord with 3-prong plug). This eliminates the need for carrying a three prong to two prong adapter and allows me to carry a two wire extension cord which is much lighter and less bulky than a three wire cord.One thing to note is that even though this has a right angle DC plug, it will NOT properly fit in the external sheet battery charging socket and therefore will NOT charge that battery as a stand-alone device. I didn't ding the rating for this because I never use it that way.And finally I ordered this on December 4th and got it on the 6th!!

"I bought this for measuring the current drawn when charging my various USB charged devices since USB chargers now come labeled ""Samsung"", ""iPad"", ""USB"", etc. and it seems the charger manufacturers interpret the implementation of these differently. For instance one charger I bought that had two ports labeled USB & iPad. I bought it for charging a Motorola RAZR and for charging an iPad but it would charge the iPad in the iPad port but wouldn't charge the Motorola via the USB port - go figure. Anyway this allows me to measure the current to ensure I'm getting maximum charge for my devices and it does that almost okay. It appears to be time-sensitive as to its measurements. For instance when I plug my phone charger in with phone attached it reads .06A. When I unplug the phone charger and plug in my computer charger it also reads .06A. When I unplug the computer charger AND the P3, then plug in the P3 and then plug the computer charger into it the reading is .23A - more like what it should be. I haven't found a good low current plug-able ammeter other than the more rudimentary Belkin, so I can live with this for the occasional times I use it.I didn't buy it for the other features - timer, auto-off, energy savings, etc. so can't comment on them.As to it being a two piece unit, I thought this would be convenient but for what I'm using it for I use it on a power strip so I could have saved $10 and gotten the one piece unit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14A8XMB290ISA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCJA2ZK#wasThisHelpful","R14A8XMB290ISA","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The looks of this watch are easily as nice as shown on the web site or nicer - very sharp in my opinion. It is a larger size watch and I have small wrists but it looks good - not oversized.Furthermore, this model has the Multiband 6 feature - radio controlled (RC) time keeping in Asia, Europe, and the US - beware of other Casio watches (in the $300 price range) that look almost identical but DON'T have this feature. An easy way to tell is with RC timekeeping under the date window ""NO"" and ""YES"" are printed (showing whether an RC signal was received or not); in the non RC version ""ON & ""OFF"" are printed indicating whether the alarm is on or off.This is one of a new generation of watches from Casio which uses 5 motors for hand movement. This is significant in that the hands can move from one position to another independently, i.e. the hour hand doesn't have to wait for the minute hand to make many revolutions until it can move to the next hour position, etc. This has been elegantly utilized in this watch.In the stop watch mode, all hands go to the ""zero"" position very fast (because each hand has its own motor) and when the start button is pushed the second hand makes one revolution every second (for the first 30 seconds), the minute hand makes one revolution in a minute and the hour hand makes one revolution in 60 minutes. There are numerous lap time features and record keeping beyond what I'll use but I'm sure will be useful to many.In the countdown timer mode, the hands go to the ""set time position"" very fast and then begin counting down to zero backwards - looks really cool.After comparing this watch to other world time watches I have, I must conclude that this is a VERY elegant implementation of the various features (timer & stopwatch), but in particular the world time feature. Pushing the mode button (lower left) changes from regular time, to World Time, Stopwatch, Timer, and Alarm - in that order. When in the World Time mode, pulling out the crown allows you to select any of the pre-programmed world time cities and shows the time AND date in that city - not quite instantaneously, but very fast.I can't comment on the many alarms in the watch since I don't use watch alarms anymore because I'm an older guy and don't hear them very well.In summary, this is a very elegant implementation of the many watch features that have previously been implemented via digital technology & displays but now done totally analog.Bottom line is I really like this watch and in comparing it to one of Citizen's latest high-end offerings, I think it is far superior in operation.As for delivery & service - Incredibly great service! This watch was shipped from Japan & Amazon estimated a delivery date between mid to late November. I ordered it on Thursday October17th around noon (around 4:00 PM Friday in Japan). I got an email within hours (around 10:30 PM Japan time) giving all the order details, saying the watch had been ""sent"" via EMS Express, and that I could see tracking info by the next day - Friday my time in Nevada. The email also included instructions on how to get an English language manual from Casio. Sure enough the next day it showed the watch had been given to EMS on Friday at 8:44 PM Japan time. It arrived in Los Angeles on October 20th at 3:33 PM PST/US time...AND SPENT THE NEXT TWO DAYS IN US CUSTOMS!!!*@$. It finally cleared customs and left Southern California on October 22nd at 4:05 PM PST and was processed through the Reno NV USPS sort facility on October 23rd at 7:04 AM. I live about 45 miles outside of Reno so I received the watch the next day - October 24th around 1:30 PM. Excellent service by World Z King & EMS...if only we could teach our US Customs Service about, well, Service.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9SNK3085W8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DFTH16O#wasThisHelpful","R1P9SNK3085W8Z","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this watch. I bought it for its style (and, okay, also a little for its tachymeter function). Having said that, (and it's purely subjective), I don't think it looks as good in real life as the pictures on the web site. And I don't know why. The pictures are accurate, they depict the watch fairly, etc.Operationally, some things are worth noting:There are two sub dials:1) The lower right dial marked from 1-10 and measures elapsed minutes in the chrono mode up to 10 minutes2) The upper left dial which has two shared functions:-2a) In normal timekeeping mode it shows time in a second time zone via the outer ring which is calibrated from 1-24 to show hours in that time zone.-2b) In chrono mode it shows elapsed time up to 4 hours; its inner ring is calibrated from 1-4 with tick marks at 10 minute intervals between the 1-4 hour marks.3) there are two second hands:-3a) one that always moves continuously in one second increments and is linked to the main hour/minute hands display (has a T within a circle), and-3b) another which is the chronograph ""second"" hand. It is always pointed at 12 o'clock until activated by the chronograph function at which time it moves in 1/5 second increments.4) The chronograph uses three separate dials to show elapsed time (up to 4 hours at which point it automatically stops):-4a) the chrono second hand described in 3b above which shows elapsed time in 1/5 seconds up to one minute-4b) the lower right dial which shows elapsed time up to 10 minutes-4c) the upper left dial (which normally shows time in a second time zone) but in the chrono mode shows elapsed time up to 4 hours.In practice it works like this: When the upper right button is pushed to activate the chrono function, the chrono second hand starts moving in 1/5 second increments. At the end of the first minute, the lower right hand moves from zero to 1; at the end of the second minute, the lower right hand moves from 1 to 2. This continues until the lower right dial reaches 10 at which time the upper left dial (which reset to zero from its second time zone setting when the chrono function was activated) moves to its first tick mark - 10 minutes. This process continues until the elapsed time = 4 hours at which time the chrono function stops. To reset the chrono to zero (and restore the second time zone functionality), press the lower right button. This is all a bit convoluted, but, as I see it, this is a ""style"" watch so function can be ""liberalized"" to favor style.To use the fly-back function, start the chrono function as usual with the upper right button. When you want to time a second sequence, you would normally press the upper right button to stop the chrono function, then press the lower right button to reset the chrono, and then press the upper right button to again start the chrono function. But with the fly-back functionality, after pressing the upper right button to start the chrono, simply press the lower right button and upon releasing it, the chrono is stopped, reset to zero, and restarted - all with one press of the lower right (fly-back) button!As to overall operation. The watch seems to work fine. For the few days I've had it, it's within a few seconds of the atomic clock in Boulder. The second time zone (using the upper left dial) works great, the fly-back function works great, the chronograph works great, etc. And the chronograph accumulates time up to 4 hours using the three different dials.I haven't had the band problems with the black edging falling off as mentioned by another reviewer, but the band does scuff easily.Two nits I have:1) One is mentioned by another reviewer: the regular second hand (the one with the T in a circle) doesn't always land on the ""second"" tick marks - sometime it is a little short, sometime a little long, etc. The second hand does make 60 stops per revolution, so overall it's accurate, but it's just an annoyance that a company in the watch business (for many years) can't get the second hand to stop at exactly 1/60 of a revolution and match that up with the printed tick marks.2) The Indiglo feature, which I've seen to be fantastic on other Timex watches, is very pale in this one and is really hard to tell time with when dark.In summary, I like this watch and am keeping it, even though I made a pact with myself a year or so ago to only buy watches with solar charging and radio controlled time...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMLE47RMTEBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053EXKFK#wasThisHelpful","R1VMLE47RMTEBV","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got another version of this watch with the darker leather band, black case with rose gold bezel and white numbers on the tachymeter scale, with red highlights on the two pushers and in some areas of the face, and polished gold highlights on the face. It has most of the features I looked for: solar power, atomic timekeeping, stop watch, and day & date indicator but doesn't have atomic timekeeping in Asia (but I don't go there much anymore) and changing between the time zones in the US and London are a no-brainer - just simply move the dial!. It's a great jeans watch and fits with most of my casual wear. I love that watch for its rich feature set and good casual looks (see my review of AT4006-06X), but it doesn't go well with my more formal attire, so I got this one as well.I love it. It has all the features I wanted as listed above and this one looks really good with certain more subtle color combinations where the other one doesn't look quite as good. This one is more subdued in its styling: no red highlights, no polished gold highlights, it has black lettering on the bezel instead of white, and just a very elegant implementations of the same features.The price is over $100 more, I guess for the ""genuine Alligator Band"", which doesn't mean that much to me, but the looks of this model are worth the extra money (to me).Easily 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5M3U38NEYIDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BSXU30#wasThisHelpful","R5M3U38NEYIDH","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:Really nice design. Black case with gold rim and red highlights in a few places and gold highlights in the dial, white lettering for the tachymeter scale, and the brown leather band with black highlights let this watch work with almost any clothing or color scheme. Nice ""sporting"" look.Radio controlled accuracy (in only two time zones).Eco-Drive solar power - no batteries required!Chronograph - easier to access than previous models due to the ""fingernail indent"" in the crown.TachymeterCONS:Radio controlled in only two time zones; world time requires manually setting if not in the US or London time zones. On the other hand, in the past 15 years, most of my time has been spent in the US time zones...Chronograph function a little hard to access, BUT not as hard as some of the earlier Citizen watches which require pulling the crown out to position 1 and then adjusting. This is because the crown on this watch can be pulled out to position 1 using the fingernails - something that couldn't be done with earlier versions with smooth crowns.A little too sporty to be a ""fine dress watch"", but can work as that.SUMMARY: Super looking and super functioning watch - I love it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ZC7YPDU75M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CB9A1L6#wasThisHelpful","R3ZC7YPDU75M4","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"INTRO/BACKGROUND:We recently upgraded from AT&T DSL internet service (advertised 5 MBPS MAX download speed and 0.250 MBPS upload speed) to cable service with advertised speeds of 30 MBPS download speed and 5 MBPS upload speed. The cable service came with only a wired router but we also needed wireless for one of our offices, so I bought the Securifi Almond - a single band (2.4 GHz) wireless router - to provide access to that office.SETUP:Setup was a breeze. The ""manual"" is the first two pages of a 4  x 4 ¼ multi-lingual booklet. The first page is how to set it up as a router, the second page is how to set it up as a range extender. Both were completely adequate in conjunction with the on-screen help.PERFORMANCE;Download speed measured from the wired router furnished by the cable company (not the Almond) hard-wired to a computer was 40-50 MBPS and upload speed was a bit in excess of 5 MBPS - both better than advertised.  Download speed measured from the Securifi Almond wireless router to a computer with a Wi-Fi connection in the same office as the router was around 40 MBPS and upload speed was a bit in excess of 4 MBPS. Pretty close to the wired connection speed.Our other ""remote"" office is 45 feet away from the Almond router on the same floor and the signal was a bit lower in amplitude coming from the Almond (judging from the ""bars"" of signal strength shown in the lower right corner of the Windows display) so I considered using another Almond device in the Range Extender mode. But on further testing and although I could still maintain a connection, I found that although the signal showed low but acceptable strength with the Almond, the speed had degraded significantly at the greater distance - approx. 2-4 MBPS download and 1.2 MBPS upload on average. So a range extender would only intensify this low data rate signal.I bought a NetGear 1450 dual band wireless router (at almost twice the price) and tried it. At the same distance of 45 feet, the signal was a bit stronger than the Almond, but the data rate for download was 10-20 MBPS and upload was 3-5 MBPS on average. All this in the same 2.4 GHz band that the Almond works on (and the only band it works on). BIG improvement! Then I connected my newer Sony Ultrabook to the 5 GHz band from the NetGear router and got 30-40 MBPS download and 4-5 MBPS upload speeds on average but consistently!! Huge improvement! And of course the Almond only operates on the 2.4 GHz band in N mode, so a comparison couldn't be made. And although the NetGear didn't have a touch screen (or any screen at all), it was also a no-brainer to setup.And the NetGear also has the AC band for future use, and although I have no devices that currently support that yet, it's a nice plus to have.OTHER:Since I now had the NetGear router in play, I thought I'd use the Almond as a repeater for the HP laptop which only had the 2.4 GHz N band, so I hooked it up that way in the ""remote office"". The Almond did provide a stronger signal, and contrary to other reviewers' comments, it did not degrade transfer speeds. But it did not improve them either. And now I'm running only the NetGear 1450 using both bands (2.4 GHz for the older HP and 5 GHz for the newer Sony) and the Almond is just sitting there doing nothing since it doesn't contribute to the system.SUMMARY:For an inexpensive wireless router with quick setup and used with devices very near the router, this is a great piece of gear. If you need to ""push the envelope"" re longer range performance, look elsewhere.ADDENDUM/UPDATE:A week or so after purchase, I got an email ""from the founder"" of Securifi thanking me for the purchase and offering help if needed - I sent back a copy of this review. A day or so later I got a phone call (on Labor Day) from Securifi Tech Support offering to help me get better performance (changing channels, etc.), but we both concluded that the Securifi router is a most basic device and probably wouldn't perform to the levels of the Netgear router I now use. Great customer service & follow-through.During the phone call, I was informed that Securifi is working on an Almond+ that has dual bands (2.4 & 5.0 MHz), the new AC protocol (in addition to G, N, etc.). Should be an interesting piece of gear when released.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQBG0KJQFYEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087NZ31S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQBG0KJQFYEC","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently got a Sony Duo Ultrabook primarily for traveling and which I love, however I do a lot of spreadsheet work and am accustomed to using a ""10 key"" keypad on the right of the full size keyboard I use with my desktop computer. I find typing numbers in from the top row of a keyboard un-intuitive, slow, and  bit clumsy.So I started looking for an external keypad, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking that's not going to work very well since I use the mouse very close to the right side of the Ultrabook. Then I came across this mouse/keypad combo and ordered it on the spot. I just got it and have been using it for the past day and have the following comments in addition to those in other reviews:PROS:Small/slim size - excellent for packing in a briefcase, but not too small/slim for use.Paired flawlessly with the Ultrabook.The mouse pointers/wheel work in the ""calc"" mode, but the number buttons are disabled from inputting to the computer (unless ""send"" is pressed) so no false number presses when using as a mouse only.Key response is good - doesn't require a hard click; not as hard as some have said.A mouse, keypad, AND a calculator - all in one!Thousands separator in ""calc"" mode.Floating or fixed decimal in ""calc"" mode.Carrying case (to protect the finish/display).Left/Right buttons & Scroll wheel work great.CONS:The rectangular shape doesn't allow it to totally fit the hand like a more sculptured mouse - but it works.Not a big con, but no side buttons (but clicking the wheel puts it in ""pan"" mode for moving left to right or up and down).Originally I listed under ""cons"" that it would be nice if a forward slash key would have been included instead of the 00 key, but on further testing, I found that the divide key does enter a forward slash for entering dates as an example.To be fair, this is not quite as comfortable as a traditional full size mouse so I wouldn't want to use it all day in mouse mode if I had a choice, but for occasional use as a mouse and keypad combo, it's really great.From comments from some of the reviewers, it seems they are trying to use this as a keypad in the ""calc"" mode, but the keypad mode has to be selected before it can be used. Also some mentioned the keys are small, and they are. But it's a mouse - the keys can't be ""normal size"".So far, I love this thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHARKYRV5JXTD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QB8YZ6#wasThisHelpful","RHARKYRV5JXTD","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have small wrists so at 46mm case diameter and over a half inch thick this watch is HUGE on my wrist. However, I really like the looks of this watch - the colors of the face and the color of the band go very well together and offset the large size, so I'm happy with it.I like the date feature and tachymeter - interesting implementation of this feature with separate dials.The first one I got was defective in manufacture - the outer markings didn't line up with the tick marks, i.e., the ""60"" at the top of the dial was completely off to the right of the 12 o""clock tick mark (in fact if you look at the picture the ""60"" is a bit to the left of the 12 o'clock mark there as well, but not as bad as the one I got). I returned it and the replacement is where it should be.The only time the main sweep second hand hand hits the tick marks accurately is between the 45 second and 60 second marks; the rest of the time the second hand stops on either side of the marks. But I sort of expect that of what I consider ""fashion watches"".After a month, the time is within a few seconds of the atomic clock in Boulder.Bottom line is I like the looks and it serves well for its purpose so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARC4ANLPBWP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATUHCDO#wasThisHelpful","RARC4ANLPBWP7","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got these a couple of hours ago, so this is a really preliminary report.I've been looking for the ""ultimate"" earphones for some time now. I wanted earphones, not headphones - I have two sets of Bose noise cancelling headphones: over ear and on ear that work great, but they are really bulky for travel.I've tried the Bose earphones and many others. So far, my favorite earphones, which has become my ""gold standard"" is, of all things, a pair of wired earphones that came with a really old iPod player (when they still had 30 GB hard drives). They outperformed the Bose earphones and all the others in terms of bass, treble, and tonal balance.Well, those Apple earphones finally met their match - and then some! These Phiatons are so far the best in terms of sound quality. And they have blue tooth AND noise cancelling - that as far as I can tell in a limited noisy environment, works great.

"I've been looking for a good looking (not clunky/backpacky) ""minimalist"" carrying case for a Sony Duo Ultrabook (8"" x 12 1/5"") I just got that could act as a protective sleeve inside of a regular briefcase and also be used on its own as a carrying case in a business setting.My other criteria:Must be able to fit the computer with the extended life sheet battery pack attachedRoom for a few accessories: USB drive, USB cable, stylus, spare AAAA battery for stylus, business cardsA carrying handle (preferably one that can be hidden)After looking at quite a few and buying a couple to try, I bought this one and I love it.This case does it all with a big plus - a shoulder strap! Okay, so why is that such a big deal? I do a lot of things that require two hands. For instance business lunches in buffets where you have to serve yourself. I don't want to leave my computer at the table while doing this, but I need two hands to serve myself. The small shoulder strap works great. And the rings where the shoulder strap connects are well hidden so they don't detract from the looks of the case when not using the strap. (The shoulder strap can be neatly carried at the bottom of the accessory pouch when not being used).Someone commented on the carrying handle being awkward. The handle is a nylon strap with elastic so that it retracts when not being used - neat feature that adds to the clean looks. It is located on the top back of the case, so when carrying it the case does carry at a slight angle, however I don't find that objectionable - it doesn't hit my leg, etc.CONS:Doesn't hold much more than the computer; you can carry some papers, but if you try to add a couple of file folders, the flap won't ""latch"" to the magnetic closure.Won't easily hold an AC power supply and still close (but with 8-10 hours of battery life, I don't carry a power supply).And finally, compare this case to the Sony case for the Duo that's priced quite a bit higher. On the Sony:No carrying handlesNo shoulder strapNo room for accessoriesCan't fit additional papers/foldersDoes expand to fit the extended life sheet battery packDoes carry the stylus (on the outside of the case)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T52X5F3R1HOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0096PD2VY#wasThisHelpful","R2T52X5F3R1HOD","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got this a few days ago after much research and trying to decide between it and the Lenovo Yoga and couldn't be happier with the choice. I got the extra battery and can go for days between charges (although I'm not a serious gamer and only use it a few hours a day mostly for business) - unlike my HP with less than 1 1/2 hour battery life. I set it up to use my Microsoft presenter/mouse, but with the digitizer stylus and optical sensor, I haven't had to use the mouse yet...and may never have to. And I'm using the stylus much more than I thought.It's amazing how little things make a big difference. With this device, you just take it out of its case or whatever, turn it on and start using it. If you need the keyboard (and I use that less than I expected so far), just pop up the screen. With the Lenovo, you have to first open it, turn it all the way around if you want to use it as a tablet, turn it on, and then use it. Those extra steps are just a pain.Windows 8 does take some getting used to, but I haven't found anything I don't like about it once I figure out how to use the various features. And there is a lack of documentation on how to use the apps, e.g., Note Anywhere - looks like a great product, but learning it is trial & error.Another big plus is the connectivity. I do a lot of PowerPoint presentations, often using clients' projectors...which ""all"" have a VGA connector. With the Duo, I don't have to carry a VGA adapter dongle - just plug it in. Ditto with the full size HDMI port and SD slot.My HP laptop is now my ""desktop computer"" and one of the issues I've been wresting with is how to sync the two since they both run Windows & Microsoft Office. Files can be handled by putting them in the cloud, but email & calendars in Outlook were a problem. After much research (again), I decided to go with Office 365 on both computers (and on my Windows phone which I'll get whenever a good one comes out) - it's working flawlessly so far.Amazingly, this computer is rated at about 3 stars by professional reviewers and a solid 5 stars by users/owners - go figure.More to follow as I get more into it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP5SFT14JOJJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9QFFJA#wasThisHelpful","RP5SFT14JOJJ7","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We use French Roast coffee and mix half regular and half decaf to make a haf-caf bean mix since we both like to drink coffee but can't take the full caffeine load. We also like to grind our own beans just before making coffee. When our Capresso Team (grind & brew) coffee pot with the swing-out grounds basked quit some months ago, we bought a Breville coffee bean grinder and borrowed a Braun coffee maker from a friend and have been using that combo until the Braun quit. We really need our coffee every day, so we made an emergency purchase of a Mr. Coffee for under $20 to use while we looked for our next ""real"" coffee pot. I've always wanted this Hamilton Beach, so I ordered it.Amazingly, it produced coffee that that had a strange chemical taste and was much more bitter than the cheap Mr. Coffee pot (which made really good coffee). I exchanged it and the second one is much better, but not better than the Mr. Coffee.However, I really love the single serve feature because we can make a full 12 cups in the morning in the carafe and before I head off I can use the single serving side to make coffee for me to take in my thermal travel cup without depleting the coffee in the carafe, leaving it for my spouse. This works really well with the Breville grinder because I can set it to grind 2 cups, put the small single serve basket under the spout of the Breville and it dispenses just the right amount of grounds right into the single serve basket. Cleanup of both sides is a breeze.I can't comment on the timed function since we don't use that, but the combo features are great.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RWN7PUNDB7BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004O0AOMQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RWN7PUNDB7BS","A1DH23ZEPK0QDE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DH23ZEPK0QDE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We often walk to nearby restaurants for dinner, crossing a big street on the way. I always worry that a car won't see us, though we take lots of precautions. I decided to get these reflective bands for our kids to wear on our evening walks. This way drivers will notice their little bodies crossing the street. They will also be useful when they're older and aren't always with us.The belt is very adjustable, from very small sizes to larger sizes. It's easy to adjust; the belt slides right through without sticking. It stays in place once adjusted, though. The wristbands attach with Velcro strips. They come in a convenient drawstring storage pouch.These give me a little peace of mind when walking at night with (or without) my kids.

"First of all, I love the feel of these towels. Other microfiber yoga mat towels I've tried have a kind of weird feel to them. It's hard to described. But these feel wonderful. I'd never guess they're microfiber from feeling them. The stitching is excellent, I haven't found any flaws. One corner has a little pocket (kind of like a hooded baby towel) to slip over the corner of your yoga mat to keep it in place.Unfortunately, I haven't done much yoga lately because we're remodeling and we recently moved in. I finally had the chance to test the towel out, and I'm impressed. It really stays put, and doesn't slip and slide under my hands and feet. I really like the included hand towel, too.

"This is an awesome picnic/beach blanket. It's huge. We have 2 kids, one of them a toddler who doesn't stay still, so this is a great feature. It has a pocket at each corner to put weights in to keep it in place. It's thin and lightweight, but durable. It has an attached storage pouch with a drawstring closure. I got the Sea Blue/Charcoal colors, and they're so pretty! I mean, it's an outdoor blanket, but I absolutely love the colors. They have a silky look to them, too.You can just shake the sand off, and it won't stick to it. It's great for picnics, the beach, the field near a playground, etc. We enjoy hiking and picnics, plus an occasional day at the beach, so we'll get a lot of use out of it.

"I've always had a problem with hoarding clothes. I never have enough closet space. I'm determined to get my wardrobe down to what will fit in my closet, once and for all. Thanks to these hangers, I don't have to purge as much as I thought I would. They really do save space. Changing hangers was a great opportunity to purge a little, though.I love the uniform look of having everything on the same hanger (though I ran out & need more!). I also don't have to worry about which hanger to use for certain types of shirts. These work for them all. They have little cutouts for spaghetti straps. The shoulders are curved, so they won't misshapen the shoulders or sleeves. The velvet material keeps slippy shirts from falling off. The box says ""before use, please dip in the water.""

" 1:06 MinsWe watch a lot of cooking shows like Top Chef, so we were excited to try sous vide cooking at home. To test it out, my husband made pork chops. We don't have a food vacuum sealer (yet), so we just used Ziploc bags. They work in a pinch, but vacuum sealed bags would work much better. The flavors would absorb better, plus one of the bags melted a little and leaked.He put butter, thyme, salt, and pepper in the bags with the pork. He let them cook for about 4 hours at 134 degrees, then seared them in a cast iron skillet with a little oil. He served them with a sauce of apples, apple cider vinegar, garlic, hard cider, and Dijon mustard.The pork was cooked evenly through, and not overcooked or tough. Pork chops can be difficult to cook just right without overcooking, so sous vide is a great technique to use with them.Overall, I'm very happy with this sous vide machine. I just have 2 cons: 1) It's kind of hard to clean if anything leaks. Using vacuum sealed bags would probably eliminate this issue, though, so I can't complain too much about this. 2) The instructions are lacking. They're pretty basic, and don't include any kind of recipes or suggestions.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I use my phone a lot, so this is very appealing to me.The top part of the case slides on and off of the main part. There is a little lightning charger at the bottom of the inside of the case. The lightning port of the phone is blocked by the case, and instead there is a micro USB port to charge the case. There are 4 blue indicator lights on the back to indicate the amount of charge remaining on the case. To charge the phone, press the little button on the back of the case. The back of the case is about 1/2 inch thick, and it adds a little weight to the phone. Overall, it's quite slim for a battery case (though this is the first I've tried). It looks sleek. I love the convenience and would definitely recommend it.I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"I love this hoodie. It's the nicest looking hoodie I've seen. It gives a put-together look, rather than a sloppy one. I'd say it runs true-to-size and suggest ordering your normal size. It doesn't run small, it's just a slim-fitting style. I ordered medium (""US S/M(MEDIUM)"") because of the reviews that say it runs small, but I should have stuck with a size small. For reference, I'm a 32DD, 31-inch waist (depending on what I ate, lol), and about 37-inch hips.The jacket is well-made and good quality with attention to detail. It seems like it will last. It can be worn 3 ways, plus the hood can be worn up if it's really cold. I got the red color, and it's a tomato red shade. It's a very nice hoodie and a cute style.

"This cell phone car mount is so convenient and easy to use. It mounts onto the car's air vent easily, just press the clip onto the vents. I can insert my phone with one hand, thanks to the spring mechanism. It holds my iPhone 5s, and it doesn't fall. You can rotate the holder to adjust the angle of your phone.

"This is, in my opinion, the perfect Vindaloo. We've made Vindaloo from scratch, but it's never been quite perfect. We've tried several store-bought Vindaloos, but they all leave something to be desired (some more than others). I'm so glad we found this one. It's exactly what we were looking for. It has a great flavor, with just the right amount of spice. It reminds me of the Vindaloo from Moon Under Water in St Petersburg, Florida. It's been a few years since we had it, but we've missed in since we moved. I cooked it with potatoes and chicken in the pressure cooker, and served it over rice.

"I've always disliked using plastic grocery bags, so I started using reusable grocery bags when they became available. Plastic bags have since been banned from my area, and you have to pay for paper bags. I have a variety of different shapes and sizes, and I really like these bags. They're shorter and wider than most other bags. This means my groceries don't have to be stacked on top of each other in the bag. I've had grocery store employees put a heavy jar on top of a loaf of bread, leaving me with smushed bread. That's just one example. Things like that are a lot less likely in these bags. They're wider, though, so you don't lose the space.They're good quality, made of the standard material used for reusable grocery bags. They seem like they'll be durable. The floral design that says ""be free"" is cute. They're not only great for the grocery store, but also for anywhere else you need to carry stuff - the beach, a playdate, the mall, etc. They'd also be a cute and eco-friendly gift bag that the recipient can reuse over and over.

" 1:57 MinsI'm a huge fan of the Montessori method, so I was excited to get this number board for my son. He's learning to count past 10, so it's perfect timing. Right now, we're using it for that and to help him connect the numbers with the numerical characters.The board has a blank grid on it, and it comes with a removable numbered grid sheet to place on top, if desired. The numbers are on little square pieces of wood, similar to Scrabble tiles. The numbers are aligned on the top, with extra space below, so it's easy to distinguish 66 from 99, for example. The tiles can be stored in the rectangular box that's included. I do wish the box had a lid to keep the tiles in.

"This is a pretty good Bluetooth speaker. I've been spoiled to try many different Bluetooth speakers, including my husband's UE Boom. This isn't in the same playing field as the UE Boom, but it's a decent speaker for the price. The sound is clear with no static. The bass is lacking, though.It was easy to pair with my husband's iPhone 5. Just hold the power button down until it says it's in Bluetooth pairing mode, then pair it from your device. The fast forward and rewind buttons are also the volume buttons. If you press the button briefly, it will fast forward or rewind. If you hold it down, it will adjust the volume. I would prefer the buttons to be separate, because I often accidentally skip to the next song when I'm trying to turn the volume up.The speaker feels somewhat heavy in hand. It has a silicone cover, which offers protection from falls as well as a cool looking design. There is also a little strap with a caribiner, so you can hook it to a backpack, etc.Overall, this is a decent speaker for the price.

"My husband carries his iPad Air around a lot for work, so he wanted a case with a strap to make it more comfortable and easy to hold. This case is perfect for his needs. The leather strap is comfortable and adjustable, and it rotates 360 degrees in 45 degree increments. The leather is very nice and good quality. It also has a little kickstand to prop it up on a table or counter. This is great for showing things to customers, or just watching a movie. The case itself offers great protection from falls and bumps. It has an inner hard polycarbonate cover, a screen protector, and a TPU outer cover. This combination is ideal, in my opinion.

"We like to go hiking, and often pack a little picnic. This pocket blanket is perfect for that - it folds up compactly into the little storage pouch. It's lightweight and has a carabiner to hook it to a backpack. It's also nice for the beach or the park. The material is ripstop polyester, which is ideal for hiking and picnics. If you put it on grass with morning dew, you won't get wet sitting on it. It's also easy to shake sand and dirt off, and it dries quickly. The corners have little weights sewn into them to prevent them from blowing in the wind, as well as loops to tie down with stakes. The blanket is easy to fit back into the storage pouch - no origami necessary. It fits comfortably. The small size makes it convenient to carry in your purse or car just in case.

"These are really nice sheets. They are so soft, they're so nice to sleep on. When I put the pillowcases on our pillows after I pre-washed them, I thought the seam had come out. Then I realized that one side is deliberately open to form a pocket to keep your pillow fully covered. What a fantastic idea! I always hate when the end of my pillow sticks out of the pillowcase. I think all pillowcases should be made like this. This set also comes with 4 pillowcases, so we have enough for all of our pillows (my husband and I each have 2 pillows). In the past, we always had 2 mismatched pillowcases on the extra pillows. The fitted sheet fits on our deep mattress and stays put. I love how soft and silky the sheets feel. They're so much softer than even the high thread count cotton sheets we had. They're definitely wrinkle resistant.

I'd also like to steam veggies in it while chicken is cooking in it. And making homemade bone broth and chicken stock. It can even make risotto! I also plan to try canning homemade jam.

"I was excited to try a drone after all the buzz about them. It's pretty fun. My 4-year-old loves it. It has multiple configurations and different size (optional) wheel options to roll it around on the ground. The larger wheels were easier for us beginners to use. Flying it takes practice. I'd definitely recommend practicing indoors so you don't lose it in a tree. The seller offers an instructional video on how to fly it.It includes a rechargeable battery for the drone, and requires 4 AAA batteries (not included) for the remote.

"These moccasins are good quality and just plain adorable. The soft soles are great for early walkers. The suede looks like good quality and isn't too thin. The fringe detailing is well-done. The yellow suede is more of a mustard yellow, rather than a summery yellow.I'd recommend sizing down. I got the 18-24 month size for my 16 month old so she wouldn't outgrow them quickly, but they're huge. I expected them to be a little big for room to grow, but I think they just run big.

"I really like the way this book is laid out, and the titles of the chapters. It makes it easy to find a topic of interest to read if you don't want to read cover to cover, or if you want to refer back. It starts with a good introduction, and the book is pretty easy to read.I was particularly drawn to the chapter ""Life will be lived all the better if it has no meaning."" I took a weekend personal development course that was based on this principal, so it was really interesting to read about the roots. It never occurred to me that the course was rooted in Philosophy.I'm really enjoying reading this book and learning about Philosophy.

"I really like this diaper. I've been using cloth diapers for 4 years, and I've tried many different kinds. I like pocket diapers because they're so convenient. What I like about these pocket diapers over other pocket diapers is that the opening for the insert is in the front. This means poop doesn't end up inside the pocket when you spray it out.I also really like the double gussets. I find people either love them or hate them, so that's a personal preference thing (as is anything else, really).I use prefolds or flats as inserts with my pocket diapers because I prefer it over microfiber. This diaper does include microfiber inserts, though, and there's nothing wrong with them.The diaper fits my chubby 16-month-old well with plenty of room to grow. She didn't have any leaks. One-size diapers are great because they last from shortly after the newborn stage until potty training.The inner lining is really soft, and I feel good about it being against her skin.

"My husband stopped wearing his wedding ring several months ago when he became afraid of ""finger degloving"" (don't do an image search!!). He finally agreed to wear a silicone ring, so I got this for him. He requested gray so it would look more like a regular wedding ring.He used my ring sizer and determined he needed a size 9. He said this feels tight, though, because it's wider than the ring sizer. The ring sizer sat just in the narrower part of his finger, but this sits on the wider part. Just something to consider if you don't know your size and need to use a ring sizer.Silicone rings are safer for your finger than metal rings, especially if you work with machinery. Accidents can happen to anyone, though. I got nervous about wearing my ring after Jimmy Fallon fell against a counter and injured his finger with his ring.This silicone ring is nice.

"This is a nice cell phone case. It offers good protection against drops. It has 2 layers to the cover: a TPU inner, and a hard outer.

"This is a great learning toy. It's pretty compact, which is great for smaller spaces. The legs fold underneath the table for storage. The drawing board is fully removable.

There is one magnetic dry-erase marker, 6 colored markers, a little magnetic eraser, and a clip (mine is a little bunny). The table has holes for each of the colored markers.There are 2 reasons I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5: 1) Mine was missing the letter Y, and 2) It doesn't stay closed if you pick it up by the handle.

"One of the best movies about mountain-climbing, the film is shot with dizzying technical gusto from a simple but diligent plot. By the end of the journey, the experience almost becomes a horror film as the heroes are defeated one by one by the savage elements. The film tries to blend in some noble and uplifting redemption at the story’s end, but the plot often paints brutal portraits of crushing hopelessness. The film itself is breathtaking in scope, beautifully capturing the expansive atmosphere of the Himalayans in all its magnificent danger, taking full advantage of modern film-making technology.The movie also provides an interesting counterpoint to Krakauer’s acclaimed and popular account of these events, as the film credits the lesser-known memoirs of all the other parties in constructing this narrative.

"Inside Out is great, but something ultimately felt lacking. Blame the high bar for a Pixar film, but while Inside Out does many things well, it never really hits the highest highs of the company’s other masterpieces.By far the best element of the film is its overall design – a strange land inside the mind populated by outlandish characters, mechanisms and buildings which all brilliantly represent the dizzying dynamics of human thought and emotion. Yet something that kept troubling me was the odd physics involved. Sure, this is a brightly-colored kids cartoon, but still the movie kept purposing so much of its actions around defined spaces, rules and machines that did not behave consistently. Likewise, the inside characters are purposefully one-dimensional beings, which makes their antics a bit redundant when their shtick grows stale.While this film has adventure, suspense and comedy, nothing every really becomes so exciting, thrilling or hilarious. The only thing “Inside Out” does go all out on is sympathy, constantly bombarding the viewer with fuzzy melancholy. The scenes border on being manipulative, but are ultimately quite charming and heartfelt vignettes about childhood, family and growing up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VG1IP47CABQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCY46VO#wasThisHelpful","R2VG1IP47CABQI","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This slow, surreal film has some legitimate creepiness to it. There’s some beautiful but simple shots that work wonders with light and geometry. The plot could easily be condensed into half the time, yet its simple execution allows a graceful pace that never really wastes time or drags for much. The last act changes to a more gruesome affair with an excellent surprise. Nothing so distinctly powerful and touching, yet it does most things well enough. Certainly best-suited for a more patient horror aficionado.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHHHWBU0R3X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EVT8KC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHHHWBU0R3X5","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A bad movie can be dumb and dull, but only the worst movies take special care to also insult and offend the viewer too. So this movie’s stale and simple plot also had to mix in some ludicrous decisions, miraculous happenstance, and some seriously misguided sermons on gender politics too. To frame this loud stupidity and cruelty as some allegorical commentary on women’s rights is a true disservice to feminists.Not Horror, but just plain horrible, the film is best classified as a thriller. I don’t know if one prolonged sex-scene and several wretched attempts at black humor would qualify it as either erotic or comedic. The meat of the runtime involves indulging the whimsy of a pair of insufferable girls, who either engage in wanton vandalism or spew moronic nonsense about self-righteous justice. This movie is like babysitting the world’s dumbest and most spoiled brats. The other half of the film involves some of the most emotive acting ever from poor Keanu, though perhaps his alternating fury and sorrow are genuine expressions from having been cast in such a stinker.The film’s logic is uproariously awful. Everything from people’s decisions, motives, outlooks, ideologies, reactions… nothing is real or human. This series of odd/bad choices are then married to a nonstop deluge of magical circumstances to manipulate the story. Keanu plays the anti-John Wick here, a brainless sad sack who somehow stumbles and trips through every opportunity given him.This film feels like it was produced over a weekend by a smarmy teenager. But what else could one expect from a movie starring the director’s wife? Considering how Shyamalan recently dug his career out of the grave with “The Visit,” Eli Roth is now easily the worst filmmaker in the game right now.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEYBNPW2FQFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016D5UG6I#wasThisHelpful","RDEYBNPW2FQFV","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disney is making some horrible movies these days. Outside of their Marvel subdivision, every big-budget blockbuster going back to maybe the first Pirates has been rather bad, or at least severely underwhelming. “Tomorrowland” might be amongst their worst, where its atrociousness sinks even its heretofore flawless director.This film just doesn’t know what to do, who it is, or where to go. Sure, there’s the retro-futuristic production design that’s spiffy to look at. But besides the CG in the background, the story is a total mess. Clooney is barely in this thing and should’ve stayed home, but the two girl leads aren’t much better though. Like its muddling marketing campaign, the film itself is too heavily invested in mystifying the viewer about what is actually happening with zero payoff. But instead of being a pleasant adventure and intriguing mystery, the story is an annoying jumble of confusion. By the time the great curtain is finally lifted, this wannabe fairy tale still can’t really figure things out without pulling strange ridiculousness out of thin air to answer its numerous self-inflicted plot holes.Little kids might not mind the stupidity and gush at the robots and flying cars, though those scenes are few and far between. Everyone else should skip this trip.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25Y0LVL4Q2ZU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y2DPYQ6#wasThisHelpful","R25Y0LVL4Q2ZU2","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a strange mess - a film made about childlike preciousness told with adult cussing and graphic violence. Like a monstrous “Short Circuit” by Tarantino, this film’s wannabe themes of humanity and social injustice want to be deep and inspiring, but ultimately are just stupid and underdeveloped.Now this critique is from someone who actually enjoys Die Antwoord’s songs and antics. But as the centerpiece for this movie, their silly shock ridiculousness does not translate into the proper backbone for a heart-warming tale of a robot learning to love. The entire enterprise is like a parody or bad joke, but its earnest sincerity is woefully misplaced and downright painful to watch.The effects are clean, if not misguided. For while the main robot may move around realistically, its design is not engaging and never asked to do so much. Likewise, the bad robot is a straight rip-off of the ED-209 in from the very similar ""Robocop.""Hollywood often gets rightfully ripped for its lack of originality, but I am stunned that anybody thought this deranged sci-fi gangsta fairy tale was a good idea. Not to mention this guy keeps making the same damn movie over and over again, with the same recycled notions of a sci-fi messiah revolting with class-warfare. This is two strikes in a row now after the less-dreadful ""Elysium.""","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UQLUMRVHYGO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRES1NC#wasThisHelpful","R3UQLUMRVHYGO5","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a masterpiece, one of the best ever made. It’s certainly one of the most fun and thrilling games, with nonstop action/horror throughout its epic story. Its taken everything shooters have ever done and combined them together into one sprawling and beautiful experience. I can see how impatient gamers might abandon the slower introduction. But after the first hour or so, the game just won’t stop in its relentless effort to impress and dazzle the player with the deepest bag of tricks ever used in a single game.Building upon the old games, this latest entry just offers more of everything. There’s 7! different playable protagonists now in the magnum opus campaign, where each have tiny little touches like different weapons, HUD displays, or melee moves. Though they can largely play the same, each has their own weapons and personality to fills out their unique role in the humongous cast, which combine together to stop the latest mutant-zombie outbreak in a globe-trotting adventure. This game surpasses even an “Uncharted” in its amount of vivid scenery and settings – including but not limited to mine carts, graveyards, avalanches,  skyscrapers, motorcycles, jump jets, skyscrapers, tanks, rope bridges, Chinese river boats, East European Castles... and that’s not the half of it. The ingenious design of the multiple heroes permits the story to explore anything and everywhere, covering more ground than any other game I’ve played. I remember people swooning at “Half-Life 2” for the neat little mini-games that would surprisingly appear. So from puzzles to vehicles to weapons, RE6 easily trumps all challengers with the broadest scope of gameplay imaginable, along with its superior graphics and sound.And this game is tense! Others seemed to have knocked this entry for being more action-oriented, and there certainly is a lot of shooting with a high body-count. But the creature design is limitless, where many mutate mid-fight into something bigger and meaner. Again, this game pulls no stops in trying to offer the widest possible pantheon of villains with all sorts of shapes, styles, sizes and tactics. The game is constantly introducing new flavors throughout the journey, always surprising the player with strange new creatures to fight. Several of the best villains are unstoppable nightmares that hound the player into fleeing for their lives.The game offers more replay depth and features than most other games as well. The co-op is second to none with stories built around pairs of characters. Often fighting together, but sometimes apart, with each person different than the rest… This game is thankfully one of the last to still have local split screen, when all other shooters have gleefully abandoned this feature to harass users into playing online only. But the game also happily adds many fun features like horde/survival, the ability to play an enemy creature, infinite powerups, and an epic expanse of player challenges too.RE6 is the ultimate in gaming, something that tries to use everything that’s ever been before, while evolving it to a new level of greatness. No one does sci-fi/horror/action/adventure as well as this game. Or as much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5FJWWPA0SL9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SXLQC#wasThisHelpful","R2E5FJWWPA0SL9","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ridiculously inept title of this film alone should indicate everything you need to know about this clunker, seeing as how the filmmakers do not understand the meaning of the word “Chapter,” nor the value of the number “3.”As this film was subtitled Chapter 3, one would logically expect it to be a continuation of Chapters 1 and 2. So once the movie gets rolling with no connection to the family in parts 1 and 2, I had to Google the film to discover what was happening and why I was watching this thing. So it turns out that this film is actually a prequel, which is not even explained in the film. And by the end, there is still zero connection to the heroes of the first two parts, though a few supporting characters from those films feature in this one. So this movie is sold on a lie, as it’s more akin to a reboot or spin-off, rather than having any major connection to a broader history.Besides that disingenuous labeling, the film is just not very good. There are some okay moments of tension and creepy shots, but overall the film is largely forgettable. The series has had diminishing returns, and the filmmakers’ deficiencies to concoct a decent premise for a third movie extends through their vanilla storyline, stiff characters and weak scares.This movie also has some of the worst and most obnoxious sound mixing I’ve ever heard. To score the cheapest kicks, the mundane volume in the movie is suddenly cranked up to atom-bomb levels of screeching noise to induce their jump scares. The trick is annoying the first few goes, but grows even more annoying when these audio explosions continue to sound false alarms.An overall frustrating experience, this film is barely worth your time. Though I would be remiss if I didn't say at least the film ends with a terrific scare.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29UVNP40KHVOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYTI816#wasThisHelpful","R29UVNP40KHVOD","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shyamalan was LONG overdue for a comeback film. After the solid “Signs,” it’s astounding he was still allowed to even make movies. Not only had every one of his films since been quite bad, they were offensively stupid and pandering. The law of averages indicates he’d eventually make a not-horrible film, and this certainly qualifies.The lower-budget certainly helps rein him in here, though there are still a number of issues in the film. The pair of young children can be odd and unsympathetic characters, often sounding too adult or cerebral. The smaller boy is especially grating with his hackneyed rapping, which makes him neither cool nor adorable. The logic of the circumstances doesn’t quite work either, as there are still some strange holes and forced decisions to explain things by film’s end.But the horror is good. Some have called this film a comedy, and they aren’t so far off in that there are some shockingly strange sights and moments in this film. But there are several great parts in this movie that successfully frighten. Some of these are clever jumps, others are goosebump-inducing weirdness. And this film features arguably the best jump scare of the decade. The director’s eye for camerawork, editing, sound, and timing are all top-notch in creating some strong and memorable scares in a definite cut above the other usual horror fare. The film is certainly miles above the director’s recent abominations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBT9ZBVM33M9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0152AVXUI#wasThisHelpful","R2LBT9ZBVM33M9","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is cookie-cutter filmmaking, a movie remarkably dull and bland in its execution. There is nothing so outrageously bad or offensive, yet nothing exciting or memorable either. It is a prime example of when Hollywood goes to work to manufacture a very safe blockbuster over creating any sort of art.The viewer can feel every whim of the focus-test masses being serviced in one of the most predictable stories ever made. There is hardly a single beat or surprise in either character or plot throughout the film. Despite its promising intro that alludes to a sort of darkly comedic horror film, the rest is completely paint-by-numbers in the simple story of a man saving his family. Of course in these modern times, the hero must be tortured and grim, so an odd backstory is invented that actually toes the lines of darkness and taste in this otherwise family-friendly fare.While the special effects are solid, they are used sparingly and are unoriginal. The film is caught in a conundrum where it wants to gleefully destroy everything, yet must also refrain from showing any actual human casualties to be a sanitized and kid-friendly film. So the entire spectacle is neutered by its PG-13.The average viewer has seen this type of disaster film repeatedly by now, and this one hews to the lower end of the spectrum via its simplicity, blandness and uninspired destruction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU3MTCZF8WDLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YHRMI3O#wasThisHelpful","RU3MTCZF8WDLS","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this movie boasts a few amazing action scenes, the rest of the film is flat and stale. The previous entry in the franchise was astounding and evolved the genre, so this entry is very dull and uninspired by comparison, content to simply rehash old material instead of inventing something new. All the cliches are here: kooky gizmos, femme fatales, globetrotting locales, sleek cars, meddling politicians, triple-crosses, playboy lifestyle, the fate of the world. The story unfolds in a very pat and predictable manner, but also with a stiff clumsiness. Many moments are bluntly explained or conveniently forced in order to advance the thin plot.This franchise has always been on the more playful end in the spectrum of spy thrillers. But this entry often fumbles the tone, as many conversations and moments come off as cartoonishly corny, and not necessarily the cool fun for which it strives. The actual plot is both childishly stupid and unnecessarily convoluted. Unfortunately, the majority of the movie is characters drolly announcing exposition repeatedly at each other. The villains are a real missed opportunity too, as they are first described as the ultimate foil to the team, ""the anti-IMF!"" but are ultimately another bland and forgettable batch of creepy white-guys. Characters will vanish from the film for long spells only to be reinserted suddenly, yet another example of the film's generally poor pacing and plotting. A real kicker is the film having what might be the dullest climax to a big-budget action film in recent memory.But, man, are these action scenes good. While the rest of the film is content with the basics, these few sequences are where all the care and resources were spent for some truly great spectacles. There is a true devotion to thrilling the viewer from Cruise as he engages in a variety of top-notch stunts to rival the best of Buster Keaton or Jackie Chan. The motorcycle chase might be the best ever put on film. All this makes the limp encounter at the end more stunningly dull.The film is ultimately a letdown compared to its far superior predecessor, but it still has its share of great daredevil moments. Four-star action in a two-star story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13PK8I8MZMKRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012XYP82U#wasThisHelpful","R13PK8I8MZMKRY","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even the worst Blumhouse horror movies are savvy enough to hit some level of tolerable watchability despite their low-budget limitations. But this film sets a new low. Featuring a few B-stars, (relatively) large budget and theatrical release, one would assume the end result would be their crowning masterpiece and not the exact opposite. This film is boring, predictable, stupid and not scary. Ultimately it’s just very lazy. It’s as if the filmmakers figured that with this abnormal level of money and talent, they would not need to focus on the heart, logic or story as much as usual.Things unfold in an odd pace. Characters have unusual actions and thoughts. The scares are minimal, bloodless, and happen off-screen. The film is so misguided, several of the rare jolts are unintentionally hilarious. The film is so strangely and poorly constructed that it’s like an inexperienced child’s last-second simulacrum of what a horror movie is supposed to be. It’s a shame that stars Olivia Wilde and Donald Glover are damned to another misfire like this, but maybe they’ll finally learn to read a script for once in their life first. Or have someone with a shred of taste read it for them.This is the front-runner for worst film of the year.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V50BZG9Z9FIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRHRXXS#wasThisHelpful","R3V50BZG9Z9FIZ","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A book this wildly experimental is bound to be polarizing, dividing people into clear camps of love or hate. Personally, as the quality of the book runs the entire spectrum of delight and dismay, it is a 50/50 split on the good and bad, running a full bell curve between the awesome and the awful.No one can fault the book’s ambition with its ground-breaking presentation. Told in a series of nested narratives - a story within a story within a story - the book also relies on a relentless onslaught of typographic abnormalities and oddball formatting. Imagine a series of footnotes upon footnotes to understand the taxing mental gymnastics required to navigate the plot.When it works, the book perfectly blends its dense themes of sanity, family and security into the labyrinthine stories of three people being driven mad by the space-bending physics of a mysterious house. The novel’s strange structure, obsessive notations, and multi-directional text all serve to reinforce both the physical worlds and the heady ideas supporting them, becoming a thoroughly unique experience for readers who enjoy complex philosophy married to a challenging but engaging presentation.But when the book fails, it is an unparalleled disaster. Imagine having to endure a dull textbook that’s been filtered through the drunken ramblings of two different lunatics, each shouting over the other. While it is a story about madness, surviving its slapdash compositions is often arduous and unpleasant, i.e. reading upside-down words in a foreign language. With moments like a 9-page footnote cataloging a list of semi-famous buildings, or an epic index which documents the hundreds of pages the word “again” appears on, there is an oftentimes laughable effort to appear dense and academic, as much of the content becomes dull filler without substance.Its primary plot (and majority of the pages) involve one man describing a movie to the reader. The story proper of the family versus the house is solid, but simple. So while there is an admirable, single-minded pursuit of investigative thoroughness and veracity, the basic premise is somewhat faulty and intrinsically obtuse: The real story is for a viewer not a reader. And while there are deep, branching sections devoted to etymology and symbolism which are the obvious curios of a literary/artistic mind, the corresponding scientific investigations to the phenomenon are lacking, underdeveloped and unrealistic. The book strives to be a rigorous examination of facts and meaning, but the methods of study are not always so intelligent, which undercuts the overall effectiveness of the piece.One’s enjoyment might come down to their feelings on a three-page footnote of an untranslated German poem. This book is more performance-art than prose.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P5E7M3VJLOSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375703764#wasThisHelpful","R3P5E7M3VJLOSU","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like its title suggests, this film is more creepy than scary. With an unorthodox style and pace, the filmmakers subtly manipulate the viewer with an unnerving and off-kilter style. From its odd premise, screwy shots, erratic editing, and strange characters, the atmospheric film creates a solid tension and suspense throughout the proceedings.  There are only a few jump scares interspersed amongst this series of very strange moments and encounters. Not all sequences are effective, where several parts are even a little dull and redundant.

"“Ex Machina” starts with a fine idea for a movie, and slowly slides downhill from there before crashing and burning in a limp finale. While the idea of a man meeting the first AI robot is ripe with potential, the filmmakers are quickly lost in the massive universe of possibilities. The story is a messy soup of half-baked and underplayed themes and notions: individuality, friendship, loyalty, morality, love, sex, wealth, freedom – So many solid ideas are given fleeting or misdirected lip-service in an attempt to thread them all into a cohesive experience. The film often lets emptiness fill its space, where slow, dreamy silences allow the viewer ample time to invent their own meaning. In many ways, this film is spiritually identical to “Under the Skin,” another artsy sci-fi film content to let the abstract and bizarre fill a largely directionless and repetitive plot. While many would hail either film as a hallmark for brilliant and philosophical sci-fi, the more demanding and experienced viewers will not abide the undeveloped simplicity. The depth is minimal, the ideas are stale, and the emperor has no clothes.To its credit, the film still looks great on its sleek production design and minimalist visual effects. The acting is generally okay, though Oscar Isaac’s New York Tony Stark seems woefully out of place. The music is solid, though a rip-off (ode?) of ""Blade Runner’s"" meditative synth. Indeed, much could be learned from that archetype masterpiece, which beautifully blended spacey visuals and sound with visionary ideas. Now that classic was gutsy enough to ask questions about humanity and then answer them too, instead of aimlessly and lazily floating brain farts off into the ether.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KTAV7TA4LB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VWPQNJ4#wasThisHelpful","R20KTAV7TA4LB0","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This author has an interesting style, which may be objectively admirable but is certainly not my cup of tea. Barker relies heavily on poetic gore to propel very familiar plots. While I can credit his stories for avoiding the traditional trappings and clichés of horror - often inventing novel premises for monsters and demons that avoid easy categorization – the stories themselves all fall into the tired formula of: blank hero - wonders what’s going on - monster! – ironic doom. The barrels of gore are not enjoyable either. Even when using semi-literary language, the author constantly relies on the grotesque and the gory for his thrills. Instead of being scared of the unknown in the shadows, the reader gets a bright spotlight shined on a revolting mess instead. It’s a cheap trick that grows tiresome. Also, for a book with only a few stories, two of them are comedic entries, which are unsuccessful in their execution by being neither funny or scary.I highly recommend Mike Miller’s innovative 3VIL series instead, which has short horror fiction that is both smart and intense, minus cheap shock and tired plots.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PHXBTB1V4OMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425165582#wasThisHelpful","R2PHXBTB1V4OMO","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While this new Terminator shares many of the same ideas as the originals – time travel, robot uprising, changing the future, apocalypse, Schwarzenegger – there is one major component that this newest entry completely misses: simplicity. Despite the time-travel premise, the old movies are ridiculously simple and easy to follow. Good guy and bad guy come from future to save/kill a target. That’s it.But this new version completely blows that framework out the window, as the various heroes and villains spend all their time between clashes with long, complicated and stupid explanations of the overblown and nonsensical plot. Now everybody’s not only going back in time but forward too, and triple-crossing each other for no good reason while they’re at it. I’ve read an interview with the writers who openly confess to a variety of obfuscated answers to the story. While they claim to have solutions for some of the logical inconsistencies to be revealed in future installments of this new would-be trilogy, other moments are just vague and not well-constructed.Terminator never needed to be an epic saga of familial loyalties, nor a head-scratching puzzle filled with muddled contradictions and mysteries of time-travel continuity. Once the movie invites the viewer into its tangled web of ideas, then it becomes too easy to invalidate the logic and dismiss the silly story. A slight innovation is connecting the rise of the machines with the modern era of social connectivity. But outside of that, the story tries hard but is ultimately somewhat stupid and lazy. Only the truest fans of the franchise would enjoy even trying to decipher the absurd and cryptic plotting.Certainly the one thing the film does well enough is the action. While never rising above the superior bar of the first films, this movie still delivers amply on a variety of action scenes, while also showcasing a variety of horror-like sequences which recalls the films’ earliest roots. The Terminators are now elevated to levels of superhero power and speed, more akin to the incredible Hulk than the tank-like Robocop.As a fan of the old films, I can round up to 4-stars on its earnest nostalgia from low expectations. But newbies to the series will be less forgiving and find it a forgettable 3-star affair at best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ9R0X0H0Q4AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01013I9DU#wasThisHelpful","RJ9R0X0H0Q4AO","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The film opens with a novel look into the apes’ world, a wordless peak into nascent simian civilization which is far more enjoyable than the boilerplate fistfights and shootouts of the back half of the film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U21VBZDNWSIA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP9G64O#wasThisHelpful","R1U21VBZDNWSIA","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These directors had previously taken a very simple concept - paranormal researchers investigate haunted asylum in ""Grave Encounters"" - and injected some innovative excitement into the proceedings to make a great film. This movie takes another basic premise - alien abduction/invasion in the woods - yet fails to do anything special or interesting with that setup.Given so much room to do something different or engaging, the film moves along under a series of very tired cliches, which just aren't executed very well: bland characters, slow beginning, boring exposition, weak mood, lack of tension, soft and ineffective scares, predictable plot, hidden monsters.The creators clearly were saving all their best stuff, and blew their entire load in the big finale. Granted, there are some good parts in the final minutes of the film, but unfortunately the hour+ leading up to that is as stale and boring as can be.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XELCG714D6YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLI8DQK#wasThisHelpful","R2XELCG714D6YQ","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is really either a high 4-star or low 5-star, because it is so close to absolute greatness, yet has a few frustrating flaws.Being the premier rebooted iteration of the iconic heroine, it's understandable about how some of the gameplay and mechanics are a bit rough around the edges: Her movements occasionally float or don't obey the controller. Difficulty shifts awkwardly. The story moves unevenly in strange climaxes. The puzzles are all a bit on the easy side.But everything else is simply superb: Cool heroine, lush graphics, exciting and varied action, engaging leveling system, variety of villains and challenges, fun weaponry, suspenseful and mysterious mood. The game even mixes in some surprisingly gruesome kills, a small detail which adds to the fun.Certainly this game is something of an ""Uncharted"" knockoff, but then again ""Uncharted"" was actually a ""Tomb Raider"" ripoff, so now the circle is complete. The sequel to this game may well approach the polished perfection of ""Uncharted,"" but this first ""origin"" adventure is plenty great already.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZNOEEAN6J30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FS8LYK#wasThisHelpful","R2PZNOEEAN6J30","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This isn't the first iteration of the dopey detective, but it might be the most forgettable. From ""The Big Lebowski"" to ""The Long Goodbye,"" to I'm sure numerous other literary precedents that I can't instantly recall nor care to, the stoned-out gumshoe has long been a popular subculture of the long-storied hard-boiled detective book. But while those reads are typically lean and mean pulp pieces, this iteration has been funneled through a famously obtuse author to become a bloated 400-page mess of rambling tropes.As is typical of the weaker entries in this kind of genre, all the players have the same smart-alecky quips, cardboard characterizations, one-note roles except for the inevitable double-crosses, while the plot meanders through the tired ruminations intercut with tired conversations. ""Think about mystery by myself, maybe go somewhere, then talk to someone about mystery. Repeat."" You're lucky with the occasional punch to the face or gunshot.The cliches aren't in and of itself bad, but the execution is. The jokes fall flat, the action is tired, the characters are not engaging, the would-be languid imagery and prose is simply basic. Worst of all is that while these mysteries generally thrive on an interesting and engaging plot, this book is literally clueless. But maybe this is all by design as some heady post-modern deconstruction of the genre.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLUDCIRZ5X0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CRQ3H0#wasThisHelpful","R2CLUDCIRZ5X0A","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know a writer's having problems when he writes a barely 200 page ""novel,"" fills it with dozens of chapters less than a page long, yet gives each section a humongous empty header as well so that these paltry ""chapters"" stretch onto a second page. If this ""book"" didn't have a Pulitzer Prize winning author's name on it, it'd be roundly drubbed out of most freshman writing seminars.McCarthy goes to his old familiar wheelhouse of rural despair, minimalist prose, colloquial jargon, absent punctuation and macho ultraviolence to produce what is now a very tired entry in his oeuvre. While his slavering fanbase of pseudo-academics may eat up the newest serving of wannabe Faulkner, any sensible person will tire of the aimless emptiness of this book.Granted, there are tiny bursts of poetry occasionally juxtaposed with gruesome shock that salvage the otherwise lugubrious and meandering episodes of this book. But as is typical of intellectually weak art, the book is so sparse in both detail and depth that only those dying to see any meaning will find any.To readers who only engage in traditional ""literary"" fiction about anguished suburbanites, then indeed this book will feel like a refreshing blast of darkness as they're titillated by its debased incest, rape and murder.

"This heady sci-fi action flick is a lot of fun. While the science can be silly and simplistic, the film still strives for an ambitious answer to what the limits of human evolution hold for mankind. While this sort of subject matter could've been the dry subject of a stiff documentary, instead it is the premise for this insanely wild and kinetic action movie. It is a wonderful mashup of hi/lo ideas, like 2001 meets Spider-man.Any one familiar with director Luc Besson's work, (The Professional, Fifth Element) knows that his films are quite cool, stylish, fun and exciting, and ""Lucy"" is no exception.So besides thrilling action scenes and special effects, the film also has an abundance of playful humor with its outlandish ideas. The film's only fault is some occasionally stiff dialog and exposition to help propel the story forward. But indeed, this action film is even funnier than most modern comedies.Another applicable genre for this movie is ""superhero."" While ""Lucy"" does not specifically adopt a mask and codename to fight crime, it is still a story of a woman who gains super powers. However, the film smartly divests itself from any one specific skill, and instead allows her an infinite amount of power to bend matter, space and time in anyway she can conceive.A final pair of bonus points for the rare blockbuster that features an original story, and a woman hero. Either characteristic is hard enough to find these days, but to have both in one film is a refreshing joy. If you are a fan of smart but fun action filmmaking, it is your civic obligation to support this movie!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROKQY00RR93V7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M25EALG#wasThisHelpful","ROKQY00RR93V7","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brilliant, old-fashioned ghost story has the type of dread and tension that's hard to come by these days. Don't let the PG-13 fool you, this thing gets intense. Sure, there are some very classically slow moments of drama and character, typical of traditionally gothic horror and not for short-attention spans. But when things get going, it doesn't get much more frightening. There's one extended sequence in the film that ranks among the classics in terms of pure terror.Most of the best frights are of the ""walking slowly towards a spooky thing"" variety, but there are still some fantastic jump scares that benefit from having the volume scream from 0 to 100 in a blink. The production design is fantastic too, with lots of great effort put into the house, pictures, landscape toys and ghosts to make everything as creepy as possible.Throw in solid performances, a quality script, good sound and score, nice cinematography, and perhaps the film's only flaw is the sometimes brooding pace. Indeed, this film is a modern masterpiece in the horror genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UTE0GZOHTSY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIGOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UTE0GZOHTSY3","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the best-looking of all the Transformers films and also the dumbest. I thought the second one was bad where Shia Lebouef dies and visits robot heaven. But while that particular moment is still the most incredibly stupid in this entire franchise, this film strings along enough bad parts to make it the worst of the bunch in terms of character and narrative.The FX have improved. Except for one chase through Chicago where they recycled the backgrounds from the last one, everything looks and moves much better in this one than in the past. Bay must've finally listened to his critics as the various robots are now easier to see, with more emotive expressions and distinct coloring. Whereas previous entries looked like a bunch of clones that would battles as giant rolling balls of scrap metal, this one has action that is much easier and more appealing to follow.But the kinetic action visuals are really the only thing this film has going for it. The story is honestly about as clever as an eight-year-old's improv while smashing his toys together: There's a tyrannosaurus who breaths fire too, so he's like a dragon? The new flying dinosaur toy-- er, character isn't a pterodactyl, but it can have 2 heads because that's totally super cool. The bad guy transforms into guns and sports cars or like just his face can be a gun too.This film reeks of being patched together from perhaps 3 different scripts, as there's far too many subplots, settings, side characters and bad guys for it to handle in its already excessive 3-hour runtime. Major characters vanish without meaning, while others are jarringly introduced in the second half. How about if the robots can suddenly use near magical superpowers they never had before, like they can now fly even though they never flew for 4 movies? Let's use the same exact climax as the previous two films where giant ships slowly fly over major cities while destroying them.Of particularly poor taste is the hero's underage teenage daughter and her romance with an adult man. While her sexuality may be modest in comparison to other Bay's past leading ladies, it is still present and rather revolting.The fatal flaw of all these films is the lack of robots. Yet again, the story and screen are carried by boring people, relegating the Transformers to backups in their own movie. There's an especially bad part in the beginning where the camera focuses entirely on the people driving a car through a cheap abandoned warehouse (for the millionth time in the history of action movies) yet the hero and villain robot have a barely visible fistfight in the background. The two brawling robots barely dance into frame like a bad joke. The director focuses on whether the good guys can drive a car any faster from the bad guys' cars, rather than the conflict from the robots' expensive special effects.The fact that ""Mahky-Mahk"" Wahlberg gets to wear glasses while talking about science as a robotics inventor (yet can't shed his trademark Boston accent to play a Texan) speaks to the stupidity of this film. Actually, the part where he picks up a giant robot sword that also shoots lasers, that was definitely sillier and written by an imaginative small boy.So indeed a young child might forgive the stupidity and love the pyrotechnics here. But even the cutting-edge visuals can't salvage the godawful story. While I think Bay's ""Pain and Gain"" is a woefully underrated film, there's no doubt this movie is absolute junk.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NEQ0UL5VV97M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L83TMIE#wasThisHelpful","R3NEQ0UL5VV97M","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This film is very similar to the original, so it'd be stunning for someone to say they like one and not the other. That said, this new movie is another classic.As the first one happily deconstructed cliches involved with buddy-cop, high-school and action-comedy movies, this new version similarly pokes fun at the ideas of college, partying, and sequels. Most sequels fail because the creators simply rehash the same tricks as the first one, particularly comedies. But this movie evolves the first's premise while also lampooning it. The almost cartoonish film (this is from the same directors as The Lego Movie and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) has a plethora of silly jokes, kooky montages, screwball cameos, foul-mouthed language, and zany pratfalls. The action scenes pop with good stunts and FX too. But again, the juiciest fun is simply the killer chemistry between the two leads, who are constantly bouncing jokes off one another in their goofy prattle. At its core, this franchise is about two morons trying to be cool. Be it high school or now college, they continue to fail, and their schtick simply does not get old.Another pleasant surprise is the lack of any big, traditional romantic interest to slog down the plot. Instead of wasting time with some mushy nonsense about true love, the movie focuses on the jokes, while substituting a wacky bromance subplot about how the boys aren't getting along as partners. Again, another clever twist on a tired formula.As an added bonus, this film has perhaps the greatest end-credits sequence of all time. While I still think the perfection of the first movie is unparalleled, this film is still one of the best modern R-rated comedies around the greatest comedy sequel ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNAIBS0UQC9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVLR4OI#wasThisHelpful","RYNAIBS0UQC9C","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Meandering plot, annoying protagonist, corny dialog, weak special effects... the only thing going for this movie is its whimsical set design, but everything else is really, really bad. The worst is how the movie aims to be something deeply and divine - the meaning of the universe! - but cannot formulate any coherent thoughts while spewing out metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. This thing is a bad first draft turned into finished film, the broken and incomplete thoughts of a rambling lunatic. While there are moments intended to be humorous, smart or touching, those parts just come off as weak, stupid and unsympathetic. There is a darkness to this world that's supposed to be ""black comedy"" that is simply just ugly and depressing. Christolph Waltz is a surly, mumbling grouch whom you're supposed to somehow sympathize with and root for, yet only does a great job of making you loath his misanthropic presence throughout the film.I even like the director's recent ""misfires"" like ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" or ""Brothers Grimm."" But this abomination makes either of those look like ""12 Monkeys"" or ""Brazil"" by comparison. If you want to see why a much-loved director with decades of hits and a two-time Oscar winner couldn't get a theatrical release, check out this deranged, illogical and strangely mean movie.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L00XEZRJUA70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGFXUU4#wasThisHelpful","R2L00XEZRJUA70","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For torture/gore enthusiasts only. This film has a horribly bad plot, built upon a wealth of dumb decisions, magical coincidences, and head-scratching illogical inconsistencies. All of these poor tricks are amply used to artificially drag out the weak story and mediocre suspense.Do you think someone wandering into a room with hundreds of fishing hooks dangling from the ceiling is either cool or scary? Do you mind if someone hits a person who has tried to repeatedly murder them over the head with a gun instead of shooting them with it? If you answered yes and no respectively, you might enjoy this movie. I'm very good with the suspension of disbelief, but this film had far too many moments where you leap off the couch screaming, ""Why would they do that when they could do this?"" After all, the magical premise of the film is that a house is invaded by both an insane serial killer AND a cat burglar on the same night.There are a few decent cat-and-mouse scares in the beginning as characters silently pursue each other, but otherwise the film has stupefying turns with a plethora of gore and suffering.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38BGVU7GO2Z5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031U8OEK#wasThisHelpful","R38BGVU7GO2Z5R","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's an undeniably epic sprawl to the game - from its large cast of characters to its galaxy-saving plot. And with various side missions and quests, the game was an immense 70-hour experience.But unfortunately despite so many things to do and explore, all the tasks and combat became redundant and repetitive. The gameplay is a bit stiff by modern standards. And while the game aspires to have this layered and involved story where you get to pick different conversational responses or moral choices, everything ultimately dissolves together where none of the decisions feel like they ever have any actual impact on the outcome.But still, the mythology is deep and graphics are strong. Hardcore sci-fi fans will definitely enjoy the rich dearth of places, races and activities in one of the best realized gaming universes ever.

The author's summary and explanation for each might also be nifty to a true fan intrigued by his process, but really they kinda spoil the plots and ruin the atmosphere.

"These stories were really all over the place (in a great way.) From heavy to light, fantastic sci-fi to quiet naturalism, every entry in here is quite different from the other. There's even slight dashes of artwork and poetry to add to the eclectic fun of the collection.If any one common theme unites the works, it's a shared sense of humor. While maybe a pair of them were completely grim and serious, the rest are all quite light and whimsical. But again, even the humor has a nice spectrum to it. Some moments are big, stupid slapstick, while others have a wry and subtle humor or maybe some dark-black comedy.The standouts were ""Randolph Rudolph the Radioactive Boy,"" a very bittersweet love story with a science-fiction twist, and ""Taking Care of Wiggles,"" a fun romp about a lazy boy tasked with putting a bad dog to sleep. But I enjoyed all the stories here. Several of them were quite short, as these stories are all just long enough to make their point enjoyably without artificially dragging things along to some supposed quota on length.It all reminds me a little of Vonnegut, who blended heartfelt stories and clever plots with altered reality and mischievous jokes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G0AHANBC4UQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2OIMR0#wasThisHelpful","R1G0AHANBC4UQI","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost like a classic 80s horror film, a group of teenagers attend the wrong party. But unlike a cliched setting, this story moves with crazed unpredictability. Certainly things go bad, but no reader can ever guess how.There are a variety of scares in here: from slow-burning dread to bizarre creepiness to big jump frights. The story is not without some other charms too, like some gallows humor, an ear for vapid teenage lingo, or the occasional lush use of imagery. There are some very adult moments too involving sex and violence, which may offend the squeamish.Like other great adventures, the darkness and madness just escalates to an awesome, frenzied finish. The read is a very cinematic experience, with lots of intriguing and dark imagery supporting a madcap narrative. It's hard to classify the type of horror here, as it's a rich blend of demons, ghosts, monsters and/or psychopaths, without ever truly belonging to any one category.

"The advertisements for this movie really missed the mark, as there is so much greatness going on in this film. ""Tom Cruise vs the aliens"" or sci-fi ""Groundhog Day""? Sure, those claims are true, but rather simplistic. There are several other really wonderful things to love about this film:1) Kickass super-heroine - While many lament the absence of women from the modern superhero boom (and rightfully so,) this movie delivers that rare woman warrior. At the start, Tom Cruise is the puny wimp, while Emily Blunt is the fearless leader of Earth's entire army. She swings this ridiculously giant manga-style sword and crushes aliens like nothing. It's simply great and cool to see anybody doing this, but especially a lady.2) Sci-fi D-Day - This movie showcases a classic ""storming of Normandy"" sequence where instead of Americans  attacking Germans, it's power-suited humans airdropping onto the beach to make battle with alien enemies. It's big, epic, loud and thrilling.3) Comedy - This movie's hysterical. The dark humor milks the premise of the repeating/neverending day for all the jokes it can, where things change in novel, unpredictable ways.4) New aliens - Tired of the same old aliens that are humanoid with 4 limbs or look like big bugs? Just as this film offers fresh spins on other tired cliches, the bad guys here are the most distinct and unique creations in sci-fi cinema that I can remember for quite some time.5) Big ideas - This film combines a plethora of heady themes: destiny, heroism, politics, morality, war, choice, etc. where the viewer has many deep things to contemplate while riding the roller coaster plot.Beyond the above, sure the movie has great performances (Bill Paxton's sassy and evangelical sergeant is downright poetic), killer action, majestic SFX, and interesting and intriguing plot.

"Nonsensical plot, insulting misogyny, bad and stale jokes, fake outtakes over the credits... this movie does everything wrong (unless you want Efron's abs.) This is honestly one of the more offensively dumb and poorly conceived films I've ever seen, the easy frontrunner for worst film of 2014.The cruel, stupid, dishonest and wholly predictable plot might be overlooked if it were in any way funny, touching, insightful or interesting. The sole audience for this film would be the strange subsect of humanity who is somehow both an alpha-idiot frat douche yet somehow has a sensitive and misunderstood heart of gold, a strange oxymoron who, like these characters, are kind rapists and responsible drunks. This film was clearly the work of someone who thought he's grown up from his ""deceiving women to sleep with them"" playboy baller days into some sort of cool, romantic playboy baller now. I'll peg the over/under on the writer/director's divorces at 2.5. Oh, this guy also co-produced the vile ""Movie 43"" too? That piece de cinema is 4% on Rotten Tomatoes. 'Nuff said here.The film wants to have it both ways - with a trio of selfish, insensitive cool dudes who are also charming and selfless. By making the females in this film all slobberingly and repeatedly fall for these manipulative jerks is an insult to all women. The film is so psychotically schizophrenic (or plain dumb) that it wants to be both a raunchy gross-out comedy yet tender and sweet romance at the same time, as if it can somehow win over both teenage male dolts and older sensitive women with both poop and poetry.The plot can't even stay consistent: At first all three principals agree to stay single, but later they call it a bet as if there are stakes on the line? Another way to tell the film was conceived by an immature man-child is that these 20-somethings are all anachronistically obsessed with 90s films, as if all the cool kids these days do not care about modern entertainment, but are down with obscure movies from decades ago when they were toddlers. Again much of this could be forgiven if the film was actually funny. But with atrocious running gags, like the umpteenth OMG! because yet another character forgot to lock a door while doing something naughty! - the filmmakers simply recycle the same bad ideas over and over.Further proof of this film's all-time atrociousness is the fake, forced and still unfunny gag reel. The notion of fabricating outtakes is mind-boggling, but the viewer can tell they are unauthentic by seeing these mediocre goofballs struggling to invent absurd ad-libs while breaking the 4th wall.And this Miles Teller guy... I've seen him in several other films he's starred in (21 & Over, Project X) and his ""cool motormouth"" routine has got to go. His grating smugness is some of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen. He's even unpleasant to look at. Unfortunately, this dork must be pure Hollywood royalty to keep falling up, as I saw that he's now in the new Fantastic Four movie. (sigh, shudder, weeps.) I'm sure there's a word in some foreign language that captures the exact opposite of charisma this loser exudes, the strange and particular emotion of ""the complete repulsion and hatred of someone/thing trying to be likable and funny."" I bet the Japanese or Germans know how to properly communicate that feeling of watching Miles Teller be in a movie.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NIV1BUEJ04CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAUFBIG#wasThisHelpful","R1NIV1BUEJ04CW","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This story is a truly amazing and unique read. As this tale is told in a ""first-person plural"" voice, the reader now becomes part of the group of protagonists driving the story. So ""we"" are going on a dark and macabre story, one involving ""us,"" a crew of cutthroats, and ""our"" mysterious quest. This trick really helps to fully immerse the reader in the experience.While the kooky voice could be dismissed as just a gimmick, the other parts are entirely enjoyable too. The story is set in an old-fashioned, Gothic and maritime world, one which offers some very rich dialog and imagery that is fairly distinct and different from most other contemporary tales. The horror ranges from the subtly creepy to the wildest jumps, but is always effective and fun.Overall, the story offers a decidedly different and delightful journey from the usual stuff, and is a must for fans of literary horror. If you enjoy this, I'm sure you'd likewise enjoy the collection from which this story comes, ""3vil,"" and/or the author's similarly trippy 2nd-person thriller, ""Kill Thy Neighbor.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R186EUY2DDUE33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFF1594#wasThisHelpful","R186EUY2DDUE33","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While so many modern games feel compelled to complicate their play with more and more (features, endings, customization, etc.) these two games are wonderfully minimal in their design. These games are like no other. Using only a few buttons and with very little dialog and the the simplest, both games are a majestic hybrid of action platformer and puzzle game. And though they were designed long ago, they still look and sound amazing. (But the movement and play can be a little meh at points.)The second game ""Colossus"" is easily the superior one since it features more refined gameplay and a more polished experience. It is a true, innovative classic in gaming.The first game ""Ico"" can be quite frustrating at times, requiring players to discover new techniques on the fly through the most curious exploration (or cheating with a walkthrough.)Combined together at this price, however, this is a tremendous value for a pair of games that are refreshingly different from everything else and and sublimely cool to play. Both demonstrate the potential of a rare breed in gaming, ones which are creative and artistic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UEF2DYXST65/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0J5FG#wasThisHelpful","R25UEF2DYXST65","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part of the joys of this series is that while it has a rich history and world it keeps building upon, each new entry is easy for beginners too. Every film almost acts like a reboot into a new subgenre of this sci-fi/horror series.For this 4th film, after a stunning shoot-em-up opening replete with Matrix-level effects, carnage and destruction, the meat of the story is a pretty bare-bones tale of survival and escape from a prison during a zombie invasion (pre-Walking Dead,) featuring a smaller cast and scale than some of the other films. But while the setting is more intimate than usual, the effects have not been skimped on, featuring some fantastic creatures and awesome ""boss"" beasts.Jovovich is simply the best action heroine going today bar none, with great intensity and emotion and killer moves.The grand finale is also fantastic in its adventurous mystery, embracing the rich potential of the premise by having another ultimate sequence filled with sci-fi, action and horror as only these movies can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MGRTPTLF1OJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DTXJ4S#wasThisHelpful","R1MGRTPTLF1OJA","A1DWUPXRD1HN1B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DWUPXRD1HN1B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This worked Ok but didn't stick as well as some other types I've tried.The purpose of using kinesiology tape is to improve circulation, support muscles and help heal and prevent muscle injury.Supporting the muscle -- Proper taping improves the muscle's ability to contract even when it's weakened, reduces a feeling of pain and fatigue, and protects the muscle from cramping, over-extension and over-contraction.Removing congestion to the flow of body fluids -- Kinesiology tape improves blood and lymphatic circulation and reduces inflammation and excess chemical buildup in the tissue.Activating the endogenous analgesic system -- ""Endogenous"" refers to something that is self-originating, and calling something ""analgesic"" means that it can relieve pain in a conscious person. So, this requirement means that the tape must facilitate the body's own healing mechanisms, a central focus in chiropractic medicine.Correcting joint problems -- The goal is improving range of motion and adjusting misalignments that result from tightened muscles.I received this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPMXPP33YQ1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012NZWYCG#wasThisHelpful","R1BPMXPP33YQ1R","A3KVIO8QV4MYHE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KVIO8QV4MYHE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this for my daughter who is really into the having a tiny waist thing. My days for that are long gone I'm afraid. LOLThis is made out of a rubberized type fabric on the outside to help you to sweat away the inches. The inside is lined with cotton to help it be a little more comfortable. It isn't very stretchy so try to order the correct size. It has a bunch of clasp hooks to fasten the front. She found that a bit tedious to do.

"I got this as a gift for my Husband who has been starting a bug out kit. I think this will be a perfect addition to that.

This is so much better and cheaper too. The bag itself has a handle for carrying and the inside have packs which are sorted depending on what type of emergency you are having.

"The purpose of using kinesiology tape is to improve circulation, support muscles and help heal and prevent muscle injury.Supporting the muscle -- Proper taping improves the muscle's ability to contract even when it's weakened, reduces a feeling of pain and fatigue, and protects the muscle from cramping, over-extension and over-contraction.Removing congestion to the flow of body fluids - Kinesiology tape improves blood and lymphatic circulation and reduces inflammation and excess chemical buildup in the tissue.Activating the endogenous analgesic system -""Endogenous"" refers to something that is self-originating, and calling something ""analgesic"" means that it can relieve pain in a conscious person. So, this requirement means that the tape must facilitate the body's own healing mechanisms, a central focus in chiropractic medicine.Correcting joint problems - The goal is improving range of motion and adjusting misalignments that result from tightened muscles.The tape itself worked good for me. If your crossing it over on itself don't let that be the end part. The ends should stick to your skin for better adhesion.

"If you are like me then you do not want everyone knowing what you ordered. I am always worried when it comes to ordering adult toys on line. I have young boys and sometimes they check the mail before I do and I do not need them knowing that I ordered an adult toy! This is not the first time that I have ordered from Renee Rick Novelties and just like every time before their toys are shipped very discreetly. You have no need to worry when it comes to ordering this toy!This toy arrived to me in a nice reusable box. There is a pull tab that you pull and the box opens like a drawer. The""drawer"" part of the box slides out and can be pushed back in to close it. The toy is nestled in  foam that is covered in a satin like material. Under the foam is where the charging cord was. I felt like I was going to destroy the box so I was unsure if that was suppose to come out or not, but it is made to do that.I love the fact that this is rechargeable. I don't have to look for batteries. I just plugged it into my computer for a little bit. It did come with some charge so I was able to turn it on right out of the box. The charger goes into a small hole in the bottom. It feels like you really have to push it in hard but it gets easier with use.The toy it self is really nice. I have to actually say it it pretty! The design on the side is so pretty. The silicone is so smooth it feels great against the skin. I can not find anything on the box that states this as being waterproof so I would not use this in the water.  I also only used water based  lube because its not a good to use silicone lube with a silicone toy.This toy has 10 different settings I believe. There is many combinations of speed and vibrations. I know with some toys there is only one spot that vibrates and needs to be powerful enough to be felt through the whole toy. Most of the fail to do so. This one has 2 spots that vibrate. The tip vibrates/ pulsates and the  clit stimulator vibrates/ pulsates. That on top of all the different settings you will be sure to find one that you love.Once I was done, I just used my favorite toy cleaner, made sure it was dry and then stored back in the box that it came in. This toy is great and I am glad that I was able to add it to my collection!

"This has to be one of the coolest items for camping that I have bought. I live in Florida so we can camp year round and my boys love to camp. We also need to be ready for any hurricane that might hit. Knock on wood, we have been really lucky here in the Tampa Bay area. This light can be hung from any tree, in a tent, or in the event of a power outage it can be used safely inside your house.This camping lantern comes with its own rechargeable battery pack. I love that Idea where I can have it charged and ready to go when ever I may need it. When it comes to camping or power outages you may need this a long time and if the battery pack runs low and you have no way to recharge it there is an adapter that come with this so you can use 3 triple A batteries.When it comes to how bright this is. I have a fairly large living room and this puts off enough light to light up my living room. I can say that anyone with in 6 feet of this light would have no problem reading a book with out straining. For the size of it, this really packs a punch!

This was shipped to me in a non script  package so no one will have any clue as to what is inside.Do not let the size of this little guy fool you! This thing can really pack a punch!  This requires little ""watch"" style batteries that is already included. You just need to remove the cap and take on the piece of paper so the connection can be made.  You just push the button and feel the power this thing packs. It is waterproof so that opens up a whole new way to play. I think that every woman needs one of these in her personal collection.

"These are great. My kids love star-wars and these ice molds are a huge hit in my house. We serve drinks in a pitcher at dinner.. I am able to put a death star in them to get the drinks cold. Who is the coolest mom ever with these? I am of course. They work just as described. I tried using just straight tap water It does make the death star a little cloudy because of the air bubbles.

"This dog treat training bag from Vaun Duffy Products is great. The material is really  rugged  and seems to be water resistant. I can't say that it is water proof yet the water that I did poor on it beaded and rolled off of it. The stitching is great on this pouch. There are not loose threads or missed stitches on this bag.This bag can be worn at least 3 different ways. It can be worn as a belt. The strap is super sturdy with a strong plastic clip. You can extend the strap and wear it hanging from your shoulder or cross body if it will fit. I have a large chest so I was not able to wear it comfortably as a cross body. You can also attach this to your belt so it hangs on your hip.The bag has a couple compartments on the outside. I found these perfect to carry my ID and a little bottle of hand sanatizer. The back of the bag has a place to store a roll of poo bags. and has a little dispensing hole.The main part of the training pouch is large enough to put a handful of treats and even a small ball to play with. There is a draw string in the main pouch to hold the items in, if you should drop the pouch or if your pooch is like mine. If I left treats alone for one minute they would be gone. This way I do not have to worry about my Sophie getting them unless I want her to have them.

"If you have hair like mine they advise you not to wash it everyday because it can dry it out. Well I know this sounds odd but I have to put product in my hair that makes it look healthy the first day after I wash it. Then on the 2nd day or 3 days my natural oils start to show up and thats when my hair will look bad I need to do something with it. I was advised to try and make it one week before washing my hair. I just try and do it once a week but that is not always possible because of the way it looks and feels. This dry shampoo actually allows me to  stretch it out between washing. This helps give my hair that fresher look, not the limp oily looking mess I sometimes get. It also smells really nice. It helps when it comes to every day smells catching in your hair.

"These teethers and pacifier clip arrive just as they are pictured. They are gender neutral so if you are unsure of the gender of an expecting mother and you want to get them a shower gift then these would be perfect.  The pastel colors are very vibrant so it is sure to keep the attention of a baby. They are made of silicone so they are dishwasher safe. I like the fact that they are dishwasher safe because a dishwasher is the easiest way to sanitize them.They are textured, so they will feel great against a set of sore gums. You can also put these in the freezer so That will be an added bit of relief from those painful teeth coming in. These are fairly tick silicone so you do not need to worry about your child being able to bite through it and then choking on a piece.  The pacifier clip is really nice. My oldest was the only one that ever used a pacifier and there was nothing worse than being out and about and him dropping it with out me knowing it. Then when it is needed it's gone. Then he would drop it and I had no way to clean it. Pacifier clips eliminate those issues. You are able to clip the pacifier to a part of their clothing  so it wont fall to the ground. This pacifier clip has silicone beads on it. It can also be used to teeth on. It is also made of the same vibrant pastel colors as the teethers.

"If you are worried about how this adult toy will be shipped then you have no need to worry. I have children that check the mail and I do not need them knowing what I ordered. This toy came in a non script Amazon box. I have ordered several toys from this company and they all have showed up this way. No one looking at the box would have any idea what is inside.Fist of all this toy is rechargeable. There is no need to have batteries on hand. I love rechargeable toys. I have a large collection of toys so I can burn through batteries The rabbit vibe is charged in the bottom with a USB plug. It can be charged in the computer or you can plug it into a power brick.The construction of this toy is really nice. There are veins, and bumps on the shaft. The head also looks like a real penis. The rabbit ears tickle the clitoris when it starts to vibrate. There all metal ball bearings in the shaft that spin and give great sensations. The total insert-able lenght of the shaft is almost 5 inches. The rabbit is about 3 inches tall. It is flexible and  will bend away from the shaft. This is great because not all women are built the same.There are 3 buttons to operate this toy. The first is the power button. It turns the toy on and off. The button on the right is the one that controls the speed and of the beads in the shaft and the vibration of the rabbit. There are 6 speeds so you will be sure to find one that you like! The other button controls the direction that the metal beads spin from clockwise to counter clockwise. This is not the quietest toy that I own, but it is not the loudest either.

I have been practicing putting it on and I have to say the first time I put it on, I was really frustrated with it.

It was grey in color and I was really hoping for a ""brighter"" color. It came wrapped in plastic so it was nice and ""clean"" I had read another review that theirs was dusty. I assume from being in the warehouse until shipped. They may have started wrapping these in plastic to stop that issue from happening. This is a large fleece blanket. I think when I have bought other ones like this they have been smaller. This blanket is warm and the stitching on the end is great. There were no loose threats or crooked edges.

"I love this bracelet. There are several colors to choose from and I chose to order it in purple. It showed up in a beautiful light blue box with a light purple ribbon. It comes already, ready to give as a gift. Once I opened the gift box the bracelet was nestled in the box on top of a foam pad. The bracelet comes with 13 charms on it. 6 of the charms are covered in sparkly purple stones. When the light hits the stones they really do reflect the light and cause a beautiful sparkle. Then the rest of the charms are gold. There is a present, crown, heart, a charm that says I love you, a lady bug,  an owl, and finally a golden carriage.  It has a lobster claw clasp and adjustable links that will allow you to have a little control of  the length of the bracelet.Over all this is a great gift to yourself of someone else!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRSY175HNV05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154PMS6Y#wasThisHelpful","R2YRSY175HNV05","A76E96F9STNGN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A76E96F9STNGN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am new to anal play and It was recommended to me by a friend to try out a relaxing lube. I really like this one. It was easy to dispense the correct amount because of the design  of the bottle.  It is also water based so it can be used with any adult toy in your collection. Unlike silicone lubes, that can't be used with silicone toys. This lube did not require a lot of lube. That means this bottle will last me a long time. I also did not need to add more as often as I had to with my old bottle of lube. When it comes to the relaxing aspect of it. This lube did really seem to help a little bit when it comes to relaxing.

"This vest is perfect for someone who loves to run or bike when the sun has set or before it rises. It does take 3 triple A batteries that are not included so you will need some on hand when it arrives if you want to use it right off the bat. This is simple to use and it really is light weight. I was actually surprised at how small it was I thought it would be a large vest but it was not.  You can adjust the straps so it will fit your check perfectly. It was not baggy so there really is no ""wind resistance"" it was not in the way and the lights a really bright.

"I love this shampoo. I have thick curly hair.. I mean really curly hair. With curly hair comes frizz and it looks dry. I already use argan oil as a leave in product so when I seen this shampoo I thought I would give it a shot. This shampoo is all natural and it smells amazing .  You do have to let it sit in the hair roughly 3 minutes before you rinse it out. I just put it in my hair and continue to wash off while it is in my hair. Once I rinsed it out, my hair felt amazing. I am not sure if it really helped but it felt like my hair was easier to brush, that there were less tangles. once my hair was dry I noticed a lot less frizz and it looked less dry. I mean I wont say it made my hair perfect, but it did make a huge difference. It made such a difference that I would recommend it to anyone that wants less frizz and wants to help their dry looking hair!

"I really wanted to add a little color to my hair and I have highlights, but I wanted low lights with out actually having them permanently in my hair because once you go really dark it is hard to undo. These clip in hair extensions allow me the freedom to change up my hair with out it being permanent. You just push outwards on the clip and it pops open, you locate the spot that you want to put them and then click the clip in the opposite direction. You just hide the clips with your natural hair. They are so small and discrete that they should look just like your natural hair but different colors.  I love the fact that it is real hair so I am able to curl it and use my flat iron on them. they come and they are straight  but I have natural curls so I am always using a flat iron in my hair. I sometimes have to touch my hair up at night if  I am going out and I t saves me the hassle of removing the extensions when I have to go over my hair with a flat iron.

"This is the cutest bath toy organizer I have ever seen. The storage body is just over 10 inches tall and the widest part of the body is around 12 inches.This mesh duck organizer will hold a lot of bath toys. My son loves rubber ducks so this is perfect for him to store them in, he can store his baby ducks in the momma duck! The mesh bottom allows water to drain out so there is no chance of toys sitting in nasty left over bath water that runs off them. The mesh bottom, front, and sides allow the toys to air dry. The 2 suction cups on the back are attached so there is no worry of the bag coming off hooks.

"I know that i worry a little bit when it comes to ordering adult toys online. I am worried about how they will be shipped. I have young children that I do not need them to know what I bought online. I have ordered a couple items from this company and each time they toy has shown up in a non script Amazon shipping box. That is perfect because no one has any clue as to what is inside the box.This toy came in a nice reusable box. The toy was nestled inside a nice formed fitting pad that was covered in satin. This toy is rechargeable so there is no need to worry about having batteries on hand. I love rechargeable toys because they seem to eat batteries if  they are not rechargeable. This comes with the USB charging cable. it plugs into a small hole in the back on the toy on the bottom. I have enclosed a picture showing where the plug goes. It is a little hard to get in the first time, but I assure you that is where it goes to charge the toy.Once it is done charging that is when I really looked at how nice this toy was. It is made out of body safe silicone. If you never have felt a silicone toy then you are missing something. They are so smooth and soft feeling with a silky feeling as well. The shaft of the toy is actually hard while the outside of it feels silky. It feels amazing against the skin.  The full lenght of this toy is almost 10 inches in lenght, The insertable lenght is roughly just over 6 inches. This toy really has some girth to it. It is just over 5 inches in circumference at one point of the shaft.The shaft is curved and has raised areas on it so the  circumference can differ just depends on the spot of the shaft that you measure.This toy is Amazing if I have not said that before. There are 3 ways to operate this toy. The first way is just the normal way a toy works. You just turn it on by holding the 10x and the R..S button at the same time. The R..S button is the one that controls the speed/ intensity of the vibration. The 10x button is the one that controls the pulsations. The combination of the 2 buttons give you and endless combination of vibration speeds and salutations.The next option you can choose to use is the music button. The music button is where the toy will vibrate when it hears sounds. It can pulsate to the beat of  music, your partner talking, or even your own moans. The options of sound is endless.  The next option you can choose to use is the touch setting. The touch setting is really neat as well the toy will vibrate when you touch or hold the toy. I did notice that the touch sensors seem to be on the front part of the shaft only. I can lightly touch the shaft and it will start to vibrate.I have had so much fun with this toy, it in now one of my favorites. That says a lot coming from me because I have a very large adult toy collection this toy is just amazing. It is silicone so you will want to make sure that you use water based lube with this because if you use a silicone lube it can cause a reaction between your toy and the lube and ruin your toy. I also advise to use toy cleaner it will help preserve the life of your toy. I would advise anyone to have this bad boy tucked away for a night of fun!

"I have a large collection of adult toys. I would say that I have them in every shape and size. I already had one similar to this one by another company that I have used so much. When I seen this one , I figured that I would love it as much as my other one. I was wrong I like this one so much more. The other one has a clitoris stimulator but its different that this one. My old one just has little nubs this one has a cute little bunny that the ears feel amazing. You can move it so the ears just lightly flutter against the clitoris or actually put the body of the rabbit  right on the clitoris and have an even more intense feeling.This toy is six and a half inches and it packs a punch for its size. The material is very nice feeling and and very flexible. This does require 2 triple A batteries that are not included so you will want to have some on hand when it arrives. You also do not have to worry about the way it shows up in the mail. This product arrived in a non script package so no one would know what was in it. This has several different speeds and that is controlled by turning the bottom, You also turn it off this way as well.

"I have to admit that I did not order these for the same reason that most people ordered them. My son wants to be Michael Myers for Halloween. In the movie he wore a full over alls outfit.  I check into pricing and some of them are way expensive. When I seen these I knew that I just had to give them a shot. They are perfect. The material is heavy duty yet light weight at the same time. I know that sounds odd but it really is.  The stitching on these are great. The seams are perfect and there are no loose threads or missing stitches. Over all the quality of these are comparable to the name brand of Dickie's with out the huge price tag. Once my son  is done wearing them, they will be able to be passed down to my husband so he can wear them to work on our car or anything of that nature he does not want to get his clothes dirty. I have washed and dried these and they hold up well in the washer. I had no issue of the color fading in the wash. My son is chunky he wears a 38 in pants and I got a double xl so they fit him a little big in the waste area but this allows him room to wear clothes under it. I hope that gives you an idea about how they fit. The double xl was not overly large on him. So if your husband is super tall then you might want to order the tall version to make sure there is room for the height!

If that is a concern to you then you have no need to worry when it comes to this seller.

When is reality you have complete control of how much and how little you want to insert. The jelly anal beads are perfect for beginners in the anal area. The beads start out really small  and slowly increase in size. The goal is to slowly work your way up to using all the beads. This is a jelly set so you are not limited to water based lubes. You can use a silicone lube that I find last longer. I just don't get to use silicone lube that often because most of my toys are made of silicone.  There is a nice pull ring that makes it easy to remove. Once you are done they are simple to clean, just use your favorite toy cleaner and you are all set for the next time you want to play.

"I love this lunch tote. It showed up just as I expected. That was the first positive thing I have to say about this company and bag. The next thing that I noticed was how vibrant the colors were of the bag.  The next thing I checked out was the stitching. I have ordered items online and have gotten them and been disappointed in how they were constructed. When it came to this lunch bag I was not disappointed. The seams were straight and the stitches were spaced nicely and were even. There were no loose threads or missing threads. The handles are attached  very well, so there is no fear of them breaking. This bag is a  perfect size to put an ice pack, sandwich, bag of chips, a piece of fruit and a juice with out an issue. There is also a small pocket on the outside to place small items in it. The only down fall of this lunch tote is the fact that it is not insulated but It kept my food cold with just the ice pack.  They also included a really nice stylus for my touch screen phone. I am not sure what a stylus has to do with lunch box , but it was a nice small added gift. Over all I would really recommend this cute bag for anyone looking for a new lunch bag or you could even use it as a make up bag for travel.

"The Neato Botvac D75 is really impressive. From box to first use was a snap. The manual is multi-lingual and basically only has 4 pages with lots of graphics to cover the basics and get your Neato moving. It comes with a comb for cleaning the airways, magnetic tape to use for setting a boundary marker, and a spare filter.I really liked how thoroughly the unit cleans, even on our thickest carpet. It also glides easily over cork. The boundary marker did its job well and is low profile so having it out on a continuous basis is fine. The fact I can schedule an automatic cleaning is a huge plus for our household.The Neato can handle complex maneuvering like going around the feet of furniture,  exercise equipment,  awkward corners without getting stuck or excessive bumping. It can also easily handle going over any cords without issue. The Neato actually goes under whatever furniture it can, which is more thorough than we would normally do on any regular basis.It easily returns to ‘home base’. The only exception was when the unit got stuck, it returned to the spot it got stuck vs. home since it was in a different room and not within the line of sight of the base.The dirt bin is adequate. I recommend checking the bin for sure after using the Neato in an area for the first time. That initial pass can result in a lot of stuff being sucked up.A couple of considerations:1) The unit is louder than I would have expected, but it is a vacuum after all. If it runs while we are watching TV, we have to bump up the volume slightly. The sound can be a bit distracting so keep that in mind when you program the schedule2) The Neato is prone to get stuck if there is a barrier less than an inch high as it tries to go over it and then get trapped. In our situation, we have a chair with a round base that it can get over, but then gets stuck when trying to back up.Overall, the Neato D75 is science fiction made manifest! My wife was skeptical of vacuuming robots and is now longing for a model that can tackle stairs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35J2LZ8FWRKQW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XELDQ8A#wasThisHelpful","R35J2LZ8FWRKQW","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Stanley Classic Vacuum Bottle is iconic with THE essential design to keep liquids hot or cold.The claim that it keeps hot liquids warm for 24 hours is actually under-rated. We boiled some water and then used our grill thermometer probe to take a number of readings. The initial boiling temp was 200 degrees F. Ten hours later it was 166 degrees. A full 24 hours later, the temperature was still an impressive 146 degrees F.  I did not test out the cooling features, since frankly, keeping a liquid cold for that long seems a bit pointless. Most of the time I go camping or see myself using a thermos like this, the question is not how to cool something, but how to keep it hot.Some additional specifics:* The entire thermos is made out of metal, with exception of the stopper, the black rim around the cup, and the handle.* The metal-looking label of 'Stanley' is a cheap sticker. This is a slight turn off, and I do not understand why they did not make it out of a cheap metal so it would look cool and will last the life of the thermos.* The weight is too heavy for backpacking, but for car camping or wherever weight isn't a major concern, it is perfect. You can heat up liquids in the evening or morning and have hot coffee ready for the next day.* The product is made in ChinaOverall a good product. Because of the sticker label, I’m deducting one star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V3DJ8K9XY18J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FZX93K#wasThisHelpful","R2V3DJ8K9XY18J","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Vitasound PAE-200, TV Hearing Helper-Charcoal GrayThe Vitasound PAE-200 is basically a wireless sound extender that is rechargeable. The primary use for me was to listen to my TV while working out 15 feet away and not have to turn up the volume so loud that it disrupted the entire household. For this purpose it worked remarkably well since I'm usually alone when working out.The good* The sound transfer is crisp and clear, even with the noise of a treadmill.* There is a 4-stage volume control built in. It works together with the sound volume of the receiver if you use the headphone output.* No need for a line of sight, it is wireless like your home phone.* No interference with our WiFi network.* The range extends far enough to cover most of my house. This was a surprise, since I went from our basement to the kitchen ~50 feet, and still had a good connection. This was likely due to the fact that the kitchen is above the work area so only 20-30 feet away from the unit.* Any headphone connectors fit. I even tried my cellphone headphones which have a three prong headphone jack for some smartphone controls and they even worked fine. I think you likely could use a Bluetooth dongle as well if you want wireless headphones.* The connector box is very lightweight and contains re-chargeable batteries.The bad* This unit does not allow you to listen to sound normally through the speaker system AND simultaneously through the hearing helper. So if you have two people watching TV, both will need a unit. It’s all or nothing.* There are basically three options to connect this hearing helper. Through the TV directly, through the back of your receiver (if you have the right plugs), or through the headphone jack in the front of the receiver. However, the PAE-200 only come with an RCA stereo jack, so I had to buy two additional pieces to make this work:  o A stereo headphone adapter plug to stick into the headphone output of the receiver  o A 3.5mm stereo male to dual RCA female adaptor to use the RCA connectors* The unit does not come with other options like optic (no cable) or coax.Overall, this unit delivers good sound and is convenient to use. However, I am removing two stars because of the connectivity/set-up difficulties. Ideally, some additional cable options and connector pieces would come with the unit. Even if I chose to use the stereo RCA jacks, I would have to take down my large TV from the wall and completely bypass my surround sound system while requiring everyone else watching the program to listen through the unit too – not really practical.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KW4NY6AMFPDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT50VM#wasThisHelpful","R1KW4NY6AMFPDY","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They do however fold flat (the ear pieces), so you can put them in your backpack if needed and quickly grab them out to put on your head. The cord does indeed not tangle as easily as round cords.They are very stylish with the polish metal on the ear pieces. The set I got has a green accent and wire that is flat. I do like the flat wire, it somehow feels more high tech, is easier to work with, and I think they might hold up better as well.The sound is fantastic for the price. When I play some EDM the bass comes out very well, at the same time, playing an acoustic piece sounds good  as well.  It is much better than the Bose or Sennheiser which excel in mid to high range, but not much in the low range. So if you play a lot of pop music, EDM, rock or watch moves, these will be a better fit then the others I have.Fit is very comfortable on my ears as well as head. Some of the above mentioned headphones like the Sennheiser or Shure, I only can have on my ears for 3 hours before they start hurting. This pair I can have on my ears for hours more. I wish they would come with noise cancelling.Unlike some cheaper brands, these also do not tend to adjust “automatically” the head size when removing them. Once set, they will stay in place. I have some pairs, specifically the Shure and Sennheizer, that whenever I put them on I have to re-adjust.The cord comes with a speaker to connect to your cell. It has a single button to pause or continue a song, pick up the phone and disconnect. I tried it with a Samsung Galaxy 4 and it worked great. The person I called found the sound quality to be good. Not that it matters, but she sounded great too in the headphones.Finally, the manufacturing seems to be very solid. Time will tell, but all the material and connections feel securely put in place.So the biggest knocks on this set are:- No noise cancelling- No volume controlOverall, definitely a pair to get if you do not want to spend too much and you want headphones that have a good bass sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRC1FS9QEFWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVERQKO#wasThisHelpful","R2XRC1FS9QEFWA","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been very happy with other Holmes products, so I looked forward to trying this product.This unit comes fully assembled including the initial HEPA filter. There are four pieces of tape (2 on each side) that easily come off. Simply plug in the unit, and you are set to go! It is fairly lightweight and definitely meant for table or countertop-type surfaces where it can lay flat. In the rooms (at or smaller than the recommended 10x11 max), the unit seemed to work great after a very slight (and not offensive) initial odor when first operating.The manual is very concise and straight-forward. There is a sticker included where you can sign-up for automated email reminders for filter changes. A nice touch for busy families. A quick search on the web for the replacement filter type ‘HAPF30 A’ has the brand name replacements at about $12/filter in a 2-pack or off-brand filters around $6-10/filter.There are 3 speed settings. To me, the lowest speed setting IS quiet enough to have on an office desk and not worry about the background noise being picked up by my headset during conference calls. For the brief period of time I used the ionizing feature, I did not notice a significant difference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HDYWW02NPM58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DK35B#wasThisHelpful","R2HDYWW02NPM58","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The PNY Elite Performance 64GB SD card works like a charm. I used it in my Canon S100, DSLR D60 and G7X. None of these camera felt like they slowed down in rapid shooting mode in comparison to the Extreme versions of some other brands. Downloading on the computer went very fast and without a glitch. Windows 7 installed the driver quickly.The only comment I have, which is not related to this product, is the size of the card. This card is really for the video enthusiast, and likely the 4K kind. The battery of each of the camera's mentioned is empty between 300-500 pictures. Let's say a picture is on average ~4-8MB, that makes at best 1-2GB in picture a battery. Video (HD) 1080p (60 frames/Sec) will still require several battery changes. According to their own calculation, I will require 50-75 battery changes for pictures.One alternative use for this card I was thinking about is to use it as a cheap backup. I have been using portable hard drives, but the solid state may be of use for some people. Just if using it as a backup, I would get two for redundancy. Per MB tough, the SD card is still vastly more expensive then a portable 1.5 TB hard drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C1JWHHPV7LUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWBCSG4#wasThisHelpful","R2C1JWHHPV7LUS","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At some point in life most people want to throw an ax, knife or ninja star, and these SOG Specialty Knives & Tools TH1001-CP Throwing Tomahawks fit that craving. I don’t know if there are leagues or sport events where you can throw these things competitively, but this is my experience as an eager amateur:About the items:1) The package comes with three axes (not 2 as the description says), and a single sleeve that holds them all.2) The single sleeve has a top section to hold the head and three Velcro straps going down a spine the top one is the smallest strap and the last one is the biggest. At first I tried to loop all three axes through the three straps, but it seems that the first Velcro strap is meant for ax 1, the second for ax 1 and 2 and the third one for Axe 1, 2 and 3. This provides extra safety when removing the axes, since they won’t all just come out, each one requires special attention.3) The blades of the axes are very sharp but were much smaller than expected. I know they say 2 inches, but 2 inches is really small. Maybe they can be considered more like a “mini” Tomahawk.4) Balance is great, and the quality of the steel and handle is superb. It feels great holding them and playing with them.5) There were no instructions or recommendations that came along in the package, with the exception to wear goggles.These are NOT a toy, but very sharp pieces of metal that can easily wound someone.After examining the Tomahawks, my wife, friend and I tried them out on different materials.1) The Tomahawks are very light to throw, so you can keep throwing them for a very long time before feeling fatigued.2) They spin great when throwing and are heavy enough to make a good impact. Ok, very subjective, but they are really super fun to throw and seemed to stay well on track.3) The braided grip is nice to hold and prevents any slippage.4) For target materials, I used a plywood board, a tree trunk, a rotten tree trunk and a large wooden box. From a distance roughly 40 feet away:  a. The plywood board broke in two after a few impacts, but the ax never “stuck” to it  b. The ax bounced off the tree trunk.  c. The rotten tree trunk had one ax get stuck in it, but the second impact made it explode with little ants flying everywhere who had made their home in it.  d. The large carton boxes worked great, although I throw one ax straight through it5) Recovering the axes after throwing was a bit difficult in lower light or in vegetation, since they are black. A bright yellow or orange stripe might have been better. I might do this myself with some duct tape.Bottom line, they are great fun, and we had a good time throwing them. Even my wife who was at first reluctant “to throw these dangerous things” got into the spirit. What is important though is finding a good target to throw them into. I think one of those plastic arrow targets might be perfect. Carton boxes or Styrofoam  are too light and wood is too dense to get the ax into it. Perhaps that will come with practice, but even just cleaving wood with it was near impossible. Because of the lack of instructions and the difficulty to find them (all black), I am removing one star of an otherwise fantastic grown-up toy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36BK1HJLXRORG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1I7F54#wasThisHelpful","R36BK1HJLXRORG","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Klymit Inertia pad is in essence a very thin air mattress. Where it starts deviating from a regular pad is that it has hole / pockets everywhere throughout its structure. These pockets allow your sleeping bag to compress less since it fills naturally up the holes and your body hovers over those sleeping bag pockets. Now in theory that sounds all good, but there are a few concerns I have with this mattress. Currently I own two other air pads, a Thermarest Basecamp and a Thermarest NeoAir.A bit of a technical comparison:- Thickness: the Basecamp is 2 inch thick, the NeoAir 3, and the Intertia 1.75 on the main body parts, but the pillow is more like 2-3 inches.- Width: both Thermarest pads are 1.5 inch narrower, but the 1.5 inch does not really give you much more since the Klymite is slightly curved upwards on the sides- Length: They all are 72 inches, but the main difference is that the Inertia has a billow build in at the end.- The Basecamp is 41 Oz, very heavy to log around, the NeoAir 24 Oz, the Inertia 12.5 and by far the lightest. This surprised me, since I thought beating the NeoAir would have been very difficult.- Insulation rating, the Basecamp has a 5 R-Rating, the NeoAir a 2.2 rating, and the Intertia is not rated. It claims that it is as warm as the sleeping bag you use it with. This creates some interesting questions on how to use it.- Material: The blue top of the Intertia is rip stop fabric and the bottom is some strong gray nylon. The seams are very well constructed so I think my only concern would be a leak from a puncture. It is also very easy to clean which I had to do after I dropped by accident a bit of fruit on it.Comfort/use- Inflating: The Inertia has two separate inflatable compartments, the main body and the pillow. The pillow takes 2 good blows as it is a bit ticker, while the main body takes 4 good longue full’s of air, so it really inflates fast. The basecamp is a self inflatable kind, but I always tend to have to blow some extra air in. The NeoAir takes a lot of air to fully fill and I sometimes have to rest half way. What is also very well designed is the end cap. The Inertia allows you to temporary push it down to hold air in, and then twist it to lock it. That is a very nice touch. One point of interest, the sides kind of curl up, the picture shows it straight, but the real blown up pad has the sides curved where you would have your knees and/or lower back. This makes it a slightly easier to put it in your sleeping bag, but I am not sure how functional it is.- The pillow fully blown up was not as comfortable as with a little bit of air out of it. The reason is that there is actually 4 parts to the pillow which cradles your head. The lower part, for me at least, fully inflated caused some neck cramping. That said, I finally do not need to have a bunch of clothing stuffed in a bag to have a makeshift pillow and this is maybe one of the best features.- Sleep: I tried both sleeping on my back and sideways. Some people were stating that sleeping sideways was out of the question, and I don’t really have that same experience, perhaps because I like a hard mattress. The pillow adjusts perfectly, and my hip fit also great into one of the pockets to have a comfortable rest. Note: I did not fully inflate the pillow- Sound when moving: A lot of these air mattresses can make a lot of noise. The Inertia is actually fairly noiseless in comparison to the NeoAir which crinkles like a paper bag every time you just move. The Basecamp is the best for this as it makes no noise at all.- Packing:  Sometimes it is a serious effort to pack one of these pads after it has been setup. The Inertia took me a minute, it deflates very quickly and easily rolls up. After I used the pad, the re-packaged pad is slightly larger than a can of pop.- Putting your sleeping pad in the sleeping bag is a very unique idea, but it makes your sleeping bag rest on the ground, or the fixed foam pad in winter.  Without the weather turning to freezing again, I simply cannot rate this for insulation. The system is just too unique. For sleeping in the summer I use the pad as an outside barrier, it at least means you do not have the entire sleeping bag touch the ground. The pad is comfortable, but a sleeping bag is softer and can be washed. I just do not like the idea of sticking it inside my sleeping bag and not being able to eventually throw it in wash machine.Overall, I like the pad, but I am not sure how well it will do in winter. For summer and moderate temperature camping I give this a 5 star, but eventually I might reduce it depending on my winter camping experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQFJNURRCEIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","RNQFJNURRCEIU","A2M9ME0N2S3R39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2M9ME0N2S3R39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two Keurig type brewers and a regular 12-cup coffee maker. I like the idea of a personal cup-at-a-time coffee brewer, but the Keurig pods are pricey and really, a 10-ounce cup of coffee is pretty small. If you want to brew something for the road, you're waiting around through two pod cycles.This Hamilton Beach brews up to 14 ounces, and can be set to a regular or bold brew. I like my coffee strong so I fill up the scoop and set it to bold. Makes a perfect hot mug every time. Any of the flavors you find in the k-cups can be found in bags. I find that 14 ounces is the perfect amount for a travel mug to allow enough room for creamer. Has a built in stand that's easy to switch between a coffee cup or a travel mug. Real stainless front and sides makes clean-up easy. A little catch tray at the bottom ensures no coffee ends up on your counter. And the water tank has a wide opening so you're not dribbling half the water down the side of the machine while pouring water. There's a scoop with a screen bottom as well as a secondary screen, that ensures you don't end up with grounds in your cup. No extra filters needed. Use it to brew hot water for tea or other hot drinks. Small countertop footprint - which works really well in my small kitchen. The working parts all slide out for super easy cleaning. After one week of daily use, I'm a happy customer. Will update if anything changes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPISZ1QA7ZX6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EI7DPS0#wasThisHelpful","RPISZ1QA7ZX6F","A1VYJUUE1MEG46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYJUUE1MEG46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Purchased this set after exhaustive research. Went to a bunch of stores to price luggage. These individual pieces were available from a major retailer for about $250 together. Checked other online vendors. Amazon's price was significantly lower at about $114. Looked at a bunch of other styles and brands of luggage. This set comes with a 10-year warranty. The spinner wheels are amazing and look like they will hold up well. Handles all seem sturdy, with no problems extending and retracting. Soft side handles are well sewn. Zippers all close and open easily with no catching. I'll be testing this out on a 6 hour flight across country where I'll have to change planes.  If I encounter any problems, I'll post a follow-up.One caveat - the color in the picture looks like lavendar. It's actually a deep plum color, which is fine. I just wanted something that would stand out when my bags come thru the gate. And the darker color won't show dirt as much.Some reviewers reported strong chemical smells.

"Love this bed! With an 850 pound capacity, it is very sturdy and well made. Massage feature is basically just vibrator motors, kind of like the ""magic fingers"" beds that used to be in motels. It's nice if you're someone who needs to be ""patted"" to sleep, like a baby. Shuts off automatically after about 20 minutes. The adjustable motor is very quiet. Head and foot are completely adjustable so you can make it as comfortable as you need. I have a 10-inch Lucid memory foam mattress, which is very firm, that I bought on Amazon 3 years ago for under $300. Same price today, and it works really well with this adjustable base.Warnings: It comes flat in a huge box. When the bed arrived, there was a fist size hole in the box and there were only two straps and some tape holding it together. At first I was concerned because there was no styrofoam or packing material to absorb bumps during shipment. But once we laid the bed down I realized that it really didn't need extra packing material. The bed is HEAVY. You definitely need two strong people for this project.Assembly: The manual doesn't tell you in the beginning that you need to insert 9-volt back-up batteries into the motor box. Those instructions are on the last page - AFTER you've flipped the base over and then have to crawl around on the floor to reach the box. But assembly is simple. Attach the legs, cut away a few strips of zip tie that hold the power cord, insert the 9-volt batteries, and then the bed is ready to flip right side up. Here's where it gets tricky. You need two people to dead lift the unwieldy, 125 pound base and flip it over. You cannot ""lean"" it over on its side, because the pressure on the legs could bend or snap the metal bolts. It was a challenge for my daughter and me but we managed. Anyway, once it's right-side up you just need to attach the corner brackets that hold the mattress on. I don't think they tell you that the bed also comes with the headboard attachment kit, which was a nice surprise.Have slept blissfully for a 3 nights. I bought it because I have moderate sleep apnea and sometimes woke up with headaches. The wedge type pillows weren't much help because I would slide off during the night. With this adjustable bed, I am able to lift the head up so that my sleep is uninterrupted and I wake up feeling like I actually got a good night's rest - either on my back or on my side. No more headaches. I love being able to elevate my legs while I watch TV or read - it really helps with edema. I used an income tax return to purchase this bed. Best thing I've done for myself in years!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPF4FLDBMBKEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CHSG#wasThisHelpful","RPF4FLDBMBKEB","A1VYJUUE1MEG46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYJUUE1MEG46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dress is lovely. I bought this for my daughter, who is a big girl, using the vendor's size guide. It fits perfectly. The print is much more vibrant and pretty than the picture. Daughter wears it with a cami underneath, which works perfectly as the neckline and back are in a deep V shape and she doesn't want to show so much cleavage. Fabric is a good quality spandex blend. Doesn't snag easily. I ordered the ""tall"" and it fits her 5'9"" height perfectly.

"Great moisturizer for the eyes and the dry skin areas of your face. For my over 50 skin, it works great.

"My daughter and I made the commitment to lose weight in 2015. Problem is I have very arthritic knees that make it impossible to do many athletic activities. I needed to start walking - slowly. I don't have a lot of space for a huge piece of equipment.  Did a lot of research and found this treadmill. It's a WALKING treadmill. The treadmill folds up, the table folds down, so when you're not using it the footprint isn't too big (FOLDED DIMENSIONS: 38”L x 36”W x 60”H).Does it work?  YES!  We pulled it out of the box and had it assembled in under an hour. No adjustments were needed. It's VERY quiet. I put my tablet on the table and watch Netflix or Prime movies while walking. I find myself on the treadmill much more because I can use my laptop and get some work done while I walk. The table is very steady - no shaking while the treadmill is moving. We've been using it a few weeks now and there have been no issues or problems. Able to go from 0.4 to 4 MPH and up to a 15% incline. We're both about 5'8"" and the treadmill is fine for our stride length (20”W x 40”L). Heart rate monitor and buttons on the handlebars as well as the display for setting speed, Very happy with this purchase.  One caveat - if you're looking for something that will allow you to RUN, this is not the machine you need. Maximum speed is 4 MPH, which is perfect for someone like me who wants to do computer work or read while I walk off the pounds.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SANW5646V5NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00761HK3Q#wasThisHelpful","R3SANW5646V5NI","A1VYJUUE1MEG46","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VYJUUE1MEG46?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She likes that she doesn't have to take throw away forks and spoons anymore because they end up getting broken while she's toting her lunch box around all day.  These sporks are tough & wash up great in the dishwasher!  When I first ordered them I was afraid they may be too small for her (she is 11) but they're perfect compact size.

"This lil Furbling is super cute and about the size of a tennis ball.  It does interact with the larger Furby Boom by putting them face to face and pressing the top of it's head. It is really cute how excited the big Furby gets when it interacts with it's baby.  However the interaction is short lived and repetitive.  I was a little disappointed that the eyes were holograms and the limited phrases it says.  The fun wore off in a few days and now both Furbys are ""sleeping"" on a shelf.  My daughter is 11 and she plays with them from time to time and uses the Furby Boom app to get more out of these lil critters.

"I purchased this ink on 5/28 and paid the extra fee for 1 day shipping as I needed the ink like yesterday.  It arrived as promised on 5/29. It was packaged in a bubble wrap mailer and inside the cartridges were individually sealed in plastic and those were inside another plastic bag. I installed the cartridges in my printer in just a few minutes after unpacking/opening packaging.  After the printer recognised the cartridges and went through the alignment process, I was ready to print!  I printed out several small pictures (for a project my daughter is working on) onto regular printer paper and the colors were vibrant, crisp & clear and the ink dried quickly without any smudging.  I can not testify as to how many prints I will get out of these cartridges yet but I am satisfied with the quality.  I can not tell any difference in these remanufactured Dell 31 cartridges compared to the Genuine (expensive) ones you buy from the big box stores.  I will be buying again when I need them.  Can't beat the price and FREE prime shipping!  Thank you Amazon & YoYoInk!****EDITED REVIEW*****I purchased this ink on 2/1/15 as I was very impressed with the quality of my last purchase and needed ink again. I don't know what they did to change the quality but this time the ink cartridges were NOT the same high quality I raved about in my original review.  Immediately when I opened these cartridges (Black & Colors) they leaked all over my hands and stained them, even splattered onto my shirt and ruined it.  I wasn't happy about it, but I got a paper towel and cleaned off the cartridges and installed them anyhow, as I was out of ink completely and needed to print something.  The 1st print was smeared and streaky and since then then the next few things I printed the colors are printing just fine, however the black is not black at all, sometimes it prints out like it's low on ink or prints NOTHING at all in black.  I have ran the cleaning system on my printer etc, and still nothing is changing the black print quality.  I HIGHLY DOUBT I will be purchasing this ink again.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5K2UKL8W3TOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV3MOL0#wasThisHelpful","R5K2UKL8W3TOR","A2H9ZKN0OK84QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H9ZKN0OK84QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 25 y/o Amazon likes these very much but they're kinda huge and more like a treat for him.  He likes holding his food and picking at it so these work well for that. But he only eats half of it then when he can't hold onto it and eat it he throws it in the bottom of his cage. It seems like an expensive waste.  I've started crushing up some to put in his food bowl (along with his primary food) and leaving a few whole ones for him to pick up.

"This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.  These last so much longer than any other ball I have bought for my rough player.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z283GXRTNN87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084DRJKO#wasThisHelpful","R2Z283GXRTNN87","A2H9ZKN0OK84QY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2H9ZKN0OK84QY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are by far my FAVORITE face product.  I only use Desert Essence face wash and these cleansing pads.  They smell pretty strong and sting a bit at first but that disappears very quickly.  They leave your face feeling so fresh and clean.  I have used many TV products, drug store products and other natural products to manage my breakouts/combo skin with no luck.  These clear up any breakouts fast for me & they DO NOT dry my face out, actually my face feels so soft after I use these.

"This is the 4th kindle I've owned and for the first time I've actually not liked it.The Good:=======- price- Kindle- all the e books, audio books, and, finally more appsThe not so good:===========- the software makes it fiddly to make your way around. Instead of the ""carosell"" from before where you could flick through books and apps you most recently used, it looks more like a complicated android set up and you have to click on several tabs before you can see your kindle's library, or uploaded apps. Sure, you can get used to it, but before you could simply see it all the moment you ""unsleep"" your kindle. Messy- the bottom side corners are all rounded, but the upper surface facing you corners are all sharp right angles. This means if you try to rest the kindle with the top part higher than the bottom, like the top is raised up 2cm , and the bottom is on the tbale, it just slides until flat. Means viewing angle is a pain withough a special cover.- holding the kindle lying down can be troublesome- Gravity works against you when you lie down and you hold the kindle up, and the rounded edges give no grip.Ok, the kindle works, and it's great value, and you can get used to all the minuses above.

"I actually use this torch as my bicycle light. I'm a light junkie for bikes (I figure more lights means cars are less likely to hit you, right?) I had two front torches which aren't bad (You can read previous reviews on them). But this diving torch caught my eye due to low price and run time of 120 hours, which is far better than the 5-10 hours new gen USB rechargeable lights currently have. I liked the results of this diving torch so much I bought two more in case the price went up.The reasons I like this torch are:- bright yellow body- easy to catch people's eye in daylight. Easy to see and not forget if I put it somewhere.- long run time. I'll be using up the included AA batteries first, but then will use my rechargeable AA batteries, and they have more juice, so run time shold be pretty awesome with them.- there is a wide field of view. Because the flash head is larger then most cree type torches/flashlights, and because the LED ""bulb"" is not as far back from the front glass as many torches, the light can be seen from a wider angle and is almost as bright from the side as from front.Please note that you can't turn the on/off switch too far, or it might not work. About 60 degrees from the off position is fine.

"I'm sorry but I have to give 1 star for the pole. The reason is the part of the pole which includes the handle and the h 4 or 5 holes for adjusting the length of the pole didn't work- the silver steel ball which is supposed to pop in to lock it iin position was always in the pushed down position, so you could pull the rest of the pole out and it was essentially in 2 pieces- the handle with holes, and the rest of the pole. I live overseas so it's not worth my returning the pole, so I wasted the money.

"Brandon Sanderson is one of the best authors I've ever read. He's very versatile, being able to write both books for both adults and teens, and he does a truly spectacular job fleshing out the world of each novel, of giving each character depth, of being able to write dialogue as if he is thinking from that person's point of view, regardless of which sex, and even human of not human. Each world has something different about it, something unique which gives it it's spark, gives it the magic. I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of his books. And this one is no exception. WIth Sanderson's books, it's not whether or not it's good or bad, it's simply the degree of how good it is. Was it good, or was it excellent.The only issue I have with Mr Sanderson is that he takes some time to publish each novel, so as some reviewers have suggested, you might want to reread previous books in the series, to refresh your memory. I read hundreds of kindle books and this is one disadvantage of kindle books.- those indie kindle authors are in a race to publish as often as possible as possible to remain fresh in reader's minds, (Chris Nuttall is the leader I think-  a new book every 3 to 6 weeks for the last few years- no joke)Hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!

"An attractively designed, high quality simple backpack which is light and easily transportable. I bought it because of price to try it, and discovered I like a few more pockets for organisation, so this pack doesn't suit me and I will sell it. But make no mistake, this is a top notch pack, despite it's incredible light weight of 175 grams. Eg, the shoulder straps look like cheap mesh plastic at first glance. But pull it. It's tough and doesn't strech, right? Similarly, none of the stitching gives, and the fabric  is , well, tough.If this type of design suits you, then I'd recommend this pack.

"Osprey is a popular brand name that many people love. But I'm not one of them. I think they look great, and are built like a tank, but they rarely fit me well, and other lesser well known brands are better IMHO.For me, I compare the Gregory Miwok 24 with the Talon 22. While they take similar volumes, I find the Talon is weak in the smaller pockets- didn't anyone notice the rough plastic sticking into the smaller pocket, which will scratch your mobile phone? And the other smaller pocket is a hassle to reach, inside the main compartment. The little mesh pocket(s- depends on version) can't put anything there besides a rolled up paper map. If it were twice the width, I bet everyone would place their mobile phone and compact camera there. Sure, you can use the waist pockets, but this is a waste. And of course, the Osprey sin of compression straps across the side bottle pockets.In contrast, the Miwok 24 has a huge front pocket, huge side pockets, both front and side are expaandable, and the top has easy access to the smaller pocket, which can take quite a few things. The Miwok also has a dedicated hydration bladder clip on one shoulder strap, and a dedicated sunglasses holder for the arm of a pair of sunglasses on the other shoulder strap.I know, I know, I sound like a fanboy of the Gregory brand. I'm not. I just think The Talon 22 is overrated. I think it's really 3.5 stars, but rounding it up to 4 so as not to offend too many people here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBB3QW7AG9F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPM8TG8#wasThisHelpful","R2IBB3QW7AG9F7","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very light hydration pack. It's about 215 grams, and seems very well made. I've only gone cycling once and for a 3 hour walk once, but so far it seems well made, has plenty of straps for adjustments, and I can fit in the things I like, like a bladder, my kindle, wallet, mobile phone etc. There are quite a few reflective bits on it too, which is good, and you can stuff quite a bit with the back cinching cords.There's some oddly designed features though. There is an individual zippered pocket for the water bladder, which is good, but my 3 L/100 oz Geigerrig bladder is just a tad too long to fit in there. Similarly, the water bottle pocket on the right shoulder strap is too small for anything larger than , I'm guessing, a 300ml bottle. There is a left and right side mesh pockets, and oone is smaller than the other. I haven't seen this before, and I'm going to guess someone thought that some items are smaller so they'd rattle around less in a smaller pocket.The side straps around the ribcage have an excellent locking system which easy to use, and excellent. So it's strange that for the sternum straps (x2), they use a complicated system needing two hands. Cost? Weight?Thankfully, my leather wallet fits in snugly in the top horizontally zippered pocket, which also has a key fob. The main compartment is accessed by a side zipper and seems quite decent for the volume of the pack.I'm due to pick up a second hand Camelbak Octane xct tomorrow and will compare the two, as well with my Camelbak Ultra LR and Gregory Miwok 24. Yeah, I'm a bit of a gear junkie.Sorry I can't offer an opinion on it's use in a long distance run. Hope some others review it for that.EDIT Sept 28th 2015===============I've used this for a couple of day hikes and several times cycling. I've noticed:- the light weight is amazing.- the front right shoulder strap pocket is where I put my mobile phone or waterproof compact camera.- the left shoulder strap narrow stretchy pockets are where I put some credit card sized cards, like the ones for tapping on ticket gates at public transport.- the side mesh pockets are quite useful, and one of them has a lockable drawstring- I tighten it when I needed to bring along lots of small bike lights which I wanted to attach at night time, but didn't need during the day.- really fits a 3L water bladder. I thought the hose attachment might poke into my back, but I never felt it.- the side straps have a great locking system. easy to use without needing to look.- the front pocket string- there is even a fob/latch at the end- quite useful and thoughtful.- the main compartment zipper has become stuck 85% near the top. Needed to zip it up and down several times to get it to zip closed completely. Happened 3 times now. Hoping won't happen again.......This pack isn't nearly as attractive as the camelbak's, but although not perfect, it is functional, light, seems solid and I will keep using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NTIMK0A2F6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00946JRQO#wasThisHelpful","R23NTIMK0A2F6E","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I generally like the author's work. But I'm afraid this one isn't up to par. The whole plot is very repetitive. Start with individual's mundane job, then introduce multi galaxy wide threat which sweeps up main character into becoming a leader who saves said multi galaxies from biological threat which is backed by AI threat using highly advanced sodium technology. This in itself isn't that much of a problem. But this novel felt very bland, with no real suspense. It read more like the author's own plot summary reminder sheet, than a proper book, especially in the last third.And am I the only one who is thinking that the Duke is going to return?

"Of all the Star Trek series' out there in written form, I feel New Frontier is the best (Department of Temporal Investigations is my second favourite, so perhaps I'm quite non mainstream from many/most ST fans). It's lively, isn't afraid to be humourous and quirky, yet it will also take the drama to a new level as well.This second book in the new series, which is kind of a ""Return of New Frontier"" series, is more like it. I felt the one before was a bit bland, but this one ups the pace, introduces some new characters and complicates the plot a bit more. Am awaiting third volume eagerlySide note-I'd prefer to read all these 4 books as a 1-2 thicker volumes, rather than x4 150-250 page volumes, but I'm guessing there's more money this way and you can string the readers along further.

"Disclaimer- I'm a man, not a woman. I'm broad and well built. I don't know what features on this pack are woman specific. But I do know I like it. The pack that is, not the woman specific features.I've had a few packs of similar size and type- Frames and air space -Osprey Stratos 36 original and newer versions, Osprey Exos 34. No frame - , Karrimor Trim 35, and a cheap backpack called Camel Mountain. I find the Crea Light 40 to be the best of the lot for me because: - it's quite light for it's size-approx 1.05kg. The Stratos 36 is about 200-300grams heavier, and the Trim 35 is only 250grams lighter. I think one way they reduced weight was by using thinner fabris. You can tell it's thinner, but it's still tough- just try to pull/stretch it0 you can't. - Side and front pockets are stretch mesh. That means you can fill up the main compartment and even if it bulges out,it won't stop you being able to stuff things into those pockets. If they were non stretch, then they'd be restricted to a thin space. The Stratos doesn't have a front pocket, although the top lid has two pockets, on on top of the other. - The shoulder strap height has 3 height levels to choose from. While it would have been great to be able to do fine adjustments along any length, like Berghaus and Vaude packs, this is much much better than no adjustment at all. Means if you buy online without trying first, you have some leeway for error. - there is a zipper along the side of a side pocket so you can get stuff out from the main compartment without digging everything out. - The top lid has an outer and inner pocket. - there is only 1 waist pocket (I don't know why expensive packs from brand names only put one waist pocket, instead of two) but it is very spacious, and I would be able to fit x2 compact cameras in there. - it has an air space for keeping yuir back cool. - well built. - Useful double pullstring levels so you can pack a bit extra in it. - There's two elastic top loops and two lower ones for stowing your poles. Quite standard, not as useful as the easier access method Osprey uses.Some niggly things: - the shoulder straps seem a bit narrow and could do with a bit more padding. - the two straps which clasp with the female parts on the top lid are attached far low on the pack, so when unclipped, they dangle down far and you reach further to grab them. - The grey ""iron/smoke"" is quite drab, but I guess it's inoffensive. But since I got it new at 60% off, I can't really complain. - The stitching for the words ""Crea Light 40"" looks a little cheap.Overall I like the pack. It works well, feels good, although extra padding might make a difference if I were to do overnight hiking. Speaking of overnight hiking, there are no exterior straps for a sleeping bag, but there are little loops on the top of the lid, so maybe you could use some string or elastics to tie one onto the pack.Or you could tighten it with the side compression straps. But point is- no specific sleeping bag straps or compartment.I hope more ladies write reviews soon so mine won't stand out so much!Thank for reading!EDIT Sept 28th 2015===============I've really only used this as cabin luggage and moving from city to city a few times, not for real hiking. So far I've noticed:- the side zipper for access to main compartment is of limited use. It's not really large enough, and it's only one side- bad luck if you didn't pay attention to pack certain items closer to the zipper.- on the other hand, you can put smaller items into the main compartment via the zipper without undoing the top lid and opening the drawstring.- the top lid is actually a separate item and is attached to the main backpack by x3 straps. I don't think you can totally disconnect the lid from the backpack, but the straps can be adjusted in length. This is good for when you overpack the main backpack and things jut out the top. By lengthening the straps, the lid remains level and on top and can still cover the whole top.It matters because it looks neater, it doesn't leave the drawstring sphincter area exposed, the lid remains level so the top pocket is level. If It weren't level, then it would be angled back and the pocket lid zipper would be down/bottom, so things might fall out when you unzip it.- sometimes there is a squeak from the frame/back mesh.- the left waist pocket is really quite big- a;; mesh pockets are stretchy and can hold lots.- I don't think it's a true 40L. the inside capacity seems to be less than the Osprey stratos 36.- on the top of the lid there are x4 short loops. If you need to strap on something like a sleeping bag- you can do that.- on the bottom x2 loops, on half of it is thicker. I don't know why. It looks very deliberate so it must have a function.- I put a 3L water bladder inside as I was going to carry the full laden pack for a whole day- fits well, but takes up quite a bit of space in the main compartment.I still like the pack, but as with everything, I'm learning to live with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCQDU93HINKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VKZBW2#wasThisHelpful","R1SCQDU93HINKF","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: my version of this bag is 1.0. Version 2.0 is the current one you see here on amazon. The hiking shop attendant informed me the only difference between version 1.0 and 2.0 were the two shoulder strap pockets added on 2.0, which are not present on 1.0. I would have liked to have bought the one with pockets, but the 1.0 I bought was 40% cheaper and didn't justify paying extra for them. Those shoulder strap pockets were not available seperately.I was looking for a light and smaller frameless backpack to compliment my Karrimor 35 Trim, which is great when full, but has too much empty space when not, and lacks enough pockets. So I was window shopping around various hiking shops, seeing what was available, and hoping to see any bags with a steep discount.Initial impressions:=============When I saw the Hyper 22 hanging on the shelf, I spent about 15 minutes testing it out- adjusting the shoulder and waist straps, putting stuff inside so there'd be some weight, putting my camera and wallets in the waist pockets, and so forth. I was impressed with the quality of stitching and fabrics, the weight was light- only about 500 grams, the waist pockets had loads of space- camera easily goes in- not tight at all, shoulder straps were long- the wider padded part doesn't end in my armpit (I'm broad build 173cm), and the shoulder straps are a bit wider for comfort.The design is a tube, but instead of drawstring to close with a flap lid, it's a 270 degree(approx) zippered lid, with a zippered pocket on the top, and another zippered pocket on the inside. I thought that was pretty cool.There are also three stretchy mesh outer pockets- two on the side and one on the front.The puzzling part was the thin string which goes from one side pocket, across the front, and to the other side pocket. The staff showed me how to use it- it has several functions- compression strap, wrapping around things you want to hold like clothing on outside of bag, and anything else. Honestly, it looks like it will rip if it gets wet, but anyone with experience in higher end gear knows that thin material doesn't mean weak material. (I hope). There are a couple of plastic hooks which allow you to wrap the string around.There's also two loops at the bottom for poles etc.Essentially it was comfortable, pockets were spacious, light, well made (if a little quirky).Real World Use:===========A week after I got the Hyper 22, I found the Gregory Miwok 24 on special and bought it (65% off- awesome!!!) and I realised that the way the front and side pockets of the Hyper 22 were sized, the side pockets were slightly larger than normal, and thus the front pocket was narrower. For me, that means my 7 inch Kindle Fire is an extremely tight fit in the front pocket, and you might only fit one windbreaker in it. On the other hand, you will be able to fit 1L bottles into the side pockets easily. IN comparison, the Miwok 24 front pocket is designed to easily enclose a bicycle helmet.The Miwok 24 became my go to daypack and the Hyper 22 sat alone in my bag box.So one day I thought I'd give it a chance and I took it on an easy 2 hour day hike/cycling combo. I found that the pack is designed for, and suits very well, marathon and distance hikers and runners. Light, comfortable, can stuff a fair bit in.But for me, it's not quite so good as I find the design of the Gregory Miwok 24 more to my liking- more spacious pockets on top and front for my electronic gadgets - tablet/mobile/spare battery. It's a purely individual opinion. If I only brought hydration bladder, food, spare clothing, wallet, then the Hyper 22 would be fine. But for me, the Miwok is just so much more flexible- front pocket can fit so much, side pockets can fit 1.5L bottles, and completely enclose my 7 inch kindle fire, top pocket eats my wallet and passport and mobile when pack used as cabin bag.The Hyper 22 is a good, attractive, durable looking pack with many good features. If you want something like this, it's certainly worth a look. But I find my Miwok 24 that much more spacious, and far more versatile. (I wish more people were writing reviews for this, because I feel guilty writing the maiden review for this pack, and I've only used it for a single hike. and I want a pack to do perform in several ways, not just purely in one)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WB6Y7Q6FAJ3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF9F0A2#wasThisHelpful","R2WB6Y7Q6FAJ3Y","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again Stephan follows a tried and true formula. Space sci-fi spanning galaxies, initially focuses one our hero in his little world, doing his job. From here, things get bigger, crazier, and his, and hence our, world view expands almost exponentially, and there are plot twists, as the enemy we thought was the enemy, is not who we think it is.

"Got this as part of a package deal buying a second hand Olympus EPL-5. Little bit of a mixed bag.Easier to carry due to slim size, get the benefit of faster shutter speed due to f1.7, haven't noticed much, if any, distortion at f1.7.Focusing in low light with the EPL-5 is slow, and the focusing motor makes a relatively loud noise. Is it screw drive focusing motor? Bokeh, which is subjective, is not as creamy as I had hoped. My Olympus 12-50mm seems to produce sharper images with creamier bokeh. Of course the 12-50mm is about 5 times longer,so that's a trade off.Certainly worth getting if you're after a slimmer easier to carry lens for your m4/3 camera body. Just note it's not perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R121Q4GGE45SC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IKLJVE#wasThisHelpful","R121Q4GGE45SC2","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 stars, but rounded up to 5.Another enjoyable well paced non stop military sci fi novel. Both my favourite and least favourite parts were in the front of the book.My favourite part was when McGill was having R&R at home at his parent's place, and, like most of us when our parents are talking nonstop to us, our attention drifts and he gets caught looking at his tapper. His mum promptly says she'll get tweezers to remove hairs which have grown through the tapper, and McGill moans ""Aww Mum! I'm not 7 years old anymore!"". She uses this as an excuse to look at his tapper's photos and then learn'sthe existence of her grand daughter.  I just smiled at this family moment. You might be a big soldier who can change the course of galactic events, but when you're home, your mum will always be your mum.Not much further from this, McGill is in Turov's office and pretty much coerced into having 3 times a week sex with her. While it's easy to see it just adds to the trend of him having sex willy nilly, I thought it wasn't in great taste (even though he did say he felt taken advantage of). If Turov was a man and McGill a woman, there would be no doubt at all this scene would be a rape scene and there'd be complaints of sexual abuse in the storyline.Aside from this, I enjoyed the book and look forward to the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JDHAZ0YRB048/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VC05XU4#wasThisHelpful","R2JDHAZ0YRB048","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the many reviews here I expected it to be nothing short of being perfect in fulfilling my expectations of removing heavy mould and mould smell from a second hand back pack I bought recently. I used 3 caps the first time, it dried in about a day with no wringing, was much better but still had a smidgen of mouldy smell, I washed it by spraying water all over outside and inside, removing the white mould, then did it again with 3 caps of mirazyme, but this time no change.The bag is much much better than before, but it's not perfect or infallible.Considering spraying loads of Fabreeze did absolutely zip before I used Mirazyme, I can hardly Mirazyme is useless. But it's not a miracle worker. It's good, but not the stuff of legend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33N26YT5HJUL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DYNSN#wasThisHelpful","R33N26YT5HJUL2","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LAD Weather watch's biggest problem is the display. It simply isn't very bright. It's got tons of functions, which I love, especially at this price. For Bang for Buck, this watch wins hands down. But you have to adpat to the display.When I fisrt received it, I was so disappointed how dim the display was. My Casio analogue watch- see the time with a split fraction glance. This one- have to take more time to see it.But I used it on a couple of walks and day hikes, and in the sunny day, it's fine. When it's dark, press the ""light on"" button and it lights up easy to read too. It's in between, like in a moderately lit room, that it's harder to see, and the watch light doesn't help much. But within 2 weeks, my eyes had adapted and the ""naturally"" squint a bit harder to focus on the digits.As for the functions, I like the altitude one the best. In my limited use, I find it's about 50m too high, but you can still tell roughly how much you you have ascended or descended, which is the main thing.When you use altitude, barometer, compass, these features will take the middle row of the watch, which is the largest row, and will stay there. The time gets moved to the bottom, which is about half the height of the middle row numbers. Staying at the middle is useful. I'd hate to have to keep pushing the mode button for it to appear and disappear every few seconds. It does, however, go idle though- says ""IDLE"".Another good thing is the wrist strap loop- after you wear it, the excess length gets tucked into the loop. On my Casio, it will often come undone with the strap sticking out. But the LAD Weather strap end has a raised portion, which acts as a ledge to stop the loop moving backwards and slipping off the strap. Nice touch.Ini hindsight, I might have considered the [Lad Weather] Fishing Outdoor (Climbing/ Hiking/ Running/ Walking/ Camping) Altimeter Barometer Chronograph Alarm Weather Forecast Men's Wrist Sports Watches, which has a normal LCD display, but it's too late now, and I've gotten used to it.Can't beat it for the features at this price. 4 out of 5 stars. If there was no display issue, it would be 5 stars for a watch at this price point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ACSIAMH6MTIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IMWDYFQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ACSIAMH6MTIS","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brands like Gregory are not nearly as popular or well known as ones like Columbia and Osprey. But like I have discovered many times in the past, less known often means it is better than the better known. And so it is with the Gregory Miwok 24.The city I live in mostly has Ospreys, with a small selection of North Face and Columbia bags. I love the look and build of Osprey, but the bags never quite fit me, for a number of reasons. I also feel they are all overpriced.  Recently, a new shop started selling Gregory and I although I was only going to window shop, I ended up buying the Miwok 24. It was high quality, had features I liked, lightweight and on special. I took it home, loaded it up with 5kg and walked around the neighbourhood and to my amazment, it felt really good! Then I put in a 3 litre bladder with 2L of water, and another 2kg of stuff (total weight about 4.3kg), and cycled for 2 hours (with a break at the Popeyes at the halfway point), and I was amazed by how awesome it felt. I honestly can't think of a single thing I don't like about it, and many things that I do.Pros/Features:========== - professional high end build quality - Comes in at least 3 colours. At the shop I saw bright blue, black and that bright orange which is kind of flouro. - Shoulder straps are wide apart so do not rub side of yor neck. The straps are also wide to distribute weight over more of your shoulder. The padding on shoulder straps and back has holes, for better ventilation, weight reduction and less swaeting. ** Awesome pockets and attachments: - two waist pockets which are spcaious and don't flatten out when you tighten it around your waist. I was able to fit my Samsung S4 in with room to spare. The S4 zoom is like a thickish compact camera. - I suspect it is water resistant. The inside of the material has this rubberised coating/lining. I have the same lining in my Osprey Talon 8 waist pack, and it came through a torrential rain storm with no moisture in the compartments or pockets. However, the Miwok 24 will not stand up to extremely heavy rain- the zippers are not those with firm plastic next to the zipper teeth, just normal cloth, so water will soak through. The Osprey zippers have those firm plastic sidings to help with weather proofing. - the shoulder straps have two very useful attachments- on the right one is a clip for your water bladder hose. On the left side is a narrow cloth sleeve with glasses embroided on it, so you can slide an arm of your sunglasses through. It's almost like they were reading my mind. I have lost 2 pairs of sunnies by just having them fall off while cycling and the glasses were just tucked into the top of my t shirt or on chest strap and I didn't notice when they dropped off as I rode.Not to mention how often they fall on the ground when I bend over during hiking. - The top of the pack has a horizontal zip for a wide pocket there. But unlike most bags, this goes all the way from one side to the other, and dips slightly down the slide. Inside the pocket, is a mesh zipped pocket and a lose clip, so you can keep your keys , wallet, passport in the mesh part. I easily fit my 6 inch kindle Fire into the pocket, as well as my wallet and keys and mobile- It's deep, it's wide, it's very convenient to put things in and take them out. It's not just a pocket for sunglasses, it's a full on useable pocket. I use backpacks as cabin luggage, and this pocket is absolutely right on the money for me- wallet, passport, keys, tablet. - The front pocket is a large flexible thing which is about 80% the height of the bag- which is good!. It can be kept streamlined by zipping up the two zippers on the side, or you can unzip them and let the pocket bulge out, and my bicycle helmet fits in perfectly. I put my bike gloves, lights in the helmet space where my head would be. There is a small elastic strap you can hook onto a plastic hook too. Obviously there's a vast range of things you could put into that big pocket/sleeve. This is the first time I've had such a pocket. There are also further elastic locks on the inside/side to tighten the pocket. - There are two side pockets most would assume are for bottles. They are, but boy, are they deep! When I put a 1.5L soft drink bottle in, the pocket goes about 65-70% up the height of the bottle. 1.5L, not 0.5L ! And the pocket is not being stretched to the limit and about to break, either.Furthermore, the way it is designed, the compression strap is near the top of the pocket and there is a sort of vertical /diagnoal flap which partly covers half the pocket, so you can tighten the top of the side pocket and things won't come out as easily if the backpack takes a tumble- it's not a full on zipper or closing but it's pretty good.All pockets are full material, not mesh, so you can put your mobile phones, tablets etc in and people won't be able to see them....or more importantly, thieves won't. The pockets just swallow the 6 inch kindle- it's that big. - on one side of the front there's a elastic tie at top and loop at bottom, for a pole. - There is one more important pocket- immediately behind the mesh foam backing, is a pocket for the water bottle. It's excellent. and my 3 L bladder fit with no problem, and did not sag or move at all.This pocket keeps it out of the way of the main compartment, and is kept closed by two velcro patches. - at the bottom there's a slot for a bike light.I know I wrote a heck of a lot. To be honest, this really lends itself better to a video review to show you what I mean.Bottom line- A fantastic backpack. It makes me want to go out and hike or cycle, just so I can use it.UPDATE 3rd Oct 2015==================I used the Miwok 24 quite a lot before hand but my constantly evolving activities and keenness to try new packs means I use it quite rarely now. It's not quite big enough to always pack everything I need for a weekend getaway, and now I use a Mammut MTR 201 7L pack meant for runners- it weighs only 215 grams, it fits a 3 L water bladder and I've used it for both day hiking and cycling. The Miwok 24 has had no real issues with wear and tear- the bottom where the plastic/foam piece backing- the corners where it presses the fabric material- the blue is wearing away slightly. Nothing has torn, it remains comfortable. But I've found that perhaps the compression from the x2 straps on the sides might not be enough at times. Also, if you stuff the front pocket with clothing, not helmets/big cowboy hats (I have one I like), then the pocket bulges out and the pack looks bit funny. Still, you can put a heck of a lot in that front pocket!So it remains a pretty good pack. The only way I think it could be better would be to put some pockets on the shoulder straps to put your mobile phone or compact camera, and maybe a bit more compression.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLYEU2320U4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWWGOUY#wasThisHelpful","R3LLYEU2320U4Q","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Stephen Baxter's XeeLee series is one of the most amazing series I've read. He takes the entire human race from the beginning, to it's end a few million years in the future, and it's war with the XeeLee, and , in developing the XeeLee race, reveals that the war which consumes all of humanity for tens of thousands of years, is but a side show for the universe spanning conflict between the XeeLee and their dark matter enemies, and the XeeLee are losing. The XeeLee are so powerful, that they are able to move entire galaxies. Humans are but a tiny side show, an annoyance.The XeeLee universe is grand, vast, is spread across billions of years. The author is fluid, has plots which grab you and never let go.And yet, at the end of all of this, I have to say that I didn't like it. I found it sad. Downtrodden several times by Alien races, then after thousands of years of warmongering, it's all for nothing. We do not matter in the large scheme of things, and whatever plots are hatched, fail, in the long run. I'm one of those people who likes to see a little something positive happen for the good guys, for the humans. In XeeLee, everyone loses. And we never actually get to see or meet the ultimate bad guys.So as I said, 99% of you will enjoy this epic series of stories.

"I have bought and read the first four of Kelby's Digital Photogrpahy books and like many, many people, have enjoyed the way he uses humour and writes his explanations as if he's just having a casual conversation with you, as if you bumped into each other at a barbeque, you discovered he's a photography pro, and you picked his brains for a few tips, and struck gold because this photographer knows how to put things in normal language, refraining from using technical jargon and making you feel illiterate, dumb and a fool.To be honest though, I've found that he is stringing out his books.

"At top of the amazon pag it says Octant LR, but when I click buy to go to Cart, it says Ultra LR. So I wasn't sure which vest I would eventually get. But at the price I paid, I was ok with either. Received the Ultra LR today, really excited with the looks, quality and my first time uses.Please note I do no jogging at all. I walk, hike or cycle. But I've wanted front pockets on shoulder straps a long time, and when I saw this vest at this price, I thought I'd give it a try.The design features are pretty good.The water bladder weight is at the hips, not up high, there are 4 pockets at the front- the two obvious big ones on the shoulder straps, which you can put bottles , or, for me, I might put cameras, quik dry towels, mobile phone with connected battery to map my hikes, and above these big ones, is a slot type pocket, the right sholder strap one opens from the top of the pocket  and is quite deep, bit deeper than my shortish stubby fingers. The other one the left (when you wear it), is from the upper/side aspect. It is not deep, and you can slide thin things in, like keys, folded money notes (some countries like Singapore and Australia have changed from making money in paper to plastic - invented in Australia, so you don't have to worry about soggy money) At the back, there's the 2 litre/70 oz water bladder, which you get access to by unzipping the bottom flap on 2 sides. Inside this flap is a hidden zippered pocket- guess you can put something here too. And above this is the stretchy open pocket for something, like change of t shirt, wind breaker, stuff to eat etc. There are no waist side pockets on this model. I wish they did.  Storage is either front or back.Shoulder strap length can be adjusted. About 30cm(?) at the end of the shoulder strap has the cloth end which attaches to the rough sticky velcro side attached a sleeve in the vest. You can detach and adjust as needed. I changed it several times.There are also a number of reflective strips on the front and back, and my pack is white/blue, which makes it easy to see.I found that the weight needs to be distributed evenly. If I put a bottle, camera in the front, but nothing in the back, it pulls forward. I'm quite broad so I notice this. I don't have the pencil thin physique some marathon runners have so it's slightly tight at the upper back for me as well. For about 10-15 mintues, there was this itchy feeling as if the mesh back was irritating one particular place on my back. Don't really notice any weight or pressure from full 2L bladder.I live in a very hot and humis part of the world, so predicatbly I did notice the sweaty back and the sweaty areas from the front pockets which had my camera, mobile phone, phone charger, towel and wallet. Since I walk, not run, I can offset these a bit by unclipping any or all of the 2 chest and one waist buckles, for air to flow behind, for it not to cling tightly to my body.When water, after approx 1L, there was some resistance and I had to suck quite hard to get water. The Camelbak nozzle has a very tight rubber cap, is straight (I prefer bent/right angled) and has a smoothly operating on/off switch you turn. Works well, though the cap seems too tight.Another irritation was the plastic clip for the left front pocket had a particular sharp part, which I kept bumping my left arm on. Nail filed most of the sharp bit away so it's ok now.But otherwise it's a good piece of equipment. Comfortable, flexible, adjustable. Yeah it gets wet from the sweat, but it  is no different from my other thin non frame backpacks in this regards. Just make sure to waterproof your important things, and experiment with the fitting. It is very flexible.I'm also thinking about trying a camelbak waist pack with built in hydration bladder. But we'll see.I'm giving it 4 stars because it's my first vest. I have nothing to compare it to. Maybe later on I might adjust the rating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THBX79IZVYF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EPGGQ62#wasThisHelpful","R3THBX79IZVYF8","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In each, there is non stop personal mayhem, political backstabbing, perpetual underdog goes into battle against overwhelming odds and complete lack of gratitude from the the people who the Admiral helps save.Start from the beginning.

It is true that compared to thoughtfully written in depth sagas, like those written by Iain Banks and Neal Asher, it is on a lower level. But it is not just a lower level, but a different stack. The author is clearly not taking his characters, storyline or himself too seriously. At time, I cringed when I saw references to other things in science fiction. But don't let it deter you.

"I've used the Samsung S4 Zoom as my number one phone, and 90% of the time when I take photos, and I've taken thousands since I bought it last year. Overall, I love it, but when the K Zoom came out, I had to see what it was like. I spent about 30 minutes playing with it at the shops and this is what I've noticed (ps: I know this isn't the same as owning it, but I feel I'm not approaching it as a total newbie- I have the S4 Zoom and they have similarlities, and I'm comparing the K Zoom to the S4 Zoom) : - Android operating system 4.4 kitkat is very similar to the version used in the S4 Zoom. Coouple of cosmetic changes. Otherwise everything was pretty much same as for the S4 Zoom in terms of app use, phone use. - The body feels like a dimpled curved body, which is what it is. It's fine for a smartphone, but not so much as a camera. - Lens - same zoom range 24-240mm in 35mm format. The rotating ring on the S4 Zoom is gone. Zooming is done by using the volume up and down button, which makes sense. The touchscreen zoom and widen magnifying glasses for zooming onthe screen are gone too. No it's pinch in and out to zoom on screen. Seems inconsistent. Sometimes it will zoom or widen a lot, or not as at all. - Camera software- Big change over the S4 Zoom, making it much more user friendly and very much more customisable. For example:  - In the Gallery, you can now move the album icons around and put them in any order you want.  - When you go to ""modes"", instead of having the scroll in a circular manner through lots and lots of options, like night, macro, etc, you can see them in two ways- scrool up and down along the left side, where you can see about 5 icons at a time, or, when you press the tab button top right, you can see about ..perhaps 15-18 icon squares across the entire screen. Not only that, but you can manage them, so that you can choose which ones you want to appear. This is very much better than before, where I used to scroll round and round to find macro, then rotate through another 5 or 6 to get, to, say, panoramic, then through several more for continous shot. When I played with the phone, I had as few as three options showing (macro, panoramic, manage), as then changed it to include every option.  - Same thing under manual mode- no more scrolling round and round in a circular time wasting fashion. It's just about 12 ssquare icons all showing at once on the screen, you drag left or right to increas or decrease whatever you waant- iso, f stop, shutter speed. etc - Other things I noticed were: I never use video, but I did, just for the heck of it. I took a 30 second one in the shops, holding the phone horizontally. When I played it back it was fine when horizontal, but when I held it vertically, it did rotate, but did not shrink so you could see the whole width. You could only see the middle 2/3 of the screen. Very strange. Perhaps it happens to others and there is a way to fix it but my lack of video experience meant I couldn't do anything. You can also shrink the video so you get the screen cap of the vid, and the actual clip is playing on the top right corner. - In terms of using the camera, I found it was not nearly as easy to hold. The loss of the camera grip meant you have to hold the thin edges, which is normal for a smartphone, but remember here, you have to zoom a lot. The shutter button is much narrower and very sensitive. Press halfway does produce a focus lock (unlike one or two online ""professional"" reviewers who have said it does not focus lock, but instead goes straight ahead and takes the photo), but because of the sensitivity you might skip the focus part and go straight to taking the photo. - Obviously the phone is too new for me to even make a guess whether or not there will be slowing down as apps are installed and deleted, and the internal HDD gets filled up. It may or may not. IT has a hex core CPU, so it remains to be seen if that will produce the magic to turn the K zoom into a magnificent mobile/camera hybrid.Overall- as a phone, the Galaxy K Zoom should be familiar to Samsung and android users. The 4.8 inch screen is larger than the 4.3 inch of the S4 Zoom and is something I wouldn't mind having on my S4 Zoom. Much easier ofor viewing, using the internet, as so on. As a camera, it is incredibly more user friendly. I wish I could update the S4 Zoom with the K Zoom camera software. But I really did not like the feel of it in my hands as a camera. If you have never used the S4 Zoom, or not nearly as often as I have, then the K Zoom will probably feel great to you. A nicely styled mobile, coupled with a fantastic lens which is wider than most (great for selfies), and zooms so far that most composition issues are taken care of. For me, I will stay with the S4 Zoom- I am used to it and like the feel in my hands. But for anyone else, I think you will love the K Zoom. It just does so much, and Samsung have obviously been listening to user comments to improve things. Try it. You'll like it.Edit 2014 August 11th====================Disclaimer- I still have not bought the K Zoom and am still using my battered S4 Zoom. However, given the similarities between the two, and I haven't seen anoything online, I thought I'd include this update.On the weekend I was at Hong Kong markets and they now have several types of selfie sticks. In case you don't know, selfie sticks are retractable poles with a handle at one end, which you hold, and a phone holder at the other, which you attach your phone to. By holding the phone further away from you, you can include more in the photo- your friends, the buildings and scenery around you. Because the phone (or small camera) is now beyond your reach, you will need to set the self timer to take the photo. Enterprising souls have introduced a bluetooth remote control- you turn you phone on, activate bluetooth, let the remote control and phone sync, and then you can press the ""take the photo"" button.Well, things have moved on since this, and at the market there were selfie sticks which have combined the bluetooth remote into the selfie stick handle, so you only need one device, not two. I saw and tried two such sticks. One had just a single button- the shutter button, and the other had four buttons- on/off, one for zoom in, one for zoom out, and one for shutter-take photo.BOTH versions do not work for the S4 Zoom, and I assume may not work for the K Zoom.When I synced the stick to my phone, the following happened. For the single button stick, pressing it made the zoom lens zoom in. That's it.For the multiple button selfie stick, pressing the shutter button made it zoom in, pressing zoom in made it focus.Now the software for the K Zoom is not the same as for the S4 Zoom, so maybe the K zoom will have no problem. But just in case, I've added this here.I've also played with the K Zoom a little more and don't find it too slim any more. Still miss the tripod screw attachment(even though I've only used it twice on the S4 Zoom ;-) )","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20L1MR18V9WEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KROR74G#wasThisHelpful","R20L1MR18V9WEW","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My overall impression of the 12-50mm lens is that it's pretty good. Many people give it a low rating, but it depends what you compare it to and your expectations.Most kit lenses for m4/3 and DSLR's are 28-80mm (in 35mm format) affairs, usually made of plastic. Images are usually adequate, but not nearly as sharp as more expensive zoom and prime lenses. Aperture is usually 3.5-5.6 - nothing special at all. Pentax adds weather sealing, Canon has USB focus motor. That's about it.In contrast, this 12-50mm has a great deal of ability:- weather sealing. This is important to me as I hike and take a lot of photos. Areas I hike may be very misty, damp and humid, suddenly rain, be rocky or have both sand and mud (ie- normal outdoors away from the city). It's nice to know I can just hang onto this regardless of conditions.- very stylishly designed. It looks high end. Most kit lenses, and many more expensive lenses do not look as sleek and well made- 24-100mm (in 35mm format) is vastly more useful than 28-80mm. It never ceases to amaze me how much more you can fit in at 24mm, than 28mm. At the very least it is easier to take a selfie and larger groups of people. 100mm is a noticeably greater reach than 80mm.- I have only used kit lenses for DSLR's for Pentax and Canon, but I'd say images from this 12-50mm lens are sharper, and there's no obvious distortion at 24mm. I do not magnify images to 1000% to check so maybe I'm missing something. - Related to sharpness, bokeh is very smooth and creamy. Only primes are better, imho.- Fast focusing.- 3 modes- manual zooming, electronis zooming, macro modes. Takes a bit of practice to work out how to switch between modes. Olympus is one of the more user UNfriendly brands I've come across. But having these options is good, and the electronic zooming means you can produce better videos.- aperture...ok, it's not fast. But then, no kit lens is. In fact, you have to pay hundreds and thousands more for f2.8 lenses. They also weigh 3 to 4 times more too.The main disadvantages are:- cost. Less of an issue now that the EM-10 has come out and the EM-5 price has come down.- length. There are several 28-84mm kit lenses for m4/3 which are between 50-70% shorter in length, making them lighter and easier to carry around.Overall, I feel the 12-50mm is a fine lens, and there is no reason for me to spend money for a smaller lens of reduced range, nor hundreds more for a faster lens which is 3-4 times heavierI bring both this lens and my 14-150mm lens when I travel and often when I hike. The 14-150 has far greater reach which is very useful, but I do notice the 28mm being not as wide as the 24mm.Sorry for being wordy. I like this lens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZEZ2AR0E3TTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073AIXOA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZEZ2AR0E3TTK","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In recent years, my cameras have been Pentax K-5, Pentax MX-1, X-5, Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, and Olympus OM-D EM-5. I've sold all my DSLR gear (too heavy), and for convenience, have used the Samsung Zoom the most in the last 6 months. Recently, however, I used my EM-5 again on a hike and rediscovered how awesome it is, especially with it's weather resistance. I decided to upgrade my EM-5 by buying a bigger eyecup, and getting a 14-150mm lens, when by sheer coincidence, I came upon the Stylus 1, and it seemed to make the EM-5 unnecessary. Same EM-5 style, constant f2.8 28-300mm, but much slimmer than the EM-5, same top of the line Electronic Viewfinder, built in WiFI. The Stylus 1 seemed like the best camera ever!. I played with it at the shops, and used a friend's one for a day or two. Overall, I think the Stylus 1 is an incredible camera, when look at purely as a camera, but when price is taken into consideration, I think it's far overpriced and not good value for money. (of course it's a personal opinion) Pros: ==== - so many built in high end features, like WiFi, EVF, 3 inch swivel screen, EM-5 styling, higher end compact sensor, f2.8 aperture, 28-300mm lens- sure, not as far as Lumix's constant f2.8 camera, but it's a fraction of the size- an excellent performance/weight/size compromise, 7 frame per second with real shutter sound and tactile sensation, better button layout than the EM-5, very smooth bokeh (out of focus background), very customisable, built in flash. Also loved the fact it had a fixed auto lens cover. Nice to not have to fiddle taking lens cover on and off. Olympus lens caps for micro 4/3 lens are ridiculously thin and impractical so the Stylus has a definite edge in user friendliness here. - for it's class of camera, focus is fast, shutter lag is minimal. Image saving to SD card seems quick sometimes, but not other times. I really don't know why there was half to 1 second variation is saving time. Must be how my friend's camera was. Cons: ==== - It feels plastic, as it is made of plastic, not metal like the EM-5, despite the same physical similarity. Thus it doesn't have the same subjective solidness. Sure I'm comparing it to the EM-5, a camera that was released at a much higher price point than the Stylus 1, but even when I compare it to cheaper cameras, it doesn't seem as rugged. - Price. I know Casio has a f2.8 28-300mm camera competitor which is even more expensive, the Stylus 1 is really a long zoom version of the Olympus ZX-1/2 and Pentax MX-1 with a EVF.Both the ZX-1/2 and MX-1 share a 28-112mm (in 35mm format) f1.8-2.5 lens which produced fantastic bokeh. I honestly can't see the price premium.  This is why I say the camera is a 5 star camera, but only 3 star when price is taken into consideration. Of course, if price isn't an issue, then forget all the other so called serious compact cameras like Canon s100/110, Pentax MX-1, Olympus ZX-1/2, and go straight to Stylus 1. The only possible improvements I can predict in the next incarnation of the Stylus 1 is a wider end, 22 to 25mm, instead of 28mm.In the end, I decided to go with the 14-150mm lens to use with my EM-5 because the lens (second hand) was half the price of a new Stylus 1 (this is 70% of the reason I kept the EM-5 over the Stylus 1), I liked using the EM-5, and the EM-5 is a higher end camera with all that entails- faster focus, customisable evrything, fast image saving, larger sensor and sharper more detailed images. I don't think many people will be in the same position I was in, so might not agree with me. I've chosen the EM-5 over Stylus 1, and time will tell if I did the right thing. After all, everyone else here seems to love it!Sorry for the rambling length. I tend to do that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF4L41WYKZKQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZEJ3XG#wasThisHelpful","RF4L41WYKZKQX","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to thank the reviewer's of Mr Campbell's first Hard Luck Hank book for enticing me into buying it. I absolutely loved it. It was fluid, non stop, had multiple overlapping problems that seemed to just escalate, yet the book maintained it's humourous edge and finished with the good guys winning from all sides..which is slightly ironic, given the ""good guys"" are all corrupt as heck!So when volume 2 came around, I quickly skimmed through the reviews (there were only 7 reviews then- it's 21 now, which goes to show the popularity of Hard Luck Hank, and justly so) and paused.....there were numerous mentions of ""It's darker""....I was worried- did that mean it wasn't funny anymore? Was Hank being turned into a deep thinking brooding assassin? Were there going to be pages and pages of self reflection after some murders?Thank goodness it's just more Hard Luck Hank goodness! I think the reviewer before who rated the content divided by violence, sex etc did a pretty accurate job. It's humourous, it's action packed, more and more things happen to Hank, even though it's not his fault, and Mr Campbell ends the book with a twist I certainly did not expect which opens the door to more advanced technology, and uncharted adventures for Hank and the friends.I thoroughly recommend the Hard Luck Hank books and can't wait for volume 3.

"I've bought and read about a dozen of his books and I can honestly say that I've enjoyed most of them. The storylines are not always original but they are usually well thought out, well paced and have reasonable character development. Guardian Glass is no different and while normally I'd be the first to say I'd like another in the series, Mr Nuttall has so many different series' going on that I'd like him to focus a bit more on some of the others, such as Bookworm.Nuttall is one of my favourite authors and I'm waiting for the next one to pop out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39M8XPSJE7TPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GBVGDA#wasThisHelpful","R39M8XPSJE7TPD","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have enjoyed this Reawakening series and was lucky enough to only discover it last year, so I got to read sevral volumes one after another, rather than only every few months as you wait for the next one. While I have enjoyed the series, I was disappointed with the last quarter of Master Mage. Without given away soo much in spoilers, it leaves a few unanswered questions, and I felt the epilogue time jumped too far, which again lead to some unanswered questions and unresolved issues. This novel reads like a final book in this series, which is why I have this opinion. If it is not, then some of my disappoiintment isn't justified.If you have been reading the series, I recommend this volume to give yourself some closure. But I have to agree with ""Amazon Customer"" that it isn't really the author's best work.

"Having read all three of Mr Weinberg's books, it's pretty clear his genre is the anti hero- the self centred immature idiot who happens to have too much power. I was really hoping for the third book in his Psych Investigation series, but this will do as a replacement, for now. I think it takes a special mind to imagine such idiotic thoughts and self image such as Sehn, and Weinberg continues to do it very well.  Read Questing Sucks. You'll laugh. You'll cry, You'll cheer for the heroes. You'll moan at Sehn's antics.As a side note, Mr Weinberg is 24 years old, quite young. I have a feeling he got bored and wanted to take a different tangent and the result is Questing Sucks. I suspect Psych series was getting too serious and he wanted to maintain the idiotic personality apsect longer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120X80W8GLBRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JA26REM#wasThisHelpful","R120X80W8GLBRK","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought these because of the good reviews. Was looking for underwear which extended down the thigh a bit to help reduce chaffing. Found these and have since bought 6.

"This novella details how Riddick began his path to become the cool badas* that we all love. Anyone who has seen the second Riddick movie might believe that Riddick became the Furyan who Killed the Necromoonger half god because he was the last one left after Furya was wiped out and had to develop survival skills, but this book shows that was only the first in a series of events.Ghosts of Furya begins Fifteen years after Furyan civilisation is destroyed, Earth sends a squad of Marines to Furya to find out what happened to Furya, and if the Necromongers are a threat to Earth. The squad, by accident, stumbles across a Furyan teenage male who is like a solitary Tarzan, except without the family of apes, and then later, a Water Elemental who, via her skills with calculating probabilities, decides to leave the Furyan with the squad and, as they tend to do, says some cryptic words, which, we, with hindsight and some sci fi smarts, know that it means the squad is later going to have a bad day, but they will somehow put Riddick on the path of the Necromonger prophecy.They name the boy Riddick, and get him enrolled to become a US Marine. It seems Earth is still much as it is today- divided into countries, with the US providing the main muscle in space.Three years later, he has nearly finished his Marine training, and it seems everyone hates him- his fellow cadets, his Sergeant, and the General in Charge. Only the original squad who found him treat him decently. I have to admit this hatred seems quite far fetched to me. Riddick really doesn't have a single friend there? Just because he is a better combatant- better coordination, healing, combat skills, ability to anticipate?In any case, he stumbles across two of his fellow cadets raping a 12 year old girl, and kills one and badly injures the other defending the girl. He returns the girl to her home, and is, of course, subsequently framed for the rape of the girl, in order for the General to have him taken into his custody to be dissected and experimented on. The original squad members come to his rescue, and just before he and the squad leader, whom he has always had a romantic crush on, make it to the space ship, they are ambushed, and she, the squad leader, dies. Riddick makes it into space, knowing that he can never return to Earth, upset with the loss of the love of his life.So there you have it.

"Like the previous 23 reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed this Voyager novel by Beyer. After all the political drama of the Typhon Pact, it's good to see at least one book getting back to the basic premise of Star Trek- to go where no one has gone before. And do they ever. It's not possible to elaborate without giving the plot away, so I won't.But I will confess to being slightly puzzled by the lack of mention of the assassination of the Federation President. Surely this would have affected and stunned the crew.I also have a prediction. Tom and Bellana will win, because when Tom's bad history gets brought up, it will backfire on the ""accuser"" (who shall remain nameless, so as to not make too big a spoiler).Overall it's a fluidly written and paced book with new lifeforms and new civilisations. It brings back a memory of TNG's very first episode, where after dealing with Farpoint, Picard says- let's see what this Galaxy Class starship can do......except now, they have this mind bogglingly fast Slipstream drive...let's see what this Slipstream drive can do!...Andromeda, here we come? ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYKNKTH0YC47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476738548#wasThisHelpful","R3LYKNKTH0YC47","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with most of the reviewers here. The final installment of The Fall has no real bang, even though there is some plot and there is some real character of the Cardassian doctor and ""Ishun"".  The final nail in the coffin for the aggressive interim Federation President also seems, to me, quite contrived and out of left field. I don't think it was really necessary, given there was the logical and obvious link between him and the True way and setting up the death of previous Federation president (which is itself was a poorly written plot- anyone with a brain could tell ""security"" as anything but)At least it ends with Starfleet returning ""To boldly go where no one has gone before"". I've had enough of Federation politics. Let's get back to the adventures of interstellar exploration.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AT4VFCGKQZUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476718997#wasThisHelpful","R2AT4VFCGKQZUK","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised to see another book out so soon, and I was even more surprised to see this is the final book of the series! Many authors keep fleshing out their cashcows until people get sick out them,I was happy with this book for many reasons. Some you may agree with, some you may not.- Sandra is gone and Jasmine is in. I found Sandra to be quite annoying and unlikeable after she gained her superpowers.- There is less wholesale slaughter of his troops than usual. (I never liked how tens of thousands of those following him always seemed to perish with little concern. In fact, he seemed more concerned when those dying were non human)- I thought Mr Larson wrote a well rounded, well thought out book which left no real loose ends as far as Kyle and his fight with the Macros are concerned-->, Kyle throws off the yoke of Emporership, gives humanity a chance of becoming unified and peaceful, removes their greatest enemy, reclaims his long lost and sometimes yearned for pre-invasion home life at his old house, albeit with a new wife and child.  There is scope for a new series, but it's not because of some untidy or deliberately open ended finish.- There were some unexpected surprises which spiced up the book. I actually wrote about six lines of them here before deciding to delete them. I know I wrote there are spoilers, but some of the enjoyment comes from discovering some of these for yourself, right? You already know most of the players at this stage of the series, but just go along for the ride.II enjoyed the First book the most, and I regard this one as the second best. Again, this is just my opinion, I'm sure others have their own likes and dislikes.

"The poisoned chalice was a book I couldn't put down. All the main characters in titan had a role to play, which was good for their character development,instead of always seeming to be top heavy (in my opinion) and there is considerable political intrigue,mixed with some action. In fact it lays the foundation of a possible intrigue and clandestine storylines in the future.I only had two issues. The first is that it was unnecessary for akaar to keep ruler in the dark.One could argue that it was necessary so riker would take the initiative. But I do not believe that to be true. The second plot weakness was at the end when ruler confronted the main villain and all he did was, as anjar said, was beat his chest. The way ruler left akaar and his wife, I had expected him to pull a rabbit out of his hat, so that was both disappointing and a little out of character.One thing I got out of the poison ed chalice was that it doesn't matter what system of government you have, there's always people who will try to abuse their power, and there always needs to be those who will do what is right and decent. Many people think they are right, but rarely does integrity and decency enter their justifications. The federation is only a few weeks away from possibly electing a militant petty power hungry dictator. Let's see what the next generation crowd can do to set things back on the right path.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5S2J5MIR8LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476722226#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5S2J5MIR8LC","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this phone after losing several this year forced me to use a 2 year old smartphone which is too slow for today's apps (much like how a decade ago we used to buy a new computer due to increase in speed and software). I've only had it for 5 days but in that time I've found it a perfect fit. As you probably know, there are two sides to this phone- a mobile phone with 4.3 inch touchscreen on one side, and a 24-240mm zoom camera on the other side.Phone: - Works like most android phones and it was easy to get used to it even though my last 3 phones have been Sony's. In fact there are some good differences, such as wrapping the 5 main screens- when you reach the end of one side, you can keep flicking the same direction and it just goes the the other side. On Sony, you had to flick the reverse direction once you reached the end of one side. All apps work well, such as internet, whatsapp, games, searching camera albums, setting alarms (which is not under ""alarms"", but is a seperate tab under the icon ""clock"", and S calender.Camera: - When I show people the phone, their first reaction is that it's big and thick. The general public is not knowledgable about the more technical aspects of cameras so don't understand how powerful and useful this lens is. Although thick for a smartphone, this is not just a smartphone. It is a fully integrated highly featured compact camera with a very useful wide angle of 24mm (in 35mm aspect) which can zoom up to 240mm (in 35mm aspect). This is a far cry from the usual 28-105mm you'd normally see on most compact cameras, or even most zoom lenses for expensive DSLR's. Being attached to a smartphone, you get a 4.3 inch LCD screen to view things, which again is vastly larger than the 2.7-3 inch you see on 99% of today's digital camerasI find the added depth useful for a good solid grip so it's stable for photo taking.On the weekend I took about 390 photos and the results have been sharp, colourful and the zoom range has allowed me to capture a range of photos I wouldn't have otherwise with most cameras. For those who are a little more technically in the know, at 24mm there is distortion at the corners which is quite pronounced, and the f stops go from 3.1 at 24mm to 6.3 at 240mm. Because of the small sensor and the f stops, it is obviously not going to give you perfect noise free photos in the dark. But for the day, it is a superb amalgam of camera and phone. There are a large number of options to apply filters, to have manual settings for shutter speed and apeture, white balance, multiple frames per second and so on. You can choose to have the camera remember these options or reset to default each time you turn it on and off.  I usually leave it on auto, as it's the most convenient for me at this stage. With my other more sophisticated cameras, I usually change settings more often, and they are easier to change as the S4 zoom requires some digging into the menus.The camera is reasonably quick to turn on from time out compared to most compact cameras. What you do is turn the camera on, then press the on/off button on the side, which is also the standby button, Then when you swipe the log back in screen, it wil go straight to the camera and turn it back on. There is no button or icon on the unlock screen so this is the only way I've found.Obviously the photos you take can then be sent to Facebook, your online photo albums, shared with friends via social app like whatsapp etc without having to transfer photos from camera to computer to phone.Battery life is surprisingly good for a mobile phone. I was able to take about 200 photos with battery going to 55% charge. 40 of the photos were with flash. Another time I took about 170 photos and the battery went to 60%.I've found this to be a versatile setup for me so far. I'm going to Bangkok very soon and expect it will continue to be my all in one device for a while (until the next best gadget comes along ^_^ )I've become paranoid about losing my phone so I've attached a wrist strap to it. I even have a pouch which I attached to my shoulder strap of my backpack and always loop the wriststrap on first before taking it out- the strap dangles out for this reason. Yeah I know- too much detail! heheThanks for reading my wordy review about this fun and useful camera phone !Edit 30th November 2013=======================I's like to expand on both the phone and camera.**Phone:I've had no problems using the phone. Everything goes from screen to screen quickly. Internet pages upload quickly. There have been no freezing mentioned in other reviews. Calls are clear and loud. My dislikes are minor, like when you pull down from the top of the screen I'd like ""mobile data"" to be on the first 5 icons at the top rather than flicking to the next 5- be nice to be able to customise this- WiFi and Mobile data are the two buttons on this screen I use most. And for customisation- on main screens, the ""apps"" icon is always on the bottom left- again be nice to be able to change this.** Camera: The camera continues to perform well. When I said above that it was a fully featured and integrated camera, I didn't say how it was so. In terms of features- you can go to manual mode and you can change exposure, shutter speed and aperture. You can do multi burst, and apply filters, though if you use filters or multi burst, it will take 2-4 seconds to process the photos.Other uses I've found for the zoom lens are: superior ability to compose photos, superior portraits using longer zoom lengths and smoother bokeh (out of focus blurriness), I've been to conferences and used the zoom to get closer in to take photos of slides, and of course, better ability to take occasional candid photos of little kids who are always squirming around.The wider angle 24mm instead of 28-32mm usually seen on most mobile phones, makes it superb for selfies. You can see the whole of your upper half of your body, instead of just your face.One surprise is a very well made and sturdy rotating ring around the zoom lens. If you are using the phone and then turn this ring, a new screen will appear with a heap of options- shooting modes like macro, or viewing the gallery etc. I don't really use it but it's interesting and the quality of the ring is very impressive- not wobbly, smooth yet firm, no gaps.That's it for now. It continues to be an ideal phone for me, at this time.Edit 7th Feb 2014=================I'm still using the S4 Zoom and overall I'm quite happy. I continue to use the Zoom as my primary camera for outings during the day and find the wide angle great for capturing more in the photo, while the zoom is very very useable for composing and getting closer to distant objects. Photos remain very sharp, colour is rich and true, and bokeh (out of focus blur) is unusually good for this type of camera (though a true prime lens of s dslr is still far far superior).An example of the life of the battery- it drops from 100% to 50% after I take 200 photos, use mobile data GPS and track my trail using one of the mapping apps over a 4 hour period.I've found the following not-so-goods.- The phone froze twice while taking a photo.- Viewing the photo albums is getting slower now I've got about 9GB of photos on my memory card and camera- Organising photos from the ""camera"" album into new albums is quirky. The process is relatively instinctive to anyone used to android- click new album, give it a name, the click the photos you want moved and it will put a tick in the corner of each photo selected, and you press done and can drag the all the selected photos into the new album. This part is fine. The problem is that the new album by default goes to the phone memory, regardless of whether memory card or phone os selected as the main memory of the photos of the camera. Thus while trying to organise my photos, I was stuck after 5 new albums because the phone memory got filled up. I also could not find a way to use the phone to move the new albums from phone memory to SD card. I had to hook it up to the computer and do it via windows explorer.- Wide angle at 24mm has disportion at the sides and corners. This doesn't worry me as I'm more interested in getting things into the photo rather than edge to edge sharpness that ""professionals"" care about.- There is dust inside the zoom lens.Overall it's still my go to camera phone combo for most of my outings and hikes and I like it.Edit 2014 August 11th====================** Selfie Sticks and Bluetooth:On the weekend I was at Hong Kong markets and they now have several types of selfie sticks. In case you don't know, selfie sticks are retractable poles with a handle at one end, which you hold, and a phone holder at the other, which you attach your phone to. By holding the phone further away from you, you can include more in the photo- your friends, the buildings and scenery around you. Because the phone (or small camera) is now beyond your reach, you will need to set the self timer to take the photo. Enterprising souls have introduced a bluetooth remote control- you turn you phone on, activate bluetooth, let the remote control and phone sync, and then you can press the ""take the photo"" button.Well, things have moved on since this, and at the market there were selfie sticks which have combined the bluetooth remote into the selfie stick handle, so you only need one device, not two. I saw and tried two such sticks. One had just a single button- the shutter button, and the other had four buttons- on/off, one for zoom in, one for zoom out, and one for shutter-take photo.BOTH versions do not work for the S4 Zoom, and I assume may not work for the K Zoom.When I synced the stick to my phone, the following happened. For the single button stick, pressing it made the zoom lens zoom in. That's it.For the multiple button selfie stick, pressing the shutter button made it zoom in, pressing zoom in made it focus.Looks like it's the basic selfie stick and self timer for S4 Zoom users.** General update:I'm still using the S4. The following issues have happened. The gallery is very slow opening. When you press it from main screen, it may take 3 to 10 seconds to open. Then when you press ""camera"" for photos taken by the camera, it make take another 3 to 10 seconds. I assume the phone memory is filled up but I can't find where the alleged 3.48GB of photos and videos are.I've dropped the phone multiple times and despite the dents and cracks, it's still going strong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJM5KI1MCPWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSR62KY#wasThisHelpful","RQJM5KI1MCPWU","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a while since we've seen Julian Bashir in the main chair of a novel. He's been moping around for a couple of Star Trek years now, and he's been given the chance to finally do what he feels passionate about- to help people. In this case, it's to prevent the extinction of the Andorians.  Long story short- Bashir and Thar are the main characters who work tirelessly to construct a cure for the Andorian's upcoming extinction and battle petty hardline politicians from both the Federation and Andor. Ironically, even the Tholians appear to be nicer people than the Andorian political hardliners.The end is somewhat predictable, but it's a ride getting there, and good to see good triumph over evil.So far, The Fall series is 2 good books for 3, which is not bad for Star Trek.ps: I was worried about the ending for Julian, but I later realised that Section 31 could get him out pretty easily if they wanted to.

"I've been on the hunt for the best carry all for day hiking for quite a while now. The other day I passed by this and decided to give it a go. How much better would it be if I could keep my back free and airy!The problem with impulse buys is that you don't know what else you could have gotten. Once I got home, I searched amazon for other lumbar packs and it seems the Talon 8 isn't top of the pile. Were they right? Is High Sierra really the best of the best?Let me say that off hand, it seems very well made. Typical brand name quality. Material is top nothc. I really doubt anything will break unless I take a chainsaw to it. However, even though nothing is likely to break, there are two phyicial flaws. One is the often mentioned thin belt strap. The other are the zippers. For this price, I expect zippers which move along the teeth seamlessly. On my one they feel sticky and for me to pull it completely on the track from one end to the other I need to use my other hand to hold the other end.I've used it twice. First time, I loaded it with 2 x 1.5L bottles of Evian water, a t shirt, mini towel, wallet and mobile and went for a half hour walk. Although the bottles are far higher than the top rim of the bottle pockets, the adjustable string kept them firmly in place. Did it feel heavy? Yes. Did they tilt backwards? Yes, but it still felt firm against my back. Did the thin front strap dig into me? Kind of, but I added something extra- a camera pouch, which I clipped over the front lumbar pack strap. This possibly added some thickness to it, thus reducing the cutting into the tummy effect. I was wearing exactly what I'd take on a hike, if I were to hike with this pack. Obviously I can't run with it, since the bottles would bounce like crazy, but it seemed doable.Second time, I went cycling for 2 hours. This time, I used the included Osprey 650ml water bottles, towelette, mobile, wallet, tshirt. The side pockets are quite spaacious- far more spacious than I've seen for dozens of backpakcs with waist ties/belts. In these, I put x2 energy bars, and my mobile as well in the left one. No problem with space, easy access to the bars. There was no sign of any wear or tear.So is this a good lumbar pack? In all honesty, I'm disappointed in it because of it's price. I paid USD$70 for the Talon 8. 2 weeks ago, I went to Home Japan store and bought a bum bag for USD$8 (yes, eight) and it had lots of space, side hip pockets, and zippers were smooth as silk. The only things missing were high density cloth materials used by Osprey, and bottle holding pockets. I definitely did not get $80 of value over the Home Japan bumbag. Still, I can't wait to use it on a longer hike- maybe it'll be worth it in the long run.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8YO2OP6ROBM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0042DWJ2I#wasThisHelpful","R3L8YO2OP6ROBM","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Although the Enterprise is on the cover, don't think this novel is all about the TNG crew. Yes, Picard and Worf are there, but they are merely minor characters in this dramatic novel which stars a cast of Cardassians, foremost of whom is Elim Garak, former Obsidion Order member, tailor, Dominion War hero, and now Ambassador to the Federation.This novel shows us what makes a good book- it's the storytelling and fleshing out characters, be they human or otherwise. IT is clear the author has put some thought into thinking out the layout of a city hitherto unknown to us in much detail, and some components of it's society. I believe that Una has done such a good job that there is potential for a spin off for each of the 3, possibly 4, Cardassian main characters. The author has done such a good job in making each one a solid character who the reader can get into.Should you read this latest installment of Star Trek novels? A resounding yes!ps: I'm going to copy Garak's way of ending personal letters - readers will know what I mean ^_^","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U743Y36CZIIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSBR5NA#wasThisHelpful","R2U743Y36CZIIW","AOXU46P5BRW2I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXU46P5BRW2I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First I was given a copy of this book for a fair and honest review. I do enjoy reading these lovely little slices of life in Canada. I love the main character and how plucky she is. Having gone through a lot of garbage, she still has a great attitude toward life in general. I don't like the boxes Amazon has here for us to fill out. There are some stories that simply don't fall into their little categories. But in order to review it I had to pick a box. This book cannot be pigeonholed. It is different and quite enjoyable.

"Linguistic scholar John McWhorter rants on the Sapir-Whorf  hypothesis that claims that the world appears different depending on the language one uses to think in.  Whorf, the fire insurance investigator, not the Klingon, noticing back in the 1930's that the Hopi language lacked modifiers and nouns for time and  tense, concluded  that  the Hopi language imbued a different world view from that of English speaking Americans.  Other extensions of this idea  argue that the richness of a language wrt conceptual terms regarding  number,  colour or snow will reflect how how speakers of that language understand/conceptualize the world differently.McWhorter's objection is that the real difference is culture, not language, and that all human beings are capable of seeing the world in the same way.  Grudgingly he admits that  neo-Whorfians have succeeded in illustrating small effects; what he opposes is granting these differences a larger significance.  The first example (pp7-9) involves cognition and categorization.  Stanford  psychologist Lera Boroditsky noted that Russian has  no simple word for pure blue, rather goluboj for a light blue and siniy for a darker navy.  Russian speakers were able to match squares corresponding to their colour words 1/8th of a second faster than squares that did not.  The same experimenter  noted that  in Mandarin time before/after mapped onto up/down, where as in English it was conceptualized as a left/right sequence.  Mandarin speakers tested on a vertical array of buttons  were  170 milliseconds faster than English speakers  whereas English speakers are 300 msec faster when using a horizontal arrangement.  (pp26-27)  (No comment from either that this may not be linguistic rather a reflection of how each group reads text, which seems  more plausible.)While  dismissing these difference as inconsequential  McWhorter doesn't  justify his conclusion, which could make one skeptical of  the arguments that follow.  Most tasks  involve both concentration  and compound judgements.  Episodic memory is only a couple of seconds long, so a difference between 1.1 and 1.224 seconds per assessment could cumulatively be significant.  It would be reasonable to consider  that we prefer  patterns of thought that would allow us to  process information  entirely within that  duration.The book certainly is interesting in its anecdotes.  That the Tuyuca of the Amazon mark sentences using evidential markers based on whether the topic was seen, heard, deduced or heard third hand or that the Nasioi of New Guinea have over 200 different word genders, South American Saramaccans can say one has ""more""  of something than another, but there is no word for less.The bte noire of the book is Alfred Bloom who observed  that Chinese is relatively free of tense and gender marker, yet the Chinese appear no less capable of  thinking  about  these matters than any other culture.  However monolingual Chinese speakers appear less willing to consider abstract as opposed to concrete counterfactuals compared to Chinese who spoke more than one language, indicating that multiple languages gave people an enhanced perspective.  Another argument against is that  many different cultures speak English, yet they exhibit differences in interests and values.  If  language determines culture one would expect greater similarity than is observed.McWhorter doesn't do as well when he admits that people who don't have terms for X, don't discuss X, but can still conceptualize about it, but this is not so obviously true.  It is perhaps a major  point of the Whorfian hypothesis that societies create terms and differentiate  them with  meaning  to be used as building blocks for grander ideas.  In a real sense this is what higher education does, initiating students with subject  related jargon and accompanying perspectives in order to provide them tools for thought.  And in the book's concluding chapter he embraces the very Whorfian notion that language can reinforce both sexism and racism, which we need to think about to circumvent.  One comes away feeling that the  real  objection is that Whorfism might lead to politically incorrect conclusions that other cultures are somehow less capable rather than different than our own.  But is that the fault of the hypothesis or its misapplication?It was an  enjoyable read, not too long (or too big) but not as convincing as the author would have liked.  Highly recommended for a book club or discussion group.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R94ZSHWIAKRR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199361584#wasThisHelpful","R94ZSHWIAKRR7","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A well written survey of archeological findings and deductive techniques used in the region, complemented by useful reference maps (pages 19 and 46) and a timelines  that mark ages from lower Palaeolithic to the late Islamic.  There's an emphasis on dating techniques, especially pottery styles whose difference in composition and manufacture demonstrate linkages to other areas, esp. Egypt and Babylonia, both of which, unlike ancient Palestine,  recorded astronomic events.  Though the Exodus is uncorroborated Rast does mention several affirming reports of events from the era of Kings 1 and 2, including finds of  red burnished Syrian pottery corresponding to the time of King David's expedition to the north.  Another interesting comment is that artifacts found in the less fertile hilltops indicate that very first settlers in the hilltops were Israelites and the conquest of the Canaanites of the valleys were conquered later, which I thought strategically similar to the placement  of Jewish communities  east of the Green Line.About 2/3rds of the book covers prehistory and the split between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, followed by a short summary of the Greek and Persian eras. A common thread is how the introduction of new technology such as clay containers for storing and transporting food stuffs, coinage for trade, waterproof plaster for cisterns  and the invention of iron implements for agriculture changed diet, longevity and encouraged the growth of larger cities.  Roman roads improved transportation  and aqueducts meant that towns did not need to be located as close to springs.  Coverage of the Byzantine and Islamic periods is  brief, limited to 15 pages,  but  adequately illustrates the relationship between  Christian and Jewish communities by referencing the  relative mix  of synagogues and churches, the former more common  to the west of the Jordan river than the east.If you are planning a trip to the area and are interested in archeological sites, Rast's book would be an excellent source to bring with you  if you looking for suggestions of historical interest.  Having  visited several times I  can recommend Meggido,  Hazor, Ein Gedi, Banias, Ir David  and Beit Guvrin, but there were several such as Taanach, Lachish, Dor, Balata and the tells (archaeological digs)  of Ashkelon and Beersheva that I was unaware of.  The book's organization appears similar to that of the Rockefeller Museum, a personal favourite,  a short walk east  along Rehov Suleiman from  Herod's Gate just outside Jerusalem's old City.  Its  sections are  organized clockwise around a central courtyard from prehistory to the present,  neatly illustrating the progression of regional development.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ66C1D6UMD8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1563380552#wasThisHelpful","RQ66C1D6UMD8N","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A revealing and wry  insiders account of Israeli diplomacy and foreign policy beginning from  the first days of the State up until the conclusion of  the peace treaty with Egypt.  A protégé of Israel's first foreign minister Moshe Shertock,  he was hired  partly on the basis of being to speak French and the fact that he owned a suit, though it becomes  obvious that analytic intelligence was also a factor.  One of the first tasks of the new Ministry was to send telegrams to various nations sending out requests for recognition.  The first problem - getting the local  post office to recognize the Ministry itself in order buy the postage on credit.Fortuitously Rafael was posted to Brussels during the cold war,  a posting he thought relatively minor until  Shertock  pointed out that this was the political heart of the new Common Market and thus essential for Israeli trade relations, which turned out to be the case.  What fascinates  are the multitude of unexpected insights into intricacies of world politics, ranging from the non-aligned movement to Soviet machinations,  the decline of French and British power in the modern era and of course the strategic considerations of Nasser and Sadat with respect to Israel and the Arab world.  Russia in particular played a triple game in India, Europe and the Middle East,  exhorting against imperialism which extending it's own influence and empire, feigning diplomatic thrusts at Suez while maintaining an iron grip in Hungary being a well known example.  Excellent portraits of Middle East Envoy Joseph  Sisco, Secretary of State William P. Rogers  and British Prime Ministers Bevin, Wilson and Heath, but not a very complete view of Kissinger, Carter or Peres.  Rabin comes off  blandly - whereas Golda was in her element with the  loose coalition of socialist leaders on the left,  Rabin was more influenced by his American diplomatic experience and tended to hold back.  Readers may also be interested in Rafael's discourse on the internal differences between Israeli political figures such as  Ben-Gurion, Golda  Meir, Abba Eban, Moshe Dayan and Prime Minister Levi Eshkol  along with an assessment of each of their styles.Often it's the little touches that both bemuse and enlighten, though perhaps exaggerate.  Who knew that it was a 7 point  Israeli  proposal to the Chinese negotiator in a meeting with UN Secretary General Tryge Lie that resolved the Korean War , or that  it was Israel's abstention on Libya based on a suggestion by Iraq that got it admitted to the UN, or when  Syrian  team  at the UN couldn't find their own town of Quneitra on the map, asking ""where is that god forsaken place""  was an Israeli who  laconically pointed it out, the response being a stupefied double take at where the information had come from.A bit plodding on the subject of the 6 Day War but one does get  the reasons for Israel's pre-emptive urgency,  one factor being the unintended consequence French  sudden volte face as Israel's primary arms supplier coupled with the rapid transfer of Russian weaponry and Nasser's ill advised dismissal of UNEF and the blocking of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping.  There are some newish observations regarding the '73 war, in particular that Israeli reassurances to the Arabs that they would not launch a  attack on suspicious Syrian and Egyptian troop movement signaled naivité and weakness rather than good will.  During the war, at least until the end, Rafael served in the Golan in combat, rather than in the diplomatic corps, but we do get a real sense of the underlying need for logistics and supply - had the US not airlifted a massive amount of material it is likely the outcome of that war would have been much grimmer.Overall assessment 4.6/5,  a worthy addition/reference to any library on the history of middle eastern diplomacy, with many considerations that apply in the present.  Just as one should look at Secret Channels: The Inside Story of Arab-Israeli Peace Negotiationsby Mohammed Haykal for an assessment of Egypt's thinking during this period,  Rafael's memoir  is also an invaluable reference on the Israeli range of views.  A downside - it's an  autobiography, there's an index at the back but no corroborating references or bibliography; otherwise a  very engaging read.

"It is rare to find a book that so perfectly captures its moment in time.  Bartley Crum was one of 6 Americans appointed by President Harry S Truman to the 12  man 1945 Anglo-American  Commission, charged with forming a resolution the problem of Jewish refugees still held in Europe combined with the then deteriorating situation in Palestine  The Commission set up a series of hearings in Washington,  London,  Cairo, Damascus and  Jerusalem, finally retiring to seclusion in  Lausanne Switzerland to write a final set of recommendations.  Between London and Cairo they manage to break up into smaller ground and review the situation in the DP camps on the continent.Crum  is straightforward in his sympathies as is his assessment of the political realities.  In overwhelming numbers,  he reports, almost without exception, the  remnants of  European Jewry held in displaced persons camps want to go to Palestine.  Europeans have  rejected them, leaving, often wanting,  them to die.  Their communities no longer exist.  They no longer wish to leave their fate  in the hands of others.  To a large extent he comes to  agree with the assessment of Professor Albert Einstein,  who's testimony takes place in Washington. (pp25)  Britain's  main interest is to maintain it's empire, and to do so it has done in Palestine what it has done in India - aligned itself with the ruling landed class who wish to maintain their position of privilege.In addition to Einstein there's quite an assemblage of dramatis personae.  For the  Arabs this includes  historians Philip Hitti and Albert Hourani, a protégé of  the wife of George Antonius,  Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood,  a representative of King Feisal who claimed that the King did not understand what he was signing vis a vis the Feisal-Weizmann agreement - in spite of an Arabic copy with an addendum written in his own hand; and  Jamal al Husseini (Ch 11), the political right hand of the infamous Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al Husseini who demurs that his cousin only consorted with the Nazis to get the best deal for the Arabs in case Germany won the war.Crum knows better.  Previously, while in Nuremberg (Ch 6) he reads through a dossier on the Mufti.  In it is a series of letters to Himmler,  Von Ribbentrop and the heads of State in Nazi Europe  requesting that Jews not be allowed to escape Europe and that Jewish children be sent to Poland for ""active supervision"" , which Crum recognizes as a euphemism for the gas chambers.Jamal's vision is pan-Arabic, one Arab unbroken nation united in Arab culture and language starting from the Atlas Mountains in the east, encompassing the Levant, Egypt Arabia.  It's also seen as public posturing.  In contrast Dr. Mohammed Fadel Jamali from Iraq sees Palestine as his country's  natural coastline.  However the most compelling Arab testimony is not made in front of the committee but in personal meetings with Crum at the King David.  One is from an unnamed member of the Nashashibi clan who asserts that Hajj Amin had consolidated his power in the 1920s and 1930s by murdering hundreds of his Arab opponents, including the murder of  Fakhri Nashashibi in 1941 Baghdad by agents of the Mufti.  He indicated that a satisfactory resolution would be an Jewish State in the western part of the Mandate, and an extension of Jordanian rule in the eastern section, hopefully rid of the Husseinis, as his clan had always gotten along with King Abdullah and the Hashemites.  He asked to remain nameless indicating that his own life would be forfeit if it were revealed.  Another was Crum's chauffeur, a Christian Arab from Jerusalem who stated that the future of Christians in the Holy Land would be better if it was under the Jews.Contrast this with the position of the US State Department and that of the British.  Early on he's cautioned by Evan Wilson, an attaché working for the State Department, that the primary concern of  both countries is courting Arab opinion to keep them out of Soviet hands.  Crum finds this unnecessarily obsequious as was the Allied response Arab threats to side with the Nazis - one would hardly expect that either regime would tolerate either Islam or the Arab oligarchy for very long.  In reviewing both the formation of Trans-Jordan and the declaration of the 1939 Peel Commission  he finds that both violate the spirit and legality of the original Mandate.  The British are also demanding that the Jewish Haganah turn in their arms and disband,  a recipe for suicide.Much ink and many pixels of layered analysis have flowed under the bridge since, but IMV this is an unparalleled account of how the A-I conflict was argued by a wide range of opinion at the time.  As many of the witnesses reported, the friction was largely generated by British and Arab interests at the top.  Though Crum's report and that of the committee was largely neglected, one senses in it a foreshadowing of Truman's final formulation of US policy.  (And there's a wonderful Truman quote near the beginning that truly reveals his attitude towards his Presidency.)  I consider this relatively short and engagingly written book and other contemporary works such as Lowdermilk's Palestine, Land of Promise (Lowdermilk testifies on pp29 and his JVA plan is expanded on in Ch. 17),  George Antonius's The Arab Awakening, and Ben Gurion's My Talks With Arab Leaders as essential references.  Most highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LI7L80I523X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FHCVBY#wasThisHelpful","R6LI7L80I523X","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Pryce-Jones performs a useful analysis of the role of the insular and often hereditary careerists in Quai D'Orsai (French Foreign Office) in setting French Foreign policy much as  Robert Kaplan did for the US State Department in Arabists: The Romance of an American Elite.  He begins with the French Intifadeh  of October 2005 when two North African Arab youths accidentally electrocuted themselves by trespassing into a power substation in the Paris suburb of Clichy-Sous-Bois sparking massive riots resulting in over 100,000 incidents of violence, the looting of shops and the fire bombing of some 45,558 vehicles.  The same kind of undermining social violence continues to the present, as France grapples with its colonialist past and the impact of the reverse flow of immigrants into France from its former colonies.Curiously France has regarded itself as a ""Muslim Power"" (une puissance musulmane - pp7). Pryce-Jones starts with  Bonaparte in North Africa and the Holy Land and continues with the system of Ottoman capitulations.  He then explores how France both funded and encouraged Arab nationalism in order to take advantage of the Ottoman decline,  though I was surprised by the omission of  the  19th century French orientalist Earnest Renan who's writings and correspondence strongly influenced the Arab world's idea of its relationship to modernity.  (See:  Hourani, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1798-1939).  Anti-Israelism:  itself  as an element of French policy has one of its origins in the 1789 declaration by Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre:  ""Everything must be refused to the Jews as a nation and everything granted to the Jews as an individual""  (pp10), reflecting an insecurity over dual loyalties, a charge  leveled  at Jews and the dominant tone of the  anti-Dreyfusards of days gone by, yet the anti-Jewish reaction in France to events in the Middle East is rarely seen in the same light.Certainly France's flirtation with revolutionary politics in the 20th century has been to the disadvantage both to itself and to the Jews and the Jewish state.  It is tempting to take the pessimists view  that the glass is less than half full, and Pryce-Jones tends to accentuate the negative.  On one hand you had the liberation of  Algerian Jews from the shackles  of  their dhimmi status through the Crémieux decree  (not mentioned in the text)  and the  acceptance of some French Jews as political figures while  on the other hand you have the France of the Petainists that dismissed and rounded up the Jews, even without orders from Berlin, and the cozying up  to Hitler's Arab ally - the Palestinian and pan-Arabic nationalist Hajj Amin al Husseini, who was first sheltered in a French villa and then allowed to flee to Egypt. Price-Jones draws parallels here to the coddling of the Ayatollah Khomeini who preached democratic reforms while in France, then did the opposite at home,  treating of Arafat and his PLO in a similar manner.Yet is it instructive to note that nations are not people, their character  is a reflection of  whichever interest groups prevail at any given time.  Certainly the French public were quite taken by the plucky little state, it's romanticized socialism  and it's numerous accomplishments, and it was interesting to note in the book's coverage of  the Suez Crisis of 1956 it French Prime Minister Guy Mollet who persuaded Britain's Anthony Eden, involving the military but concealing it from the Arabists in the Quai.  Much of the rational to undermine and perhaps topple the new Egyptian dictator Nasser for his support of the Algerian FLN.  However France (and the Jews) were tossed out of Algeria and under De Gaulle and subsequent Presidents, notably Chirac, the  relationship with Israel became  more acrimonious, and it was perhaps the French decision to cut off arms sales including parts and replacements for its Mirage and Mystère fighters  to the Israelis on June 3rd, 1967 that factored into  Israel's  to attack sooner.  At the same time Quai D'Orsay believed it was buying influence with middle eastern  dictators, terrorists,  monarchists and Islamists, but in fact it was they who were being purchased, with little to show for it in return.It's obviously not a full take on the French Republic, and since publication both Sarkozy and Hollande have taken a keener role foreign policy.  He does  quote François Hollande's assertion that foreign policy ought to have more direction from the National Assembly (pp151), and though the mills of  change within government departments grind slowly it will be interesting to see what comes next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WU7QDN18SPUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027ISAF0#wasThisHelpful","R1WU7QDN18SPUS","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For such a short book Ryle takes awfully long to state his points.  Granted it's a transcript of a series of public lectures and not a set  of polished  essays but a red pencil would have come in handy.Potentially  a rich topic,  the issue is recognizing the nature of choices between different  world views and Ryle chooses eight examples to illustrate his arguments-  A: science vs religion, B: fatalism vs free will,  C: Zeno's paradox of Achilles racing the tortoise,  D: hedonistic  vs utilitarian ethics,  E: scientific rigor vs. everyday pragmatism,  F: technical  vs non-technical frameworks, G: whether reality needs to match the world we perceive and  H: the logician's choice between applying formal logic vs informal rhetoric.  Ryle confesses he's less interested in the outcome of the dilemmas than in how one chooses between them.Zeno's non-paradox could have been dismissed  in a paragraph or two  - mathematically it's simply a question of mathematical limits where time and the traversal of space are reduced at the same rate to the infinitesimally small.  The reason Zeno never catches up to the tortoise is that he's never given enough time to do so.The other  dilemmas resolve into utilitarian choices as to which interpretation works best for a particular end.  Cases E, F,  H and arguably A are highly similar pitting rigorous frameworks which while exacting and precise are too detailed for everyday use.  G revolves the philosophical concerns as to whether or not we can believe our senses or our judgement about them as to the nature of the world.  Yet, Ryle argues, that  we know from the start that our senses are flawed and our interpretations are error prone, does not negate that they are connected to and serviceable approximations of  reality.  B, fatalism vs free will rests on the difference between looking forward into the future vs. looking backwards into the past, or in Ryle's language, the difference between anterior and posterior truths.  Before an event occurs the outcome,  though anticipated is largely unknown, and one cannot make true or false statements about the unknown.  Since future events are unknowable, neither idea can be validated, making the issue moot.  As for D, Ryle  believes that the arguments were done to death in the 19th century, a simple way to resolve a dilemma by declaring it uninteresting.Yet there are other kinds of dilemmas that Ryle ignores  such as choosing between alternate aesthetic goods - say a Cezanne vs. a  Kandinsky, or between alternate moral  evils,  choosing  under uncertain outcomes such as hiring one contractor vs another;  the relatively trivial but at often time consuming dilemmas of choosing an outfit; the dilemma of action vs. inaction.  Categorizing these  and the basis of response could have been quite  fruitful.Perhaps I'm  guilty of here presentism and  should not have been so harsh in projecting my expectations.  Writing a review is partly a dialog with the author, fellow readers and oneself  and since Ryle passed away nearly 40 years ago it's somewhat unfair that he can't have the last word.  There has certainly been a lot of work on Decision Theory from an Engineering perspective since publication of the book.  I still have  my  copy of Ryle's THE CONCEPT OF MIND  which I thought very  highly of when I was in university, but has anyone else since considered this problem from a purely philosophical  POV?  I don't know but I'd be interested in finding out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VXIB0DFQHDC7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521091152#wasThisHelpful","R1VXIB0DFQHDC7","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main idea of the  first part of the book is that altruism is a quality, in an evolutionary sense, that enhances a group's ability to survive.  Do groups operate and evolve  as if they are single organism in the same logical sense that plants and animals evolve and operate as a collection of differentiated cells?  Certainly some groups have maintained coherent stability for long periods of time.  However the majority of evolutionary biologists, which include such luminaries as Richard Dawkins,  have treated this proposition as an anathema equivalent to heresy. They argued  that the basis for altruism is no more than self interest in wanting to propagate one's own genetic material.  The authors criticize this view as stretching  The Selfish Gene idea so far that it becomes  tautological.  The authors also  object to  Dawkins  insistence that altruism be pure, with no benefit and likely to the detriment of  the individual committing the altruistic act, countering that degrees of self interest do not invalidate altruism as a separate motive.  Nor can it be claimed that individuals either  accurate calculators of future benefits accruing or that they are sufficiently convinced of the results.  (pp241)  And yet another problem is agreement on what defines a group vis a vis the relationship of individuals to it.The difficulty the authors run into is that they present the gist of  mathematical modelling (ie: the Price and Hamilton equations)  but fail to explain them thoroughly enough, potentially alienating both the mathematically literate who would prefer a more rigorous treatment and a popular audience who would likely be more comfortable with less. For the former I'd recommend Mathematical Models of Social Evolution: A Guide for the Perplexed  by McElreath and Boyd and  Axelrod's The Evolution of Cooperation for the latter.  Briefly,  groups of pure altruists  (such as Al Cap's Shmoos) are easy prey for purely selfish individuals.  However by allowing skeptical altruists into the mix  (the example offered is Anatol Rapaport's strategy of Tit for Tat), the group gains resilience against unscrupulous exploiters.  And while altruism can be innate, it can also be a learned behaviour.  Axelrod's model allows for changing strategy over time.The second part of the book considers matters of  philosophy and psychology, proposing 4 motivational models  - hedonism, egoism, altruism and their own view which they briefly label relationism, with examples of experiments used to test for each.  Chapters 6, 7  and 9 lean heavily towards the philosophical.  Most people reject pure altruism as it is easy to generate counter examples, as Hume notes, reason is capable of overriding passion,  but here again purity should not be a requirement.  Pure hedonism, the concern only for the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, (masochists invert the relationship) fails because it relies on solipsism wherein the external world is merely instrumental.  An egoist, according to the authors, is also inwardly directed , but is is much more amenable to delayed gratification of desire.  (pp226).  Both are easily distinguished from altruism, which is usually defined as seeking the good for others, however altruistic  motives do not always equate to morally good behaviour.  The authors illustrate with Shakespeare's Iago as someone who seeks the destruction of Othello for the good of society,  however because his means and ends  are malevolent we consider him more  egoist than altruist, though he himself might not.  Doctors and guards in concentration camps were trained to overcome their revulsion for the ""ultimate goal of helping the Volk"".Overall a good approach to an interesting controversy in evolutionary biology that is moderately fair to the opposing side.  The discussions are robust and the authors introduce a number of useful sources including HRAF, a Yale based anthropological database comparing the  practices of some  600 different cultures which can be used as a test of their conjectures.  IMV Sobel and Wilson are essentially correct in  their conclusions supporting  a pluralistic model.  Surprisingly they leave out Maslow's hierarchy of needs in their chapters on psychology which gives a good multi-level rational for pluralistic motivation.  Taking this further, a good argument can be made that  the mechanism that has  evolved is neither inherently selfish nor altruistic but behaves as  software that can and does  emulate either behaviour or both as the circumstances arise.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RUY3EL076TK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674930479#wasThisHelpful","R2RUY3EL076TK1","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a midsized collection of around 40 or so books of quotations, among my favourites being  a well worn International Thesaurus of Quotations which I've had since high school and Peter's Quotations: Ideas for Our Times along with specialty items such as Primetime Proverbs and As They See Us  but I had never heard of Evan Esar who was a nationally syndicated columnist back in the 1960s.

"Alain de Botton is the sort of person one would love meet over an extended lunch or dinner party,  or have as a friend to bounce ideas back and forth.  ""The News: A User's Manual""  is an upbeat and eminently  discussable reflection on the role and effect of news on society.  In the author's view, the news media should be, at its best, an educator and promoter of Enlightenment values, and  a curator of  important issues of the day.  At times it fails, its editors and writers are only human, and we, as readers fail it as well.  The question, for de Botton,  is how to  obtain our attention for what really matters.He offers Hegel's  argument that the news has supplanted religion as guiding  public attentions.  Both purport to alleviate ignorance, and provide lessons in morality and leading what each believe to be the good life.  Both alarm us to the dangers of this world, and, in a variety of ways, thus prepare use for death.  The promotion of modern celebrities is analogized to the Catholic Church's recommendation in medieval times of The Golden Legend: Readings on the Saints.  There's also the useful distinction of Aristotle's Poetics between ""horrors""  (""a meaningless narration of revolting events"") and  tragedy where sympathy is built for the victim and perpetrator alike.  He compares a short articles invoking disgust with the fascination for Medea (woman murders own children to avenge herself against her husband's faithlessness) or Hamlet, a family that engaged in a bloodbath.He neatly categorizes the role of images as twofold - in most cases merely confirming the text of the news; more rarely to create a deeper understanding and involvement, as it did for him in evoking pathos not only for child brides but for the marriage relationship as well.  De Botton is also quite adroit at using images - one notes the contrast on pp89 - the top image shows a scene at the Italian parliament  with the remark ""Important and embarrassingly boring developments in the Italian Republic""  while below a scene from Julius Caesar  captioned  ""Important and oddly fascinating developments in the Roman Empire"".  No doubt it's what happens next is what peaks our interest - if it bleeds, it leads.There's not enough cynicism, especially for cases where good intentions lead to bad results.  Journalists and their editors are not omniscient and rarely qualified with expertise beyond their accumulated observations.  Like any group they can easily succumb to group think and go no further than echoing  the rest of their community and themselves. Somewhat concerning is his justification for editorial bias (pp29).  Nor does he explore the phenomenon of tuning out other or the worry that large numbers of people get their views thru edutainment sources such as ""The Daily Show"" and ""Comedy Central"" though there is a short bit on the blinkers  created by News Personalization (pp 242) where he bemoans the loss of random serendipity which forces us to consider a wider selection of events, a topic covered at length in Eli Pariser's ""The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think.The other problem comes closer to the end where De Botton runs out of steam and writes perfunctory chapterlets on each of the sections of the newspaper: Accident,  Nature, Health, Dining, Travel, Technology,  Culture.  Yet, and possibly because he is not interested, there nothing beyond the idea of celebrity about sports teams and our fascination with strategy, nothing about Advertising, Public Announcements, the Comics (the modern replacement for the Victorian serial novel),  Social Announcements where it does not concern celebrity (births and deaths), or community news.  Nor does he mention  the reflections of other modern philosophers  on news such as Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (the audience is the product) or Chomsky (Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media).Yet the approach is infectiously gentle, and reminiscent of Paulos's A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper.  A fun idea would be to  imagine how other philosophers would have approached the same material.  Marx would have alternatively condemned the media as a tool of the bourgeoisie or as the hope of the proletariat. Kuhn might have focused on prevalent news paradigms and how they have shifted over time, Weber would have focused on different news cultures and so forth.Problems aside, to which I'd add the lack of a bibliography for reference, it's a good personal read  as well as a suitable selection for a  book club discussion group or a source of ideas for teachers or parents on how to  approach  teaching critical thinking.

"One of the more illuminating  means of discovering the past is through  its contemporary writers.  Van Paassen emerges from the same fine tradition of  in place investigative  reporting as John Gunther, Albert Londres, Edward R. Murrow and John Roy Carlson.  His first hand accounts of the ""Grand"" Mufti Hajj Amin al Husseini (who tried to have him killed),  the British authorities in Palestine and  Hassan al Bana,  offer  incredible insights into the political challenges faced by the Jews of Palestine from the 1930s up unto the first few years of the 2nd World War.The analysis and details are fascinating.  For one, he argues that the Turkish alignment  in WW I  was a result more of Russian provocation on its borders than German enticements.  A socialist at heart, he admires the industry and culture of the young kibbutzim and points out that much of the fear mongering against the Jews comes from feudal bourgeois land owners who's hold on the working class fellahin was threatened by economic modernization brought by the Jews.  He also throws cold water on the degree  that ibn Saud or the landed class  Arabs of Palestine  offered  the Allies  - with the latter it was quite the opposite  until Allenby's  final advance on Jerusalem in 1918  which consisted of  bowing to the inevitable, offering that the myth  of  Arab support was simply a product of T. E. Lawrence's  wishful imagination.  On pp295 Van Paassen tells us that  Fakri Pasha, distinguished as a mass murderer of Armenians, had assigned Captain Marek Schwartz (seconded from the Austrian Army)  with the task of destroying Jerusalem and the Mosque of Omar, should the British enter the city.  Rather than carrying it out, Schwartz, a Jew, ""spiked his guns and walked into British lines"",  later remaining in the country and contributing to its prosperity as a businessman.  The destruction of Al Aqsa, ordered by a Muslim commander, was saved that day by the actions of a Jew.There are several episodes of note.  One is a meeting with Albert Londres and John Philby (before anyone knew that Philby was a a double agent) about obtaining a visa to Hadhramaut, where Philby's influence peddling was quite apparent.  We learn that ibn Saud dismisses Hajj Amin calling him ""that dog of an idolater and Satan's spawn whom His [Britannic] Majesty would willingly chase into hell""  (pp56)  Another is  an interview with the head of Al Azhar in Cairo,  who regards the Palestinian Mufti  as an uneducated fraud and  is surprisingly empathetic with the Jews of Palestine as having  similar national goals quite similar to his own for Egypt (pp312).  The Mufti gloats (pp89) over the large sums donated by the international Muslim communities, ostensibly for the creation of an Arab University and repairs to the Mosque of Omar,  but neither project took  place.  He also describes meeting with High Commissioner  Harry. C. Luke in  over the British disarming the  Jewish settlers of Hulda in June 1929, only to be attacked and destroyed 9 days later by Bedouin marauders. (pp292)  He relates some of the less known aspects of the Hebron massacre of 1929 as he was there to witness the results.  In particular, despite  Luke's  protests that the Government was  taken unawares,  Van Paassen reveals that 10 days earlier it was Luke  who had ordered various hospitals, particularly the Rothschild clinic, to have a large number of beds ready for casualties.Particularly stirring were the acts of  sacrifice and daring by the relatively large contingent of Palestinian Jewish volunteers who fought for the Allies not in Europe or Palestine but in North Africa.  In the Battle of Mechili a contingent of 500 Jewish engineers tasked with laying out a mine field where surrounded on 3 sides by German troops with no reinforcements arriving from the British.  Jewish engineers constructed Montgomery's impregnable forts at Al Amein;  By July 1st, 1941 only 45 had survived, but they held out until the French arrival.  In June of 1942 the British were trapped in Iraq, needing in short order the construction  bridges across the Tigress and the Euphrates to counter the Nazi aligned coup - made possible by the fortuitous appearance of  Jewish sheet metal manufacturer who had been a contractor  for  bridges across the Danube and the Moldau rivers as well as the Berlin subway.  Better known was the successful attack on Fort Gourad in Syria led by Moshe Dayan who lost his eye in the battle.  Though far more famous later on, Dayan's position at the time of writing was operating a gas station in Hanita.In addition to the 30,000 Palestinian Jews who volunteered and served with British forces in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Mediterranean patrols many more contributed to the war effort through industrial production of chemicals, precision instruments, spare parts, serums, uniforms  and weather analysis  (essential to the planning of operations) for the entire Middle East provided by the Meteorological Department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  He adds that this failure of the Press to acknowledge the contribution of Palestinian Jews to the general war effort was among the best kept secrets of the war (pp172)  In this light Van Paassen found it scandalous that the British  betrayed the very principles of the Mandate by a policy that appeased Arab political pressure and blocked Jewish immigration into Palestine.One feels touched by History in a wonderful read which strips away many of the built up myths about the era.  Extremely worthwhile as a personal or library acquisition and most highly recommended!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6DW5375TCVB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0977102106#wasThisHelpful","R6DW5375TCVB3","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I  agree with several  of the other reviewers here - the best part of  the novel was the interlude in the desert where the protagonist seemed to undergo some major personal growth.  Without giving too much away, the denouement where Marid addressed ""his"" troops, since it was set up by Shaykh Reda  should have gone the other way, giving Effinger a more difficult but not impossible situation to write his way out of.  A major disappointment was the lack of new insights or emphasis that  would justify this being a science fiction novel.  Yes, there is the background of Marid Audran's wrestling with his addiction to designer drugs and neural implants, but nothing new or different from the first book of the series.  And while the technical lameness of Friedlander Bey's attempt to  cornering the market in data-link information rental market is somewhat dated given today's widespread mobile internet access could be forgiven,  not much was done with this to further the plot.Here and there  were several good character moments  and I enjoyed the introduction of the Budayeen equivalent of  Baker Street Irregulars but the overall  development was not that satisfying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BP366ZQEOYYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=076531360X#wasThisHelpful","R3BP366ZQEOYYN","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A useful exploration into the romantic European notions of what constitutes a national identity.  Kedourie pegs  modern Nationalism emerging as an all inclusive idea  requiring the consent of the governed as an outgrowth of the French Revolution but, in an interesting fashion, credits Napoleon's rhetoric which accompanied his conquests for its spread.  (pp94-96)  However, given his mid 20th century perspective, following two world wars,  he's rather disdainful of the outcome.  In Kedourie's view, the problem with using unitary definitions  such as language, culture or religion as the basis for the state is that inevitably there will be conflicts with geography - the physical boundaries of a country almost always include more than one group.  A state that insists on a single identity will inevitably be exclusionary.  He's also critical of a style of totalitarian nationalism that erases the boundaries between public and private.Nationalism, argues Kedourie, is neither a creature of the left or the right, arising from both.  In the 19th century nationalism  was considered to be highly progressive, and indeed,  Woodrow Wilson 14 Points underlining the Paris 1919  Peace Conference emphasized the acquisition of a national status for subject peoples to be amongst its highest ideals.  However as they achieved power, men such as Pilsudski, Mussolini and Chiang Kai-shek who were perceived as initially being on the left, were now viewed as being on the right.  This became instrumentalized as a propaganda device in the Soviet toolbox - if  nationalism  was against capitalism and imperialism it was progressive; when it was deemed to go against the tenets of  the Politburo, it became right wing and regressive.A strong argument cited for nationalism is that national power structures  are  an essential advantage in helping a culture to survive.  On the other hand he cites positively the longevity of empires such as the Ottoman who's system of millets allowed a plurality of cultures to co-exist, until broken apart by national ideals.  He counters the case of the Poles and the Magyars, that their historic claims to national states with historic boundaries by pointing out that while true, these were not truly nationalist in the modern sense because they were feudal societies ruled by the gentrified few. (pp119)  But then so was the Ottoman Empire and Kedourie fails to consider that large portions of the  Empire were  nomadic, up to 50%, and that the Porte would order the movement of peoples in order to manipulate the mix of ethnicities and maintain order in favour of the State.National identity is probably weakest at the borderlands - he cites examples such as  Macedonia/Albania where pollsters would switch identities as needed by the week.  Kedourie finds plebiscites (the recent referendum on Scottish Independence would be a good example) as problematic as affirmative results are usually thought of a permanent (after all, they are disruptive in a major way)  and he would rather that they be more frequent, so as to constantly reflect  the changing will the people, like elections.  He makes an interesting comment towards the end that the American/British perception of nationalism rests on an article of faith that governance by the people will inevitably lead to good government which is what makes it desirable, whereas  the concept elsewhere is that self governance is itself a good, even if it inevitably leads to tyranny - perhaps a fine distinction but an idea worth exploring.  Lastly, and no doubt this comes from his own experience as a refugee from Iraq and such events as the massacre of the Assyrians in 1933 which he mentioned passed without consequence for the perpetrators, he's somewhat dismayed that Empires, just like  Nations are equally  likely to cast aside principles  for political expediency.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T9OF157TCMD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0631188851#wasThisHelpful","R2T9OF157TCMD7","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bursting with geopolitical insights, ""Peoples of the Earth""  provides a much needed  analysis  of issues and trends relating to indigenous  rights  in  Latin America.  The well balanced arguments for indigenous empowerment and just governance are a far cry from the binary caricatures often subscribed  by the vocal fringes of the far left and the far right.  Whereas the right often portrays indigenes  as ""hopelessly ignorant, shiftless and  lazy""  and a block to economic progress (pp146),  leaders such as Chavez,  Morales, Ortega and Correa  have had  demagogic success in coopting long term dissatisfaction to achieve power, while at the same time actively dismantling the very checks and balances such as a free press, independent judiciary,  and political opposition  that provide  the foundation for democratic freedom.In the 1920s the Soviet Comintern expressed an interest in popularizing indigenous nationalism as part of their effort to export the Revolution to the Americans, yet by 1932 lasting until 1941 this cooled  in the face of potential unrest in their own periphery amongst Poles, Finns, Belorusians, Crimean Tartars, Chechens and other like peoples, which oft times resulted in  ethnic cleansing,  (pp40) .  However the Marxist dichotomy of class struggle persisted on the Latin American left, casting those of European origin as bourgeoisie  and the indigenous population as luckless peasants, which was a gross simplification amounting to a different form ideological colonization that suppressed a rich diversity of  native cultures.  Up until the 1990s indigene activism  tended to be based overtly on economic class, party lines or religion but increasingly it's become more oriented on ethnic lines. (pp44)  Also suspect are green-movement attempts to romanticize the history of Amerindians as wise and noble ""guardians of the land"", glossing over the problem that indigenous groups who often have a deeper history of inter-tribal violence, antagonism and quests for dominance that play beneath the surface.  The problem for analysts  is that indigenes have multiple identities to latch on to,While the entire book is fascinating, Chapter 6 takes a particularly interesting turn by considering parallels to other places and other times.  Anderson examines  the katarismo  ideology  taking hold amongst  the  2 million Aymara  in the  highlands between Bolivia, Chile and Peru and finds  it sharing many of the characteristics of Islamic fundamentalism in its rejection of Western models and cultural diversity.  Also discussed are some of the influences on Chavez, such as his relationship with Castro but also the ultra-right-wing ""Painted Faces"" loyal to the late Argentine Col. Mohammed Ali Seinelden who led several coup attempts, and the neofascist sociologist Norberto Ceserole who was said to been  Chavez's ideological mentor.  (pp80)  It's a potent mix of far left and right.  The chapter concludes by examining  Indian code talkers of WW I who were so successful that in the 1930s the Nazis sent  undercover anthropologists and linguists to the American southwest to not only study them, but to persuade them to create a pro-Reich fifth column. (The effort failed.)The middle section of the book is a series of nation case studies concerning the indigenous populations of Bolivia, Peru,  Ecuador, Guatamala, Chile and Columbia, and there are also references to Argentina and Mexico as well throughout the book.  .  In Chile and Argentina  the focus in on the Mapuche,  ""one of the most articulate and vocal of the hemisphere's indigenous peoples"" who  are under threat because they occupy the most desirable farming and cattle raising land and who are struggling to find acceptance as partners in the  state.  Peru brings up the ideology of  ""ethnocacerism""  founded by Marxist-Lennist lawyer Isaac Humala who claims to be descended from Inca royalty and holds that the copper coloured majority of Indians and Mestizos are racially superior.It's an informative read on the 2nd world with wide implications understanding the interplay between migrant and localized populations elsewhere.  Andersen brings up parallels not only with  the decolonization of Africa, but the subsequent  politics of such national  leaders such as Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe  and the long history of  European and Middle Eastern strongmen.  The exploitation of natural resources  in  Bolivia (lithium)  and  the Amazon  is reminiscent of Nigeria and the Sudan.  Indeed, as Andersen notes (pp178), there is a high correlations between the world's unexploited resources and the homelands of first nations.  While the desirable trend is a multi-ethnic pluralism,  achieving the right balance is difficult and there is a tendency at least in the beginning for legislative accomplishments to be as thin as the paper their are written on.Political actualization of national identity is always a work in progress.  It's a complex playing field that a single text can only partially illuminate, but it's a very good overview of nationalist issues and international relations containing lessons applicable both on the continent and elsewhere.

"Focusing mainly on ontology (the theories of what can be known) with side trips to ethics and aesthetics, this is an enjoyable but light excursion through some of the more interesting ideas of classical philosophy with additional touches of humour.  What readers may find surprising is how often these ideas were inspired by the need to support religious doctrine.  For example John Locke argued for the duality of mind and body in order to defend the thesis of the immortality of the soul  and  Liebniz’s conjecture  that this is the best of all possible worlds depends on his belief of an omniscient and all powerful God who’s infinite goodness would permit nothing less.Targeted at a popular audience the book could also  work  as a “Cliff’s notes” for  college students as it provides a rough cognitive map of the major contributors to the field.  Most of the 43 vignettes centre around an individual such as Plato,  Hobbes or Popper  rather than a school of thought,  though four center on eastern  religious/philosophic ideas.The structure of  the chapters are self similar.  Hayden  places his subjects in the context of their era, summarizes one or two key ideas which may seem strange in the present day  and then adds one or two subsequent arguments for or against.  At the end of each chapter there are one or more arrows pointing to related chapters, somewhat in the style of a “create your own adventure book”  indicating an alternate order of reading.  It is worthwhile to draw a graph using these references to gain an appreciation of the overall relationship between the topics.  There is also a brief Appendix at the end suggesting additional reading.  IMV it could have been extended a bit (say 50 chapters)  by straying into  philosophical topics such as existentialism,  deconstructionism or political philosophy.  And whereas the tag team of Socrates deserve 3 chapters, the two chapters on Berkely could have been combined and Popper’s “World 3” fit more into the theme of oddities than his more mainstream theories of scientific proof.

"An interesting survey of current thinking on the role games can play in children's education, focussing on digital environments.  An added fun element of the book are the delightfully topical and witty cartoons drawn by the author that reinforce,  summarize and counterpoint many  of the points in the text.  In lieu of page numbers and an index  they are also useful for scanning  the topics.Do games encourage aggressive or counter productive behaviours.  Moldofsky suggests not, arguing that modern parents and educators tend to err in being overly protective and that play often builds character by allowing children to explore alternative scenarios in a relatively safe environment.  He cites a negative correlation between M-class (mature) video game sales and violent crime though notes a slight  increase in truancy other negative behaviours in young boys, but a significant doubling for young girls approaching the same level.  While the data for children is used correctly, the chart used for overall violence is problematic as any increase in the rate of societal violence in the young is masked by the  bulge of the baby boom.Chapter 2 addresses the concern of gaming as an addiction but compared to other activities such as smoking, gambling or substance abuse,  it's relatively harmless.  Moldofsky does make that point that unguided gaming behaviours tend to be self reinforcing, and he cites evidence that much of addictive behaviour is related to the  brain chemistry.  Simply throwing a child into a game is not enough, the game itself does not take into account the background that the player brings to it or local goals making mediation by teachers a valuable and often necessary contribution.  He also outlines a number of psychological motivators that draw people in and make play such an enjoyable activity.Chapters 3 and 4 go beyond theory and look at the structure of gaming environments such Khan Academy, a free resource for STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Math) subjects which combines ""missions""  along with  cognitive mapping illustrating both the concepts learned and their relationship with each other.  ClassDojo relates strongly to a behaviouralist approach by using badges and points to reinforce positive performance.  Games like Evoke are online MOOCs where students interact and problem solve  learning  how to deal with topical crisis situation.  He also gives a number of useful examples where both traditional board and electronic games have been adapted for the classroom.The final two chapters are more speculative exploring the effect of up and coming immersive technology such as Occulus Rift and neuro-feedback devices.  It also looks at some of the emerging ideas behind the pedagogy of games.  There's an interesting study on ADHD.  Pushing the subject further, games have the potential of moving from  glass slab screens to the physical world by treating motion as information.  We see this in such products as the Nike Fuel Band and most recently, yesterday's introduction of the  Apple Watch (not discussed in the book), which uses haptic feedback (slight changes of pressure or vibrations applied to the wrist) to give direction (turn left, turn right), emotive response or other information, without the use of a screen.I add by way of disclosure that Mitch has been a good friend of mine for a very very long time, however  it was a complete surprise to me when he announced over lunch one day that he had written this book.  As a friend, if I hadn't really liked the book I would have kept my comments private.  However, because we are friends, part of that friendship has been common outlooks and interests.  Oddly enough,  though games and simulations do benefit many situations, other than classic games for social occasions such as Scrabble or Trivial Pursuit I'm not personally attracted to them, nor are my own children, and I tend to resist gamification.My own interest lies in the area of cognitive psychology and the potential of applying different approaches to problem solving, and in this respect the book is richly rewarding.  I found it an informative  read  that could be covered in an evening or, as in my case, over a couple of days of commuting to work.  The target audience is teachers and parents interested the strategic implication of gaming and gamification as a means of improving  the both the progress and enjoyment of  education, while also addressing many of the concerns.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38NJ6UNNLVHJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MOTO5EC#wasThisHelpful","R38NJ6UNNLVHJT","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Egypt's primary goals of the post WW II  period, according to Doran, were  to rid itself of British imperial domination and assert what it felt as it's natural role as leader of unified Arab bloc on the world stage.  Though temporarily  broke and dependent on US aid, Britain's reluctance to comply was based on its self-perception as a global power.  For Egyptians the issue were treaty rights granted under duress that allowed Britain unfettered access to Egypt as a military base of operations in the event of a regional crisis, which was at the sole discretion  of the British government and territorial rights over Sudan - in effect both anti-imperialist (against the Brits) and pro-imperialist (in favour of Cairo) at the same time.  Both had delusions of grandeur as Egypt had neither the assets nor the experience to make it a regional power, let alone the clout to justify its request for a permanent seat on the UN security council.  England, which was drawing down it's massive army deployed around the world had  the trappings of empire without the means to sustain it.  Power though is largely image.  As such Whitehall needed to maintain it's possessions in Egypt in order to resist pressure elsewhere.  However in the first few months of 1947 saw a rapid retreat from this position  with Prime Minister Clement Attlee announcing the independence of Burma, the Partition of India, referral of the Palestine problem to the UN and the renouncing of responsibility for the defense of Greece and Turkey.  (pp79-80)Much of Egyptian resentment was a result of their treatment during the war when on Feb 4, 1942, when, with Rommel's Afrika Corps knocking on Egypt's door,  the British surrounded Abdin Palace and demanded that King Faruq purge the government of Axis collaborators and install the liberal Wafd leader xxx al-Nahas as PM.  Regionally there was a concern about the growth of Soviet influence and Moscow's strategy was to dilute British influence and fill in the resulting vacuum.  The Hashemite Kingdoms of Jordan and Iraq formed a natural and pro-British alliance  adding Turkey to provide a united front,  as did Egypt and Saudi Arabia with a weak 3rd leg provided by Syria which felt threatened by Adballah's designs for a ""Greater Syria"" under his control, which the Syrians also desired, but under them.  To wrest control from the British, Cairo appealed to Washington and its anti-imperialist Truman doctrine reasoning that the US as Britain's principle lender would have considerable leverage.  Doran does an interesting analsyis of the power dynamics of the Arab League, under Secretary General Azzam Pasha, an Egyptian diplomat.The 2nd half focuses  on the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.  Publicly the Arab nations have proclaimed the easy and rapid defeat of Zionism, and  the Arab Street believes this to be true.  However in  political and military circles there is growing recognition  that the Israelis are far better organized and that the optimum response is to push forward as far as possible then turn to the UN for a ceasefire to continue the fight politically.  The Arabs are fragmented and  Doran successfully argues that defeating Israel is secondary to preventing any of their rival allies from gaining territorial or political advantage.  Jordan and Iraq are understandably hostile to the forces of Hajj Amin al Husseini (Iraq because of his role in the 1941 coup with Rashid Galiani)  and Abdullah in particular envisions taking as much territory as possible, creating a Greater Syria.  Hajj Amin for his part tries to assemble a Holy War Army (pp178)  in the environs of Jerusalem which Abdallah quickly squelches demanding that all armed factions in the area report to the Jordanian Legion.Egypt, coveting the Negev, bypasses the sparse Israeli fortifications and occupies  a thin line comprising  Majdal, Faluja, Bethlehem and  Hebron which is seen  as a bridgehead into the west bank and territory coveted by Abdallah, however the incursion lacks the essential supply lines that would sustain it, causing Nasser a serving officer in the campaign to remark that he saw  the effort as political rather than military.  And politically it seems to work, as Count Ffolke Bernadotte's final proposal before his assassination on Sept 17th  by the Irgun, ignored the UN's partition resolution,  and awarded  Egypt the entire  Negev south of the line, internationalized Jerusalem, gave Israel its gains in the north and recommended merging, the rest of Jordan (pp177).  Egypt's advantage is temporary.  When the ceasefire ends the Israelis  take  just 9  days to negate Egyptian gains  making the proposal moot.The book gets 6* for content and 4* for presentation.  Doran's analysis is deep and complex, utilizing a wide range of secondary and tertiary individuals so that an appendix of dramatis personae indicating  background and affiliation would have been quite useful.  It's not a light read but it is a solid ""must have"" academic resource with well supported insights into the motivations and conflicting priorities of the era.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KAMLRPJLEPM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195160088#wasThisHelpful","R3KAMLRPJLEPM7","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ferguson weaves for us a troubling dystopian novel of the present.  A mystery of sorts, the novel begins with the death of Laura Curtis's father in an apparent car accident.  Henry Curtis, a retired shop teacher has lost everything to a 419 scam, not out of greed, and this is a nice touch, but altruism.  Laura, a copy editor, attuned to the nuances of phrasing and against advice that she leave the matter alone,  uses this skill to track down the scammer down  and meet with him in a deadly and quite satisfying game of cat and mouse on his home turf - Lagos, Nigeria.While Laura and Henry are our entry points, this is also the story of Nmandi, who grew up learning the hidden stories of the forest from his own father.  He manages to find work as a mechanic on an oil pipeline, and he parlays the skills that he has into a mechanics job driving a truck of stolen oil from the Delta to  Kaduna in the North  with  Joe, where he befriends and takes responsibility for Anima, a pregnant refugee.  It is through Nmandi's eyes that we learn about Nigeria, which is really the primary story and character of the book - that of a tribal society and verdant land torn apart by its intersection with western capitalism and human greed.  The search for and production of oil has not only destroyed a once sustainable environment but the veneer of civilization as well, corrupting everything that it touches.It's a well paced novel  with strong elements of  social awareness offering a  tragic mix of  loss, hope and hopelessness.  The edition I have features a striking  image of Amina with 3 tribal  identification scars on her forehead, her hair and face below the eyes hidden by a deep blue cowl overlooking a rock swept plain, was a book club edition published in Canada and include an interview with the author with some questions for discussion.

"If one begins with the claim that A is the cause of B and takes this for a fact, then a counterfactual is the opposite:  if A had not occurred, then B would not have resulted.  A common example is the belief that the assassination of  Archduke Ferdinand by Serbian Nationalists led to the First World War.  The counterfactual states that without the assassination there would have been no war.  The observation that this type of statement  is highly arguable provides a rich framework  to explore.  What is remarkable is that much of this research is so recent, and it's what this collection of 13 essays is about.Philosophers look at the world and attempt to explain.  The psychologists are intrigued with the explainers.  The book contains papers from both groups, and some manage to bridge both fields.  Most of the psychologist root their approach with a brief chapter (pp201-208) titled ""The Simulation Heuristic""  in the 1982 book ""Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases by Kahneman and Tverski which characterizes counterfactuals as a mental play applied as a  test  of the initial hypothesis of causality,  whereas the philosophers in the group focus on the book Counterfactuals by David K. Lewis.  (I found a copy and looked it over - somewhat dry and too much symbolic notation to struggle through).  Another common reference was to the writings of David R. Mandel and for a taste he's also the author of Chapter 7.For developmental psychologist experimental results show that the ability to use counterfactuals occur very early in life, around age 3 or 4.  Some of the writers probe how counterfactuals affect emotions.  Near misses tend to evoke greater regret - Olympic Bronze medalists tend to be happy as their counterfactual visions consider the difference between not placing at all vs silver, whereas the alternities for Silver are Bronze, which is nearly the same and the glorious position of being first with Gold. (pp176)  Similarly when subjects were presented with situations with the same outcomes, such as having an accident,  they rated the situation having greater regret if the victim had taken an unusual route rather than if they had taken the regular route - the irregularity more likely to be seen as the cause.  Children could employ counterfactual emotions in themselves, but empathy for similar emotions in others waited until age 7.Between philosophers there is some controversy as to whether  speculations over things that haven't happened yet (future hypotheticals) qualify as counterfactual enough.  Over generation  of alternate hypotheses also muddy the field - what if Ferdinand had been killed at a different time, or by Croatians, Russians or Turks, or if he had been killed by a knife or a banana peel put in his path  - there are an infinite number of causes that are entirely similar, but they do not invalidate the premise.  Nor are low probability causes (he was killed by aliens)  or results (he had a miraculous recovery) worthy of consideration.  Counterfactuals also have to be seen as controllable - a discarded cigarette may be the cause of  a fire, the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere, while necessary, is not  (pp179).  We do reduce causes to classes of causes  (the ArchDuke was killed by a adversarial group - we don't care how, who or precisely when),  but the usable counterfactual if not a polar opposite  has an entirely different saliency wrt normal events.  Counterfactuals also require a priori an understanding of causality.  Dorothy Eddington points out (pp234)  - one of the problems in dealing with causality is the difficulty of distinguishing laws-like behaviour from incidental generalizations.Many of the observations are just plain fun.  In Sobel's Ch 6 we learn from  Slolnick and Bloom (2006)  that children are able to distinguish between fictional worlds: They know  Batman knows that Spongebob is a fictional character, and vice versa, but Squidbert is as real to Spongebob as Robin and the Joker are real to Bruce Wayne.  This breaking of the 4th wall may also contribute to our fascination with literary crossovers, which are themselves counterfactuals.  Other entertaining aspects of the book are the various scenarios where subjects were asked to use counterfactuals to determine causes, such as the case of a crime figure who was given a slow acting poison by one assassin, but who's  car was rammed off  a cliff by another. (pp157).A very well written and informative read but highly academic.  Often there's quick but unexpanded references to other papers but this would be expected by the  target audience  of  upper level university students who will find this an excellent resource for essays and understanding the related issues, teachers and those with a very strong interest in cognitive psychology or the philosophy of logic and knowledge.  With these caveats in mind, it's quite recommendable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1360GZ7MUY535/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=019969513X#wasThisHelpful","R1360GZ7MUY535","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And if I can believe firms like Consumer Physics by this time next year I should be able to purchase an inexpensive tricorder that uses the cloud to crowd source the composition of objects such as food, plants and soil through a digital signature read by a hand held spectrometer.On the other hand Star Trek's hypo spray was invented before showing up on TV and used for mass vaccinations in Africa.  Perhaps some remember a short lived 1970s TV series Probe where protagonist Hugh O'Brien used an early prototype of Google Glass (video pickup but audio only feedback) connected to a computer centre  (Google/Yahoo/Bing) headed by Burgess Meridith (fantastic character actor BTW)  which he queried  to find out people's background, location related data (Maps)  and identify objects (Google Goggles).  And whereas that old favorite flying car is not likely to become an everyday reality,  the  Leap Motion Controller controller and Kinnect are  practical and more important, available Minority Report style  user interfaces.  Recently at Toronto's Mini Maker Faire  I was able to view  a demo of 3D food printing.  Though not  even close to the speed and utility of a replicator... yet,  it's technically feasible or  to create a  hybrid device that given a command ""Tea, Earl Grey, hot""  it would,  2-3 hours later,  have manufactured a sturdy plastic cup with the likeness of Patrick Stewart on the side and filled it with tea.  More importantly, low powered  devices like solar lamps, cell phones and crank powered radios promise to bring the benefits of 20th and 21st century technology to hundreds of millions of off grid people around the world.The book focuses mainly on the implementation of different types of user interfaces that appear in science fiction films and TV.  There is quite a bit of cultural reciprocity involved, to some extent real world engineers are inspired by the creative visions of filmmakers and vica versa.  But whereas film can gloss over  technical difficulties, economic infrastructure required and usability issues,  real world design has to not only live with these but also  fill in the details.  Nevertheless the authors are able to provide a number of stimulating examples where these problems have been overcome and useful products created.Aside from providing good design advice the book is also a pleasurable romp through the history of science fiction movies, from the Georges Méliès very early Le Voyage dans la Lune   ( featured recently in Hugo)  to District 9  and Iron Man 2.  There is also a very good summary of the evolution of UIs used in the Star Trek universe.  However there are some noticeable  gaps - the authors don`t consider the espionage genre .  The Bond films  abound in gadgetry, The The Prisoner subtlety  and  Get Smart`s ""Cone of Silence""  is a wonderful send up of technology gone wrong.  Nor, 1 meagre reference to Asimov's 3 Laws of Robotics as the only exception,  are written works such as  Heinlein's Waldo, Pohl's Heechee spaceships or Asimov's  The Foundation Trilogy  consulted, even though there's terrific  description of a UI for visualizing history contained therein.Caveats aside,  it's a fulfilling read, copiously illustrated with full colour slides  that will jog your memory  and  well worth  adding to your personal or corporate library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNRRRHZ3YMWUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009EGPJCU#wasThisHelpful","RNRRRHZ3YMWUY","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a devoted fan of the Alex Rider series since the debut of Stormbreaker in 2006, and this final installment maintains the high quality fast paced thrill of adventure that distinguishes this eminently readable collection.  Designed as a junior James Bond, Alex is always presented as the reluctant teenage spy.  His nemesis, SCORPIA, is an evil organization for hire which masterfully uses murder, torture, blackmail and subterfuge to achieve its ends.  Countering this is a sometimes morally questionable MI6 run by the outwardly stiff and bland  Alan Blunt, his mint sucking second Miss Jones and Smithers  the somewhat puckish stand in for Q, who finally gets in on the action.This time out SCORPIA is hired to ""convince"" the British government to return the Elgin Marbles to Greece.  They  develop an elaborate plan of deception to implicate Alex in the murder of the US Secretary of State (obviously Hillary Clinton, but unstated) and  blackmail the British into submission.  MI6 takes the bait and Alex soon finds himself planted in a elite school in Cairo, this time accompanied by his legal guardian Jack Starbright, bringing her into the danger as well.  There are also elements of previous episodes in the book.  Julius Grief, a malevolent clone  altered to look like Alex from  Point Blanc  has a pivotal role,  and  Joe Byrne  (the book's Felix Leiter) also makes an appearance.Horowitz not only has a gift for describing action but he is also an expert at getting us inside his character's thoughts and he adroitly inserts plot elements early on which are later used to good effect.  It is a pleasure to read his work and the only regret is that this is the last book in the series as Horowitz promised that he would stop when Alex turned 15.  Though there's still some wriggle room for the author as Alex hasn't actually had his 15th birthday in the book.  Like Rowling's Harry Potter series,  many kids grew up with Alex, and while another teen adventure novel is likely out of the question,  perhaps we can hope that Horowitz will revisit his character at a later age to match his grown up audience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBSFDCI6MNG5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142419850#wasThisHelpful","RBSFDCI6MNG5P","AY7ZS03I9M3PY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AY7ZS03I9M3PY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I really enjoyed this fun and super hot read, the characters are sexy and the plot was interesting.

They quickly discover they have a lot to learn in this adult world, and there is a lot more than what you find in text books.

"This book introduces you to the sexy and fierce Lisa, the girl-next-door turned zombie killer who is horny but frustratingly the lone human among zombies. The story has a nice flow that keeps your attention. As Lisa reminisces on her previous sexy conquests it comes into stark contrast with her current dire circumstances. With no time to waste with pretenses the dominating side of Lisa comes out, and she wants to play. With plenty of sexy scenes, fast pacing and gory clashes with zombie this story was definitely out of the ordinary. I really hope there is a sequel, I want to see what naughtiness Lisa gets up to next and what happens to Jimmy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DB3R0RLKA3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RPP06M#wasThisHelpful","R25DB3R0RLKA3W","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked this short, meaningful story. The author states that it was originally written as a screen play and after listening to it I'd love to see it as a film. As the story unfolded I found myself pulled into the story. Well written with deep meaning and interesting characters (that I'd like to know more about!) this is a story about life choices, making up for the past and what happens after death. I couldn't get this out of my head and found myself dwelling on it hours after I finished it. It has a great ending that is quite thought provoking. It's just under an hour long which is the perfect length for a gym session or commute.

"I never read a romance type of book like this. It is not like 99.99% of others in that there is an actual story line with great characters that you come to enjoy and love. Noah had me laughing hard. He is the no-nonsense type who kicks ass and takes no prisoners.The love story background of Jackson and Jen was very cool. Falling out of the exact same tree 10 years apart, as they each watched the other. Emily was right, it made a great love story in the first book in the series, Control. In this book life throws them crazy curves. I'm now a fan of M.P. Lodi and can't wait for her next novel. I hope soon as I have a feeling Noah and Emily will have some adventures in New York from the sound of it. Oh...I forgot. There is lots of incredible sex if you are into domination and fantasies. All consensual though with safe-words etc. This is definitely not for non-mature readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131KR28DF0065/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S67PFY#wasThisHelpful","R131KR28DF0065","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this story and all the unique characters. The chemistry between Raph and Mac is well written, you’ve got two guys who go way back and it’s apparent in their banter. With the ability to almost know what the other is thinking they make a great team and also know just how to push each other’s buttons. When their friend Sam comes to them for help finding his younger sister it looks like a simple enough case. But as soon as they start digging into Alison’s disappearance it becomes apparent there is a lot more going on than first meets the eye and things escalate very quickly. I liked the supporting cast of characters (James, Toni, Annabel, and Alex are some of my favorites), they all have a lot of heart and personality. I look forward to book 2, in which I’m hoping some of these characters make appearances, maybe it will be about another case that Mac and Raph are working on?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZR0FY74HBPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4ZQ1NW#wasThisHelpful","RTZR0FY74HBPD","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The main characters are Sophia and Cove and both are living with emotional scars from their pasts that have caused them to make some not so positive choices.

"As I pass every chapter by through this book, something about it evokes in me part of a remote memory, one of a novella, an old novella by Austrian writer Artur Schnitzler, this book whose English version is known as Dream Story, while in its original German Traumnovelle, first published in 1926, I believe just as the others before me mentioned, it shares an immense thematic ground with the 2014 The Ascent of the West.Even though one is set in Vienna of the time, while the last is contemporary, fringing back and forth over scenes from a nigh future, I tell you there's a line of parallelism striking cross this novel and that novella, that most reveals itself in the image of the secret society and the masked ball.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21C8MIWGZC8DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O75RNDG#wasThisHelpful","R21C8MIWGZC8DP","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I’m a big fan of interracial erotica and office romance, both gay and straight, so I was pretty sure I’d like this book. Though to say I liked it is an understatement.

"Loved this story, it definitely feels like the Golden Girls meet Harry Potter and mischievous fun ensues. It has an interesting concept of having magic regulated by the government and class 6 wizards working as consultants. This read like a detective novel and I enjoyed trying to fit the puzzle pieces together as they are discovered. I liked that Josephine actually acted her age. Too often stories with old characters in young bodies act their looks, not their actual mental age, which when you think about it really doesn’t make sense. I also appreciated how clean this book is, nothing overtly sexual or too gory (even with some dark subject matter) and no swearing.

"Probably my favorite aspect of this novel (besides the very hot scenes) is the mischievous sense of humor throughout. With Steamroller’s plotting who knew what would happen next… I also liked how realistic the story felt, which pulled me in and made me wonder how much of it is true and came from the author’s personal experiences. Especially as a lot of this story is told in great detail.The theatre scene was vibrant and comes alive as the central point that pulls all the characters together. Set against the serious backdrop of Perth, Australia, the dramatic and colorful cast of characters (mostly actors) made quite a statement. I enjoyed following Orlando, Stephen, naughty Ms. Watson, Jan and others as they get up to no good and liked seeing their relationships develop.

"I’ve become a huge fan of this author and after finishing his Gamers and Gods trilogy I was excited to sink my teeth into this series. We are brought into this unique semi post-apocalyptic world where the current situation is well presented and explained without feeling like you are being talked down to, instead you get to see things through the alternating character’s eyes.The creativity and intelligence that went into this story was just as impressive if not more so than the previous books I’ve read by Mr. Kennedy. The concept of the “Pathspace” was unique and interesting with a bases in real life physics. That’s part of the beauty of this story, the feeling that everything could really happen. A sci-fi world that is believable really helps to pull you in as it is quite easy to suspend your disbelief. I also liked how he brings in current real-world affairs and shows the possible consequences of even well-intentioned beliefs.I highly enjoyed getting to know the characters and found myself rooting for some, disliking others and genuinely caring about most of them. The psychology behind some of the character’s actions was complex and realistic. A character driven novel with magic, war, underdog heroes, aliens and themes that will make you question your actions and their effects on this planet and future generations, I’d say this was a great beginning to another amazing series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTBJHTQ6257S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PR1Y1PC#wasThisHelpful","R1QTBJHTQ6257S","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After the way the first book ended I couldn’t wait to dig into the sequel. This picks up right after the first ended and takes an interesting direction in virtual reality that I did not expect, and have never seen before. I liked how the author handles this unique scenario and characters. With the Greek Gods meddling things once again get complicated and when Sekhmet gets added to the mix things take another interesting turn. Between the fascinating characters and unique settings I found myself immersed in this book from beginning to end. The pacing is really good, just fast enough to keep your interest without getting confusing. It’s hard to fit this book into one genre but if you’re a fan of sci-fi, Greek mythology, online virtual reality, fight sequences or even romance you will enjoy this series.

"I’ve been on a bit of an Aussie kick lately and since I’m a fan of erotica I thought I’d give this book a read. It is one of the hottest gay eroticas I have read, from one sexy scene to the next no details are left out. I liked how realistic and convincing the characters are, with a good amount of character development. I also couldn’t predict what would happen next and got thoroughly pulled into the story. When Kev meets a gang of hot Tahitian boys the story almost gets too hot to handle. This was a fun and unique read with lots of sexy male on male action.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMWOSNRNJM13Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPRYU5I#wasThisHelpful","RMWOSNRNJM13Y","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve been a fan of this author for some time, speed reading through her Sibyl Potts series as I couldn’t put them down. This looks to be the start of another great series full of unique and fun characters. I really like the author’s sense humor, I seriously snickered out loud several times during this book at the crazy situations Rose manages to get herself into. Although probably my favorite thing about these books is the fantastic grammar. Seriously, I’ve read so many self-published books that it is a relief to read one that is not only well written, but spell checked and edited.

"It’s quite apparent from the beginning of this series that the author has extensive experience in the military, which really brings an authentic/realistic feeling to the battle scenes. They come alive and pull you in. After getting to know Captain Michael Sheridan in the first book I couldn’t wait to see what he would do/go through in this sequel. After discovering how the Kurgan operate I was interested to see how the characters would use this knowledge and what new things they would discover in this continuation. I found myself rooting for Cole, Tarina and others to make it through to the end of this book, with the bloodshed in war I knew any character could die.The realistic writing combined with an interesting storyline made this a very captivating and satisfying read for me. Although the combats and maneuvers are intricate I never felt confused about what was happening, which considering the chaotic nature of warfare made the writing even more impressive. If you’re a fan of sci-fi, you will enjoy this series. If you’re a fan of intense war stories, you will enjoy this series. If you are just looking for something gripping and unique, then this is a series for you.

"This book was not what I was expecting, which was just a fun relaxed read. Instead I was thrown into an action packed world that brings together characters from ancient Greek mythology and virtual gamers in 2051. So needless to say I was hooked quickly and instead of relaxing my heart was racing as I was pulled into this fantastic story. The author’s creativity and great writing is apparent very quickly as the characters are introduced and the story begins to unfold. I love when a story mixes folklore from the past with modern day (or future) settings. What makes this story so unique is the use of the virtual gaming, which is complicated but easy enough to follow. I really liked this story as I play online games (WOW anyone?) and I’m a big history / Greek mythology geek but I think anyone with a sense of adventure would also thoroughly enjoy this novel. I can’t wait to dive into the sequel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJEEKJZJS5ZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ4C1Y0#wasThisHelpful","R1YJEEKJZJS5ZI","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the descriptive narrative of this novel and the pace at which it progressed. In a world where there is no petroleum and librarians are detectives you are introduced to Pratima, a young student and researcher in her early 20’s and William, a teen who has spent the majority of his life in libraries. They may be young but their knowledge, determination, and life experiences are exactly what is needed to stop an evil plan in their chaotic world. Along with a great cast of characters these two are set on a dangerous path to stop an attack that would end many lives. In this future setting knowledge gained from books is precious and should not be abused, unfortunately there are those who will. Thankfully there are those who will fight for what is right. I highly enjoyed this story, the sweeping landscape and the characters and look forward to more of Pratima’s adventures in this well-crafted realm.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJCFX5PPVP0FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKFFOSE#wasThisHelpful","RJCFX5PPVP0FH","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a child every time I got sick my mom would inevitably mash up some raw garlic and chase me around trying to force me to eat it. I’m not sure which was worse, actually eating it or the breath and burping that would last for hours… But as horrible as it was it really seemed to give my immune system a great boost. As an adult I am so glad there are options like these supplements that give you the same health benefits of garlic, but without the horrific side effects! No more flower wilting breath, just improved health. These are some of the best supplements I have purchased, hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23F4182KGXPIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYK3MMA#wasThisHelpful","R23F4182KGXPIE","A2GD79I5YOLNCD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GD79I5YOLNCD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like hot short story compilations as I can usually finish at least one whole story before my stop on the train ride home from work. And what’s more fun than reading an erotic story while surrounded by strangers who are oblivious to your enjoyment? These stories did not disappoint as they jumped right into the exploit and descriptively brought the action to life.

"I have a different Lampat lamp at home and bought this one for my husband to use in his office. So far he says it has really helped him have less eye strain and he really likes the USB port at the back to charge his cell phone. Not only is it functional it is aesthetically pleasing as well, which was part of the reason I wanted this one for his office. He said that his colleagues have commented on it and have asked for the brand and where he purchased it. Didn’t realize how much attention a lamp could get!

"I’ve been dabbling in graphic design for a few years and have been teaching myself with every resource I can get my hands on. This book is exactly what I needed as it has taken my limited knowledge of color applications to a more professional level. For years I have played around with hues, saturation etc. on pictures and while I liked the final results I didn’t really understand what I was doing. I had never heard of hue similarity and found the information and examples in this section extremely useful. Sometimes I don’t like the way something I’ve worked hard on comes out and I’ve been stumped on how to convey what I want the picture to say.

Each character has an in-depth history which really brings them to life by adding depth and realism to the story.

"I'm rather excited to write this review.  It's so nice to get something that really lives up to its name.  I have some Thayers open now and the bottle is still pretty full.  Normally would have finished the Thayers before opening the Dickinsons, but when I received this after reading all the great reviews, I just had to try it.  So, I washed my face, sat down at my makeup table, splashed some toner on some cotton balls and began to wipe my face.  My initial thought was hmm my face feels clean and refreshed, then my pores caught my attention --- My pores literally looked like they were diminishing with each swipe.  I'm 50 and I have great skin but my only issue is my pores.  They're not huge and probably not as bad as I think, but because they're noticeable to me I'm always searching for that next product that will actually shrink them.

I really like the fold out stand, which is handy for watching/reading stuff, and makes the phone especially easy to hold onto when I use it as an e-reader (for ebooks from the local library system). Two minor things: 1) the fold out stand is now loosening up enough that sometimes it folds out when I don't want it to (it used to click positively into stowed mode, now not so much), and 2) it fits in the case firmly, such that even after all this time it's difficult to get out.

"This product seems well designed, and the manual is comprehensive. The flashlight is bright, and all functions seem to work well. As with all such devices, it's a good idea to read and understand the manual in order to maximize the life of the battery and the device itself.I am confused, though: in section 4.3 it sounds like the device is not for *directly* charging cell phones, as it says: ""disconnect the smartphone or PDA first from the USB charging port before cranking (the crank charges the internal battery and by design, the smart device must be disconnected first to prevent the phone from power cycling and reduce the load on the crank"". Also in section 5.5 it states ""it is not intended for recharging fully a discharged cell phone battery... a fully charged Adventurer will only partially charge a cell phone or mp3/mp4 device. After the battery stops charging the device, begin cranking... to continue charging the cell phone."" I think that could all use some clarification in the manual, and maybe have someone else not familiar with the device proofread it for clarity (as some of it could be rewritten to better serve the purpose). Also, at least one other person here has said they've charged their phone with the solar panel: is that advised? From reading about the crank and how it needs to be used correctly, I'd rather *not* use it if the solar option works as well (and I understand it could take longer).I should also say that I've spent the time writing this review and questions because of how great customer support is in responding to reviews.

The on-off button on the top of the GPS is right up against the clamp, but that's due to the size of the GPS. I was initially worried because the bottom of the holder isn't quite flat (like it's been stuffed with too much beanbag filler), but it's never moved once when in use. I was kinda hoping the the inside of it was big enough to store the GPS when I wasn't using it, but no such luck.

"Great drumset, really a lot of fun. The picture (like many other product pictures) isn't really indicative of actual use, because everything plugs into something else so there's cables all over. But Alesis also sends some black wire ties to help keep things in place, so there's that. Also note: unless you are playing at very low levels, it's not recommended to use any old amplifier with this: you need one built for electronic drums, or a keyboard amp, or you'll thrash in to death (presumably because of the frequency range and dynamic range of the drum kit's output). Also note: it's not completely quiet: even in a room with the door shut the kit can be heard else where (especially the kick drum). But as they say, that's just physics.

"I happily give this item 5 stars for doing what it is supposed to do, and doing it well. I had no trouble using this with my Windows 7 laptop and my Cisco 7960 VOIP phone (no phone amp needed). But be aware of these things:-- the binaural phone headset I tried with it (Plantronics HW261N Binaural Headset) is either not built to provide stereo sound, or the ZoomSwitch doesn't support it. This is no problem for phone calls, but I was, at the time of purchase, in a sucky cubicle environment (and anyone who claims they're good for ""collaboration"" needs to just admit they're for ""packing more worker drones into less space"") and wishing to use my headset to listen to music or waterfalls, so I could do less unintentional ""collaborating"" while I was trying to get things done; and not having true stereo sound was a deal-breaker for me. I'm not sure if a different headset, or using one of these (ZoomSwitch ZMS15-PIGTAIL Soundcard Headset Cable Adapter - DJ9930) and a true stereo PC headset would help, but I suspect that phone systems, and the phone/headset side of the ZoomSwitch, are just not designed to handle stereo signals.-- the ZoomSwitch is a USB device that will show up as a second sound system to your computer, which adds complexity and possible confusion until you get things set up correctly; but does allow you to do something cool, if your phone software supports it: I can have the ring sound and regular system sounds come through the computer speakers, so I don't need to wear the headset all the time, only when actually on a call.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YPXFXJ1J7QL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BK5IBE#wasThisHelpful","R1YPXFXJ1J7QL3","A26S0R5B6D0BP9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26S0R5B6D0BP9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:-- feels great: because, like a beanbag, it conforms to the shape of your head and shoulders-- the buckwheat hulls do mean a cooler sleep (in my case, not a completely cool sleep, but at least the pillow allows some of the heat to escape away, not hold it all against me to form a bowl of noggin sweat soup).-- the cover feels strong, and the zipper tough enough to hold everything in (pillow case recommended)Cons:-- this pillow is not very pretty. Because it's half-filled with loose buckwheat hulls, it doesn't retain any shape like a regular pillow.-- it's a bugger to work with, in terms of trying to get it into a pillow case or even just move it around: it's heavy, and gravity does what it does best.-- it's loud when you move it around or punch it into shapeBut those things are okay, and I'm still giving it a 5-star review, because it's just the physics of the thing, and I'd read enough about these pillows to expect all of that.Protips: if you let it hang and get all the hulls in one end, then fold the empty case underneath, it's firmer and better-looking, but for me at least it's then uncomfortably high; also, this would be wicked cool in a pillow fight, if there were no rules and you had no sense of fairness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5T4TK6CL3QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MI13K4#wasThisHelpful","R3R5T4TK6CL3QO","A26S0R5B6D0BP9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26S0R5B6D0BP9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These look good on my son's '98 Crown Vic. When they arrived the box was so thin I thought we'd somehow only ordered one, but there were four of them in there: they don't use the tabs and metal rings I've seen with other wheel covers, but instead just have a series of metal clips along the edge that hook over the lip of the rim. Two of these clips wouldn't work on the car until we gently pried them outward with a screwdriver, then they snapped on (and it felt like the plastic cover was nearing the point of breaking, because it's kinda thin). Time will tell if they stay on; they seem solid enough now. Here's the kicker, and the reason I only gave it three stars: the box they came says ""Wheel Skins are designed to stay on the vehicle's wheels and are not designed for frequent removal. To remove Wheel Skins, remove the wheel from the vehicle to access the Wheel Skin's retaining tabs and proceed with care."" I don't even understand that, because to remove the wheel you'd have to remove the lug nuts, which are behind the wheel cover; and there are no tabs, just clips. So I worry that these are single use wheel covers, especially if one tried to remove them in winter, when the plastic would be cold and brittle. I'll post an update in a few weeks or months.UPDATE: after 5 months of use, I can say that they've held on pretty well, except 1) lost one while driving (probably too fast) in a couple inches of water after a flood; and 2) after getting the tires rotated, the tire store (that's all they do is tires) didn't put one on good enough and it fell off and got driven over and it broke. Given all the issues above, I think I'd take them off and put them on myself when work needed to be done; or, more likely, I'd just not buy these.

"It is not too common that a small production company makes a wonderful film with a nice story line, cast and nicely done overall. The Legend of Longwood is a wonderful dramatic story that will be enjoyed by most who sees it.The main genre of this film is drama with a sense of adventure and fantasy thrown in. Also, they include from time to time a bit of comedy making the story enjoyable, yet thrilling.The story begins when a young girl named Mickey (Lucy Morton) is torn away from New York where she lives with her family because they have to move to Ireland on almost the opposite side of the world. She arrives sad and depressed. To add to the problems of leaving New York, she leaves behind the memory of her passed away horse which is the only connection she has to her dad.  (If you want to find out more about he dad, you have got to watch the film!) She and her family settle in and she soon learns about a legend and starts a massive and dramatic adventure along with a discovery which leads to a very unexpected ending.This film is a wonderful production with nicely executed shots and story plot. You never expect what happens so it is just a thrilling thing to watch. The director, Lisa Mulcahy, really excels at creating a compelling story with everything in perfect position. The only con I have is that the acting with some of the younger talent is a bit dull at times. Also, they move through conversations so fast that I missed important parts of the story, making me wondering what happened later.My favorite scene is when a elderly lady tells Mickey the story of the, 'Mysterious Black Knight' which is a 300-year-old legend. It is shown through animated pictures and narration and becomes a very, if not the most, important part of the story.This film really has nothing too mature for kids, so I recommend it for ages 9 to 18. I also give it 4 out of 5 stars because, although it is very nicely done in terms of directing, story and camera shots, it lacks somewhat in terms of acting skills and feels rushed at times.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

"Maya the Bee Movie is a cute and funny movie! It’s about a young little bee named Maya who is very curious and eager to learn about the beehive. As Maya explores the beehive without permission, she asks a bunch of questions. Maya quickly learns that she is completely different from the other bees. She repeatedly finds herself in trouble by Buzzlena, the queen’s assistant. As a result, Maya gets banned from the hive. Her friend Willie does not want Maya to be alone, so he leaves the hive and follows her. As Maya and Willie are out in the meadows, they learn that hornets and the other bugs and insects are not as bad as they have been told. While Maya has been banned from the beehive because of her curiosity, Buzzleana devises a plan to harm the Queen so that she can take control of the bees and the hive.There are several different messages in this movie. The one that stands out the most to me is, “dare to be different.” In this movie, the bees have to follow specific rules, specific directions and they must do as they are told. Maya is different and she is told that she does not belong in the beehive. She works hard to find her place among the bees. She learns that she is an important bee in the kingdom and that her voice is important.My favorite part is when Willie is mad at Maya and decides to fly back to the beehive. Willie is scared of everything. But, when a frog sticks out his tongue to try to capture Willie for dinner, Willie hits the frog’s tongue and flies away without looking back. That’s pretty impressive for a fearful bee.My favorite character is Willie. Willie is a very loyal and a true friend. He supports Maya and helps her when she’s down and he’s not afraid to tell her when she’s not right. Willie is also very funny.Maya and the Bee Movie is a wonderful movie!

"Who knew that being so square could be so cool! Big Block Singsong is a terrific musical, visual DVD romp. Creators Warren Brown and Adam Goddard have hit the creative mother load here - what seems so simple is so deceiving in its well-designed construction - the 'simple' individual block characters sing a two-minute nicely produced song that covers subjects from noses and hair to emotions of sadness and happiness, so you see the sky's the limit, or not. Two of my favorite pieces are 'Octopus' who is so proud of his eight legs and 'Moose' who touts the joys of visiting the park. If I was a betting man I'd bet you couldn't watch just one, could you, I bet not.This might be the best invention since the Wheel! Simplicity and cleverness of design mixed with catchy songs and melodies. Great to look at and fun to hear. I'm 65 and mesmerized ... the colors and movement will entrance toddlers while adults will get the in-jokes. Each two-minute animated song is a complete story and true to its mission of making what might be a mundane single word into a revelation that being so square could be so cool. I love that some of the lyrics are above the head of the little ones. It doesn't matter because the visual and audio support each other so wellThe songs are positive and supportive and applaud individualism and uniqueness. I bet this DVD will get worn out from repeat viewings!The DVD cover shows the diversity of each character, an animated block that is colorful, very fun-looking and inviting. The technical features are all sound but the joy is letting each of the 24 segments play through. Cool!The kids really liked this program. They watched it with interest and they were excited for each next song to begin. They laughed and jumped around during the song about hair. We watched it in two sessions because it was a little long for them to watch in one session. They lost interest halfway through but came back excited about it again later. They loved the different colors of the blocks and were interacting and discussing the songs with each other.""It's big music!"" ""My favorite part was the hair person that had hair all over her eyebrows."" ""We liked everything."" ""We liked that it said, oh yeah!"" They really liked the format of short, fun songs, laughed hysterically at the hair song. The baby had his eyes open really big. They also liked the space song. Thought it was really cool. ""We learned about colors, fruit and flamingos. The owl looked so mean."" They were loud and enthusiastic about each new song. The baby cooed at the fruit song. Very enjoyable for all, ages 4 months to 5 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW17VFL9NHPS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0JTYJC#wasThisHelpful","RW17VFL9NHPS5","A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 50th Anniversary Edition of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The Sound of Music is a must-have for every family.  This 5-disc DVD set includes the movie in HD and standard definition, a new 60 minute documentary called The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg and lots of other special features.The Sound of Music is the best family film of all time because it brings  everyone together with its great, true-life story of the Von Trapp family.  The songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein are all wonderful and unforgettable.  Each song is a masterpiece. Some might think Frozen is an amazing movie musical, but Rodger and Hammerstein’s The Sound of Music is a million times better!  The quality of the song writing just cannot be compared with anything else.The Sound of Music stars Julie Andrews as Maria, a young Austrian woman who is training to be a nun at a monastery.  Christopher Plummer stars as Captain Von Trapp, a wealthy Austrian naval captain who hires Maria as governess to his seven children.  It was directed by Robert Wise.  It won five Academy Awards including Best Picture.The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg, which is included in this 50th anniversary DVD edition, is informative and revealing.  We go behind-the-scenes to visit the original locations in the film: the monastery, the Cathedral, the Von Trapp estate (which is really a classical music school) and a 100-year-old marionette theater which was the inspiration for the puppet scene in the film.  It is wonderful to see Julie Andrews so excited about coming back and visiting the film's locations after 50 years.For those who love the songs, the 50th Anniversary DVD Edition also includes the original soundtrack from the film. And there are lots of other bonus material, such as Music Machine Sing-Along;  Audio Commentaries with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, and Director Robert Wise; A City of Song—Virtual Map of Filming Locations in Salzburg, Austria; Vintage Rodgers and Hammerstein and The Sound of Music programs; and more.The Sound of Music is appropriate for all ages.  The documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg is appropriate for those ages 10 to 18. I rate this new DVD set 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Clayton P, KIDS FIRST!

"This is a fantastic collection of My Little Pony episodes. My Little Pony: Keys of Friendship is a collection of the best episodes from My little Pony including a sing along. And, if you are as big of a fan as I am - you will be very entertained by this collection.This collection has more than just favorite characters - there are a lot of family matters, some good lessons, a lot of comedy and some pretty thrilling moments as well as great and catchy music.The episodes show, as usual, the pony friends learning about friendship. However, Twilight, who recently became an alicorn (unicorn and Pegasus) doesn't feel like she is doing enough of her job as a princess. However, she will become more important than ever when an ancient beast comes back from his prison to rain chaos in Equestria! (The country where ponies live.)I thought this was a very smart choice of episodes since the DVD contains about half of the full season. These episodes really are exciting and, even though some people may not know it, pretty funny and really show some good lessons. For example, in one episode about family, ponies argue a lot but at the end they are still just a family.My favorite episode is when one of them learns that she is a cousin of another friend. When they realize there may be an error, they go on a road trip to find out the truth. On the way there, the family argues and feels bad that they may look like a dysfunctional family. At the end, they see that even though they argue, they are still a great family. I like it because so many families in real life feel are like that and we all need to understand that it happens with everyone - nobody is perfect.There is nothing parents should worry about and even infants will like the bright colors of the show and its wonderful sounds. I give this DVD an age rating of 1 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST!

"What an exciting and thrilling blockbuster! I was worried about this film. This was the 8th add on to the Planet of the Apes series, second to the reboots. So this Is a sequel and an eighth movie. I expected that it would feel a bit stretching, but it isn't. In fact, Dawn of The Planet of The Apes' main purpose Is to show another side of these super apes and to set up the story for the next film in the franchise.This isn't just about fighting; in fact, fighting scenes, even though they are epic, take very little part of the film. There is romance within humans and apes families, sometimes, the apes can act funny. Dawn of The Planet of The Apes is thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time! Also it has a story line no one expects!The original Planet of the Apes book is about humans that went to a planet ruled by apes. When they come back to Earth, the same thing happened to our planet. The reboots, (Dawn of The Planet of The Apes and Rise of the Planet of the Apes) are pretty much prequels. So, Caesar leaves civilization with his ape friends while the human race almost goes extinct due to a deadly virus. The remaining humans struggle for power. Will they be able to find a new source of power or will it be up to the apes and their leader to decide the humans' fate?For me, this is a fantastic addition to the series. They don't try too hard to make it too action-packed and cool looking. The apes look extremely realistic and I really like that. They include some scenes from Rise of the Planet of the Apes which helps to pull it all together nicely. The action and fighting even has some stuff from the original 1963 Planet of the Apes book! The director made it a perfect length and, in fact, this is the first time I've seen what I would call a ""trailer"" movie (a movie that looks like an hour-long trailer for the next one in the series) that is entertaining and includes a surprise ending.My favorite scene is when we see a small group of humans working on the power station. When they wake up, the youngest is sitting with an ape that acts as a teacher to young apes and is very loyal to Caesar. The kid gives him a book and reads along with him. It shows how well they actually understand each other and how alike humans and apes are. It shows friendship and how two creatures of different species can be friends.This film has some violence and intensity so I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic graphics, a well planned story, excellent cinematography and stupendous acting.Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"It’s been years since the Decepticons and the Autobots battled for the fate of the humans in Chicago and human defenses against alien forces are at an all-time high. A government branch of humans is targeting all Transformers, Autobots and Decepticons alike, with the help of a menacing assassin. While all of this is going on, Cade Yeager, a struggling inventor from Texas tries to make enough means to keep his property and put his daughter Tessa through college.  While looking for parts to help his inventions, he stumbles upon a broken down, rusted truck and decides to fix it up. To his surprise, the truck turns out to the mighty Optimus Prime. Cade fixes him and decides to help him defeat the forces coming for Earth yet, again once he realizes what the government is doing to Transformers. Now, the fate of the entire human race lies in the hands of Optimus and this family of humans and, without them, we might just face extinction.This film is entertaining and visually very well done. Director Michael Bay uses the first IMAX Digital 3D camera, making the images more immersive and stunning than anything that’s been seen on the big screen so far. It’s very intense to be sitting in the IMAX Theater seeing these 50 ft. robots captured in such a realistic way. If you’ve seen any of the previous films from this franchise you know that they are nothing short of action packed. The cinematography and CGI is able to show the intense battle scenes and large scale attacks in a breathtaking, edge-of-your-seat way. One thing that I don’t like about the visuals is the inconsistency of the Transformers from film to film. The main characters look the same but some of the Autobots that are introduced in this film are designed completely different than in any of the previous films. Their faces are constructed to have features that look extremely humanesque and it is strange to see them next to Optimus and BumbleBee who still have the classic Transformer look. Another inconsistency is that, in the last film, every time a Transformer was hit they would spill a blood-like-liquid, but in this film, if they are injured, the liquid that comes from the wounds is bright green.It is very strange to see a Transformer film without Shia Labeouf but, I am quite impressed with Mark Wahlberg and the way he tackles this role. I think he’s a fantastic actor and really grounds the film. I’m also a fan of Nicola Peltz and think she is decent in this film. However, I am really sick of the way girls are portrayed in this franchise. Every single leading lady looks like a Victoria’s Secret model, is completely helpless about 75% of the movie, can never figure out how to help them self and has to be told to run before they do. Near the end, they have one moment of courage and that’s pretty much all. It’s a formula that is completely predictable in all of the Transformer films, but alas, it’s what sells.Like I said before, this film is entertaining and it enjoyable. It kept me engaged, concerned for the characters, shocked and, I’ll admit, I did almost cry near the end. However this film is peppered with extremely cliché and honestly annoying lines and interactions. From the very beginning, Tessa is introduced as a stereotypical film version of a teenage girl. She rolls up with her friends screaming and giggling about how excited they are to party and be crazy. The whole interaction is cheesy and unnecessary and sets her up to look like a bimbo. After that, her boyfriend, who looks suspiciously similar to the Hemsworth brothers, comes to save the day and the rude, inappropriate and just plain stupid things he says to Tessa’s father drove me insane. There are several lines in the film that prompted me to say to myself, “Really? Was that really necessary?” The last irritating thing is the fact that they really drove the whole “American Way” and patriotism to the ground. In every seen at Cade’s ranch there are at least two American flags shown and it is constantly mentioned that they’re just good ole’ Texas folk, protecting America with cries of: “Don’t mess with our country!” “Think of your country!” “Fight for your country!” Previous films were less centered on our nation and more about the human race as a whole.Despite my qualms regarding this movie, it is entertaining and the visuals are extremely well done. I give it 4 out of 5 stars and recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 due to the violence and language. However, if you have seen the previous films and are under 13, then this film should be suitable for you. If you're a fan of Transformers, action or just want to experience the first film to ever use the million dollar IMAX Digital 3D camera, be sure to check out Transformer: Age of Extinction in theaters now.Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST!

"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an awesome animation! It is adventurous, funny, and suspenseful. The producer (Bonnie Arnold) does a great job keeping everyone on the edge of their seats throughout the whole film.How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an incredible sequel to the first movie.  It is a 3D animation about a boy named Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his dragon, Toothless (Randy Thom), who are trying to stop a bad Viking named Drago (Djimon Hounsou) from capturing all the dragons and making an army out of them. Hiccup and his friends must work together in a battle to protect the peace.This movie has you feeling many different emotions throughout the film.  It is suspenseful, funny and even a little bit sad.  The amount of thrilling scenes in this film is incredible.  I kept wondering if Hiccup and his friends were going to get caught when they went on all their adventures.  How to Train Your Dragon 2 is also very funny.  All the characters and the dragons have a good sense of humor.  The characters scripts are hilarious and the dragons have very comical body language.  The animation in this film is also amazing. The 3D animators do a great job with the special effects.  The dragons look like they are popping out right in front of you! My favorite part of the movie is when the two alpha dragons fight with each other.  I like it because the special effects make it look like it is happening right in front of me.  Like I could reach out and touch them!How to Train Your Dragon 2 has a great message.  It shares with us that you have to believe in yourself if you want to accomplish big goals or dreams.  This message is used a couple times with a couple different characters throughout the film.I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it is suspenseful and funny.  Kids and adults will love it, especially those who love fantasies with dragons and Vikings.  I recommend How to Train Your Dragon 2 for children ages 8 and up. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy.Reviewed by Jeremy B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"Never have I seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one. The Fault In Our Stars is an exceptional movie that will have you crying, laughing and anxious all at the same time. It is based on the amazing novel written by John Green. In this movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace, a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Ansel Elgort plays Gus Waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well. They fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep, slowly and then all at once. Their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in Amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy.  This movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner. I absolutely love this film.There are so many great aspects about this movie that it’s hard to highlight a few. However, one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning. It creatively captures a teenager’s perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer. It reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it.  John Green knows how to grab the audience's attention by intertwining the two most heart-wrenching aspects of life - love and death. Another thing I really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on. I read the book a few months ago and I loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity. I didn’t feel like there was anything missing. Overall, this movie is extremely great and I want everyone to enjoy it as I did.My favorite character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things. She teaches Gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion. Hazel knows she’s going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too. I think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to Hazel Grace.My favorite scene is when Hazel, Gus and Isaac go to Isaac’s ex-girlfriend’s house. Isaac’s ex-girlfriend, Monica, dumped Isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind. Right before the surgery, Monica dumped Isaac and never even asked if he was okay. Hazel, Gus and Isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house. This part is so funny because Isaac is blind and he can’t see where he’s throwing the eggs. This struck me as so funny because he’s throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but Hazel and Gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement. It is just a funny scene.I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children. I am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours. This is an amazing movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends. It comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie, you won’t regret it!Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"The movie Sophia Grace & Rosie’s Royal Adventure reminds me of a Cinderella fairy tale.  There are two bratty sisters and a very innocent one named Abigail.  It is similar to the Cinderella story because Abigail has two girls looking out for her as if they are her fairy godmothers. This movie is definitely an exciting royal adventure.The story begins when Sophia Grace and Rosie are sent on a special assignment to meet the princesses of Switzelvania to see which one will be crowned Queen.  However, they loose their guardian and become mistaken as the King’s great grand nieces.  They end up having to teach the King’s daughter, Princess Abigail, the ways of being a real princess.  In the process, they get thrown into a dungeon because the bratty princesses (Abigail’s sisters) don’t want her to become Queen.  However, at least they have their secret weapon.  To find out what that is, you will have to watch the movie.  In the end, everyone gets what they deserve!My favorite part is when the security guard tells the guardian, Phyllis Bunt (Amy Louise Wilson) that she can get out of jail if she reveals her true identity.  She gives a made up name of Dynasty Composition knowing no one believes her real identity anyway.  However, the security guard lies and won't let her out.  Phyllis then jumps the security guard, ties her up and duck tapes her mouth.  I didn’t see that coming!  It is hysterical.All the characters are great, especially Princess Cordilla (Emma Pierson) one of the princesses who makes fun of Abigail.  She has a funny voice and isn’t very smart and plays the part well. The main idea of this movie is that if you believe in yourself, you can make anything happen.I recommend this movie for kids ages 5 through 12.  Specifically, girls will enjoy this movie, as every girl wants to imagine herself as a princess at some point. Therefore, I rate this movie a four out of five “dazzling” stars!  Sophia Grace & Rosie’s Royal Adventure is available now on DVD.Reviewed by Haley P. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"SlugTerra: Ghoul From Beyond is an entertaining, action-packed animated film. This movie brings a new face to the slug. Instead of being creepy crawlers, they are warriors that can save the world. This makes the movie even more humorous to watch because these cute creatures are nothing like the slugs we find on earth.Eli and the “Shane Gang” has defeated the evil Doctor Black from corrupting all of the slugs in SlugTerra but evil still runs rampant in the 99 caverns. For a short time Eli and the gang are able to stop the villains from doing any real damage, but nothing can prepare them for what they encounter: a Slug that can do something no one in SlugTerra has ever seen or heard. The gang must find a way to help win the battle against a great evil. Eli on the other hand must engage in a very different type of duel to save the slugs, his friends and himself.This movie is perfect for the SlugTerra fan. There is more action and humor than ever before. I love how each slug has a unique power that helps them in combat. For example, Hoverbug has the power to fly, while Frost Crawler can protect itself by forming a sheet of ice around itself. Some slugs have “safe” powers like Boon Doc who can heal both humans and slugs. Other slugs can be harmful like Tazerling who zaps his opponents. My favorite character is a slug named Burpy because even though he is small he is a huge help in the battle.Sam Vincent does a great job driving the story as his character Eli Shane. Lee Tockar adds amazing humor to the movie as his character, Pronto aka “Pronto the Magnificent.” The message of this movie of this movie is ""don’t lose hope, always keep trying.""There are many things that come to mind when I think of this movie. The eye-popping animation is one of them. When the slugs are launched into the air, it looks as if they are coming right at you!SlugTerra is best for boys ages 8 to 11 and I give it four out of five dazzling stars. SlugTerra: Ghoul from Beyond is available online and comes to stores June 10th so to check it out.Reviewed by Simone S., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"X-traordinarily perfect! I’ve been waiting for this movie for a while and what a payoff.The future, as we know it, is a wasteland for mutants: hunted and eliminated by the Sentinels. To stop this from ever happening, Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent into the past to prevent this dark outcome.I adore the X-Men series and to see it again is beyond fantastic. Bringing back the original iconic actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto) makes me overjoyed! Even the younger versions of them - Micheal Fassbender and James McAvory are their own 3-dimensional characters because they’re not trying to be replicas of their older selves. Their interaction and relationships are strong and, just as in “X-Men First Class,” I love seeing Eric and Xavier just talking. These two started as friends and the film shows that perfectly. They have different pathways and ways to fix events but they never give up on each other.The action and special effects in this film are grand. Showing different mutant powers is what made X-Men unique to begin with. It’s not entirely combat action, like “Avengers,” it’s more letting their powers do the work. Magneto slowly lifts an entire baseball stadium, which allows us to marvel at how powerful mutants can be.The story is astounding! This film has to pick-up from the previous films and tie-up loose ends. Not only do they succeed but, they also remember little details. Example: the young Wolverine doesn’t have metal claws. They’re bone because he doesn’t get the metal ones until sometime in the future. Specifics like that add to how incredible this film is.It can also confuse people who haven’t seen the other films. There are inside jokes and character connections that could be lost.My favorite character is Quicksilver (Evan Peters), a mutant who has incredible speed.This is by far the best representation of a comic-book character. Evan shows the mischievous and cocky side of Silver that is always a kick to watch.My favorite scene is Quicksilver’s super speed sequence. This is when the team breaks Eric/Magneto out of a Pentagon prison and the group is cornered by security. Quicksilver, without a care in the world, pranks the guards by poking the bullets in mid-air, pulling their guns out of their hands and more. This is such an incredible ride that it just needs to be experienced.The message of this film is, “Choices you make in the present, affect your future.” The whole reason for this story is that one careless act has changed the world forever. We need to think through the choices we make to have a bright future.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 13- to 18 year-olds. This film shows dark images and language that is not intended for younger audiences.Reviewed by Keefer C. B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"Maleficent is a remake of the Disney classic ""Sleeping Beauty."" I assumed that I knew what it was going to be about but, it turned out to be a totally unpredictable and amazing movie. Maleficent is about a betrayed fairy (Angelina Jolie) that curses the king's infant daughter Aurora as revenge. She soon discovers that when Aurora grows up, she is the only one who can restore the peace and happiness that everyone needs to get them out of the depression caused by revenge and war. This movie takes ""Sleeping Beauty"" and turns it into a completely different movie.By far, this is the best Disney movie I've seen and one of the best movies I’ve seen in a while. Everything is just right. For example, the music sets the right mood in every scene. It is strong and loud when it needs to be and quite and shy at other times and, at certain points, it is playful and happy. It really pulls the whole movie together. Along with the jaw-dropping music, this movie has amazing actors starting with Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning (Auora). They fit each role perfectly almost as if they were born for these roles.This movie is very interesting to watch because it isn’t entirely based on ""Sleeping Beauty"" so you get to see a completely different side of Maleficent before she becomes the villain that she is known as. Throughout the movie I found myself wanting the movie to go quicker to see what would happen next but not wanting it to end anytime soon. I think that the director Robert Stromberg and the writers Linda Woolverton and Charles Perrault really outdo themselves with this movie because I cannot stop obsessing about how great it is.I give this movie 5 out of 5 perfect stars and recommend it for ages 9 to 18. To be honest, this movie is a movie that you should be sure not to miss because IT IS THAT GOOD!Reviewed by Samantha A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"I was pleasantly surprised by this original and great story. Son of Batman is a great, action-packed animation many people will enjoy.This film has a lot of elements to admire - thrilling Batman-class fighting that kept me excited and at the edge of my seat. There is also some romance between Batman and his 'special person' which is short, but nice and I thought it fit well.The story starts when a training camp is destroyed. A young boy escapes with his mom and flees to Batman who, as it turns out, is the boy's father. For his safety, Batman takes the child and, as Batman, tries to protect and train him. Batman teaches his kid to take criminals alive but, a new mystery arises - one that will have a significant impact on the story line. We join Batman, Robin, and Batman's son as they face off deadly people while Batman makes sure his kid doesn't hurt himself. It's a fun and action adventure that all Batman fans will appreciate!Overall, I think this movie had some ups and downs. The animation is rather interesting but, I thought it was a bit too much at times. It is gory at times, yet plastic and 2D like most superhero animations. I believe that the animators could have cut down a bit on the violence and mature content. Also, the animation of the faces looks a bit fake to me. The directing is interesting. I thought that the angles were good and fit the storyline quite well. The voice-overs are excellent.  For example, Jason O Marra who is the voice of Batman, doesn't show much emotion and talks in a quiet and dark whisper - perfect for the character. The plot is original and surprising, which I am fond of. For the most part, Son of Batman turns out to be a very unexpected and surprising adventure.My favorite scene is the first scene iwhen the academy is destroyed. Even though this is a sad moment, it sets the tone for the entire movie. I love scenes that may not seem important but have a big impact on the rest of the film.This movie has lots of adult lines and a lot of gory scenes, so I recommend for ages 11 to18. I also give it 4 out of 5 stars because of some hiccups with the animation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIP3A4X6ZXT7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GZ0ML4C#wasThisHelpful","RIP3A4X6ZXT7T","A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This movie is about Shaggy and Scooby winning a trip to WWE city to see WrestleMania.  The gang runs into trouble when Scooby is accused of stealing the WWE championship belt. Some of their new friends must prove Scooby’s innocence before it’s too late and the mysterious Ghost bear ruins the main event.  Daphne (Grey DeLisle) is my favorite character because she is in love with John Cena and it reminds of me of myself when I have a big crush on a celebrity.  I love when she confesses to Fred that she gave John her phone number, cellular number, email address and home address.  That is pretty funny and cute and - Fred gets jealous. Scooby (Frank Welker) is my second favorite character because I love his voice and he is a better fighter than Shaggy because his moves are so swift and smooth.I enjoyed the wrestling scenes in this movie, especially when Scooby is dreaming of being in a video game and he is up against a slice of a pizza, two delicious hotdogs and a huge cup of soda. My favorite scene is Scooby playing the bonus level of the video game by doing Sin Cara’s victory dance because Scooby has some nice dance moves.  I is really cool to see WWE city animated because you get to experience what it is like to be a wrestler and what it is like to see a fight in the stadium. The upbeat music allows the audience to feel the excitement of the opponents. My least favorite part is the beginning because it takes forever to get to the plot and I is confusing for the first 30 minutes of the film.The moral of the film is to not allow one’s anger to turn into revenge.  It’s okay to be angry. It is not okay to act on the anger and make bad decisions.  Parents should be aware that there are fighting scenes and a Ghost bear before allowing small children to view this movie.  I recommend this movie for ages nine year to 18 years. I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DG0Z9T3L1L42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCR8VFA#wasThisHelpful","R3DG0Z9T3L1L42","A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Poppy Cat Birthday Treasure and Other Adventures is an exciting, funny, and adventurous series of animated films for preschoolers. They are based on the best-selling books by Lara Jones. They have a lot of bright colors and friendly characters throughout the film which will keep kids entertained for a long time.This DVD is a collection of seven animated films. In the main episode, Poppy Cat is celebrating her birthday. She receives a lot of presents from her friends including a treasure map. Poppy and her friends journey to the Mystery Jungle to find the treasure.Each episode on this DVD takes you on a different adventure and they all are really cute. The characters are friendly and treat each other nicely, which is good for preschoolers to see.  Each episode only lasts for eleven minutes so it is a good length for young children whose attention span is pretty short. The episodes are full of bright colors that are very appealing and I think young children will really like. The music is very pleasant too. My favorite episode is “Marshmallow Mines” because one of my favorite characters, Rocket Cat, is in it. Rocket Cat is brave and thankful throughout the episode, which I really appreciate and I know parents will too. Another great thing about this DVD is that it made my imagination fly. I immediately wanted to create boots that had magnets in them so that I could walk on walls, just like Rocket Cat.What I like best about Poppy Cat Birthday Treasure and Other Adventures is that each episode teaches an important lesson about friendship and teamwork. At the end of each segment, Poppy Cat’s owner explains the message and gives examples.I give this DVD 5 out of 5 stars because it is educational, adventurous and funny. I recommend it for kids ages 2 to 5, especially for kids who like animals, music and bright colors.  I think young kids will really enjoy the friendly and silly characters.Reviewed by Jeremy B, KIDS FIRST!

"This is a breathtaking masterpiece of art that allows your mind and heart to soar like the wind .The story is loosely based on the real life story of Jiro Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). He dreams of flying but, because he's nearsighted, decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and, in the process, falls in love with Naoko (Emily Blunt). Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along?The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky, the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan, so American voice-overs are dubbed over the animation and yes, it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan, such as the Kanto earth-quake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.My favorite character is Mr.Caproni (Stanley Tucci) a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war, but a creator of dreams.My favorite scene is the last dream sequence, after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.The message in this film is, ""Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect."" Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft, determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices, he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him, ""Did you have a good ten years?""I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11 to 18-year-olds. This film shows people smoking and deals with serious issues of the time. This is a must see film!Reviewed by Keefer B, KIDS FIRST Film Critic.

"This movie creates a touching new twist on a story that might have come across as corny, but doesn't. Mr. Saajan (Irrfan Khan), a retiring accountant, is grieving over the death of his wife and Lla (Nimrat Kaur), a young mother, desires more attention from her husband. Lla sends her husband a special lunchbox and, by accident, the lunchbox is delivered to Mr. Saajan instead. Realizing the meal was misdirected, Lla writes a letter, places it inside the next day's lunchbox and what unfolds are sincere and beautiful messages that changes their lives.The plot's not unique, but the writers produce an atmosphere in this script that sets it apart. Shot in Mumbai City, India, we roam through the streets and are allowed to observe the people, their traditions, their homes and their work establishments. The dialog is in English much of the time but at times in Hindu with English subtitles which immerses you further into the culture. Irrfan and Nimrat's characters have their own stories that are spectacular to watch and, once these characters start writing to each other, we see a whole new side to both.My favorite character is Mr. Saajan. Khan creates this man who reaches out to someone who he does not even know. His role is heartbreaking to see and you feel the emotions he is experiencing. For anyone who has lost a loved one, you can really identify with his emptiness.My favorite scene is when Mr. Saajan is watching a show that his wife had taped. He remembers watching her and watching the show that made her laugh. You see his face change as he understands the joy she got from the comedy. We see how, a moment that brought joy in the past can still bring joy now, only in a different way.The message in this story is, “Sometimes the wrong train can bring you to the right station.” Lla is unsure what to do when she realizes the lunchbox is going to a perfect stranger. Mr. Saajan is not sure what to do when the notes start to touch his heart. So they both feel they are on the wrong train.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to age 11 to 18.

"If you are a family film lover like me, then you'll love ""Wide Awake."" It's a wonderful family film that deals sensitively, and even with humor, with a fairly unusual situation for the screen: a 9-year-old's struggles with his faith in God.In this movie a young boy learns lessons about life and God during a trying year of discovery in fifth grade at a Catholic boys' school. As the school year opens, Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross) is sad over the recent death of his grandfather (Robert Loggia) . On his first day at school, Joshua is harassed by the class bully. Because his grandfather played football, Joshua tries out for the school team, over the objections of his parents (Dana Delaney and Denis Leary), two physicians who don't like the risk of injury. But Joshua is not very athletic and does not make the team. Joshua continues to seek answers from God about his grandfather, so his teacher, Sister Terry (Rosie O'Donnell) advises him to approach a cardinal who is coming to visit the nearby girls' school. Joshua meets a young girl at the school and falls for her. As the year goes by, Joshua continues his quest for spiritual answers and finds them in unexpected places, such as a winter snowstorm.The main characters are Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross), Mrs.Beal (Dana Delany), Sister Terry  (Rosie O'Donnell), Neena Beal (Julia Stiles), grandfather Beal (Robert Loggia) and Mr.Beal  (Denis Leary).I like this movie because of that way that it is structured, meaning the way that it is put together, the characters seem as if they already knew each other for a very long time.I would recommend this movie to kids age 5 to 12 but, it's really a family movie that parents would enjoy as well. I give this movie 4  out of 5 stars because some of the music doesn't go well with the scenes.Reviewed by Valdi B., KIDS FIRST!

"This is an animated action thrill ride. Marvel heroes Ironman (Adrian Pasdar) and Hulk (Fred Tatasciore) battle a new villain named Zzzax (Dee Bradley Baker). However these two Characters have a long road ahead of them to become an unstoppable team.What is very unique about this film is the animation. When an action scene happens we see fantastic effects, like the dust when a character falls. They have bright blues and reds in this and it’s electrifying.  The writing is comic book style, we have the hero say a witty remark then, they fight, only to say another witty remark. It brings audiences back to the good old days of comic book lines and it’s perfect for this setting. The characters are well established.  Whenever you get two well known characters together, you get to experience entertaining interactions.My favorite character is Ironman  / Tony Stark (Adrian Pasdar). He’s a crime fighting, egotistical, billionaire. I enjoy Starks personality - a guy who is so full of himself and yet so likable. Plus when he has the Mark VII Iron suit on he’s a powerful ally.My favorite scene is when Hulk and Ironman battle Zzzax for the last time. This is your big ending battle that every super hero fan looks forward to. It’s everything I dreamed it would be and more. Also to top it all up, Hulk wears an Ironman Suit.The message of the story is, “Two heads are better than one.” Hulk and Tony don’t get along at first and they don’t work well together. Half the time Hulk uses Ironman as a club. Soon they learn that they need to work together to conquer villains.I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5-12 year olds, because the kids will enjoy the action and the funny remarks from the characters. You can call some lines corny, but to me it reminds me of the comics I know and love.Keefer B.

"“Ender’s Game” adapted from the worldwide best selling book by Orson Scott Card is a must see event. 50 years after an alien race tried to colonize earth and millions of lives were lost, the International Military continue to strengthen their forces in hopes to prevent and eliminate any possibility of future attacks. Young children are enlisted in a program that trains them to fight and learn strategies through intensive studies and video-game like activities. The best of the best are then sent off to boot camp in space to be trained to lead and fight in the military. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is an extremely gifted boy who is recruited by Colonel Gaff (Harrison Ford). Gaff believes that Ender might be the only hope left for the human race and intends to train him to lead the International Military. Will the fate of the entire earth be too much for young Ender to cope with?I am absolutely in love with this film. Not only is it visually breathtaking in Imax, but it has so many emotional layers that touch on an abundance of issues that surface in our society. First off, the cinematography and CGI is absolutely flawless. I love the design of the Space Camp where the recruits are trained. I also thinks it’s cool that although “Ender’s Game” is very futuristic, they didn’t go overboard with the advanced technology which makes it seem as if these could be things we could see in the future. I really like the fact that there is no obvious makeup on the child actors. Since they are only children and are playing children in the film, the makeup artists kept them natural looking and allows their blemishes to be shown which is something you don’t typically see.This film is so emotionally intense. I honestly was speechless once the film was over. “Ender’s Game” is 2 hours long and I could have sat in that theater for several hours more. One thing that really stood out to me is that this film touches on the topic of sending children off to war and the detrimental effect it has on their emotions. This is a serious issue in our society today because, even though we aren’t sending 12-year-olds off to war, so many of our troops are fresh out of high school and are in no way ready for what they are about to face. This film shows how the effects of war and violence weigh on the children and how they are broken down and built back up into people lacking empathy and emotional stability. It was brought up a lot that if these kids even come home alive, there isn’t much left of them. Another issue that is prevalent in our culture that is also addressed in this film is the fact that realistic, violent video games are completely desensitizing our generation to the very real issues of violence in our world today. In the movie, the kids are trained by “playing” several different war games -from contact strategies on teams, to video game-like exercises that test their ability to control a space fleet. They are playing these “games” and not being able to fully understand how what they’re doing will affect others. I also really enjoy the fact that so many different cultures are represented in this movie. A lot of times we just see films that are centered around the U.S. and our own customs but, “Ender’s Game” really shows how all cultures and ethnic backgrounds are affected in these ways.I like so many characters in this film that it’s hard to pick out one favorite. I obviously loved Asa Butterfield's character, Ender, because he does a ridiculously outstanding job of portraying the complexity of his character. Ender is going through extremely rigorous training that pushes him both physically and emotionally and he has to deal with his own issues of being either too empathetic or too quick to violence. I also really love Bonzo, played by Moises Arias, because I think Moses is a fantastic actor and I’ve only ever seen him in more comedic roles. To see him play such an intense role is really powerful. This film also has some other fantastic young actors such as Abigail Breslin, Hailee Steinfeld, Aramis Knight as well as incredible adult actors such as Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. Overall this film has an outstanding cast and characters.I give “Ender’s Game” 5 out of 5 stars because I feel like words can’t describe this film. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It entertained me while also getting me to think about real world issues. I do however recommend this film for ages 13 to 18. This film is very intense emotionally and visually. There is quite a bit of violence and even though it isn’t over-the-top gory, it is very realistic. This film left a big impact on me emotionally and younger children may not be able to handle that type of intensity. But if you are over the age of 13, I strongly recommend it even if you aren’t necessarily into sci-fi or futuristic films. ""Ender’s Game” has so many layers that there is something for everyone, So head to your local theater because “Ender’s Game” is showing in Imax and 3D now!Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST!

This was an amazing movie that lets us see just a few of them in their everyday lives - caterpillars, ladybugs, bees, wasp, butterflies, beetles, snails, grass hoppers, spiders and many more.The cinematography is breath taking. I still wonder how they got a camera tiny enough to fit into an ant colony so we could watch them store food. Watching a spider eat a shrimp under water is head tilting.It is an amazing film which lets you watch insects being born. I never thought of bugs as cute before. Well, maybe a lady bug and I do have a pet preying mantis but, this film actually made me want to pet a few of them. You could actually see that bumble buzzes are cute and fluffy, that snails fall in love and ants like to have clean faces. The birth of the insects is fascinating. They all come from eggs and eat them when they are born. Then they dry off and are ready to play in the world.My favorite scene is watching a butterfly come out of its cocoon.  They are stunning and you get to see every detail of their beautiful wings. I also loved watching the lady bugs take off and fly with their hard, bright red spotted shells and hidden wings for flight.The caterpillars are very cute. There is a large variety of them, all with different faces. Viewing the flowers waking up each morning and how they wrap themselves up for a good night sleep was stunning. I never knew how insects got pollen and now I do.The time lapse photography of watching a Venus fly trap capture a bee is another wow moment in this movie. This is a visual film with the audio being that of the surroundings. Insects don’t really talk so it is all about natural sounds. I recommend this film for ages 4 to 18. I think an audience as young as 4 would love this movie.  It might seem a bit long so I would split it up into a few viewings. For bugs lovers, this is a must see. I give this movie 4  Twinkling Stars.Even though this movie gave me a new prospective on insects and I found them to be incredible I think I will still keep my fly swatter handy.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

"This movie is amazing! It is pretty scary at times and really cool. It also had a lot of action and suspense, but it also is kind of confusing at times because it switches back and forth through different worlds a lot.This movie is all about a girl named Jane (played by Natalie Portman) who is a scientist and is the girlfriend of Thor (who is played by Chris Hemsworth) who found this place that had a red substance under a rock called the Ether. This substance is absorbed into Jane’s body and whenever someone touches her, the Ether zaps them by using her energy and makes Jane pass out every time. There are these evil elves who are trying to get the Ether to destroy the whole universe. The leader of the elves is Malekith. Now the king (Thor’s farther) advises against going against Malekith but he does it anyway.The main characters in the movie are Thor, Jane, Loki, Malekith, Odin, and Darcy. My favorite character in this movie is Darcy because she is really funny and really cool. She is also pretty amazing to help out to save the world.My favorite part in the movie is when, at the very beginning of the movie, Jane found a building that seemed normal but when she went inside they found out that in the building there are secret passage ways that you can’t see and low gravity, which means that you can pick up a gasoline truck with one finger! Why I like this part so much is because Jane found the Ether under a rock which went into her body and could not be taken out! The weirdest part was that when it went in her body, it seemed like it was 1 minute but it turns out that she was gone for 5 hours!I recommend this movie for ages 11 and up because this movie is pretty scary and pretty intense that I don’t think a younger audience would enjoy it.

"You should think twice before you eat that Thanksgiving turkey this year!  Especially after you watch the movie, ""Free Birds""!  This is a wonderful animated comedy, packed with lots of action and adventure.  Two turkeys team up to travel back in time to try to take turkey off the Thanksgiving menu for good.  If this doesn't sound funny enough, these two turkeys have nothing in common with each other, argue constantly, and run into some hilarious situations when they travel back to pilgrim days.In order to change the course of history, the turkeys, Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson), must first learn to get along and put aside their differences.  Reggie is a smart, although a rather lazy and weak turkey, while Jake is a strong and brave turkey, but very dumb.  This duo makes for some great comedy!  Then a female turkey that Reggie has a crush on makes it even funnier!  This role of Jenny is voiced by the very funny Amy Poehler, which could not have been cast any better. The director, Jimmy Hayward, also directed ""Horton Hears a Who!""  He is also known for his work on ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc.,"" and many more great animated hits.  The soundtrack for ""Free Birds"" is also great. My favorite scene in this movie is when Jake rescues a bunch of baby turkeys, chicks, from a blazing fire.  These adorable, tiny puffballs are clinging to his feathers, and looking up at this massive hero with huge eyes.  It is just too cute!  ""Free Birds"" is a family movie that is great for all ages.  I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.  So don't miss out!  Go see this movie when it opens at theaters near you on Nov. 3rd. Reviewed by Molly J., KIDS FIRST!

"I loved this film. It takes the classic tale by Hans Christian Anderson and updates it with state-of-the-art 3D animation that truly is magnificent. The ice castle created by Elsa, aka The Snow Queen, is an elaborate form of imagery that exudes elegance. The tale takes a creative leap from the original but still centers on the struggle between good and evil and, in the end, we learn how love overcomes the most dire circumstances. There are some scenes which may be too frightening to your younger viewers such as the giant snow monster the Queen creates to guard her castle. But, for the most part, this is a tale to be shared with your younger children and even pre-teens will enjoy it - particularly the imagery.Youth comments: I expected the movie to be kind of like ""Tangled"" with a main plot and a long, long quest. Well... I was almost right. ""Frozen"" is a great movie the whole family should see! The movie has so much to love - comedy, romance, adventure, suspense, thrillers, fantasy and so, so much more. It also teaches us a valuable lesson of not being afraid to show who we are and put our ""powers"" to a good use.The fun starts when two young royal sisters get into an accident. One has a magical power to summon ice. The magical girl hits her little sister, Anna. She lives but, has no memory of the magic and does not see her sister for many years. When Anna finally gets to see her sister, it turns into a tragedy.The animation is so adorable and fitting for the actors. They play the voices very well. The two sisters, Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) sound so much alike. The other actors, like Josh Gad do fantastic as well. The film flows very nicely too. The graphics and animation look unbelievably real.My favorite scene is when Elsa (the one with powers) runs away and builds her own ice castle. She is also my favorite character because she tries to protect her sister, but keeps messing up at it. The castle is built very nicely and it shows her true powers of being the ""Snow Queen."" I wouldn't mind living in a castle like that myself, if you know what I mean. Since the movie is so kind, bright and educational, I recommend it to ages 4-18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars.

"A poignantly triumphant movie, the storyline of “WADJDA” is just as phenomenal as the story of how the film came to be. In short, “WADJDA” represents quite a number of firsts. It’s the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, a country where cinema is prohibited. Writer and director Haifaa Al Mansour is Saudi Arabia’s first female filmmaker. It is also the first submission from Saudi Arabia for the Foreign Language Category for the 2014 Academy Awards.Set in a country known for its repression of women, the movie follows our title character—a 10-year-old spirited girl—in her journey to buy a new bicycle so she can race her best friend, neighbor and crush Abdullah. Even though Wadjda’s mother warns her to stay away from both bikes and boys because of their culture’s strict customs, Wadjda is determined to buy her bike with her own hard-earned money, no matter what the consequences. This, in turn, leads to joining a Koran competition at school. If she wins, she will have more than enough to buy a bike and therefore beat the boy next door.Subtly, the film explores the repercussions from this society in which girls should only be seen, not heard and, in public, only their eyes should be seen, with the rest of their faces covered by black veils. Wadjda tests boundaries in her search for freedom of expression. Although she discovers the contradictions in her world, she’s determined to challenge women’s traditional roles. The movie covers major topics such as polygamy and child-brides, as well as smaller oppressions such as the restriction of driving and rules of women in the presence of men.It’s mind-blowing to me that a movie about the oppression of women was made in the exact environment it depicts. On DVD, the making-of featurette explores in-depth the struggles and challenges that faced director Haifaa Al Mansour. The line, “respectable girls go inside,” is said to Wadjda in the film, and Mansour confronted the same problems. She had to direct her cast out-of-sight using a walkie-talkie to communicate with her cast and a monitor to watch the filming. She could not be seen working with men and often, when religious officials would come to inspect the bustle, production would be halted and moved to another location. It took close to five years to make the movie, but the effort is worth it.First timer Waad Mohammed is perfect as the fun-loving rebel Wadjda. This film is rated PG and I recommend it for ages 10 to 18. The pace may be slow for kids under ten. This is truly a landmark film that the world needs to watch. I give it five out of five stars. Perhaps the most uplifting message is that although the plot is fiction, the remarkable story behind the movie is not, and that shows that revolution is possible. This film played in theaters last year and will be released on February 11 on DVD/Blu-ray.Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

"This is an incredible film based on the book by the same name. It follows the life of a young girl who is abandoned by her mother and placed in foster care with a couple who also take in a young Jewish man who puts the entire family at risk. It give us a glimpse of what life might have been like for children similar to this during the time the Nazi party controlled Germany. At times terrifying, at times humorous, it will surely give you a full range of emotions. The production is simply stunning from the first rate performances to the sets that portray a very realistic image of this small German town. Young Sophie Nelisse plays a very believable character as the young girl, Liesel and Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson, the adoptive parents, are equally believable.I know that this book is required reading for many middle schoolers and would highly recommend that they watch this film as well. It portrays so well life in 1938 Germany from the Hitler youth groups to the book burning, the anti-Jewish propaganda, and the brainwashing that ordinary people endured.  It certainly opens up for discussion why all of these people bought into the Nazi regime.Youth comments: Out of all the movies I've ever seen, this one is the saddest. ""The Book Thief"" is a fantastic film that would make everyone who sees it cry, laugh, enjoy and be at the edge of their seats.  This movie has so much to watch - a tiny bit of comedy, sadness, history, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense, a bit of violence and, of course, theft.The story begins when a young girl is on her way with her sick brother to live with a new family. Sadly, the brother dies along the way. The girl is left alone with a new mother, a new father and stuck in Germany during World War II. Her family does a lot of scary things and it's a very sad story as well.The movie has so much history. I am Jewish so I cried quite a lot when I watched it. The facts are very accurate and very well done. The actors are stupendous. They are sad, happy, scared, brave and a lot more. The special affects and the thrilling way this film is done is amazing. This film is one of those films that made me cry. I wanted to go back in time so I could change Hitler's childhood to convince him to be nicer, kinder and not kill people. This movie is definitely big, intense and memorable.My favorite scene is a happy one. The family is hiding a Jew in their basement. The father (Geoffrey Rush) is a bit of a goof so he gets a lot of snow and they start a snow fight in the basement. For once, the mother plays along, and the girl builds a snow man. There they are huddled against each other, listening to the father play an accordion and feeling happy despite what is happening in the outside world. Because the movie is so intense, I recommend it for ages 11 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend that everyone watch this film and think about what happened in the past. We all have responsibility to make sure that this history doesn't repeat itself.  Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

"My dog thinks this is good stuff. Eukanuba is a quality brand, so I have no concerns about trying it. I mixed it in with the dog's regular kibble for the first couple of days (to minimize GI distress from changing foods), and she was very excited. I gave her a full bowl of it last night, and she eagerly went to town on it. She doesn't typically get that excited about kibble and sometimes waits an hour or more after I put it down before eating it. This stuff was irresistible, so I gather it's quite palatable. There's not that much else to say about dog food unless you're concerned about the ingredients and/or where it was manufactured - no concerns about either for me.

"This is a lovely, lyrical journey through a family’s history. I found it to be particularly interesting, because it delved into the many different societal norms and echelons in terms of Jewish assimilation prior to – and during – the worst of the antisemitism movement. Following Bernard and Win Schlesinger’s letters over the years was a privilege. They clearly had an extraordinary marriage that resulted in a loving family, who are introduced in the beginning of the book, so that you know the end result going in.The five decades of letters between Bernard and Win form a rich tapestry documenting courtship and separations due to wars and other divergent paths during an exceedingly turbulent time. Antisemitism did touch their lives deeply, and the author explores the tensions beneath the surface of his family’s societal ascent. He also shares the stories of their generosity in helping to rescue Jewish children in 1930s Germany. This book is a work of art and a pleasure to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1S7FVLU4ECN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204381#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1S7FVLU4ECN","A2CV33795L4KHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CV33795L4KHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This gadget is comparing itself to the VacuVin Wine Saver (""No longer do you need the complicated rubber stopper with a long plastic pump to suck the air out of the wine bottle...""), but I can't say that it measures up. It's prettier and smaller, but that's about it. This one fits over the top of the wine bottle, and you push down (pump) the top button until it stays down, which is supposed to indicate the wine bottle is vacuum sealed. But when you take the Visol Vacustopper off of the wine bottle, you only hear a very minor ""pop"" noise, which makes me think there wasn't that much of a vacuum seal. I don't trust that it's protecting my wine for future drinkage.

"My initial impression of this spinner is that it's a very pretty and elegant touch for my front garden. It was easy to assemble, but the instructions advise you to bend each of the ""wheels"" 30 degrees to enable the spinning effect. I dislike the fact that I have to be the one to do this. I think it should come already bent at the proper angle, although I realize that would make shipping a little tricky. Without using a protractor, it's difficult to tell if I got it right. The instructions do provide a drawing of what a  30-degree bend looks like, but it doesn't show the wheels themselves with the bend, so it's not a sufficient reference. I set the spinner in my garden on a breezy day, and I have yet to see it spin on its own. It also appears to be very delicate, so I wonder how long it will last in a strong wind. (I noticed that other reviewers said the spinner flew off in a strong wind.) I also think this is overpriced. It's pretty, but as Forrest Gump's mother would say: ""Pretty is as pretty does.""

"""Flood-ravaged"" is a bit of an overstatement, but the lower level of my house was recently flooded after a deluge of rain, and the rug was soaked. To make matters worse, I was out of town, so the rug had to just sit there for a few days. Then I dried it out in the sun for a couple of days and brought it back inside to see if it could be salvaged. It stank pretty badly. I tried spraying Febreze on it - the heavy-duty version - two days in a row, but the smell kept coming back. After a web search on rug deodorizers, I came across this product and ran out and bought it. As the directions suggested for stubborn odors, I sprinkled it liberally and left it for 30 minutes before vacuuming it up. The smell this powder puts off is quite strong at first, so I recommend retreating to another room until after vacuuming. After vacuuming, the rug looked and smelled great. It looks as clean as the day I bought it. Two days later, that is still the case. The rug carries a slight hint of the Arm & Hammer's scent, but nothing offensive. I'm very impressed! An added benefit - I don't empty my vacuum canister as often as I should, so *it* tends to smell.

"I like using an epilator, because you only have to do it every couple of weeks. I already have an epilator that I liked (a corded Braun model), but I was intrigued by the features on this Panasonic.

When I use my epilator, I find that I need a lot of light AND my eyeglasses so I can tell if I got all the hair. But I thought if this Panasonic worked well enough, I wouldn’t have to worry about that. Well… it doesn’t. It’s okay, but it’s not quite there. On the bright side, the Panasonic epilator came already charged and assembled, so I was able to test it right out of the box. I used it dry first, and it didn’t get all the hair. I switched to my other epilator to make sure I was being fair, and the Braun corded epilator was definitely more effective. I did try the Panasonic with shave gel.

"After spending a little time tweaking a couple of things, I can say this makes an excellent second TV. I got this as a lightning deal on Prime Day, so it was roughly half-price of what the big box retailers charge. When I first set the TV up, I thought that was probably all it was worth. The picture quality was subpar – some excessively bright spots that seemed to reduce the resolution – and I was very disappointed. Then I played with the settings and discovered that the TV has several presets for picture quality (similar to presets for a stereo equalizer), and I experimented until I found one (“cinema”) that I really liked. Now I have a beautiful, sharp picture on this great little TV that is set up on the wall in my bedroom. This is 720p, which is not the highest resolution available, but it’s more than sufficient for a 32-inch picture. No complaints there.Setup was very easy except for one little glitch. An onscreen menu guided me through the process of connecting to my home wifi, but the onscreen keyboard doesn’t appear until you click the “okay” button on the remote while in the onscreen box you want to fill in. Hard to explain without a visual, but when you click “sign in” on the screen and you see the boxes for username and password, and you click down to the username box, you expect the keyboard to come up automatically. You have to do the extra “okay” click on the remote before that happens. That’s a little odd, and it took me a few tries to figure that out.The Smart apps work very well. I experimented with Netflix and Amazon Instant Video – signed in easily and access my videos right away.I like to fall asleep to TV, so I appreciate the fact that this one has a sleep timer. A minor point for most people, but it’s a big deal for me, especially since my last bedroom TV didn’t have a timer. I also like to be able to continue to watch a program after retiring to the bedroom, and if I’m watching something on a Smart app on the TV in my living room, I can now turn it off and head upstairs and use the Smart apps on this TV to continue where I left off. That’s not unique to this TV – just a really nice reason to have a Smart TV in the boudoir.I mounted this on the wall, and the fact that this TV is lightweight (and paper-thin!) enabled me to do this without assistance. All in all, this makes an excellent second TV – or perhaps a nice first TV for a small apartment. I’m very pleased with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QWT7V8OEVT3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZVD007O#wasThisHelpful","R3QWT7V8OEVT3H","A2CV33795L4KHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CV33795L4KHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a collection of various sundry tools from DIY projects over the years, and they are stored in a multitude of drawers and cubbies all over the house, so I usually spend a lot of time hunting down the right tool. So one thing I really like about this tool kit is that it’s a compact (almost) all-in-one set that I can keep/carry altogether and have everything at my fingertips.

"I chose this storage unit because of the size. I wanted something smallish that would hold a couple of chair cushions and a few other small items that I need to keep clean and dry, and this is the perfect size. The unit assembles very easily. It looks a little cheap, but the color keeps it from standing out much on my patio. I don't have any need to sit on it, but it looks sturdy enough to handle an average-sized adult. It doesn't appear to be completely debris-proof. I notice a tiny bit of tree debris in the box, but I can't figure out how it's getting in. It's not bad enough for me to return it.

"I love a shoe that's a little different without being too showy. I saw this shoe with the metal accents and thought it looked like something I would like. You always take a chance when you order shoes online, but these fit perfectly, and they were quite comfortable from the moment I put them on. I wore them all day at work, doing a moderate amount of walking, and I had no discomfort at all.The shoes are beautiful. The metal accents are very stylish but not garish or tacky. The heel height is just right for me - I don't like wearing high heels to work. I'm not a fan of kitten heels, and that's the one thing I would change if I could. I knew the shoes had kitten heels when I ordered them, so that's not a complaint. These days, it's so hard to find stylish (i.e., non-frumpy) shoes without high heels. I'm happy.

"As another reviewer's headline stated, these are comfortable and classy, although I would not call them all that stylish. They're a little ordinary-looking, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think they are pretty enough. They have what I consider to be the perfect heel for a working woman's pump, and the shoe does feel immediately good on your feet. The patent leather accents add a little extra style. My one complaint is with the buckle on the ankle strap. It's a bit wonky - doesn't seem to lay flat the way I would expect it to, and it's very challenging to adjust. If I were able to slide the rear strap over my heel without unbuckling and rebuckling, this wouldn't be an issue, but unfortunately, it doesn't just slip on. I had a significant amount of trouble with this, and it's going to lead me to return the shoes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N849UG7MJBJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ5ASC6#wasThisHelpful","R1N849UG7MJBJG","A2CV33795L4KHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CV33795L4KHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is true that the best time to moisturize your skin is right after a shower when your skin is already moist. This can either be before or after you have toweled off, because your skin isn't completely dry after toweling off. This moisturizer is to be used before, and it does work well. My skin retains the oil and stays smooth and moist, but unfortunately, so does my towel. This is the downside of many of these types of moisturizers, and I found that after using this one two days in a row, I had to wash my towel. If you're someone who replaces towels frequently anyway, this won't be an inconvenience for you. It will keep me from continuing to use this moisturizer. In addition to the more frequent washing, after I towel off, I wrap my bath towel around my head to keep my hair from dripping, and I don't want that oil on my hair.This product has a nice light fragrance. And while I normally prefer such things to be unscented, I have to admit the fragrance is unnoticeable after a short time, so it's not a problem.Bottom line - it goes on easily and moisturizes well, but there is too much oily residue on the towel, in my opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZTEPCVV5NH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB87WX2#wasThisHelpful","R1UZTEPCVV5NH0","A2CV33795L4KHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CV33795L4KHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an improvement over some of the more basic Keurig brewers. You have multiple choices for the amount of coffee you want to brew – small cup, big cup, small carafe. (The carafe is not included, and I recommend buying one that is insulated so it retains the heat.) It’s a small unit, so it doesn’t take up much space on your counter. You do have to use Keurig K-cups or an “approved brand,” because the machine reads the pod to determine brew strength. There are MANY approved brands, though, so I don’t think it’s the end of the world. It worked with my Eight-O’Clock brand K-cups just fine.This machine is well designed for functionality, versatility, and convenience. The fact that I can brew one BIG cup of coffee is perfect for me. And of course, one of my favorite things about single-cup brewers is that you can give your guests whatever they want – any type of coffee, tea, or even hot chocolate. For that matter, if you only drink one cup of coffee in the morning, that’s all you have to make.The brewer makes a great cup of coffee – any size you like.

"I am new to running, and I'm not exactly young, and I was in old shoes that weren't quite right for me. Shin splints hit me after the 6th run. (Well, to be fair, it's a walk-to-run program, so it's not that much running just yet.) I checked a few Internet tools that help you figure out what kind of shoe you need (neutral stability in my case), and this particular shoe kept coming up. Then I did what everyone who's new to running should do - I went to a specialty running store and got an expert to study my gait and do a good fitting. These were among the shoes he recommended, and they felt the best. He put me in a size 9, which was a surprise, because I wear a 7 1/2 in regular shoes (and that's one big reason you should get a professional fitting if you're new to this). While I was recovering from my shin splints, I walked in these to get them broken in. Once I was ready to try running again, I discovered just how great these shoes feel. The wide toe box gives me plenty of room, the heel fits me just snugly enough, and there's just the right amount of cushion to protect my feet. I'm very happy with them, and I'm looking forward to gradually upping my running game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBWQYCTZCNL10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWKT9E0#wasThisHelpful","RBWQYCTZCNL10","A2CV33795L4KHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CV33795L4KHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are replacing an old heavy, wood-handled trimmer, so it's hard to imagine that a newer trimmer would *not* be better. However, I have to say this is a LOT better. I love how lightweight it is, and the blades are nice and sharp. All of this makes the trimmer easy to use for careful touchups where you want to be precise. I did test the knob that adjusts blade tension, and I find it to be easy to use and effective in making minor adjustments for different types of shrubs. I'm willing to bet that I will be less likely to put off my hedge trimming work now that I have these.Update October 1: I have noticed that I no longer put off the shrub trimming now that I have a nice set of shears.

"This travel mug is an attractive design and seemingly very functional at first glance. I tested it with my morning coffee, which I drink during my long commute to work. I tend to sip slowly, so a mug that maintains heat is desirable. That much - it does. When finishing my last sip an hour later, the coffee was still hot. The vacuum seal is not quite 100%. I snapped the lid seal down and screwed the lid onto the mug tightly, then held the mug upside-down over the sink and shook it a bit. There was a bit of leakage from the side of the top (where you screw it on), but it was pretty minimal - not enough to keep me from using the mug. The top seals shut with a snap. When you snap it open, a little ball that seals the drinking slot recedes. Here's the worst part from my perspective: the drinking slot is small, and the little ball is still close enough to the opening that it interferes just a bit. I found that I could only sip very small amounts of coffee, as opposed to taking a healthy sip. When you're driving, you don't want to be distracted by having to think too hard about how to get a full sip of coffee from your travel mug.This particular mug size is too tall to fit with my K-cup brewer (I would have done better with the smaller size), so that's an inconvenience. I have to brew the coffee in another mug and then pour the coffee into the travel mug. If you're brewing a full pot of coffee and pouring from a carafe, this won't be an issue for you.I also tested the mug's cold retention function by pouring ice water in the mug and letting it sit for three hours. The water was still very cold, although the ice had mostly melted. Good enough. I'm not likely to need to keep anything ice-cold for longer than that. I do like the fact that this mug is dishwasher safe.Overall, I'd have to say I'm not crazy about the functionality of the sipping mechanism, and that will probably keep me from using this mug on a regular basis.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13B3O9O18HNE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IR77HFE#wasThisHelpful","R13B3O9O18HNE6","A2CV33795L4KHH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2CV33795L4KHH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I previously had one of the 3M filters for a company laptop and liked it very much. I didn't realize Dell was making these now, and as it happens, they're not. This would appear to be a 3M filter with a Dell package wrapped around it. Either way, a good product. (In case you're wondering, these are compatible with any laptop - it doesn't have to be a Dell. I have an HP.) This was easy to install. I put the adhesive ""slides"" on the side of my laptop monitor frame and slid the screen down into place easily. I can leave it in place all the time, which is a nice convenient feature, or I can use it only when I'm concerned about privacy issues. I can see my screen just fine - it's only a shade or two darker than normal, and I *could* increase the brightness if that were a concern. People sitting beside me can't see the screen clearly enough to recognize the content. Depending on the angle from which they're viewing, they might be able to make out some of the image on screen, but most likely wouldn't be able to discern the big picture - especially when smaller type/font is involved. This is great for when you're traveling on a plane and don't want to share your business with everyone around you. I can view or create confidential business materials, I can watch a movie privately, any number of things. People sitting directly behind you can see what you're doing, because they're working from the same angle as you. This filter is designed to block the view of the nosy people sitting beside you, and it works well.

"My dog says these are good but not out-of-this-world awesome. When I gave her the first one, she eyed it suspiciously, then took it to her spot where she eats, then she rolled around next to it for awhile as if she needed to think about whether to accept it. To be fair, my dog doesn't always take to new treats immediately. If it's not what she's used to, she takes her time. She did get around to chewing on it, and then she very happily finished it off. It didn't last very long once she got started on it, which means she really liked it. When I gave her another one the next day, she displayed a similar level of non-enthusiasm, which I would *not* expect if she had really loved it the first time around. Same reaction with bone #3, and I noticed that she needs to drink a lot of water afterwards, so something about the taste makes her very thirsty. It's hard to know why a dog does or doesn't like something, but I can't say this is a major hit. The bones don't last very long, which was a bit disappointing.

"I have a sloped back yard and an inset exterior stairwell that leads down to the lower level of my house. When we get a lot of rain, water gets in the house. I have spent all kinds of money building an enclosure around the stairwell, regrading the walkway, building a little dam - you name it. While all those things made *some* difference, I still have gotten a little water. I was at my wit's end. A friend saw these and mentioned them to me. I read the reviews and decided to give them a try. Two days after they arrived, we had a flash flood. No water in my house. None. I put my bare foot on top of the Quick Dam that was at the downstairs door, and it was dry. I thought no water had gotten in. A little later, I turned it over to doublecheck, and it was indeed wet. Then I checked the one in the bottom of the stairwell, and it was swollen but not overflowing. My point - these sandbags can take in a LOT of water. They had room for much more. I bought a bag of 6, and I don't know that I'll ever use more than 2 or 3. They dry out pretty quickly in between rain storms. But I have extras on hand if we get recurring deluges. I'm in awe. And I no longer have to panic when the weather forecast calls for 2 inches of rain. This product has made a huge difference.Update January 2015:Five months later, I can still attest to the effectiveness of these sandbags. (And as you probably noticed, I technically don't use them as sandbags - I use them as water absorption bags.) The one issue with them is that you need a warm sunny day to dry them out. You need to be able to put them somewhere where the water will evaporate efficiently. That's a problem in the winter when it's cold and there's less sun to help out. I have bought another box of these to help me with my water issue, and I'm not complaining. If that's all it takes, I'm fine with this minimal cost and effort.

The first time I tried it my son was wearing a compression shirt that had neon stripes. This little flashlight made my sons neon stripes glow in the dark when the light was on it.

They were nicely designed but not made as expected, if you have excitable kids like mine (all 3 have adhd) they kept snapping the bracelets and the bracelets started to break the same day (come apart).  If you have kids that will snap them every now and then, you should be ok with them.

It matches my own watch (a Wittenauer) in the diamond rim and my wife fell in love with it on first sight.

"The new Panasonic Earbuds are just what I've been looking for...good sound, comfortable in ear and able to dampen out noise from outside.  I use them on a long commute every day, so being able to wrap myself into a decent TV show, movie or music is essential.  These do the job very very well and I've been impressed by how well they work!I am not an audio engineer...but I'm a discerning consumer and these pass muster very nicely.  The bass and treble pop well, the volume is solid (I hate ear buds that don't get loud) and voices, both spoken words as well as sung verses were crisp, clear and easily heard. The cord for the earbuds is substantially and I believe will stand up to everyday use and abuse and the body of the earbuds seems well engineered.Last, the earbuds come with three different sizes of rubber heads, and even the smallest worked well on my oversized ears.  All of the heads stayed secure, even as I tested their stability with a finger nail (is there anything more annoying than a lost head on a set of earbuds?).All in all, very happy with my new acquisition and looks forward to many hours enjoying them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJA29SEPSTMLH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMVLY7C#wasThisHelpful","RJA29SEPSTMLH","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently had a chance to review one of Ammex's other nitrile gloves, the medium blues and gave them a good rating. My sole complaint was that they were a little snug (more my fault, not sure my hands are medium in size) and that they felt a little sweaty.  The material seemed solid, but those gloves can be used by others...these are the gloves I'm going to use from now on.Black gloves with a matte finish, these are very comfortable, not at all sweaty and the material feel like its ready for work.  I use gloves when I turn wood, do glue ups, apply finishes (including CA finishes which is messy and leads to a week of picking CA glue off skin and nails everytime) and do yard work.  I need to be able to feel what I'm touching, even to a point of delicacy and be able to depend on the gloves to stay comfortable and tough.These do all of that...the material is strong (I was able to rip it but it took some concentrated effort) and I wore them for around 40 mins when I was doing some work yesterday.  Without latex (there is no latex, so sayeth the box), without powder (which can stain work, there's no powder here), these gloves worked like a charm.Very strong recommend and an excellent add to my woodshop!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26UD6CLQD6M1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E21HDK#wasThisHelpful","R26UD6CLQD6M1C","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these gloves because I do woodturning on a lathe.  Often, I used glues (wood and CA glues) and they get everywhere.  Other times, I used finishes (just put boiled linseed oil on a bowl about 20 mins ago) and oils track onto everything.  Using gloves helps...even if they get pretty sweaty inside after an hour of work.I used to use the white surgical gloves you can buy at drug stores but more often than not, they would rip putting them on or while you were using them (usually when you get to the tough part where you REALLY don't want to stop to put on new gloves).I will point out that I have some pretty big hands and these 'Medium' sized gloves were a touch snug (not unbearable, not even really uncomfortable).

"I mounted the new OmniMount Wall up in our living room, adjacent to a 60"" wall mounted television.  I found the studs (wasn't hard, just measured off the rack that was already holding the TV) and had it installed in all of 10 minutes.  The mounts it comes with will work with a variety of wall types, and, if you prefer, you can probably substitute heavier duty plasterboard wall mounts to replace the ones here which are supposed to mount up to 60 pounds.Its black, painted underside of the glass shelf unit and pretty much goes with anything.  The channel cover is very functional and did a good job hiding cables out of sight.All in, a simple setup, a pretty looking item that is functional.  The only reason it was not a 5 star was that the compartment is really small (roughly 19""x2"") and that's simply not very big. It would have been better to either make it larger or give the option for a second shelf somewhere below the primary one. Right now, I've got remotes stashed in there and a cable or two, but it would be nice to put my cable box in there, or (as someone else suggested) a bluray player. For my cable box (which is really a TIVO in disguise, my bluray, my receiver and amp, they are on the table below the TV and shelf, with cables trailing up the channel.  This works well, but leaves the cabinet they are sitting on looking very cluttered.All in all, a good recommend for what it is...it will be a nice addition to a mounted TV, will hide wire and do so with grace and style.

"Product Review: My First Lab Mini Duo Scope  Exec Summary, excellent educational toy!Last week, I had the opportunity to offer a kid-safe microscope to my grandson as a way to jumpstart his imagination toward science. To say it went well would be an understatement, it went extremely well.  He was engaged with the microscope for an entire weekend and I don't think he encountered ANYTHING that didn't go under the lenses (assuming they fit).My experience with microscopes is varied.  I spent a year as a biology major back in college, but those days are long behind me.  Back then, I always had a difficult time discerning just what the heck I was looking at.  That has not changed...and its not the fault of the microscope.The microscope in question is plastic but its pretty hardy.  There will not be parts breaking or falling off anytime soon, even with relatively rough handling.  The unit takes AAA batteries which powers two lights (above and below), a 10x lense up top and up to 40x below.  What comes through is a solid image, by a microscope that maintains its focus (even as I was focusing and handing it to my grandson) and a clear and easily changed stage for the scope.The image was solid, functional and easy to see.  The unit comes with three prepared slides (plastic), a number of empty slides and specimen windows, a couple of specimen bottles and some yeast and brine shrimp (Sea Monkeys!)  We tried preparing the brine shrimp but either they didn't hatch or we didn't wait long enough (waiting 3 days).Separately, I had a set of prepared glass slides from a microscope I bought my son some years ago, and again, this microscope did very well with them.All in all, a strong recommendation.  If you have children who are youngish (marketing suggests 8-15), this is an excellent and inexpensive way to offer the microscopic world to your children.  If a child is looking for a microscope, this is a great way to introduce it, and perhaps consider a more expensive unit at a later time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DLF79UUYPNK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3DHJC0#wasThisHelpful","R3DLF79UUYPNK0","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Smart, well photographed and researched, the Lonely Planet guides are an excellent value for the traveler.This calendar has some of the most beautiful images ever...with places I would love to travel one day.

"I’m going to approach this review in a different manner than I have written reviews in the past.  I suspect many pet owners simply go to their local pet store and grab up whatever food their pets like and maybe whatever is on sale.  I want to review based on the dog food, but also on the experience of ordering dog food online.I would love to say that my dog has a discriminating palette that ensures he eats only the best and most healthful and, then, only disdainfully.  But that’s not my dog (nor, likely, anyone else’s) and when he eats, he does it with his whole face deep in his bowl, as fast as he can take it in, chew it and swallow it. He doesn’t limit himself to traditional food (sneakers, flip flops and the odd paper item he can fetch off a kitchen counter will also suit) nor is he ever not hungry.  In short, he’s a happy little critter that loves eating anything at all times and we have to be careful at home to make sure that anything within reach is reasonably dog-friendly.So it’s up to me to make sure that what he does eat makes sense from a health standpoint. The Nutro dog food is quite healthful, from what research I have been able to crib from the ingredients list (pasted below al9ong with the guaranteed analysis from the Nutro website).  Lamb and brown rice contain many healthy components, like antioxidants for immunity boosting and other elements for joint health. Further, other ingredients are promoting a shine to his fur coat and I’m happy to say that I have seen the results.Changing to this dog food didn’t upset my dog’s stomach at all, which was a worry.  My dog has a sensitive stomach, despite his taste for anything he can swallow.  But not to worry, this Nutro dog food had no effect on his stomach and, in fact, he likes the flavor enough that he kicks his bowl around if there isn’t any more in it. The advertised ability toLast, I’d like to spend a minute talking about ordering dog food online.  This dog food online was cheaper than the dog food I got at my local pet store, even with shipping.  The nice thing about it is that I can order a regular delivery, have it show up every month and always have consistent food in the house.  So, its cheaper, more convenient and that’s a win for me.All in all, I recommend the dog food (so would my dog), believe it to be a good value and that ordering online was a win all the way around.From the Nutro website details on this dog food:Ingredients: Lamb, Lamb Meal (source of Glucosamine and Chondroitin Sulfate), Brewers Rice, Rice Bran, Chickpeas, Whole Brown Rice, Split Peas, Whole Grain Oatmeal, Pea Protein, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), Natural Flavor, Sunflower Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), Soybean Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), Potassium Chloride, Salt, Choline Chloride, DL-Methionine, Taurine, Zinc Sulfate, Niacin Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin Supplement (Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Iron Amino Acid Chelate, Copper Amino Acid Chelate, Selenium Yeast, Biotin, Manganese Amino Acid Chelate, Vitamin A Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Vitamin D3 Supplement, Potassium Iodide, Folic Acid, Rosemary Extract, Decaffeinated Green Tea Extract, Spearmint Extract.Guaranteed Analysis  Crude Protein (Min.) 21.00%  Crude Fat (Min.) 13.00%  Crude Fiber (Max.) 3.50%  Moisture (Max.) 10.00%  Linoleic Acid (Min.) 3.50%  Zinc (Min.) 250 mg/kg  Selenium (Min.) 0.25 mg/kg  Vitamin E (Min.) 80 IU/kg  Niacin (Min.) 250 mg/kg  Biotin (Min.)* 2.5 mg/kg  Glucosamine (Min.)* 100 mg/kg Chondroitin Sulfate (Min.)* 350 mg/kg  * Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHQO8IXDRDU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRK9U4#wasThisHelpful","R3DHQO8IXDRDU5","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The SUMMARY: The Perfectly Simple Bars are not so simple.  There’s a lot going on in these bars, both from a taste and a consistency basis.  The bars don’t LOOK delicious, there’s a lot of ingredients (see below) with a few almonds and Bing cherries.  The sweetness comes from honey and vanilla (Madagascar vanilla!). When you bite into it, you don’t expect what you get, which is a rich a tasty bar, satisfying and filling. There’s 180 calories in each bar, with 70 of them coming from fat.  That’s not a lot, considering I think the bars can be a complete meal replacement. There’s also 10 g of protein.  For more about the bars, I included a snapshot of its nutritional details with this review.The AD: ""These tarty Bing Cherry & Almond Bars are sure to perk up your taste buds. Wholesome ingredients, such as dry-roasted almonds and Bing cherries, are mixed with a little sweetness (courtesy of USDA Grade A light-amber honey and Madagascar vanilla), so each bite explodes with the kind of sweet and savory goodness that makes you wanna do a little happy dance.""The INGREDIENTS: Soy Protein Isolate, Dried Bing Cherries, Dry Roasted Almonds, Sugar, High Oleic Safflower Oil, Crystalline Fructose, Brown Rice Syrup, Almond Butter, Light Amber Honey, Cocoa Butter, Raspberry Puree, Tapioca Starch, Palm Kernel Oil, Concentrated Apple Puree; Less than 2% of the following: Concentrated Apple Juice, Corn Syrup, Palm Fat, Natural Flavors, Dutch-Process Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Nonfat Milk Powder, Whey Powder, Milk Fat, Salt, Madagascar Vanilla, Natural Cinnamon Flavor, Pasteurized Whole Egg Powder, Concentrated Aronia Juice, Maize Starch, Soy Lecithin, Glycerol, Citrus Fiber, Pectin, Citric Acid, Calcium Lactate, Sunflower Lecithin.  NOTE: Contains soy, milk, almonds, and egg ingredients. Manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts, other tree nuts, and wheat.The COMPANY: The company that makes the Perfectly Simple bars is called ZonePerfect and their website proudly proclaims that they have been “nourishing lives since 2003.”  It actually says that, but despite the cheesy hype, the product is pretty good.  As it turns out (and is not easy to find), ZonePerfect seems to be owned by Abbott Nutrition, which is a division of Abbott Labs.  That its owned by Abbott doesn’t bother me…Abbott makes excellent products.  This is one of them. You can find this at Walmart, among other places, or you can, as I did, order from Amazon.The EXPERIENCE: The bar announces itself prominently when you open the wrapper.  It smells delicious, with the cherry right at the olfactory forefront.  The bar comes out of the wrapper and although it looks like a bit of a mess (a lot going on in that bar), it tastes delicious and the consistency is reasonable.  Sometimes with bars like these, they fall apart because the ingredients don’t blend right.  These do not have that problem. The taste is excellent, with a hint of honeyed sweetness but the sweetness is nicely offset by the tartness of the cherry.The FINAL ANALYSIS: All in all, these bars are delicious, reasonably nutritious and taste much better than they look. One bar made for my breakfast this morning and it was filling and satisfying. My recommendation?  If you’re looking for your next good bar, this one is really good and I recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QX0WHDZB6U7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XLCD9AM#wasThisHelpful","R1QX0WHDZB6U7M","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In reviewing Protein drinks, there’s not a ton to be able to tell about their long term effect. Sodas will eat away stomach lining if you drink enough of them long enough. Juices have acid so they can as well.  What’s the long term effect of drinking a protein-additive drink?  I’m not sure…but this particular drink is tasty, the right amount of sweet and, in addition to protein, contains electrolytes, vitamins and minerals. The slogan is Rehydrate, Restore, Recover. I will add another that the company will appreciate: Reorder.  I liked it and we (my family and I) are going to order more.The COMPANY: The drink is produced by a company called New Whey Nutrition, and according to their website, their first products were made to meet the protein replacement needs of post-surgery bariatric patients. In researching the company, New Whey’s Mission Statement is stated as: “It is the desire of New Whey Nutrition to develop and provide quality products for you, ""the customer."" In addition, New Whey Nutrition will provide you with the utmost comprehensive and innovative products. All the products sold on this website are to arrive promptly from the time that they are ordered and to arrive in good condition. If any product is unsatisfactory, please return un-used portion and you will promptly be refunded.”  You can find their products at GNC, Walmart or Wegmans among others, or you can, as I did, order them on Amazon.The BEVERAGE: The bottle contains 20 fluid ounces of beverage and that represents a single serving size.  That’s relatively large, but part of the idea is to reduce hunger by filling the stomach with liquid.  There’s 140 calories in the bottle, none of which come from fat. There’s 6 base electrolytes, 110 grams of sodium, 220 grams of potassium, 24 grams of carbs.  Other contents include: Vitamin A, Calcium, Vitamins B, B6 and B12, Riboflavin, Niacin, Biotin and Folic Acid. What’s missing that’s in a lot of other drinks? Fat, Gluten, Lactose, Caffeine, Cholesterol and (my personal fav) high Fructose corn syrup. All in all, this is a reasonably healthy rehydrating cocktail.  If you want more specific ingredients (good luck reading the label. I went out into the sun with 1.25x reading glasses and couldn’t make it out completely) I’m attaching a snapshot of the label to this review.The EXPERIENCE: The consistency of the beverage is a little thick, which I like and probably will lessen hunger.  There's a sweetness to it, but given the lack of High Fructose Syrup, I’m guessing that comes from a little sugar and the fruit blended in.  Even though you get the sweetness, you don’t get the after-taste that comes from so many drinks.  It starts sweet and finishes that way.  The taste pops nicely and, as a blend you can distinguish between the flavors, at least as far as the pomegranate and blueberry go. Not sure what an acai tastes like...but I'm guessing it taste ACAI (ok), yes, that's a pun there.The SUMMARY: I cannot say whether there are long term health benefits from drinking the Nuaquos beverage, but I can say that it is satisfying and I like it a lot.  The ingredients seem to be reasonably healthy and the experience of drinking it is a good one.  If you are considering, I recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JX7J7ZKT5KGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NG7NS4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3JX7J7ZKT5KGJ","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In reviewing this case, all I can tell you is that if you compare it to what else is available for the S6, you will pick this out of the crowd immediately.  The case is clear heavy duty plastic and rubber edges and the phone slips into it simply and easily.  There's no mistaking this for the other cheap plastic cases.  You might mistake it for some kind of military 'Protect at all costs' style of case because its rugged, solid and very functional. It actually does meet military specs for protection (seriously) but this one actually looks like it does. You probably couldn't spike the phone-in-the-case at the ground but the case seems very solid for most accidental drops. Its similar to an Otterbox (which I use for my Ipad) in its durability and styling, but I like this one better.  It looks great.The case is very well thought out for the product.  The buttons and access is simple and you can tell when you're pushing it properly. The headphone cutout is particularly useful being large enough to accommodate my larger-sized jack on my headphones. That's rare...other cases couldn't accommodate my favorite headphones that I use for my ipod.Worth noting is that I didn't get a screen protector as promised, but I already had one so it was not a problem and if you wind up disappointed on this score, its easily removed (unlike my Otterbox) to put on after the fact.If I had to pick a negative (its not for me), the case does add to the bulk of the phone.  I'm not sure how you can protect the phone without adding bulk and truly it is really not a problem for me.  But if you are sensitive to the heft of the unit with the case on, you may wish to consider it. Having said that, a thinner case would probably not be as rugged or as pretty.All in all, strong recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYSM55GXQZR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRG8K0A#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYSM55GXQZR6","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In reviewing this product, I've enlisted the help of my wife who is much more the natural market than am I.  She's also fairly critical when it comes to products and skeptical when it comes to relatively wild claims to do things that then happen only in moderation. The product is produced by Ulta Beauty, a chain of cosmetic superstores out of Bolingbrook, IL.  Their lines include all kinds of cosmetics and some very big names.  They even have two stores (apparently) in my home city of Philadelphia.These gels are placed around the mouth and on the forehead for a period of ten minutes at a go.  Its suggested to use them once a week or more often if you, as consumer, think its necessary.  I'm pretty sure that ‘skyn’ (since when is capitalization a marketing brand?) would love if you used the ‘ICELAND’ product every day.I will suggest that the actual gels are simply weird feeling.  They feel like they’ve been refrigerated (they weren’t), like there’s some kind of moisturize on their surface (there doesn’t seem to be) but they do feel effective.  To call them gels is probably an oversimplification.  These are peptide-packed (infused) transdermal patches, but a far cry from nicotine patches.  These are comfortable, easy to use and relaxing.The gels seem to be some kind of soft cloth with the gel material facing the skin.  They are individually and carefully wrapped and require a little work to get out of their casings whole.  But once applied, they cool wonderfully and feel great against the skin.  After use, twice, my wife is happy to report that she likes the product a lot, wants to buy more and (you're welcome, ‘skyn’) and use them more often than once a week.  She really believes they alleviated wrinkles and I agree with her.Be aware that we are not in a position to offer advice as to the long term effects (or lack of effects) of using the product.  I suspect people’s mileage in this regard will vary based on their own complexions, how often they use them and for how long.  But I know my wife is satisfied and that’s good enough to warrant their continued use.  Having gone through a bunch of products over the years, that she is satisfied makes for a happy surprise.When I say that it feels like there’s moisturizer on the gels, a finger test seems to come up dry.  But there’s actually a lot going on here. The ingredient list (cribbed from the website) includes: Water/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Angelica Archangelica Root Water*, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates Copolymer, Agar, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Caprylyl Glycol, Perfluorodecalin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG-75 Shea Butter Glycerides, Glycosphingolipids, Xanthan Gum, Ubiquinone, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Flower/Leaf Extract, Buddleja Davidii Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus (Arctic Cloudberry) Seed Oil, Oxycoccus Palustris (Arctic Cranberry) Seed Oil, Aluminum Glycinate, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 60, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Sorbic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol.The website also points out the gels are: “Free of parabens, petroleum, mineral oil, chemical sulfates and phthalates. 100% vegan and cruelty-free. Dermatologist tested for sensitive skin.”All in all, a really good product that I believe we will be reordering in coming days.  As well recommended as any product we’ve used twice can be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CMVFWR8M7YLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGWYOG4#wasThisHelpful","R1CMVFWR8M7YLZ","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a person that tends to go through safety glasses pretty rapidly.  Somewhere in my garage-workshop there's about a dozen pairs, all of which are probably hanging out together, laughing as I go looking for a pair readily at hand.  Mostly, I use the cheap $2 ones that will do the job but not much more than that.These safety glasses do more than just the job.  First, they're comfortable as a pair of light glasses can be expected to be.  They do feel like plastic, but there's a foam (I think its open cell so it can breathe) backing that makes them tolerable. That same foam forms a comfortable seal against your face, keeping dust out of your eyes.  That's one thing the cheap ones do not do that's appreciated!  They are comfortable enough that I can likely wear them for extended periods of time before they are not welcome on my face anymore.  I have a large head...they fit me perfectly, your own mileage may vary!Second, the lenses are a bright yellow (what is referred to as 'Amber') which actually seems to brighten up the workshop considerably.Third, they have a strap so if I do take them off, they will be right where I can get at them without much effort.All in all, great glasses, recommend them highly!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7BCVFOAIA9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAYZTTE#wasThisHelpful","RQ7BCVFOAIA9J","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a real fan of Werther's candies, and have been for quite a number of years. The company itself isn't named for an individual (according to the website), its named for the European town in which a candy maker named Gustav Nebel first made his caramels.Caramel can come in a variety of textures and hardnesses (assuming that's a word).  In this case, these caramels are wrapped individually and are soft, rich and creamy delicious. A serving of 4 contains about 100 calories, much of which is about the sugar content. Other ingredients are butter and cream.In terms of textures, they are soft and if you have difficulty with hard caramels, have braces or dentures, I believe that these would likely be fine for you.  I hesitate to say so in case someone has a problem, but my son, who has braces and is careful not to eat foods (like caramels) which might damage them) tried one and had no problems. If you are one of the people above, try at your own risk, but I suspect you'll have no problems and a really happy treat.All in, high recommend (applicable to all of Werther's products that I've tried over the years).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFE8DYY5HQB91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5M3I1I#wasThisHelpful","RFE8DYY5HQB91","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In reviewing this 'Child Carrier,' I'd like to point out that it is a remarkable piece of engineering. Not only will it securely hold a child from close to infancy through toddlerhood (is that a word?), it does so very comfortably.  Sitting on shoulders with two straps, stirrups for the child's feet, even legs that can be opened to provide a secure base to set the child down.The carrier is well padded, with heavy plastic adjustments which look pretty solid.  There are a number of handles to hold it, with and without a child in it and a lot of storage, particularly on the bottom of the carrier.  It is not a toy...this is a serious piece of equipment and it feels like it could survive years of use and abuse. There are many straps, each of which require some adjustment to fit the child.  Fortunately, the carrier comes with a very useful thumb drive with videos to show how it works.  It isn't hard to adjust at all and the makers have thought of everything. There's even a canopy that can be erected above the child's head to keep sun (or light rain) off.The only drawback is that the carrier is bulky and, though light for what it does (I saw 10 pounds online), its a solid weight.  It takes up a large footprint and is probably too large for daily use (unless you were really opposed to using a stroller).  I believe you could go for long hikes and walks, backpacking with this carrier and it would be admirably suitable, but those are likely to be its only uses.  If you are considering this as a way to get on the roads with the youngster, this is an excellent product.  If you are looking for a simple way to take trips to the mall or shopping, this is likely overkill.I like the product, I recommend it for hiking and long walks, but it will probably be too much for many other uses.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC1UEH5I5BTDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KBH7K#wasThisHelpful","RC1UEH5I5BTDE","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered the watch from Amazon as a gift for my wife.  It doesn't look fantastic in the pictures but the watch really is lovely and she opened it when I was in another room.  I heard the exclamation (""Oh!  So pretty!"") and ran in.  Sure enough, she loved it.  The face and diamonds set each other off very nicely, the band is a lovely colored leather and all in all its a great bargain for the price.The real test of a watch happens over time...whether it stands up over time to the punishment that watches get everyday day in and day out is the true testament.  But as far as I can tell, the watch seems rugged enough for everyday use and pretty enough for even dressed up events.All in all, very satisfied with purchase.

"In reviewing food for my dog, I have a couple of criteria: ingredients used, appreciation by my dog, price and overall presentation of the product.The food is made by Hill’s, which has been making dog food since 1939.  That’s a long time…their other brands include Science Diet, Ideal Balance (of which this is a product), Prescription Diet and Hill’s Healthy Advantage. They are committed to honest advertising and, I believe, in making a product that is healthy for pets.The ingredients to this particular dog food are a lot.  Roast beef is only the start of the list of premium items in the dog food: there is also Buckwheat, Peas (green and yellow), flaxseed and canola oil (for the dog’s fur coat), parsley and rosemary. There is approximately 391 kcal/cup of the food, and it is comprised of 23.2% protein, 14% fat, 52.6% carbs and 4.8% fiber.  I’ve copied and pasted the actual ingredient list at the bottom of this review if you want it.  The dog food is a little bit expensive and the package I got was gone in a couple of days (a little small but my dog kept wolfing it down)My dog loved this food.  I couldn’t keep his bowl full.  He particularly liked the meat chunks which he dug out first, but then he would finish the bowl off entirely. Ordinarily, if my dog likes a food this much, he’s going to have a bothered stomach not long after…but that did not happen here.  He was very happy with the meal.Last, not least, the dog food is kibble based but does not have a distinctive odor, which I appreciate.  Many dog foods, particularly with premium ingredients, really smell bad.  This one does not.The only drawback that I see is in price…the product is a good one, healthy and appreciated for my mutt.  But the price a is a little bit much and I will likely buy more, but may mix it with a cheaper brand to spread that cost over a longer period.Ingredients: Beef, Yellow Peas, Cracked Pearled Barley, Whole Grain Oats, Pea Protein, Chicken Liver Flavor, Chicken Fat, Egg Product, Chicken Meal, Buckwheat, Oatmeal, Powdered Cellulose, Dried Beet Pulp, Malted Barley, Brown Rice, Parsley, Canola Oil, Calcium Carbonate, Flaxseed, Choline Chloride, Green Peas, Carrots, vitamins (Vitamin E Supplement, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), Niacin Supplement, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin Supplement, Folic Acid, Vitamin D3 Supplement), Iodized Salt, Cranberries, Potassium Chloride, Taurine, Mixed Tocopherols for freshness, minerals (Zinc Oxide, Ferrous Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Calcium Iodate), Apples, Broccoli, Zucchini, Citric Acid for freshness, Beta-Carotene, Rosemary Extract.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20SAV5IS0ALZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TH3MMKW#wasThisHelpful","R20SAV5IS0ALZR","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hot Wheels continues to innovate.  Since its founding in 1968 by Mattel, they have gone beyond the scope of simple 1:64 scale care replicas (it was apparently meant to be a competitor to Matchbox) to encompass tracks, collector editions/models and conventions for model collectors.  I'm not one of those people.  I had Hot Wheels when I was a kid, loved them dearly and have given them to my son for years. Now, it was time for my grandson!This new track system throws a curve at it.  Using a combination of a hot water and a cold water tank, the car literally changes color (dark to light green and back again!) as it moves through its track. Further, it can be set up to trigger a second car as the first car moves through its paces on the ramp (this one doesn't change color, but it’s still a pretty slick trick to add to the toy.)  The toy can also be added to a broader track and used as an expansion set.Construction was pretty simple, even if the directions looked complex. Simply use the letters in the directions and the whole toy will go together in about 2 mins.The problem is you have to keep refilling the ‘tanks’ which drip and reheating the hot tank (not that hot…) and cooling the cool tank.  In the interim, bring a towel, its going to get wet everywhere!  Having done this in a bathtub made it simpler, but that’s about the only place that the toy makes a lot of sense. The second time my grandson asked to play with it, the only answer was to wait until bath time. Come bath time, we kind of forgot about it.Don’t get me wrong, Hot Wheels are a lot of fun (even for a guy with grandkids) and they keep pushing the envelope for people who like them. This one is fun but messy and while my grandson liked it, I’m not sure how many plays he’ll get out of it.Recommend: If you are a collector, its pretty slick. If you are a kid, it will be fun at least the first time you play with it.  If you are an adult buying for a child, it’s a bit of work.  Its up to you to decide if its worth that bit of work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T2AYVSB75IUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1Q5WYO#wasThisHelpful","R2T2AYVSB75IUB","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So, Greenies has a blueberry flavored treat for dogs, and given my predilection for having my dog try new things, it sounded good.  In the case of this chew, the advertising points out that the treat is, in addition to delicious, safe, easily digestible packed with extra vitamins and minerals and (not surprising considering its shaped like a toothbrush) its supposedly good for dental hygiene..My dog is about 30 pounds and even if the vet says he's chunky, I know how much muscle is in that body.  He takes me for walks.  When he chews things (more often than I'd like) he chews them apart in seconds.  He can spend a whole 5 mins reducing a largish nylabone to nothing. He also went through these treats in about 30 seconds...but he loved them and came looking for more.The bag I got had about a dozen treats in them.  He's eaten two of them and really likes them.  As a human, I can say that the smell is pretty strong. From six inches away, you can smell the blueberry pretty easily.  Any closer and the odor is overpowering.  Having said that, dog's breathe afterward definitely was more pleasant than usual.All in all, a worth treat to try...I may buy more once I'm satisfied the product won't do anything to his stomach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTRIRV4KL1P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7R7HQC#wasThisHelpful","R1PTRIRV4KL1P3","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tonight I had a delicious meal, using McCormick's Sicilian Chicken skillet sauce.  It was a simple dish, prepared quickly...simply cook the chicken, brown the vegetables, add the sauce. The result was delicious with a wholehearted flavor that's Sicilian to its heart. All in all, it was 10 mins of cooking and three of us ate well.  The flavors, basil and garlic, popped nicely and there's a little heat to the flavor.  In short, its everything I love in cooking and its made simpler than I usually can make it.  As you can tell from the pictures, I had it with some thick garlic bread and ravioli.A winner...one that's earned its way back into my cabinet. If you are considering, I recommend highly.  You won't be disappointed.  Unless you started out that way, in which case, you'll be full and maybe not so disappointed.So you're aware, the sauce contains 30 calories (count 'em!), none of which are from fat.  That's good.  There's also 400 gm of salt, not so good. The ingredients are crushed and diced tomato, vinegar, garlic, corn starch, salt, spices (paprika and basil), olive oil and some acids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30N1HFCXPLW4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLV5AGC#wasThisHelpful","R30N1HFCXPLW4Q","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My DII rug finally arrived after two weeks of waiting.  The rug itself is the size of a doormat (a little smaller than I expected) and is lush, comfortable under bare feet and pretty. I was originally thinking of this for my foyer but moved it to my bathroom where its been put through the wringer.  Wet, dry, the rug remains secure to the floor, colors haven't run and it remains a comfortable addition to my décor.I saw other reviews in which people pointed out that there were sharps in the material but I did not experience this problem at all.

"Gaming is becoming an immersive technology, one which will involve a lot more than hand eye coordination.  It makes sense that, with the advent of games on handhelds, cellular phones and tablet computers, games on dedicated gaming machines and personal computers would have to evolve...they simply can't compete easily.  Further, those machines had the memory, hardware and throughput capabilities to allow for gaming to expand.When I speak of expansion, I'm pointing to more than simply graphics upgrades.Sounds, music, touch response and the ability to change settings to suit taste have made games on dedicated systems, like the Playstation, so much more than they used to be.  No one is going to confuse Madden 2014 with the actual experience of trotting out onto a football field in your pads and cleats...but games weren't ever meant to be that.  Computer games are their own animal...and the experience has been improving for years.  Madden may not have anything to do with football as played on a field, but its a lot of fun all by itself.Today, I reviewed the sound upgrades that have been coming about to extend that level of expansion to PlayStation in the form of the Turtle Beach Headset.  You do not have to use these headphones for PS alone.  They can function as simple headphones on their own, but the sound levels (and ability to speak into the microphone) do a nice job of extending the experience of a PS game to another level. They also work well in plugging into a cellular phone.The plug is worth talking about..in PS' case, it plugs into the handset.  I'd love it if it was Wifi/Blue tooth compatible, but that would mean batteries, charging and (possibly) reduced capabilities.  As it is, its very good and does a great job of letting you hear and communicate.  It could be a little longer (approx. 36"").Pros:- Good sound- The response is solid enough that I don't need it to be wireless.  Its worth using the wire.- Comfortable for relatively short periods- The inline amplifier works well, is intuitive.- My son can still hear me when I call him and he is gaming with this headset on. (BIG plus!)Cons- While comfortable for short periods, I watch a movie with them on and, honestly, I was squirming a bit near the end. Part of it was sizing, part was warmth-retention.  I have a large head, your own experience may be better.- A little weighty, a little bulky.  Not  a big deal...just a little bit. You will not mistake these for earbuds.- The cord is a little short...this is the only real reason I took one star off.  It hasn't been a problem, I can extend it using an extension cord but should I have to?- The sound when you are wearing them is very good, but it leaks out.  People in the room will hear what you are listening to.All in, very serviceable headset, with really solid sound and performance.  If you are considering a headset for gaming (PS), a cell phone or ipod, this is an excellent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDPUB01XOQ81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK2DCU4#wasThisHelpful","R1WDPUB01XOQ81","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I gave him Fisher-Price's Transforming Bat- Bot and he played with it for a solid 8 hours today.Don't be surprised...this is Batman (not necessarily apparent from the name)climbing into a transforming tank.  Its remote controlled and the 'Bot' is basically a tank that can stand up.  It also fires (very light pressure) disks at targets, usually falling short of whatever the child will aim at, but still a lot of fun (the amazing thing about the dancing bear isn't how well it dances).  Sound effects, voices, lights and, of course, Batman, make this a toy that kinds (probably boys mostly) will love.  I know my grandson wouldn't go to dinner without Batman.  My son, who is 13, was playing with both grandson and BatBot and now he wants to watch the batman movies.The product came fully setup and ready to roll.  I had to put some batteries into the remote but not the Bot.

"Review; Belkin Car Charge MountToday I installed my new Belkin Cellphone mount in my car.  The devide (Belkin Car Charge and Navigation Mount for Iphone)plugs into your car lighter (remember when they were actually used to light cigarettes?) and hold your cellphone in place where it can (theoretically) be safely view while driving.The notion of a mounted cellphone seems like a pain when considered but for people that do not have GPS or need to have handsfree access to a cellphone while driving, this is a pretty solid performer. The neck of the device is long enough that your lighter distance in the car shouldn't matter much.  That neck is also stiff enough that it is not going to flop over on turns (or at all).The clamp mechanism is solid, but removing the phone takes two hands (so does putting the phone on).  When it is in place, it can be adjusted to need and is clearly and easily sighted from the driver's side.  It will work well.  Likewise, the plug has a retaining ring on its exterior to hold it tightly within the plug.As a charger, it is also good.  The charging plug is on a flexible bar so you can easily bend the plug forward to mate with the phone.  The charger works immediately and without the annoying warning that the plug is not Microsoft approved (and may not work).All in all, a very good product, one I plan to use daily!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L7A3UNW2JE5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNMMY04#wasThisHelpful","R2L7A3UNW2JE5E","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It doesn't matter, Epson Scan does what its supposed to...and the image was pretty and with a little sweetening using Picasa, it was actually improved over the original.I did not check the fax...though I have no doubt that it functions fine. I just don't have use for a fax!When I unboxed the printer, I was pretty amazed at the size of it.  This is not a home unit, though most homes would be fine using it.  The box is large (aren't they all?) but the printer is really large!  I had to look inside, the box was like a Tardis, the printer felt bigger than the box it came in!  Setup was pretty simple, though my mother started using it and had to call Epson.  MJuch like their product, they were responsive, helpful and a pleasure.All in all, very good printer.  This will work well, will not cost a fortune to either maintain or replace ink and I expect it to be the household workhorse for years to come.

"This is the third Philips Sonicare toothbrush that I've gotten.  I bought one for myself, loved it, bought another for my wife.  She also loves it. Its been around 5 years since I switched and cannot ever foresee going back to a manual one.  In fact, during the few travelling trips where I've either forgotten or left my Philips behind and had to buy a manual toothbrush, I hated the experience.This toothbrush was for my son, and its almost the same one that I have and use every day (you can probably find my earlier review around Amazon somewhere).  All in, its terrific.  About the only negative is that this toothbrush goes on for 2 mins, then shuts off.  My version of it pauses every 30 seconds to signal you to switch quandrants (upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right).  But that's a minor quibble...the toothbrush works very well.Worth noting is that the heads on these should be switched out every couple of months.  I've discovered that a number of drugstores carry 'generic' heads for them that are much cheaper and work just as well.Last, not least, my cat likes the toothbrush too or at least the taste of the toothpaste on the body of the brush...I'm thankful that the head is covered by a clear plastic cover or I'd be swapping spit with my feline!If you care considering, this is a strong recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UF0G9I8TFUIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZHP49K#wasThisHelpful","R1UF0G9I8TFUIU","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The following review is based upon my observations and those of the female who will be using this.This organizer is designed for cosmetics, to organize and group them.  Its sturdy (a heavy plastic), has two drawers as well as 'containers' on top to hold eyelines, lipsticks and other cosmetic applicators and appliances.  The design of the top of the unit allows for items to sit comfortably, even as I move the organizer around but I would not stack items on it.All in, it is likely not big enough to handle everything a person may own...but it will hold all of your most common items (if you have more common items than you can fit in this organizer, you should redefine what you mean by common items).  The drawers have a little give to them, but that is not a bad thing.  There may be contracting or swelling as temperature changes happen and the little bit of slop in the drawers will probably help a lot more than they will ever hurt.My only concern is whether the organizer, which is translucent, will collect powders and cosmetic gunk over time.  There's no way to tell that now, but the design of the unit should give sufficient access to its surfaces and corners to make it relatively easy to clean.All in, a win!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G0RHUYRQWQM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5L2H7O#wasThisHelpful","R3G0RHUYRQWQM6","A3O60C5513YYD6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O60C5513YYD6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, I got my new iPhone case from Case Logix.  Its attractive, appears to be well constructed and fits snug and secure to the back of my iPhone.  The profile of the cast is slim and tight to the phone, not adding any substantial bulk to it.The back appears to be made of a textured cloth. This is attractive and a nice touch.  I'm hopeful that it will not give me the problems that come with cloth for items such as this, where the cloth catches, pulls out, stains.  I will update my review should this occur.  As of today (06-30-2011) it is a five star review but that may change depending on mileage...some of these cases have a tendency to look great on a shelf or a phone after a couple of days but do not wear well.  Stay tuned on this.Case Logix, in case you are not familiar is a Boulder, CO based company that started with audiocassette cases and have now grown to provide cases for many different items, mostly portable technology based products and support.

"I'm in love with the comfort of Skechers GoWalk shoes, but I frequently get comments on how odd-looking/ugly they are and I wanted a pair that looked a bit nicer for pairing with shorts, cutoffs, and skirts for the summer. I was pleasantly surprised with these shoes - they were even comfier than my GoWalks, which I didn't think was possible! They stay comfortable even when I have to spend a few hours on my feet at a time. Plus, unlike my GoWalks, I get compliments on how cute they are all the time!Please note that these shoes run large. I wear a size 8 in all my other shoes (Skechers included), but I saw several reviews advising that customers order a 1/2 size down. I ordered a 7.5 and they fit exactly the same as my size 8 GoWalks. Glad I read the reviews first! As for width, my feet are slightly wider than average, and they fit perfectly in that regard.I noticed the foam inserts in these shoes aren't sewn in like on the GoWalks... does anyone know if the inserts are replaceable once the memory foam wears out?","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OBJ5APOBJ2C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKZXOBM#wasThisHelpful","R3OBJ5APOBJ2C4","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our cats were running low on their generic stuff, and I happened to see this at the pet store and bought it. My cat Ringo, an older cat, woke me up in the middle of the night running around the house. I got up and he had pulled out all sorts of toys from his toy box that he hadn't played with in years, and was eagerly rolling around and playing with them all. I asked my husband what had gotten into him and he said he'd given him some of that ""zoom stuff"" a few minutes prior. We've never gotten a reaction like this with catnip, not even with the organic stuff we sometimes get from the Farmer's Market - Ringo was more active and playful than we'd seen him in awhile!This morning, he managed to find the Zoom bag and was licking the outside of the plastic, trying to get at the nip inside.

"I've never felt compelled to review tampons before, but then again, I've never had a preferred tampon brand until now, and these Tampax Radiant tampons are just too awesome for me not to rave about.I grabbed a huge box of these at random two periods ago because they were on sale, but they are now my absolute favorite. I don't like using tampons without applicators. I've used tampons with cardboard applicators in the past, and I just can't get them to work well - the tube-shaped design is not only painful to insert, but the lower ""plunger"" half doesn't always slide into the rest of the tubing smoothly, ending up stuck and unusable unless I take the tampon out from the applicator and insert it by hand, therefore defeating the purpose of an applicator. Yeah, not my idea of a good time.These tampon applicators have a smooth, thin shape that inserts and depresses easily. My favorite part is the packaging - the seals are a sticker, making them both easy to open and resealable, so you can insert your used applicator inside and seal it up before you throw it away. Less grossness to impose on public restroom custodians! And as someone who was a custodian throughout high school to save up for college, I know how gross dumping those sanitary napkin cans in public restrooms can be.The packaging is also very silent, so you don't sound like you're ripping open a bag of potato chips in the bathroom stall. I figured this might be a good feature for some people. Personally, it doesn't bother me unless I'm in a unisex restroom. If I'm in a women's restroom, no one in there is going to give a crap (ha!) about being able to hear you open a tampon wrapper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NP4QRT7DZTNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OSBVKO#wasThisHelpful","R1NP4QRT7DZTNX","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these ACcase covers in brown. It was lightweight, thin, and a very lovely color, but the one I received was poorly constructed; the front cover was wobbly (wriggled up and down when closed, despite the magnets) and, when closed, left a slight gap on the top and bottom through which I could see the light from the Voyage - meaning it wasn't being put to sleep. Auto wake also only worked 2 times out of 10 tries. I mainly wanted a case for the auto sleep/wake function, so this wasn't something I could overlook. I sent it back (thankfully Amazon returns are painless) and replaced it with an OMOTON case in black. They didn't have the same deep brown color that I liked so much about the ACcase, but the Kindle Voyage snapped into the OMOTION case perfectly, construction feels sturdier than the ACcase, and the auto sleep/wake function works perfectly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EPEIELSC2SR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBXD5GW#wasThisHelpful","R1EPEIELSC2SR7","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It seemed to work quite well and I was pleased with my purchase, but when it came time to pick up dirt and dust, I realized what the other reviewers were complaining about. The exhaust is pointed directly at the user's face, so all the air being sucked in is blown back at you. Not a big deal when it's just air.

You can hear everything that goes on around you with these on, even with music cranked up fairly loudly (which completely negates its purpose as a sleep aid). The bands are also pretty large.

"I had an older soft chest that looked just like this for groceries in the back of my car that I gave to my sister, so I bought this one to replace it. It's a great size and will fit in the back of most hatchbacks (my car is a subcompact and this fits in the back with plenty of room to spare). Each square can hold two gallons of milk or a few shopping bags. I use mine for groceries since I live in a hilly area and groceries tend to roll around in the back of my car; one messy milk accident was enough for me to vow to never just set bags in the back of my car again! The front pockets I use to hold small tools or maps I want to keep in my car.Please be aware that this is intended for HOLDING groceries or storing car tools/accessories - if you are using it to store items heavier than a gallon of milk, do NOT use the chest to CARRY items around or the bottom will rip. I know the handles are a bit deceiving in that area. If you are just carrying around paper towels or other lightweight items, you will be fine.I am removing one star because this is the only soft storage chest I've ever owned that did not come with rigid square pieces on either side of the middle insert that fold down to cover the bottom of the chest upon opening (to keep the chest from collapsing in on itself when empty). Not only does this mean that the chest is always in a state of half-collapse when not filled, it also means you can't carry items around in it (as I stated above) as I could with my older soft chest.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273U59KHHNO3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZVN78C#wasThisHelpful","R273U59KHHNO3F","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dislike plain sparkling water and flavored waters, so I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed Sparkling Ice. I decided to give it a try because I was incredibly thirsty while shopping at Winco one day and these were only $0.89 a bottle, so I thought I'd give them a shot. I liked it, and my husband bought me a variety pack at Costco a few days later and I fell in love, especially with the Strawberry Watermelon (another surprise, since I don't like watermelon-flavored things). I've gone around town and managed to try several flavors (since most stores carry only a few), and while not all of them ""wowed"" me, I haven't had one yet that I've disliked. The lemonade flavors are particularly good!Make sure you are getting a good price if you decide/need to purchase online. The most I've ever seen these sold for in stores is $1 a bottle (WalMart), so any 12-packs being sold for more than $12 is a poor price.

I would recommend it if your skintone is lightish-medium or you are at least 1-2 shades darker than Ivory in your normal foundation. I will hang on to the bottle until summer and see if the color suits me more after my skin tans a little.It also rubs off easily - even hours after applying and setting with powder, a ton of this came off on my phone screen while talking.

"Does very well moisturizing dry skin exacerbated by winter air. I was impressed by how quickly it worked when I had been using other lotions that still hadn't done the trick after several weeks of repeated use. Originally I purchased this after hearing from a dermatologist that it would help treat my Acanthosis Nigricans (I have PCOS and AN is one of the symptoms) as well as small red bumps on my arms. While Amlactin hasn't helped get rid of either of the affected areas after two months of use, it has at least slightly approved its appearance now that the skin stays so much more hydrated than before (both conditions look much worse with dry skin).I only have two complaints about the product: if your skin is quite sensitive, the product can sting on contact and there is a burning sensation afterward for 10 - 15 minutes. Also, the lotion bleaches fabric. Wash your hands with soap afterward or you will bleach anything you touch, and make sure to let your skin dry a few moments before putting on clothing.

"I bought this item from my local hardware store yesterday morning after coming into work and realizing that some of the techs had left the warehouse door open the previous afternoon. As a result, my office was swarming with flies - a coworker and I counted, and there were over thirty swirling around. They were landing on me, walking across my computer screen as I worked... it was creepy and disgusting. I got my boss to cough up a few dollars for me to go to the store and buy something to get rid of them. This item was literally the only thing they had in the store to trap flies (which was cool with me, since I really didn't want to resort to fly tape). I followed the instructions and placed it behind the fax machine (so no one walking by my office would have to look at it).When I came into work this morning, I only saw four flies buzzing around my office. I took a peek inside the trap - YECH! It's FULL of dead flies! Looks like it was worth the money, which is great, because my boss had griped about handing over seven bucks.I've read a few other reviews here mentioning the smell, but I guess mine hasn't been out long enough to smell yet, plus I only plan on having it out long enough to catch the few remaining flies before dumping it out, cleaning it, and storing it in the cleaning closet to fight another day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFUHYPA7CHSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004TBKG#wasThisHelpful","RPFUHYPA7CHSO","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a 2.5 gallon tank housing a single betta, which was frequently overrun with algae (the filter would be coated within days) despite weekly water changes and only keeping the light on for a few hours each day. The gravel I had inside would trap in food/waste, which made the tank smell horribly. Because of this, my water changes were often 50 - 100%, which was stressing my betta. He started chewing on his own tail and wasn't as active - he refused to even chase my finger around (a game we've played since I first adopted him).I picked up three bags of this Activ Betta sand on a whim while browsing my local pet store to find him a new toy to perk him up. My tank is 2.5 gallons, and with three bags, I get an inch of even coverage. For three days, the water was slightly cloudy from the sand not fully settling, but after that, the water was crystal clear. It's been a full week, and the tank looks remarkable clean - my filter is still white (before it would turn green within a week, black if I left it in for a second week), there is no algae growing on the tank anywhere, and my betta is once again happy and active. He even blew a huge bubble nest last night, which he only does when he's very happy and relaxed (I know that sounds weird, but I've had him for a couple of years, so I know his quirks).The sand makes it very easy to clean, since now I can see any food he misses and retrieve it with a turkey baster, and it looks lovely. Feron (my betta) likes it, too; sometimes he'll swoop down and rub himself in it, then sleep on it, which he never did with the gravel (he would sleep on top of soft plants instead) so it's obviously quite soft.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSMKUGWZPGITO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V80N4G#wasThisHelpful","RSMKUGWZPGITO","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My little betta ""office assistant"" Feron LOVES this food. I recently ran out of Bio Gold and they were temporarily out of stock at my local pet store, so I grabbed a bottle of this Aqueon pellets since I've used items from their brand in the past for ""fish stuff"" and liked them. My betta absolutely loves this stuff; he prefers his noms in pellet form. After initial hesitation as to the change in flavor, he was on these little pellets like white on rice.The only problem is that, before, he could take his sweet time picking at the three or four pellets I'd feed him daily. However, these pellets sink within two to three seconds of hitting the water. I have to feed them to him one at a time, and sometimes he still isn't fast enough to catch a pellet before it sinks. He'll chase it downward, but doesn't always catch them. I had to order a turkey baster so I can retrieve the sunken pellets. Until that arrives in the mail, I've borrowed a little mustachioed cory catfish from my boss's tank to supervise pellet cleanup duties (he likes these pellets too, although he has to wait for them to soften for a few minutes before he can eat them).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30FR9S7X2488J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00176BAZK#wasThisHelpful","R30FR9S7X2488J","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't normally purchase shoes if they're over twenty dollars. Let's face it, when it comes to fashion, I'm on a cheap side. But I've recently begun majorly amping up how much I walk each day, and I've noticed that my feet hurt after only a short twenty-minute walk while wearing any of my other active shoes. I also have issues with insoles shifting around after a few weeks and having to glue them back in place, and the fix never lasts long.I've never had Skechers before; in fact, I used to roll my eyes at the brand name ever since those shape-up shoes came out while I was in high school and were revealed to be completely ineffective a few years later. However, after reading literally hundreds of great reviews for this particular shoes, I decided that they were at least worth a shot. Honestly, I suspected that some of the reviews were probably exaggerating just how comfortable these shoes were, but the moment I slipped them on, I realized I was wrong - my feet were in heaven.Twenty to thirty minute daily walks are a breeze now, as I experience no pain in my feet whatsoever. I went for a six mile hike on a trail through our local mountains and, even after over two hours of walking, the ache in my feet wasn't a fraction as bad as I would usually experience in other shoes. The insoles also stay perfectly fixed - I believe they are sewn in place. Because of this, I don't have to worry about washing the shoes, because I know the insole won't come out! I just throw the shoes in when I'm doing a load of towels and then air-dry them on the front porch, and they look as good as new. I've never had shoes come out of the wash looking so good before!I have semi-wide feet, and the front of these shoes are quite roomy, and accommodate me perfectly without actually having to opt for the wide version. The only cons I have regarding these shoes are that 1) I've had people tell me they're ugly and look like aqua-socks. Personally, I don't care what people think of my clothing, but if you're the type of person who puts stock in what others think of your appearance, you may want to take this into consideration. 2) The nubs on the bottom are wearing out pretty quickly. For 40-60+ dollars, I'd expect shoes to last a long time, so this aspect has been disappointing. I'm fairly certain I'm going to have to replace them every few months.I ended up buying two pairs of these shoes - one for everyday wear, and one indoor pair that I use on my treadmill. I just wish all the colors were the same price instead of varying so drastically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78PX10FN6VCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058XKH84#wasThisHelpful","R78PX10FN6VCQ","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I typically experience some pain my palms and fingers while crocheting or knitting, and these seemed like the perfect item to aid that. I measured across my knuckles and was a perfect measurement for size Medium.When I got the gloves, they did fit very nicely in the wrist and palm area, but the finger holes came right up to the tips of my fingers! I have pretty average sized hands - my fingers aren't THAT short! As you can imagine, the fingers being so long made it impossible for craft work, plus it made it very hard for my fingers to move at all - after testing out the gloves for less than ten minutes while knitting, my fingers were cramping awfully and my pinkie fingers had both fallen asleep. The gloves ended up putting my hands in far more pain than I was experiencing beforehand.I do see a lot of positive reviews for this product, so I would say that if you've got long and slender fingers, you might find these gloves useful. If you've got more average mitts like I do and need support, perhaps find a different set of crafter's gloves that are fingerless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQJ3L8PIGENL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Y2GY7U#wasThisHelpful","R1BQJ3L8PIGENL","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't surprised by its tiny size since I took out a ruler after reading the product description, and this cauldron should work fine for burning loose incense. However, I'm not sure the one I got was new. The handle and cauldron (both inside and outside!) were covered in brown smears, and were very, VERY sticky - almost as if someone had used the cauldron for burning resin and then returned it. I have a photo of some of the brown goop inside the cauldron (the only bit I remembered to take a photo of before cleaning). The welding is sloppy, and on one side, the triple moon symbol is crooked.

"Our house is very small - one bedroom with a shared office. We needed all the space we could manage, so I traded in my writing desk for this floating one. While quite time consuming to put together, it looks absolutely gorgeous once installed, and has saved us quite a bit of space; we installed inside the office closet, where it fits comfortably with about 5"" clearance on either side. I've always wanted a ""closet desk"", and the floating feature gives me plenty of leg room, as well as area to store filing cabinets and other storage bins if need be.There is a hidden shelf on the bottom in the back that faces the wall - this is where I've hidden my huge surge protector, so only a few of my many cords are visible. There's a small hole in the center bottom so that I can turn the surge protector off if the power goes out (you have to lie on your back on the floor to access it, so it's completely hidden from normal view). The upper shelf is larger than I thought - I was able to fit my Aqueon 17771 Mini Bow 2-1/2 Desktop Aquarium without it sticking out at all - my betta likes watching me work, and seems to be much happier somewhere where he can see me most of the working day!Because I was unable to find the dimensions of the middle cutout area for a computer on any sites, I was unsure my 27"" iMac would fit. It ended up being a perfect fit - see my customer photo. The inner section of this area measures 27"" wide and 20 1/2"" tall, so if you want to be able to tuck your computer into it for more desk space, make sure it fits within these dimensions. If a 27"" iMac fits, I'm pretty sure most desktops should do fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LOXHZ1YJ1RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009I2AL8W#wasThisHelpful","R22LOXHZ1YJ1RT","A19W2I27LYN1D7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19W2I27LYN1D7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There's a nice weight to it and feels wonderful around my wrist.I like this, because I can wear either gold or silver with jewelery with it.The clasp is easy to close on my own. And it was also simple and easy to take off on my own. But, it's so much nicer (and romantic!) when these items are put on by a loved one.This came beautifully boxed. An inner black box inside of another black box. The boxes have the soft feel of the ThinkPad notebooks, that soft silky, matte kind of feeling.This would be wonderful gift.

"I'm loving this Blu phone.  It's light but feels very good and sturdy in my hands.  It has a good feel to it.The buttons are easy to use - volume and power are on the right side of the phone.  Power plug is on the bottom of the phone.I'm moving from a Moto G phone and this Blu phone is lighter, thinner and has a larger screen.  The screen is nice and crisply bright. I love the larger screen without having to deal with a heavier phone.  I can easily slip this in my pocket.While setting this up, the hardest part was removing the battery cover and inserting the sim card.  I had to get my reading glasses out to figure out how to do those.  The battery cover has a slot on the bottom right hand corner which is where you can start to pry apart the battery cover from the phone.  To insert the sim, there is a small, thin metal bar which needs to be lifted loose before inserting the sim.  Yeah, sounds simple now, but while trying to figure it out, I was going a little batty.In regards to the sim cards - this is a dual sim card phone, so you can insert and use 2 sims cards at the same time.  Convenient for people who travel to other countries frequently or who may need to have 2 sim cards regularly (maybe one for work and one for personal use?).While setting up the phone, I logged in to my Google account and magically my contacts appeared and apps started to get installed.  I *think* I liked this...  Yes, it was very convenient.  But, I wasn't aware this would happen.  I probably should have been more aware as everything seems to be saved and tracked and backed up somewhere.  I guess I just need to be careful with my Google account and ID, knowing how much of my data is connected to it!The phone comes with a bunch of goodies: a headset, a USB charger and cable, a screen protector and a protective case.  These items are not super fancy, but they work well and it's great to have everything you need as soon as you have the phone.Oh, one additional item - the phone it has a notification light.  It will blink red when a text message or a voice mail arrives.  Nice feature.The battery seems to last me for well over a day.  I'm in the habit of plugging in at night, but let it go for a couple days and I still had a charge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23U7RDK1YLE9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XIHS62#wasThisHelpful","R23U7RDK1YLE9B","A2I5QH4F5FDKK5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I5QH4F5FDKK5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This drill is solid and very well made, more a contractor grade drill versus a home user or occasional user.  But, the home user will certainly welcome and love the features, too.  A puny, under powered drill just makes the job harder and makes everything take longer, whether a small, quick job or a longer weekend project.  After using this on several projects, over several days, we've come to understand this is the Cadillac of Drills.This cordless drill has AMAZING power and torque.One example of use - we used a larger drill bit and this drill made it a breeze to drill into older wood and pressure treated wood.  It was like putting a knife through soft butter.  There was no locking up of the drill and we could finish the job quickly.  This drill completely blew away any other cordless drill we've used.  Honestly, it made our hearts beat fast with excitement.  We've struggled and suffered with drilling into hard wood before, on so many projects, and this drill completely made that problem a thing of the past.This comes with two batteries, which is great as you will always have enough juice to get a job done.  The batteries have LED lights to show how much battery life is left, which is nice so you know how many bars you have before you need charging.  The batteries came with about 2 bars of charge and charged really quickly when we charged them up.  The charger has a cooling fan of some kind, maybe so it doesn't over heat during the quick charge feature?  Pretty neat.This drill has an easy to use quick release chuck and we love the ratcheting chuck.  It was easy to change drill bits and remove them when finished.The drill is weighted well so it stands up on the battery fine, no tipping over on itself.The batteries and charger are on the larger side compared to a lot of other drills we have.  The battery also makes the drill a bit on the heavy side.  On my bathroom scale, it weighs 5.4 pounds.  If you need the excellent power, quality and longer battery life, as well as faster charging, this is the drill for you.  If you prefer a lighter drill, this might be too heavy for you.Oh, one more thing - this comes in a really nice solid material carry case.  Most drills either don't come with any case or come with a soft bag.  This hard carry case makes it easy to store and transport the drill without risk of any injury to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16V7SN2SELQ96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0159N7FWI#wasThisHelpful","R16V7SN2SELQ96","A2I5QH4F5FDKK5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I5QH4F5FDKK5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We grill at least once or twice a week.  We've gotten used to our grill and after grilling for a few years, our grilling skills are adequate. Still, having a grilling probe thermometer that also can tell you the temperature of the grill is a big plus. We usually do rely on the temperature gauge on the grill and we think it works well but we've heard they can be off.We tend to grill steaks and burgers and sausage mostly, and this type of device isn't the most beneficial for those items but for large items, this really comes in handy and works well.  It being wireless and being able to have the sensor inside the home is a great advantage. We compared the temperature this gave us to a different probe thermometer they both matched up closely so this seems to be pretty accurate.These are black in color and both come with handy stands. Batteries are needed for both devices, which come with the units.I wish these came with a storage bag to hold these in when not in use. It seems these types of things never come with a bag and you need to toss them in a drawer for storage. A tougher material for the units or rubberized case would be helpful for long term durability.Careful around flame... I killed a previous grill probe because flame flashed up and hit the probe.  The instructions give this warning, too.  I'm not sure how we're supposed to keep flame away 100% of the time, though.  I mean, we're cooking over an open flame, so...  ?It says it can monitor meat and grill temperature up to 300 feet.

"I have used these reusable filters before and this one works very well and fits perfectly in my K cup machine. I admit I switch sometimes between packaged k cups and my own ground coffee. Having the option to enjoy your own ground coffee and also being able to brew one cup at a time for convenience is great. There really is a difference between your own ground coffee. Yes it requires a little more effort in having to grind, and then clean this filter but worth it if you like coffee. At the office it is a little more work so I often rely on the prepacked ones. I had another reusable filter in the past that just did not fit right and actually leaked. I am not sure why. I tried a few different things to make it work and it never did work just right. No issues with this unit.One of the other great things about these is you can regulate the amount of coffee. If its one of those mornings and I need a strong cup.. more coffee. If its a little later in the day on a Sunday and I want coffee but not as strong I use less. Rinsing easily under water and ready for next use.I would recommend as in the long run less money that always using packaged k cups.  We received this for free for evaluation.

"We drink wine often and now and then we do not finish the bottle. As a wine drinker I can say that these really do help keep wine a little longer then just replacing the cork. They do work and take the air out of the wine. Next to investing in a more expensive wine preserver system these are great for the home user. Simply put one of the two rubber ""corks"" in the wine bottle and put the pump on top. Depending on how much wine is left and after a few pumps your done. When you are ready the next day or two to enjoy more wine you remove the rubber stopper and after a brief wisk of air escaping you are ready. I believe I read somewhere that when you hear a slight difference in the air pumping out sound you know you have pumped enough. Well you will notice for yourself.

"We have a mostly outdoor cat and he's had a problem with hairballs.  When talking with the neighbors or walking outside, I've seen his little hairballs on the sidewalk, in the street, on driveways.  Yuck.  And when I see them, I do my best to clean them up.We haven't had good luck with hairball products before.  We've tried treats and adding different things to his food.  Didn't work, or he didn't like it and wouldn't eat it.This Nutro hairball control food is working well and the best part - he loves to eat it!  I've still found a hairball here and there, but they are happening less and less now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZYRXFPOWXHS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZI3VJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZYRXFPOWXHS0","A2I5QH4F5FDKK5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I5QH4F5FDKK5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Yes... this works.  This covers the natural scent of ... well ... poop.  We're finding that we don't have to use more than one or two sprays, though.  Any more than that, and the scent of the Poo-Pourri is very strong and noticeable, many, many feet away from the bathroom.  No poop scent, though.  So, that's good.  But, then, having a poop scent billowing down the hall was never our problem.  So, be mindful about how much Poo-Pourri you use.It's easy to use, just spray in the toilet, into the water, before pooping.  Somehow, it traps the poop odor with nary a noxious scent escaping.Good to travel with, easy to stick in a purse to use when out and about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F66OU5QVPKKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW25UMC#wasThisHelpful","R1F66OU5QVPKKQ","A2I5QH4F5FDKK5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I5QH4F5FDKK5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful workhorse of a printer.  It was wonderfully easy to set up.  Actually, the hardest part was removing the blue tape which was holding all the movable pieces stable and safe during transport.The quick start guide was easy to follow.  The ink bags are a breeze to install and there is no mess at all.  There are two paper trays, so different size/stock paper can be loaded for use.It’s a pretty large printer.  The box said it takes 2 people to remove it from the box and that is correct (at least in my case).  There was no way I could remove it from the box on my own, but it was pretty light with 2 people carrying it.Getting it on my wireless network went pretty smoothly.  Installing the software on my Android cell, iPhone, iPad, Android tablet and computer was also a pleasant experience.  No problems, with the computer and the iPad being the faster/smoother installs.  Being able to printing from all these is fun.  My sister and brother came over and they were able to print from their cells phones within minutes.The printer is a good printer and we’re getting good , clean, crisp prints from the printer, just what you would expect from an Epson printer.  Oh, and it’s fast.  I also love the large LCD touch screen.  The features seem to be endless on this printer  -- duplexing, ethernet connectivity, scan, copy, fax...Now, while this is a wonderful printer and it prints fantastically and is easy to set up, I’m not so sure how well it would hold up in a very busy work environment.  It’s not the speed of the printer.  That is actually quite amazing and it prints extremely fast.  It’s also not a worry about using up ink too quickly.  This printer comes with enough ink for thousands of black and thousands of color prints.  No…. my concern is for the physical body of the printer.  It’s plastic.  Yes, it’s very nice plastic.  And it does seem to be well made.  But, I don’t think the drawers, buttons, levers and paper tray are made for any type of abuse.  I’ve seen people at work being very mean to the printers, taking out their frustration on them, or just using too much force to close drawers or lids.  And while the printers at work are ugly beasts and they don’t print as nice as this Epson, the plastic is harder, tougher and built for the abuse that the poor printers get.Anyway, that’s really my only negative on this printer.  It’s an expensive printer, over a grand, and I can’t see it lasting for many years in a very busy office environment, without something cracking or snapping here and there.  I think, though, it’s perfect for a very small business or more intimate office.  It's all the printer you'll ever need and should last a long time if not abused.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16O7Z65PC34GK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JFF0#wasThisHelpful","R16O7Z65PC34GK","A2I5QH4F5FDKK5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I5QH4F5FDKK5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Difficult installation compared to Schlage Keypad Deadbolt.  Very hard to line up screws through door, rubber gaskets kept twisting.  Took 30 minutes to do something that should have taken 10.Programming is strange to say the least.  Managed to put in a Master Pin, but following their instructions can't add other User Pins.  We have to use Master Pin to open door.  Had to do reset to ""Factory"" twice and their diagram on how to do it was flawed, says to ""push reset button"" and there isn't one . . . you have to use a paperclip to push the button inside a small hole.  I think I reset it, but still won't let me use anything other than the Master Pin after I reentered it and started over.I finally figured out their programming instructions . . . after being in the computer software industry for 35 years I count myself as an experienced user, but this one was stumping me.  There is supposedly a setting that makes the door auto-relock which I finally got to work. It is a great feature, BUT the only setting is 30 seconds.  We would like it to be more like 1 or 2 minutes so you could take the garbage out or run to the car for something.On the pro side it is an attractive unit and I like the emergency battery feature and the Auto Lock feature.Couldn't test the ZWave network feature as I don't have the controller required.

"Really bright!!  Covers a 6-8' circle with light.  It's cool white, but for a walk light who cares.  Very light construction, be very careful putting it together.  Before you start, open the battery cover and make sure they are seated properly. Turn the switch by the batteries to ""on"".  Then you can assemble the 6 pieces and go stick it someplace where you need good light at night.  Note that the batteries are a problem area, I needed to reseat them after a couple of days -- thought the light had failed, the batteries had just fallen out of contact.  Put a piece of foam inside the battery lid to keep that from happening again.The chrome is a little cheap looking and had the battery problem, so one star off.

"This is a very useful product for the BBQ season.  Since it is winter, we have tested in our ovens and it works perfectly.  The Bluetooth range seems to be about 35 feet indoors, may be a little more outdoors.  Linked up fine with my Moto Maxx and with my Nexus 7.Software complaint: while it does a great job of showing the temperature, it also offers a timer which would be great if they both displayed on the one screen.  They should be integrated instead of acting like stand-alone apps.  You start the temperature tracking, and then when you go to the timer to set it for basting or whatever, it hides so you don't know how much time you have left.  All you would need is a little countdown window in the same screen as the temps.Note that cleanup was easy and the winder makes it easy to store properly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DZX14DV2PJ61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ1SQV2#wasThisHelpful","R1DZX14DV2PJ61","A20G074MWH9U7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20G074MWH9U7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is very handy and does a lot of projects that require a level, so I asked her to help with the review on this product.  Following are her comments:""Love the look.  Love the construction.  Love the carrying case.  It is relatively light weight so that you can easily manipulate it with one hand if you are drawing a level or plumb line on a wall.  The hand grab areas are user friendly.  The buttons are all user friendly and the laser button is at the end so that it can’t be accidentally confused with anything else.  As a level, this product is superb.  Besides the easy-to-read LED display for the distance from level , there is an angled line drawing which tells you that it is out of level.  When the lines meet, level has been reached.  There are also 2 arrows which tell you which way you need to go to reach your goal.  Where it goes beyond an ordinary bubble level is in its ability to give you exact angles of any degree if you require them.  And in my estimation, it is quite accurate.As far as the laser part of it, I feel that there are many products on the market that are perhaps easier to use and that are more effective.  This can be used by the occasional handyman for DIY projects, but in order to use it to full capacity, you will need a tripod and even then, I’m not sure this is the best or easiest to use product for a laser-type job. ""Note that I couldn't get it back from her.  It is now part of her kit. She also felt it was a little expensive for the everyday handyman, so recommended subtracting one star for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIJR7ZVP4FK3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZHIH0Y#wasThisHelpful","R1TIJR7ZVP4FK3","A20G074MWH9U7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20G074MWH9U7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After I had thought I had done my research I bought this to replace an aging Denon AVR-988 unit. Wanted more HDMI ports.  Big mistake was not asking the Yamaha support group on Facebook a lot of questions before I bought it.  First, there is no way to support both speakers and a set of wireless headphones at the same time.  There is no monitor out function at all.  I am very hard of hearing and like to watch TV or listen to music with the family using my Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones.  I can do that with the Denon, but not the Yamaha . . . guess their engineers haven't heard of the ADA requirements.Second, the zone 2 only works with NON-HDMI sources.  If you want to listen to the game in one room while watching it in another as we can do with the Denon, there is no way.  You cannot pipe audio from your DVD player because the input is via HDMI, you cannot send music from your cable or Uverse connection if they are connected via HDMI.Note that there are ""Monitor Out"" jacks on the back, but they only work for non-HDMI sources.I have a feeling that a lot of the so-called ""Zone 2"" and ""Zone 3"" on all of the Yamaha AVR have the same problem as well as some of the other manufacturers, but none of them are forthcoming in their advertising or brochures.  You have to download their manual and search to page xxx to find out what you want doesn't work.  One item that does work through these zones apparently is anything coming in from the network.  But then you would have to have a PC that is remotely controllable to take advantage of this.  I do have a Alienware Alpha that will be hooked up to my future AVR, but it attaches via HDMI.If you are thinking of buying a Yamaha and want to use it for anything beyond a basic 7.1 setup, go to their facebook page and ask questions.  I give them 4 stars for answering support questions there, but the product only gets one star.Since I waited too long to return this unit, I will be selling it cheap.  Haven't opened it yet, luckily I was reading the manual and started having questions before I tore apart my audio/video closet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QHGAO6F2HLIR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B981F1U#wasThisHelpful","R2QHGAO6F2HLIR","A20G074MWH9U7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20G074MWH9U7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, works perfectly in our shower!  We completely redid our master bath and put this in the shower.  Contrary to what some reviewers have said, it really only turns on from the motion sensor when we get into the shower.  The glass door seems to be enough to block it's view.  Ran a 4"" pipe up through the roof to make sure there was no back pressure.  Sound is extremely low, can barely hear the air movement when you are in the shower with the water turned off.  Nothing fogs in the bathroom, ceiling outside of the shower stays dry.  Only complain is that it is moving so much air that you feel the cooling breeze  as soon as you turn off the shower . . . not sure that is a valid complaint :) . Note that we did not wire this through a switch as it has an on/off switch in the unit when you pull the faceplate down . . . we wanted something that was always on.Well made, moves a lot of air, auto features work perfectly, almost silent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IOR7S747VUZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XNWP5M#wasThisHelpful","R2IOR7S747VUZR","A20G074MWH9U7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20G074MWH9U7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Would have given it 5 stars except for the bogus marketing claims of ""600Mbit/sec"" speed which this device does not, in fact can not deliver for basic technical reasons. It does deliver decent speeds in my tests, at or above most of the little plug in adapters that I have used.  It seems very stable, haven't had to reboot it once and had it on a high use device overnight that was downloading updates to a new system.It is not as tiny like a few of the N adapters I have used, but it does deliver both AC and N capabilities.  I would recommend using a short USB cable extension if you are using it on a mobile device as it sticks out about an inch and would be easy to crunch.

"The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One might be the gamers systems to many people, but PCs have more games, cheaper games, and can usually make those games look way prettier. Still, PCs can be a pain in the ass to use, particularly plugged into a TV. You can't just pop in a disc, pick up a controller and start playing. The Alienware Alpha claims to be the best of both worlds: a PC game console.  If you price out the components and try to make one like this yourself you will end up spending more and getting something that will not be ""wife friendly"".  This box is very WF!!!First, if you want to fully use this console and all of its power get a keyboard/mouse or keyboard/trackpad.  It takes a long time to set it up to get started and in several places you start wanting a keyboard.  It took me way over an hour to get through all the setup, update loading, question answering, etc.. When you get to the games side, there some of the older games that require either mouse clicks or keyboard input.  Since you can get a nice wireless Logitech keyboard/trackpad for less than $30 on Amason, it's really not that big of a deal and it expands what you can do with this little box.It really is a little box, far smaller than my XBox, and it draws lots less power.  Unfortunately, part of that is because there is no DVD drive.  But most games you'll want to play download from the net anyway.  That does point up one problem that my daughter picked up: it has a very slow drive.  Some of the really big games need to keep loading from the drive and sometimes she thought the system had quit.  Luckily you can easily upgrade the all of the components yourself.  I would get the cheapest model and add your own memory and maybe upgrade to a SSD or very fast hard drive.  Other than the drive, everything else is screaming fast on this box.  I think all you need is the i3 cpu as the custom GPU just blows away the XBox.  You can play almost everything at full 1080p with decent frame rates.  For sound, you are either going to need USB Headphones or a receiver/TV that can handle the optical audio out.  Since there is no 3.5mm audio jack it's tough to get audio out of the Alpha if you plug it into an HDMI monitor instead of a TV.When you get to downloading games from Steam you find another limitation.  It downloads them one at a time and you can't start play until a game is fully downloaded.  I looked around and found a couple of people that said just to cue up a batch of games and leave it running overnight.  Again, if you are planning on playing some of the Window's games from EA or others you have to go to the Windows desktop to install and run EA games like Crysis 3 and Titanfall.  That means you need the keyboard/mouse again.Should you buy it?  Do you want a game console? Then buy one as a Windows box will be anywhere near as easy as an Xbox or PlayStation.  BUT, if you want a gaming PC that fits into the living room better than any gaming PC I have ever seen, this is what you want.  If you do, buy the base model and spend a little extra on a SSD or hybrid hard drive to replace the one that comes standard. Upgrade the RAM yourself. Get a mouse and keyboard.  Happiness will ensue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15YUN90DN4WVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA7AF74#wasThisHelpful","R15YUN90DN4WVT","A20G074MWH9U7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A20G074MWH9U7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The slider for setting the light is a real improvement over the others we have used.  Much easier to find and use.

We have one from the other ""L"" switch company that only supports LED and we needed one for a mixed group of lights.

". . . and I realize that my opinion is in the minority.I gave the book two stars because it is head-and-shoulders above the pablum that poses for ""historical"", ""1st century Christian"" fiction written by other authors.Randy Singer is, in many respects, a good writer.  I have not read any of his legal fiction, but I am willing to give one a try.  He tried to do his historical homework with regard to 1st century Rome, and I appreciated that.  He used the writings of Roman philosophers and historians, and I appreciated that.  His approach to the New Testament was more disappointing -- and his refusal to use any of the 1st and 2nd century Christian material -- which has survived, and is readily available in English-language critical editions -- is, in my opinion, historically dishonest.  A number of points, some of which have been raised by other reviewers.  There may be points presented that could be construed as spoilers -- so I'm giving the alert now.Item:  Singer seems to have a fixation with crucifixion.  The notion that Seneca would subject sons of Roman nobles to fake crucifixions -- and that the noble families would allow it, is absurd on its face.Item:  Singer seems to have a fixation with Vestal Virgins.  The notion of a years-long love affair involving a Vestal Virgin, without discovery, or even reasonable suspicion, is also absurd on its face -- and the penalty for love affairs with Vestal Virgins was severe.Item:  While obviously wanting to stick to an uber-literal interpretation of the Biblical text, Singer makes some gaffes.  For example, Nicodemus came to Jesus by night -- not the other way around.  We don't know if the woman caught in the act of adultery was at the foot of the cross; we don't know what Jesus wrote with His finger in the sand -- Singer uses these as legitimate plot devices -- but if you're going to insist on ultra-literalism, you have to be consistent.Item:  I don't find the notion that Theophilus was Paul's advocate convincing -- but as a plot device, I'm willing to let it stand.Item:  THE BIGGEST AND MOST EGREGIOUS ISSUES ARE HISTORICAL!  If you are willing to use the testimony of Josephus; if you are willing to use the testimony of Roman historians, why in heaven's name don't you do the same with the early Christian texts?*  The entire notion of both Luke's Gospel and the book of Acts being hastily composed during the very earliest time of persecution suggests to me that Singer has never seriously studied the composition of either text.  Luke was a highly educated man who was an eyewitness to some of the events in Acts.  In the Prologue verses for both books, he proposes to his readership exactly what he plans to do, and how he plans to do it.  He then executes his plan exactly as he stated that he would.  This is classical Greek biography; not something dashed off in a short period of time.*  How does Singer's views of the composition of Luke's Gospel explain the personal family details found in the Infancy Narrative?*  Singer presents Luke as using some fragments of an account of the life of Jesus written by some young Christian named John Mark.  Mark was more than just some guy!  He had traveled with Paul, and was the secretary to Peter.*  For that matter, where is Peter?  He's mentioned once.  Doesn't Singer realize that Peter, too, was a victim of Nero's persecution?*  Singer's historical timeline is goofed up.  Acts ends with Paul in Rome, living in a rented house, awaiting trial.  Most scholars (using the testimony in both Acts, and in II Timothy) believe that Paul was released following his first trial, continued to travel, and was re-arrested and martyred during Nero's persecution.*  Singer's theology is goofed up.  When a crowd of believers shows up at the home of Theophilus, a watered-down version of a post-Reformation era communion service is presented -- as almost an afterthought.  Is Singer unaware of Paul's specific instructions in 1st Corinthians regarding the celebration of the Lord's Supper?*  Details about the persecution under Nero abound.  It didn't happen the way Singer presents it.  And no, even Nero, would not have dared to crucify Roman citizens.  Hence, the beheading of Paul (the Roman citizen) and the crucifixion of Peter (not a Roman citizen.)*  Singer does give a few clues to a reviewer who is an historian, that at least some early Christian traditions were researched.  Singer uses the name ""Longinus"" -- long associated with the Centurion at the foot of the cross.  Singer also writes an epilogue, using the name of an Early Church Father -- Eusebius -- but mis-dating the Council of Nicaea by a decade; and suggesting that Eusebius presented the Emperor Constantine with copies of the Bible.  Only problem here?  The New Testament was still very much in flux during the time of Eusebius -- and Eusebius writes about that very controversy!As I said:  I wanted to like this book.  I liked the premise.  But I can't get past the sloppy Scripture scholarship, and I REALLY can't get past what appears to be a deliberate re-writing of Early Church History.Give this one a miss.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRFDAQNE9X4EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414348606#wasThisHelpful","RRFDAQNE9X4EN","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
". . . but he is so agenda-driven regarding the issue of anti-semitism (real or imagined) that it really detracts from the storyline.Please don't get me wrong; this is a good novel in many respects.  The theme of post-WWII Italy is one that can -- and should -- be thoroughly explored, both through works of fiction and non-fiction, and in this work of fiction, Carroll uses interesting, well-fleshed out characters to tell several stories (Warburg being one of them).  Without spoilers, I found much of the ending quite satisfying.The problem here is that seemingly every non-Jewish character is presented as all anti-Semitic, all of the time from (predictably) Church leaders to the President of the United States.  In the latter case, he suggests that the historical President Truman deliberately fired his Jewish Cabinet Secretary, because he was afraid that if he, the Vice-President, and the Secretary of State were all killed, someone Jewish would become President.  The only problem with that theory, Mr. Carroll, is that this is not (and was not) how the line of succession works -- and any 9th grade civics textbook could have told you that.

". . . by this purported novel (using the term very loosely).  I am a conservative Catholic by most reasonably accepted standards.  I'm a convert who knew exactly what I was getting into when I was received into the Church.  I am, by profession, an historian and theologian -- and my Scripture studies and interpretation would certainly fall well to the right of center.  I believe in the reality of sin and evil and am sadly aware of the sins committed in the name of God and in the name of the Church.  I am strongly opposed to the heresy of Modernism -- but I am equally opposed to that (hopefully) small group of very traditionalist Catholics who throw around the term ""Modernism"" to attack anyone who dares to disagree with them.  I see that as a mark of intellectual laziness.This work of ""faction"" is a hashed together diatribe about anything the author doesn't like about the Church, held thinly together by a bizarre plot that would make most conspiracy theorists blush.I was given my copy by a very devout, very pious, woman in my parish who is quite possibly more conservative than I am.  She was very frustrated by the author's strident tone and wanted to discuss her concerns with me.  I not only concurred with her concerns, but added a few of my own.  The author may have been more persuasive if his tone had been a bit more irenic -- but that still would not have made up for the structural defects of the novel itself.Without spoilers, let me just suggest that the ending smacks of more than a little ""sede-vacante"" influence.Don't waste your time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVO5J3CWTHB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=061522525X#wasThisHelpful","R3AVO5J3CWTHB0","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

". . . and I learned quite a bit.I'll admit it.  Even as a history major, World War I history has not been an area of expertise.  I knew that the assassination of the Archduke was considered to be the spark which ignited the powder keg which erupted into World War I.  I knew that the stupidity, naiveté, and just plain bone-headedness of the leadership of most of the participating nations pretty much guaranteed a second world war.  I knew that American involvement in the war probably helped bring an early end to the war.  Beyond that?  Not much.Boy did I learn!I didn't know what an ""Archduke"" was and didn't understand the (very) complicated hierarchies of the Austrian royalty and nobility.  I didn't realize that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the Heir Apparent.  I didn't realize how devout both he and his wife were, nor how devoted they both were to their family.  I also didn't realize how poorly his children were treated and how his sons suffered during the Nazi regime.This book sets out to re-examine the Archduke; discover who he really was and what he believed; and to attempt to correct some of the historical revisionism that surrounded his family.  In my view, the authors succeeded in their purposes -- and, apparently, at least one surviving member of his House believe so as well.This book; this love story reads like a novel.  I couldn't put it down, and indeed, have re-read a good deal of it.As an interesting side-note, the Archduke's nephew (and heir) who was forced off the throne in 1918, is well on his way to being declared a saint in the Catholic Church.After reading this book, the following remark by Sir Winston Churchill makes a great deal of sense:""This war (World War II) would never have come unless, under American and modernising pressure, we had driven the Habsburgs out of Austria and the Hohenzollerns out of Germany. By making these vacuums we gave the opening for the Hitlerite monster to crawl out of its sewer on to the vacant thrones. No doubt these views are very unfashionable....""

". . . with a good deal of value.I have no doubt that this book has infuriated many.  In ""JFK, Conservative"", Ira Stoll is literally attempting to re-make a legend.  Such an attempt will generate controversy.Stoll makes the point, however, that word usages have changed significantly throughout the years, and words like ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" don't necessarily carry the same meanings today that they have in the past.  It is also true that the perspective of the various political parties has also changed over the years.Whether Stoll's usage of ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" can be sustained is a reasonable point of discussion.  However . . .. . . as the words are understood today, Kennedy's anti-Communism would certainly be considered ""conservative"".. . . as the words are understood today, Kennedy's foreign policy would certainly be considered ""conservative"" (except with the Libertarian movement).. . . as the words are understood today, Kennedy's tax-cutting policies would certainly be considered ""conservative"".  (Even, it is interesting to note, more conservative than Barry Goldwater's views).. . . as the words are understood today, Kennedy's attempts at fiscal restraint would certainly be considered conservative.Stoll also points out that some of Kennedy's liberal biographers were creative in their editing and selective in their use of quotation to attempt to prove their own points and political philosophies.I would not classify this book as straight history, but by the same token, I would not classify it as agenda-driven either.

While the book is titled ""Lawrence in Arabia"", the book isn't merely about TE Lawrence (though he is the major player).  The book also details the machinations of the German anti-Semite Curt Prufer (who manages to acquire as a lover and recruit as a spy the younger sister of the man who would become the first president of the State of Israel; Aaron Aaronsohn, a scientist and committed Zionist; and the American William Yale, working for the interests of Standard Oil, New York.  All four men play significant roles in this book.""Lawrence in Arabia"" also serves to de-bunk myths made popular by the classic film ""Lawrence of Arabia"" -- and also recounts in incredible detail the idiocy of most of the military commanders, especially the British and French; the deceitful diplomatic posturing and posing, again, especially by the British and French; and the complete naiveté of President Wilson as to the historical and political realities in the Middle East.I appreciate the enormous depth of research and work that went into this book.  I also appreciate that the personal editorializing by the author was kept to a minimum (and concentrated at the very end of the book.)

". . . as is my brother, and we both have a number of iterations of the game.  This one looks flashy and ""hip"" (and, I suppose in one sense, it is) but I note a number of detractions.  For one thing, only 2-4 players can play the game rather than 6 (or even more, in some editions.)  For another, at least to my mind, the game has been ""dumbed-down"".  There is more luck involved than merely two six-sided dice.  And the game seems designed to run more quickly than the standard edition (and yes, I realize that this may NOT be a detraction for all!)  This edition will also need to be updated regularly, as certain ""brands"" come and go in popularity (though I'll freely admit that Coca-Cola and Pepsi are likely here to stay!)Look, to my mind, it's hard to improve on a classic -- and the original game is a classic.  In my view, Hasbro has seriously damaged the board game market; absorbing Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, Selchow and Righter and Avalon Hill, but not noticeably improving the product or developing new games.I've been playing the original game since I was five.

". . . to a stunning saga of Space Opera.In the opinion of this reviewer, Michael Flynn does ""Space Opera"" as well as any alive today (and with more depth of character than Doc Smith, and less of the tediousness one sees toward the end of Asimov's ""Foundation"" series).To the best of my ability, there are no spoilers here.Several reviewers pointed out (rightly, in my estimation) that this novel is not a ""stand-alone"".  It must be read as the fourth book of a four volume saga.  (I will point out, though, that knocking off stars for not being a stand-alone is not quite fair).  This concludes the saga begun in ""The January Dancer"" and opens up a universe of worlds which is thousands, if not tens of thousands years in the future; a universe of high technology -- but one in which much has been forgotten.  Amid the fighting; the betrayal; the various factions; backstories galore (which really don't begin to clarify themselves until the third volume) this is, at the end of the day, a love story.  A love story with vibrant, yet deeply flawed characters and well worth the read.As an aside, I love what Flynn has done with his take on the evolution of languages and names.  Very creative -- and believable.Flynn's style is not to everyone's taste -- and requires effort -- but the reward gained is well worth the effort.Very highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BMZGR3QCXQTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765334801#wasThisHelpful","R2BMZGR3QCXQTW","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Chapters are devoted to each stage of Henson's career, from his early days at WTOP in Washington, DC, to Sesame Street (which, I argue, would never have been the huge success it has been over the last 40 years without Henson and his Muppet team), to the wildly hysterical (and ground-breaking) The Muppet Show; to Fraggle Rock; to the films -- both the successful Muppet Movies, and the less than successful (but cult classics) ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Labyrinth"" and everything in-between.I learned a lot about Jim Henson.  This biography does an excellent job of presenting who he was as a person.  It is not a hagiography by any stretch of the imagination.  Character flaws are certainly not ignored (and Henson had his share).

The stories range from the wildly funny to the depths of pathos -- and food seems to be part of every story that is told.

". . . than the previous novel -- but with a similar criticism.  It is obvious that Mr. Berry loves history -- and I applaud him for that.  This being said:  If you're going to delve into Middle-Eastern history (which is primarily religious in nature) you need to have some idea as to what you are talking about; you need to have more than just a superficial grasp of theology.  It is clear to this reviewer that Mr. Berry really does not.What I liked most about this book was the character interplay between Cotton, his ex-wife, and his son.  Some of it was, perhaps, predictable -- but for whatever reasons, I like Mr. Berry's characters.  The quest for the lost ""Great Library of Alexandria"" is a theme that has been used before -- but that's okay as it is an interesting theme, and one that will most likely to be continued to used.Not high literature -- but not bad for a bit of escapism!","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9EJOM2S3SIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345485769#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9EJOM2S3SIP","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Capon's masterpiece, ""The Supper of the Lamb"", one of the later chapters is dedicated to the importance of the dinner party.  In ""Party Spirit"", Fr. Capon takes the concept of the dinner party and carries it forward in a most delightful way.Ten or more years separate ""Party Spirit"" from ""The Supper of the Lamb"", and in some respects, Fr. Capon's tastes (and principles) have redacted slightly.  For example, while still abhorring the concept of the cocktail party (and, with apologies to St. Thomas Aquinas, demolishes the concept in a manner which would delight any scholastic theologian) valuable points are given for when the giving of a cocktail party seems inevitable.  In addition, Fr. Capon's views on the ideal number of guests is more broadly characterized than in the earlier work.Fr. Capon opines that the only two types of parties are the planned ones and the impromptu ones -- and spends a good deal of time discussing both.  I particularly enjoyed, however, the umpteen number of both main dishes and desserts created impromptu from a minimum number of ingredients.The theology, while not as pervasive as in ""The Supper of the Lamb"" is nonetheless present -- and a necessary part of the book.  Of particular interest to me was his discussion of the Parable of the Wedding Feast.Four+ stars.  It's not ""The Supper of the Lamb"" -- such a Magnum Opus comes along only once a lifetime.

I may well not have continued.Let me start with the positives:  I truly liked the characters, and that is probably the main reason this book received two stars, instead of one.  I liked the human interest angle.  I liked the action.  I liked the centuries-old castle being restored using only tools available hundreds of years ago.But . . .Mr. Berry may well love history -- but his knowledge of Church history and Early Christianity is sorely lacking.  And I'm not talking about those issues over which scholars have legitimate and reasonable disagreement.  I'm talking basic, fundamental facts about which there really isn't any dispute.  One example should suffice (and I know I'll lose some readers here).  There was a fundamental difference between sub-New Testament writings which, even though never part of Scripture, were widely used in the Church, and writings which the Church rejected outright -- and never used in any capacity.  The author completely conflates these two very distinct types of literature into a single genre.  You just can't do that.I'm continuing to read the series, again, because I like the characters -- and need a bit of escapism from time to time.

". . . in the ""inner workings"" of the Royal Household of Queen Victoria, this book is for you.This book is neither biography, in the strict sense of the word; nor is it history, again in the strict sense of the word -- though there is a good deal of both contained within the pages.  It relates the story of the reign of Queen Victoria from beginning to end -- through the eyes of six different retainers who served her in various (and very different) ways.  All six perspectives are unique -- and anyone even remotely interested in 19th century England should be delighted.  One thing I particularly enjoyed was reading about the quite different relationships that the Queen maintained with her various Prime Ministers -- and how whatever political party was in power would try to place ""their people"" in the Queen's ""Inner Circle"".A truly enjoyable read -- and not just for a ""history geek"" like me!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4QT93ZU599/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062269917#wasThisHelpful","RU4QT93ZU599","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
". . . Steve Berry ""Cotton Malone"" novel I ever read, so I did not have a great deal of the backstory available to those who have already been fans.

The stories of all four of these presidents has long interested me, so I thought I'd give the book a try.I'm glad that I did.  The premise, admittedly, was a bit far-fetched, but the storyline was well-handled.  Some of the characters interested me enough that I decided to go back and read some of Berry's early ""Cotton Malone"" novels (which I will review at a later point).""Conspiracy"" novels do run the risk of trying to be ""too clever by half"" or by insulting an historically informed reader with silliness -- but I didn't find that this novel fell into either of these pitfalls.An enjoyable and recommended read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TN022UV46WV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345505522#wasThisHelpful","R1TN022UV46WV","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes, I know what to expect from a formulaic plot -- and there is nothing wrong with a good formula -- but this one was weak.Without any spoilers, the rather dramatic ending of the last Ethan Gage novel resolves itself almost immediately -- in a manner I found to be somewhat staged, if not downright unbelievable.

This book gives deep background on the upbringing and education (both religious and secular) of Henry's children; not only the three that later ruled, but also of his acknowledged illegitimate son, Henry Fitz Roy.  This book deals not so much on ""how"" they reigned (whether for good or for ill) but also ""what made them tick"" as human beings, caught as they were in politically perilous times.In my professional life, I've had occasion to lecture on numerous occasions on Henry VIII and the role that he played in the English Reformation -- and I'll confess, upon reading this book, I learned quite a few things I didn't previously know.

Yes, the plots are a bit formulaic -- but it's an entertaining formula -- and the reader is aware of this going in.I also appreciate that while I was reading this work of fiction -- cyber attacks from China were actually occurring.

". . . with the tragedies in Ireland in the 19th century; this book was a devastating reading.""The Famine Plot"" examines the relationship between England and Ireland during the various waves of famine and blight which swept over Ireland through much of the 19th century.  I'm a reasonably well-read historian -- and even I was shocked by the callousness, disregard, bloated bureaucracy, greed, and downright evil perpetrated by the English political, social, and religious leadership against Ireland.  The book's author is obviously trying to make a case that the behavior of the English government toward the starving Irish rises to the level of genocide (according to the UN definition) and, in the eyes of this reviewer, he makes a pretty darn good case.  (Honestly, there were times when I could only read a few pages without tossing the book aside in disgust at man's inhumanity to his fellow man.)The stereotypical Irish Catholic mistrust of the English Protestant is certainly made clear.  And understandable.I have to note that there were few ""good guys"" in this narrative.  Both major political parties in England share plenty of blame.  The sympathetic and/or charitable English landlord was the exception, rather than the rule.  And the attempt to tie food for the starving to coerced religious conversion was beyond the pale.An outstanding, yet painful read.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LZPGBR5GACZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230109527#wasThisHelpful","R2LZPGBR5GACZP","A3MSB482DIB9SL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MSB482DIB9SL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laney and Gunner haven't had it easy, but things sure get even harder in this one. I really liked that we got Gunner's point of view along with Laney's in this one. We really needed it with everything coming to a head. This book sure keeps you on your toes. The previous books have been leading up to this. Betrayal, back stabbing, and bring you to your knees hurt happen, but there is more than meets the eye. We all know about Luke and Gunner, but Colt another cowboy is added to the mix. Mighty jealous of Laney having three hunky cowboys in her life. Will Gunner finally get the justice he seeks? And will Laney get her HEA?

"At the beginning while reading I didn't think I was going to really like this one as much as the previous book in the series, but boy was I proved wrong. I really got caught up in the book. You have Luke and Alexis two damaged souls. They have scars both physical and emotional. To see the magic healing touch these two have for one another is something to read. You can't help, but feel for them. Their inner demons really do a number, but on Alexis' journey of self discovery she gets way more then she ever expected. Luke is set to task of ""babysitting"" Alexis, but he definitely gets way more then he bargained for. But will it come back to bit him in the butt by keeping it a secret why he just happens to show up everywhere Alexis is?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GXVLMO0319BX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013BEDMPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1GXVLMO0319BX","A3O24SH2K12EL7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3O24SH2K12EL7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, what a book. I was hooked right from the beginning with Ryker interacting with his little girls and the whole spider scene. The book just gets better from there. Ryker is definitely going on my favorite book boyfriend list. He has passion, compassion, and protective of those he cares about plus a bonus he is oh so yummy. I liked how the book really got in the process of running a hockey team. It gives a great feel of the game which as a sports lover and romance book lover I feel is so important.  Gray is making history by becoming the first female general manager in hockey. She has an up hill battle, but she has the support of her star goalie. You can feel the instant attraction between them. When they're together it's HOT!! One problem, they have to keep it a secret with what's going on between them. Things get dicey for them, but can they come ahead on top? Loved the ending of the book was just perfect and the epilogue was a great way to wrap up this story.

As I read on of course I get more of a understanding behind it. Arianna is working on her thesis and it's about the legend/myths about Castle Nathair. What she gets is way more then she bargained for. There is something about the blacksmith Craig. More then meets the eye with that one. Get yourself wrapped up in magic, intrigue, and mystery with this book.

There is no way to explain how much I enjoyed this book! It had me so hooked I hardly could stop reading it. The connection between Olivia and Mateo makes this book work so well. Man the heat in this book is off the charts hot! Right off the bat too. Be forewarned you may need to fan yourself when reading. Mateo is a dirty talker and he does it so well. Olivia is a very likable character. Her life is in the toilet at the moment and she's coming back to Salvation where she won't get the warmest welcome, but she sucks it up and makes a stand.

He is jaded and unwilling to let another woman into their lives. Ryder is 7 and as school begins, it appears not having a mother around is taking a toll on this little boy. Tori worked at the Funky Monkey while going to school and always enjoyed when Trace came to the bar but now she finds herself across from him as Ryder's school counselor. Trace has always been attracted to Tori, now that Ryder has brought these 2 together in a different capacity, will they acknowledge the sparks between them? Or will Trace push her away to protect the bubble he's created for Ryder? Along the way, Kristi reappears, what does this mean for Ryder? Trace? Tori is faced with some difficult family issues.

"Stepping into Rosemary Beach stories is like visiting old friends. I have truly enjoyed this series and cast of characters that we have met along the way, experiencing all the highs and lows of their lives. This time we meet Reese, the opening prologue gutted me but it sets the tone for the resiliency and fortitude Reese needs to find and build a life for herself in Rosemary Beach. She works as a maid and walks everywhere just living a content life. One of the houses is Nan’s which ends up with her crossing paths with Mase as he comes to town to visit Harlow which sends her life on a new course. Mase can’t believe his eyes when he encounters the sexy cleaning lady singing totally off key yet he’s enchanted. Mase has shied away from commitments based on the history of his parent’s lives so when he finds himself wanting to cross paths with Reese and then helping her, he isn’t sure what to think. He just knows that Reese is important. Jump in for all the fun, drama, romance and sexiness you expect from all of the Rosemary Beach books, you won’t be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NMI657HDQEIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OO0C#wasThisHelpful","R1NMI657HDQEIK","A3DANGFIJBZP20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DANGFIJBZP20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Georgie is a lost teenager; living in a home where both of her parents ignore her and their definition of love is buying her whatever she needs. This sends Georgie spiraling down a very destructive path but it puts her in the crosshairs of her favorite rock star, Sloane. Sloane lives the life of a rock star to the fullest (wow the number of woman that are in contact with his penis) then he bumps into Georgie and sees a kindred spirit, she reminds him of himself at 16 when his life began to spiral out of control down a destructive road. Neither Georgie or Sloane have a great support system behind them, the parents on both sides are crazy, self-absorbed and self-centered. Sloane finds himself in a new position, he wants to help Georgie, get her back on a good path and away from the drugs that are leading her down a road she may not return from.  As much as Georgie and Sloane shouldn't be together because she is under age, these two souls connect, but can they find a road to happiness together?

She hasn't seen or heard from Cooper in 4 years which makes it totally shocking to run into him after one of the fashion shows she has worked. Cooper is just as surprised to see Daniela at the hotel and is a bit startled by her chilly reception. I love that Emily Jane Trent always gives us the dual POV. Cooper has missed Daniela as much as she missed him. The challenge is will she forgive him for leaving and give him another chance. Cooper is working as a PI following a man so an element of intrigue is established since it seems the man he is following has some interest in Daniela.

"Compared to our other more elaborate Nerf guns, this one is a simple single-shooter with a holster that clips to the child's pants.  It fires one Nerf bullet and carries two underneath the barrel.  The Holster carries four more (the gray section in the Amazon photo).  The cocking mechanism is not too difficult for a 5 and 8 year old to use.  The best thing about this simple Nerf Gun?  It has the most power and zip of any of our Nerf Gun collection.  The bullet flies the straightest line of any we've tried during target practice in the yard.  I think the more elaborate guns lose some of their zip as they get more complicated mechanisms.  This is one hits what you aim at.  When the neighborhood kids come over and we have Nerf wars in the yard, our Strike Blaster become the most demanded Nerf Gun.  And the price?  Amazon's is easily $6 to $10 cheaper, in frustration-free packaging, than brick and mortar stores in my area.

Then last week, like a bolt from the sky, Amazon put a recommendation in my field of view and it was Hydrox.  I was blown away.  Where had they gone?  Why did Amazon have them?  I began to research and now I understand that through a series of company buyouts, it was slashed.  Now thanks to Leaf and Amazon, I ordered my first real Hydrox in years... in decades.

"Be advised, this robe looks good, but it is very thin, almost veil-like.  It works and is Made in the USA, but if you want a real solid robe for your child's Jedi costume, look for the thicker variety.  With that all said, it is well made and appears durable.  The sewing is tight and has no loose strings that needed trimming.  The thinness of the material was a tiny surprise.  Yet, my child doesn't care one bit and thought it was a real Jedi robe in her imagination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86MA18GJTLQP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GYY2B8#wasThisHelpful","R86MA18GJTLQP","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very excited when this arrived as well built as it is.  Truth be told, I expected something far less, but it would satisfy this coming Halloween needs.  Yet what came out of the packaging, while 100% polyester, is very well sewed and durable.  My only concern is the thin velcro strip that holds the boots on under the child's shoes, after a night of walking that is sure to give way.  I imagine it will be an easy enough fix though.I was pleasantly surprised to see the label and it is stamped, ""Made in the USA"".  I wish the packaging really pointed that out, but it says nothing about it being constructed here.  I found it while trying to see how to clean this product (by the way, hand wash cold, only.  No iron.  Air dry.)Thank you, Rubies!

"Benny is a lot of fun.  As soon as he was entered into our game, we received the directions to his spaceship (Spaceship!).  I think Lego needs to include these directions in the box, but that's another review.  His spaceship in its first form is a flying toy and a first for my family.  Kids had a lot of fun flying Benny and his spaceship in the Lego Movie level.  The spaceship fires red lasers and was an instant hit.  When another Lego Movie character leaps into the spaceship (Wild Style, from the starter kit), she as well provides her version of ""spaceship... Spaceship... SPACESHIP!"" while flying.  Just a nice touch.Benny is a brawler and laser shooter.  He talks to himself a bunch and the voice sounds like the one from the movie.  His spaceship is top notch.  Waiting for the other two variations to unlock (by collecting gold bricks within the game).  Have spent in-game earnings to also include ""mines"" with his spaceship, though we have yet to discover what these mines in fact do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17257878NA1M8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMB606Y#wasThisHelpful","R17257878NA1M8","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Been looking forward for this on my Amazon Firestick for quite some time now and it's here.  I linked my Disney Movies account and all my previously purchased Disney movies were instantly linked.  Unfortunately, unlike Amazon Prime or Netflix apps, there is a whole lot of buffering that keeps occuring, which shows up as a pause in the movie and a spinning circle in the center of the screen.  It makes watching a movie, not entirely impossible, but very frustrating.  We counted 12 buffer moments in the first 15 minutes of Mary Poppins.I think some work needs to be done to the app to bring it on par with Amazon Prime or Netflix (as examples).

"This is an amazing popcorn maker.  It's is lightweight, collapsible and doesn't appear like it should do anything with popcorn.  For my first two trials, I used a 1/2 cup and about one tablespoon of coconut oil right on top.  My 1000 watt microwave gets to 3 minutes and leaves a few old maids, but in general that's a good time.  It could probably go another 10 to 20 seconds.  The popcorn was light and very crispy.On subsequent pops, I lowered it to a 1/4 cup just for myself and omitted the oil.  I would do the 3 minutes again, though for a 1/4 cup that's the far edge of almost burning.  I give it a little spray of olive oil from my wife's baking cabinet and sprinkle with salt.  Perfect.So far there is nothing to hate or dislike with this simply designed popcorn maker.  By the way, use pot holders when pulling it out.  The sides are quite warm coming straight out of the microwave.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDX3FMEHBELJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF9CT0C#wasThisHelpful","REDX3FMEHBELJ","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very sturdy goblet for wine drinking (or any other beverage of your choice).  After breaking two wine glasses in my rental home on the hard tile floor of the kitchen, I was desperate for something... less wimpy.  You probably wouldn't want to entertain guests with your fancy Tervis wine goblets, but for general wine consumption after a long day, this Tervis does the trick!  It holds quite a bit of liquid as well.  I believe it holds 16 ounces.As for the Tervis guarantee, I can attest to cracking a general drinking cup made by Tervis and without a single question from them, they replaced the entire cup within two weeks time (mostly my mailing to them and their mailing back).

"We adore this lamp.  It has a beautiful, glowing orange color thanks to the dimmable bulb inside the salt block (accessed via the base and easily removed for exchange).  The best way I can describe it is ""warm"".  It brings a warm feel to a room, not by physical heat, but by it's color, as it sits glowing in a darkened room.We use it for just about any occasion and any lighting situtation, but alone in the dark, it being the sole source of light, is really an amazing sight.  Our young children come and go in the night, so this dimmable salt lamp has also become our new night light.  It is on the heavy side, but still transportable and my wife takes it to every room she's spending time in.  It does not simply stay in one spot in our home.I can not speak to it clearing the or purifying the air.

"For starters, this bed arrived one full day earlier than planned.  That was a great surprise and we appreciated it.  Upon receipt of the bed, my wife and I scratched our heads at how such a small Amazon box could hold a 40""x35"" dog bed.  When opened, we saw that it was tightly shrink wrapped and folded over many times.I thought that there was no way for an extra large dog bed to come from this tightly bundled object in front of me.  We followed the included instructions and soon had it unwrapped and let it begin expanding.  Within an hour, just as instructed, the bed had expanded about 90% of the way.  (Overnight it fully expanded.)  The interior memory foam is flecked with blue and has a very cooling feel to it.  It is very dense and in no way cheaply manufactured.My weimaraner is 11.5 years old, 95 pounds, and loves his old beat up bed that we were trying to replace.  My problem was that he would only lie on the beat-up bed, if there was no couch space available.  I also know at his age, memory foam is far better for him.  So I am trying to kill two birds here: get him off the couch and give him on some nice memory foam for his aches.He launched himself at the new bed and began rooting at it.  So far, no issues.  He plopped himself in the middle of it and lay there for awhile as we watched him... but soon he made his way to the couch.  So admittedly, we have to give him time and get him adjusted to the new bed.  He seems very willing and to me, it's far more comfortable than his last bed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAYPGOC07TC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FA5YPWE#wasThisHelpful","R3IAYPGOC07TC2","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always used White Vinegar in my Keurigs, but decided to try this citric acid based cleaner to see if I was perhaps missing something.  You get three uses per bottle, so already that is a great bargain over the Keurig branded cleaner, which I found needed the entire bottle added to work.  As for citric acid over standard white vinegar, I can say I feel it cleaned better.  I clean every two months, as recommended in the manual of my K75, and with my first CleanCup cleaning, the machine sounded less ""congested"" afterwards.

"I enjoy this brand and this scent.  I was confused by some of the reviews as they mention sweating.  Having switched to deodorant only and no longer using anti-perspirant 7 years ago, sweating is par for the course and natural as well.  Why did I switch?  I discovered that I had a tumor that developed under my left armpit.  It was benign and the doctor recommended I stop using anti-perspirant after explaining how the aluminum worked.  After some time of not using anti-perspirant, the tumor went away.  That was enough for me.I picked up Every Man Jack sometime ago at a local grocery and continue to use this brand.  The scent is not overpowering and my wife likes the smell.  I do not have to reapply throughout the course of the day.

The tracks come off occasionally, but are easily reattached.  I was worried about the machine gun that is detailed on top of the turret, but it also has continued to survive.On the underside you can tell where batteries were supposed to go at one point when the model must have been sold as a moving tank.

"Upon receiving this purchase to replace my last Staples branded shredder, I was instantly amazed at its weight and size.  Though accomplishing 4 more sheets of shredding power, this shredder is half the weight of my previous micro-cut shredder.  The footprint is far smaller as well.  Very pleasantly surprised by both aspects.  Add in the fact that it is also half the decibels, suddenly its a real winner in my open floor plan house.I ran into some slow-down when grinding through junk mail.  Though technically only 3 sheets of junk mail, I guess when folded three times, like a normal envelope fold, plus two sides of envelope, the page count is suddenly upwards to 10-12 sheets.  Add a sheet or two and you compound the issue.  Compared to my Staples micro-cut shredder, the junk mail always had to be opened to shred.

"We love this product.  This is our 3rd purchase of the same Cal-Mag.  When taken in the evening, it puts me in such a relaxed state, far better than any chamomile tea.  Not being a scientist or dietician, I have no idea why Calcium and Magnesium does this.  It was recommended by my Chiropractor after several visits for neck tightness which was casusing headaches.  I believe he uses a different brand, but we liked this brand for the 2 to 1.  My wife has issues with too much magnesium, so we had to avoid that.  She can sip this daily and has no problems.The bottle claims it has a delightful lemon flavor, but we beg to differ.  It has no lemon taste, but does have a citrus tartness to the hot water.  I add a squirt of lemon juice.  I have even added apple juice and I suddenly have a weak hot apple cider to sip.  But lemon?  No, not really.  We have to add to it to get something more that tart hot water.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVA3V0CLR1K0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENHRB44#wasThisHelpful","RCVA3V0CLR1K0","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My father has the Garrett branded digging tool and I bought this one to try something different, as his feels a little cheap.  This Lesche tool blew me away with its quality.  It just feels heavier and more rugged.

"Believing one of the previous reviews, I was hoping this armband would hold my S4 in its Otterbox Commuter case.  It does, but not without some snipping of the armband material and a bit of wrestling.  So, does it fit while still within its case?  Yes.  It takes me a good minute of positioning, squeezing, pushing and tugging to get it fully seated into the armband.  My dog hates this timeframe as he stands by the door.Outside of that, it works fine enough.  Sometimes the clear material on the face of the armband that allows you to access the touch screen of the phone, doesn't work 100% and I have to pause my jog to really get a good press of the buttons.  The band fits my upper arm in the larger of the two slots.  When on my arm, it is on for the duration of the run and does not slip down.  The interior of the case is always devoid of sweat, which is impressive to me.If the Commuter case was a little easier to slip off and on, I'd probably spend that time doing that instead and neatly slide the naked phone into the armband.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJONV9A26XYIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIET8LE#wasThisHelpful","RJONV9A26XYIE","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If not careful, these ears can scrape children's faces.  The black section in the photo is actually two layers, the first, closest to the head is soft cushion.  The second section of the black is an sharp edged piece of hard plastic.

This left the other ear still on her head and that sharp edged black section, scraped forward all the way across her cheek.Some tears were had at the event, but we instructed her how to better pull these Neikos off her head.If adults try to wear these, they are very tight squeeze.

"I had read the descriptions here of finely chopped tea in this Yorkshire Gold Tea, but was really surprised to see how fine it was.  One reviewer said it was like coffee and I have to agree.  I do not have a strainer fine enough to trap all the tea and end up with extra on the bottom of the cup.  That is my only reason for the deduction of 1-star for my review.  I find the tea to be flavorful and milk compliments it nicely.  I do not sugar up and simply like tea and a bit of milk.  At work I will even drink it black.

"When it arrived it was much smaller than I was expecting.  It is only a 1-liter kettle, but in my mind that was going to be much larger.  Nonetheless, it is a perfect size for the cabinet and the cord is removable, stored within the kettle.  It is marked as holding 6 cups, but when I make my tea, my mug is about 3 cups, so unsure what exactly a ""cup"" size is!  I use about half the boiled water.The kettle is very fast and boiled the liter worth of water in approximately 3 minutes.  I say 'approximately', because I did not time it, but rather it was the time for me to get out my mug, get the tea, fill the strainer, get out the milk, etc.  By the time it was all done, the automatic shut-off on the kettle was going off and the boiling stopped.I do not know what its longevity will be like, but at this Amazon price, whatever use I get out of it, will be more than paid for.

"Upon breaking the seal and taking my first whiff, the smell of this Special Reserve was very spicy, but the smell of the alcohol was quite strong.  I had my doubts at first.  I do not often mail order after shave and never one that I have not tried in the past.I went to the bathroom, had an afternoon shave, and applied Special Reserve.  Immediately scents of cedar, leather, and spice filled the bathroom.  I was amazed.  It smelled nothing like it did in the bottle.  This is a must-apply to get the real scent.Then for the real test, I got myself dressed and was going to go out to see my wife.  She wasn't downstairs, so I waited.  When I heard at the top of the stairs, she declared that it smelled ""very manly"" in the house.  I laughed.  She expanded her comment as she came down the stairs.  She said it smelled like I had been outside, maybe working with wood and maybe a little woodsmoke.  She then got close and said it smelled different nearer me.  She could smell the leather undertones and the spice, perhaps musk.  I asked if she liked it and she did.  It was different than any other I have worn in the past.The initial punch of smell lasted about 30 minutes and as the evening wore on, I noted I could still smell the spice/musk, but the cedar was almost gone.  For me it was perfect.  It is not cologne, but rather after shave.  Cologne should last you all day.  After Shave is a nice scent but doesn't linger.  I like this Clubman Special Reserve very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14VQBG0SMF2T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000UJLB7W#wasThisHelpful","R14VQBG0SMF2T4","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had previously ordered this play set for my daughter's growing Infinity collection, but we saved it for Christmas.  She immediately wanted to play it that Christmas Day and as we set into playing, at first she was in awe that it in was Radiator Springs.  She had a good laugh at all the tractors and other characters from the movie(s).  There was a lot of pointing at the screen in our first sessions.  When Finn McMissile was introduced, her glee couldn't be contained.For the first day or so of playing, she was happy enough that it was simply Cars.  But I noted that after those initial gaming periods, she began requesting older playsets, like The Incredibles.  I wondered what was wrong.She explained and I will translate the 6 year old's explanation: being that you control cars, there is a lot racing to be done.  Whether an actual side by side race, or one where you chase down an errant vehicle, and she does not understand racing.  She is not very good at racing and loses every race that the game throws at her.  Her frustration begins to build until reaches the point where she'd rather play another playset or Toy Box mode.As the adult I have raced with her and tried to let her win, but unfortunately, the opponents (like Chick Hicks) aren't so nice.  Every race comes off as a do-or-die, must-win situation and each racer is very competitive and will use the sideways bash move to get you out of the way.  I have tried to beat the race and even I found myself growing frustrated at the opponents.  I wish there was a way to ""dial down"" the race aggressiveness.I think she is a little young for this title, which surprised me based on the characters and theme set.  She is enjoying the time spent around Radiator Springs, but each new 'quest' brings on a new race and she wants no more of that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25PLGJ83548X5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT2BFKW#wasThisHelpful","R25PLGJ83548X5","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the product Keurig should have developed to make the Vue a stronger system.  Standard K-Cups are everywhere these days and almost every box store has their own variations of K-Cups as well.  But Vue?  Not so much.  We fell in love with the features of the Vue, but after 1.5 years of ownership, we find the lack of Vue cups to be frustrating.My wife introduced this K2V Cup to me prior to Christmas and try as we might, could not get one until now.  It really works well.  The K2V Cup is really two products in one: the standard KCup adapter and a brew-your-own adapter.  The brew-your-own fits inside the standard KCup adapter.  The adapter has a pointed needle at the bottom to make the hole in the standard KCup plastic bottom.  The brew-your-own adapter is hollowed out on its bottom to fit over the needle.On the first usage, I wasn't sure how the standard KCup would fit the adapter.  With the brew-your-own adapter out, I slid my first KCup in and knowing I had to puncture with that bottom needle, I simply pressed down until it seated itself in the adapter.  There was a very satisfying 'pop' as it punctured and the KCup is nice and snug.  I had no fear of it separating from the adapter.The adapter with KCup fits the Vue system perfectly with no hang ups.  I adjusted for my 10oz ""thicker"" cup of joe and let the Vue do what it does.  Voila.  It works and without any mess.  The used KCup is removed by just grabbing its top and lifting out.Thank you EZ Cups/Perfect Pod folks.  You have definitely breathed life into our 1.5 year old Vue system.January 21, 2014 Edit:  I wanted to delve into K Cups themselves.  We have found in our daily usage of the K2V Cup and our various K Cups, there is a definite difference between the foils tops on the different brand K Cups.  A little background first - when you insert a K Cup into the K2C Cup, there is a needle at the bottom to penetrate the bottom of the K Cup (this produces a nice popping sound).  This also seats the K Cup into the K2V and makes it snug.  When you close your Vue door, the needle in the hatch penetrates the foil lid of the K Cup.  When you remove the used K Cup, you find the two holes.  The foil lid has a nice, neat needle hole as well as the bottom.What we have discovered to date is that Green Mountain branded K Cups have no issue.  So far we have utilized Breakfast Blend, Lake and Lodge, Sumatran, Newman's Own, Our Blend, and Vermont Country Blend.  The Starbucks branded K Cups also have no issue.  So far we have used House and Sumatran.The Caribou branded K Cups DO appear to have an issue.  So far we have only used one box of Daybreak Blend.  The foil lid appears thinner or a different material.  When you extract the Caribou K Cup, the foil top is completely crushed inward.  Instead of a neat hole, the foil lid has a large, dime sized hole.  This exposes the fine grounds of coffee and we have experienced some grounds in our coffee and machine.  I clean these out with a couple small empty runs of water.February 8, 2014 Edit:  I have since experimented with Eight O'Clock Columbian variety.  I also have no problems with this brand in terms of the puncture on the lid being too large.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYQWOGOOKZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H4G2UCY#wasThisHelpful","RYQWOGOOKZX","A37D9SE2F6AO6R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37D9SE2F6AO6R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The only flaw I can find in the product is that the removable plastic cover (the right side of the product in the photo, with the hinge), too easily comes off while sharpening.

"This is a terrific and simple to use set of exercise resistance bands.  They are color coded according to strength (yellow is the lightest at 2-4 pounds, red the heaviest at 25-20 pounds).  Basically, if you haven't used these before, they are flexible bands with carabiners at the ends to which you can attach handles.  They are fun to exercise with, and the set comes with a booklet describing a simple workout routine.  Also included is a simple cloth anchor to use for connecting the bands in a doorway.  I like the fact that I can exercise anywhere in relative privacy, and with minimal space requirements.My favorite feature is portability. I travel often, and the whole set fits in a small and compact bag, which is easy to pop into a backpack or a suitcase when traveling, so my ""gym"" can go everywhere with me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKCKDRKE4BWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0154C3XSE#wasThisHelpful","R3CKCKDRKE4BWL","A3LDLV1GWQJLEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDLV1GWQJLEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought one of these mics just to use as an emergency backup, but as it turns out it has remarkably good sound, and I'm using it in my regular rig now!  It has a really tight cardioid pattern, which makes it a great mic in noisy settings! I rarely get any feedback from it.  It compares very favorably to my Shure SM58, which it is designed to look like as well as to my older Shure Beta Green mics.

"Once charged (see note!), the phone works very nicely.Using the android setup app that opened automatically on startup, I easily added my account and contact info, setup the security features and made my first phone calls.The physical appointments of this phone are nice - it has a big (5 inch) attractive, colorful and easy to read screen. Netflix movies look great!A metal strip surrounds the screen, adding a nice touch of elegance. The plastic back has a leatherette texture which feels nice in the hand.Internet connectivity is good.  At home, the Dash found both of my wifi networks and easily connected. Once online, my browsing experience is smooth and effortless.  The powerful processor in this device is really evident when browsing, streaming video or listening to music. No buffering or interruptions.With bluetooth on I easily found and connected to several different headsets.Phone calls are efficient and clear, although I wish I could boost the volume a bit higher. Its a bit quiet.The sim card I used is a T-Mobile that I've had for about ten years - and the phone had no problem setting it up.I'm new to the Android OS, but found it easy to use and efficient.Note: This was not a difficult setup, but it was not a quick start either, as the battery was not anywhere close to being charged when it arrived. You need to fully charge before using this phone. Plugging in is simple - and there are indicator lights on the phone - a red one while charging that changes to green when charging is finished.Be patient: Using the included charger, mine took over 4 hours, after some false starts (there were a few warnings from the phone that my ""battery is too cold - please unplug from the charger"". For my second charge-up, I used the charger from my Lumia Windows phone - it charged the phone much more quickly. I've been topping up with a dc charger in my car and it works fine.Although this phone multitasks very nicely, be aware that the battery life is much better when you remember to turn off apps when you are done! I've noticed that apps open on shutdown reopen at startup! The Dash M. has a ""recent apps"" button right on the home screen, so its not hard to turn off apps when you're done. If you have a lot open there is a ""clear all"" option to close them all at once, a good idea when you are shutting down.Overall, I'm impressed with this phone. It is simple to use, has a deep feature set, a clear screen and good, if quiet sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157T49IN4WUG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01730B2C4#wasThisHelpful","R157T49IN4WUG1","A3LDLV1GWQJLEQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LDLV1GWQJLEQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This little robotic vacuum actually does a pretty good job on our carpeted and hardwood floors.  After charging, we set it to its default pattern.  It cruises around, changing direction and pursuing various directional strategies when it bumps something or runs into the included ""invisible wall,"" which we used to keep it from running over an electric cord.The capacity is pretty small.  It filled up within a few minutes when we first ran it.  It isn't a full substitute for a regular floor vac, but it will certainly let you go longer between thorough floor vacuumings.  The little side brushes are effective at pulling small bits of debris into the path of the rotor brush's suction.It effectively returned itself to its charging base when it ran low.My only complaints are that it's a bit noisier than I'd hoped--sounds a bit like a kid's toy running around--and that the dirt cup fills a bit faster than I'd hoped it would.  (That's a mixed complaint.  It actually reveals that the vacuum is a bit too effective at picking up dirt and pet hair.)Overall, this is a pretty good robotic vacuum and is worth checking out if you're in the market.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OK8EBL0MM4RH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126C99PQ#wasThisHelpful","R1OK8EBL0MM4RH","A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This grooming kit comes in a nice, supple leather case.  However, it seems quite overpriced for what it is.  You get 1) a metal file and nail cleaner; 2) a manual nose and ear hair trimmer; and 3) a cleverly designed set of clippers with a retractable lever.  After using the set, I think the clippers are the only element that reflects typical Henckels standards and quality.The file is fine for what it is, but it's nothing special.  It's a stainless steel nail file with a decent finish.The real downfall of this kit is the rotary trimmer.  It is a manually operated trimmer (i.e., you have to hold the mid-barrel piece and spin the cutting shaft assembly by hand).  And it does not cut hair so much as it pulls it out.  It was an unpleasant experience to use it on nose hairs as some of them are growing from highly sensitive areas.  In the past, I have used a Panasonic battery-powered trimmer and never had a similar problem; the Panasonic cut the hairs with a rapidly spinning blade.  This trimmer, on the other hand, is difficult to operate because you cannot hold it perfectly still while also spinning the cutting shaft assembly with your other hand.  Sure, it isn't going to cut your flesh, and it feels substantial.  But unfortunately it appears to have been designed for masochists.  There is a small brush inside the base of the trimmer to help wipe away the follicles the trimmer pulls out with the hairs.  This device appears to be the principal reason the kit costs so much, and it ruins the value of the kit.The nail clipper is fine and sharp.  You operate it by pulling the lever to extend it from the body of the trimmer and then, once it pops up, by pushing it forward to put it into position to generate leverage.  The clippers are sharp and work well on fingernails.  But they alone are not worth the price of admission for this kit.If I were to receive this as a gift, I would suspect that the giver was trying to punish me for some (imagined) slight.  Better than being sealed behind a brick wall perhaps, but only just.Not recommended.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROW85TE7Z4QU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8ZPAS4#wasThisHelpful","ROW85TE7Z4QU3","A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, we followed the instructions and seasoned it by coating it lightly with oil and baking it for an hour at a moderately low temperature.  With cast iron, you don't use harsh soaps to clean it.  You want to build up a ""patina"" to keep the product well seasoned.  Cleaning it is a little difficult, however, simply because it is such a heavy item.As for performance, it's great.  The smooth side works great for tortillas, and the grill side is deep enough that the meats you cook develop decent marks and don't just sit in their own juices.Overall, this is a great piece of cookware.  Just keep in mind that it's quite heavy and difficult to maneuver when you're cleaning.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIB7P80TI0L6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAAR5HI#wasThisHelpful","RLIB7P80TI0L6","A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and daughters are enjoying this electronic manicure tool.  It's like an electric toothbrush for nails.The motor causes the head to oscillate quickly.  The three interchangeable heads allow you to shape/file nails quickly, to smooth the tops of the nails, and to buff/polish the tops of the nails.The only step that you really need to be careful with is the second one, as it can be damaging to your nails/nail beds to reduce their thickness too much.The heads are shaped well and my ladies are all able to get at the full surface of their nails.It's not too loud either.Overall, it's a helpful tool if you want to try something other than the old emery boards and buff boards.

"This travel alarm clock is a very basic clock with a few neat features.  First, it can run from power from a USB port on a computer or a USB charger through a micro USB input on the side of the clock.  A cable is included.  When it is powered from a USB port, it constantly projects the time on the ceiling through a lens on the top right side of the clock.  Also, when running from USB power, it is possible to charge a 1.0A device from an output port on the side of the clock (same side as the input).  This output will not work if only using two AAA batteries.My only real complaint is that the LCD is difficult to view from certain angles and looks almost blank.  Also, the image accompanying this product does not accurately depict the screen, which is a standard silver screen with dark numbers.Overall, it's a decent, functional alarm clock.  It does not have the radio feature that some La Crosse clocks have, so it's up to you to set the time.  The AAA batteries (not included) are supposed to last about a year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JEURRYU4XZXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC39VZK#wasThisHelpful","R2JEURRYU4XZXA","A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the ET-4500, Epson took one of its multifunction small office printer/scanner/fax machines and added a massive amount of ink capacity.I have Epson and Canon multifunction machines that are quite similar to this.

"We have a daughter who is curious about the way things work and who loves learning about things.  This bug vacuum and critter barn set was right up her alley.The bug vacuum is a pistol-shaped device powered by two (included) AA batteries.  Pulling the trigger yields a low intensity vacuum.  (The company includes a tiny foam butterfly so you can see how it works.)  It isn't overwhelming, but it's enough to pull in small insects that aren't latching onto a surface.  Our daughter used it to collect several crickets, fireflies, and even a bumblebee.The ""barrel"" of the vacuum contains a valve that the child can open or close to trap the insect within.  Once trapped, it's easy to transfer the insect to the critter barn for brief observation before freeing it.The whole set is pretty neat because kids don't have to touch the insects.  That minimizes the chance that the insect will be mangled or harmed.  And for some people, it probably provides comfort that those same fingers that are holding PB&J sandwiches haven't been all over some bugs moments before.In all, I'd highly recommend this set for kids who are interested in learning more about the insects in their yards.

"This is the second BLU smartphone I've had a chance to try.  I'm still impressed.  For a c-note, you can get an unlocked phone with Android Lollipop, a decent screen, a decent camera, and capabilities that match many competing brands that would cost you hundreds of dollars more.  Sure, this phone doesn't have a top-of-the-line processor or massive amounts of internal RAM or storage, but the storage is expandable through microSD cards.  And the RAM is not a problem unless you are someone who actually needs to be performing several tasks at once, and that isn't most of us.  For basic smartphone use, this phone is more than adequate.The build quality is fine.  It is plasticy, but for the price it's a much nicer phone than you might expect.  The included transparent cover helps to protect the plastic body against minor bumps and scratches.The phone has pretty good battery life, too.  It has a 3000 mAh battery that will keep you going all day, even if you're surfing the web over WiFi or watching a video.Call quality is fine.Lollipop is fairly smooth on this phone.  There are times when an app is a bit slow to launch, but I don't think that's unique to this phone: my Galaxy Note 3 has similar stutters and hiccups in Lollipop.Overall, this is a tremendous bargain smartphone.

"I have listened to music through headphones for decades, starting with a pair of AKG K240DFs back in the 1980s.  My preference is for a neutral sounding headphone with a slightly forward/detailed presentation.  That is not something easy to come by in sealed circumaural headphones in this price range, but Audio-Technica has managed it here.In terms of appearance, the headphones are well finished.  The gun metal/brown pleather look may not appeal to everyone, especially as AT has included some funky anodized-look red accents.  But to each his own.As for fit, they're circumaural (around the ear), not supraaural (on the ear).  The memory foam covered with pleather makes for comfortable pads that give decent noise attenuation.  You don't hear a lot of what's going on around you, and those around you do not hear what you're listening to.  I used these on my commute on mass transit rail, and they did a good job damping the sound of the El train.  However, they're a bit tight.  I wear a 7 3/4 hat, though, so my head is a bit bigger than average.The cord is detachable, which is nice.  However, because of its comparatively stiff jacketing and the way it attaches to the left earcup, it transmits a lot of ""microphonic"" cord noise to the left earcup.  In other words, when the cord moves and brushes or bumps against something, you'll certainly notice it -- sort of like a stethoscope.As for overall sound, I evaluated using three sources: my Galaxy phone, a HRT MicroStreamer (DAC and headphone amp), and a HeadRoom Desktop headphone amp with Class A upgrades.  Although a portable device can easily drive these, I found that the sound really benefitted from amplification, smoothing the treble response, which verged on grainy and harsh when driven from the Galaxy, and tightening and controlling the bass.  If you can afford a portable headphone amplifier, it will serve you well with these headphones.  These do have some emphasis in the bass.  Other than that, they're relatively neutral in the mids and treble.  They have excellent detail retrieval -- I could hear well into the music listening to FLAC files via the MicroStreamer and Desktop amps.These do not suffer from common sealed headphone problems such as recessed mids or an overly closed soundstage.  They're nowhere near as good as my Shure 1440s or AKG 701s (both of which are open designs) for a sense of air around the performance, but they're better than my Beyerdynamic 770s.  As an aside, imaging isn't really a headphone highlight area anyway unless you're listening to recordings made using a binaural setup.  Most stereo recordings are not engineered to image and soundstage well on headphones as opposed to speakers.  This has to do with the fact that, listening with headphones to stereo recordings that aren't made using a binaural setup, your right ear doesn't hear any musical information from the left channel and vice versa, although listening with speakers both of your ears do hear sound from both channels.)The overall sonic presentation is slightly forward and detailed, not smooth and relaxed (a la certain Sennheiser models).Overall, these are a solid set of sealed headphones that can be used at home or with portable devices.  They have an elegant, classic appearance and feel well made.My only substantive complaint is the cord microphonics, which are distracting when using the headphones in a portable fashion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192Y93B8VSMIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEUBIKM#wasThisHelpful","R192Y93B8VSMIL","A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Neil Grimmett's The Hoard is a dark, scary, rough and tumble thrill ride that will have you turning pages for hours on end. This is definitely a ""you can't put it down"" book, and I way overspent my reading budget and lost a lot of sleep reading the book.The story takes place in England, in the Royal Ordnance Factory at Bridgewater. It is based on the actual event in June of 1951 when an explosion killed 6 workers. The blast was never explained. Neil Grimmett in The Hoard postulates what caused the explosion. We are taken through it in the first chapter of the book. Now fast forward 30 years to when Byron, the son of one of the victims as been clandestinely advised that the explosion was no accident and monstrous evil has been and still is taking place at the ROF. That the letter was sent by a seeming madman only complicates things.US readers will want to be aware that the book is written in UK English. I had no difficulty in understanding the ""working class"" dialect present in most of the book. Do keep in mind though, that I have worked for the British Diplomatic Corps for 4.5 years, and I am rather used to it.  I don't think that the few differences or slang words used will present a problem to the vast majority of readers from other countries.Mr. Grimmett does such a stunning job of intimately describing his characters and settings that this book will chill you to the bone and leave you gasping for more. You can tell when a character is influencing the main character Byron because he tells us what he is thinking and feeling in reaction to the character. Because the story is based on actual events, that feeling of believability and realism permeates the entire book. His portrayal of characters like Gunner, Daphne and Bates are so cinematic that I had no difficulty in picturing them easily. That is part of what brought the eerie and sometimes terrifying parts of the book to life for me. Much of the action takes place at night as well. So wandering around an old munitions factory still in use where extremely dangerous explosives abound and evil men are killing people that get in their way - you may need to sleep with the lights on for a while. I know I did.As the story progresses and the discoveries unfold and relationships evolve, we are pulled deeper into this dark and ugly story of what really happened.Mr. Grimmett delivers the technical expertise and wallop of Tom Clancy in his descriptive writing ability. He gets to an extreme level of detail with his characters, language and dialog;His story telling ability in The Hoard is phenomenal.The book comes to a logical and appropriate conclusion after an unbelievable roller-coaster ride and another near catastrophic explosion at the ROF Bridgewater facility.Just a warning to parents out there - This is an ""R"" rated book for language, violence and sexual situations. I would not advise under 17 year olds read it.In summary I would not hesitate to recommend this book to any adult reader out there that likes a good solid yarn skillfully executed. Thrill seekers, this will SO be your cup of tea. If you are looking for a gripping, edge of your seat can't put it down read, try The Hoard.NB a copy of this book was provided to me gratis in exchange for my honest review, which I have rendered herein.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPLPVG33MGPA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLPNF8#wasThisHelpful","RPLPVG33MGPA9","A1DBVVPE6HM1GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DBVVPE6HM1GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The paranormal is not a genre I usually read. However, at the author’s request, I read a description of The Unearthed. I then read a short sample, and of course by then I was hooked, so I readily agreed to be scared to death reading it.Now, I had just moved into a new apartment at about this time, and I can tell you, I got so scared reading this book, that I had to go to sleep with the lights on for a while. And as a world traveler that frequently goes to a different country on business every other week, it’s not like I have a faint constitution or anything. This book was so well written that it really scared me reading it.In fact, I WAY overspent my reading budget, I lost sleep, and I just couldn’t put it down until I had finished it. And what an ending! A few reviewers have fussed about the ending, but to my reading, it makes perfect sense in the context of the story.Let’s just take a step back here: Evan Rowan is an understated, comparatively little known writer. That’s a mistake, and I am certain that we will see him climbing to the “A” list in paranormal writing soon. He is an undisputed master at descriptive story telling. He has a narrative strength that is really impressive when it comes to painting a very detailed, gritty picture of someone and what they think and feel and what motivates them. His character studies and alliterative skills paint a story picture that is believable, realistic, and very, very scary! It is very clear and obvious that he is a professional writer with a lot of experience. No grammar and syntax errors. No stage props showing through. It is seamlessly and professionally executed at a very high level. And I am ever so grateful for the lack of technical and typographical errors. Very few if any at all.I have seen some reviewers complain that Mr. Rowan inserted himself into the story. Well, I disagree. Clearly they are not students of cinema, as Mr. Rowan obviously took a page out of Mr. Hitchcock’s book of putting himself in his own movies in a very ingénue, vignette role.  If it’s good enough for Alfred Hitchcock, it is good enough for Evan Rowan, and I, for one, loved it.The way Mr. Rowan gives you his bleak descriptions and sub-plots within plots, it was almost for me like watching Liam Neeson in Taken(x) right there in the pages. His writing is outstanding.As to the story line, it starts off almost like a Ghost Hunters episode: A suburban unremarkable house wherein lives a mom, dad, and Billy, 13 year old boy. Blood drips into the basement. Billy is talking to an “invisible friend” that no one can see or hear. But weird stuff is happening in the house. Oh, and by the way, there were 3 murders in the house just a few years ago. The mom, the dad, the teenage son all killed…Enter the Ghost Hunters, Tim McCloskey and good for nothing little brother Eddie. Who have their own skeletons in the closet, so to speak.  Tim, the big brother, responsible for n’er do well Eddie… But why is that? Turns out we’re in for a surprise. Who was REALLY responsible for the death of their parents?As you read, the action gets more and more taut, the suspense builds, it gets ever more creepier and scarier, until a very surprising ending that you won’t see coming…. But boy, are you going to suck it down like a Hoover run amok!I honestly think that in addition to Evan Rowan’s descriptive ability to paint believable cinematic images out of his words, his depth of character study and his no-frills, no-nonsense, let’s not just be polite and tell it like it is here style make this book incredibly believable and credible, and just continue to grab you, buckle you in, and take you on this wild, nightmare ride until you reach the end… and you may be sleeping with the lights on too for a while. I know I was.If you like paranormal, if you like thrillers… or as I discovered even if you don’t think you do, I can recommend this book. The characterization, narrative, dialogue and horror are all pure gold. The unexpected twists and turns will leave you gasping... and reaching for the light switch.  Eddie and Tim (and Jackie, Talia, Billy, Eamon, Michelle, Moira and everyone else for that matter, even our puckish lottery winner) will make you want to know more about them. They will make you want to find out what happens next… which is just what I’m about to do, as I embark on the next book. But I have to wait until I’m on vacation, I cannot afford to lose that much sleep and go to work and function!So to sum up, Evan Rowan is a fantastic writer, I loved the book, and I can’t wait to read more of this spine-tingling, creepy, taut supernatural story in his next book.I would recommend that if you are considering the purchase of this book, read a sample. Does it speak to you? Does it reach out and grab you? Then grab it.Respectfully submittedDr. Geoff","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YP08AVJLYFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPJY0V8#wasThisHelpful","R25YP08AVJLYFO","A1DBVVPE6HM1GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DBVVPE6HM1GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review, for which I am honored to oblige*Joshua Elliott James has a clear passion to be a writer. He can tell a good story.  While this book is classified as a novel or novella, at 36 pages I would classify it as a short story.  Given Mr. James’s gorgeous and eye catching cover art, I would say that his stories might actually work best as graphic novels.The story line resembles that of an Indiana Jones adventure, and with a female heroine as glamorous as Arcadia Jones, it has potential for being a really fun and exciting adventure story. But due to its length and its striking lack of detail where it is really needed, it struck me more as the Reader’s Digest condensed version of the Indiana Jones adventure. The story felt rushed. Even though the action was explosive and non-stop, it should not have felt as though the writing is rushed.I was very excited about this book; just the cover art alone is enough to stir the blood.  It is written in a present tense first person stream of consciousness style that when done right is unstoppable. But unfortunately, there is just not enough there. For example, Arcadia is considering where thieves might try to sell Da Vinci’s stolen books. She wonders about New York, but discards it because “it is her turf”. WHY does she consider it her turf? Who does she know that makes it unlikely? What does she know? There is so much there that is not said, it cries out (to me) to be detailed.I actually DID like the story for the non-stop action and adventure. There were a lot of issues that mitigated against that enjoyment.The paragraph about the Trevi Fountain in Rome is another great example. For people who live there, I understand, it is backdrop. But for everyone else, they really want to hear about the Trevi. The throngs of people, the sound of water, the ancient patina, the hordes of tourists and people trying to throw coins in and get photographs!  Many people dream of going there someday, or have been only once, and why not give them something they would recognize and relate to! Make it come alive! Not just a casual mention in the context of clothes shopping! Come On, a Harvard Archaeologist and Museum Curator can’t care less about the Trevi Fountain because she needs those red shoes for the Tango competition? Really? Really?As to the technical aspects of the book, there are issues.  This book is in serious need of editing and proofing, and Mr. James may want to consider finding himself a good proof reader for future revisions and future books.  Examples of grammar, syntax, tense and language errors abound.  Here are a few examples:“But Arcadia does not budge in.”“Murder happens again before she recovers the books and takes the first flight out which is to Australia and then to Spain where she is chased first by killers and then by the police who is accusing her having shot a police man.”“It’s a good job I love a challenge, but first I need to check the alleyway before I leave Rome.”In addition to the language and grammar problems there is an abundance of misuse of single quotes in this book and I am not really sure why.The story line has its challenges.  It was crying out to me for details, more details please! Cities like New York, Rome, London and Geneva – God they are oozing with character from hundreds of years! Please, a little detail! What’s nearby? What are the people dressed like, acting like? What are the smells in the air? Is it raining? What are people like in Rome when it’s pouring and you can’t get a taxi?  You get the idea.Now, as to the travel: My last tour of duty was with the British Diplomatic Corps. I was there for about 5 years. My remit called for travel to a different country every 2 weeks. So I know travel. Sometimes I was hopping from country to country for 3 weeks back to back, every few days a different city. Let me tell you – It is not as easy as Mr. James makes it sound!  Also, one MUST wonder, where is the money coming from that pays for all this?  The museum she curates? She does not have unlimited funds!  Someone has to stop and do the accounting and budgeting at some point!  And do you have any idea how TIRING that amount of travel in a short amount of time is? And the jet lag from going across 13 time zones and back?Unfortunately my sister is a Harvard trained Anthropologist and Archaeologist. She has had her own series of adventures going back many years, including the discovery of more than one lost language.  I understand that this book is a work of fiction, and should be treated as such. I have heard in great and intimate detail about some of these adventures – it actually made the book harder to believe.  I do understand that this is an action and adventure story, but some of what Arcadia does seems incredibly out of character for who she is purported to be.I am a published author myself. I write in a very different style and in different genres. Some people really like my writing and it moves them; some hate it, and think it garbage. Presumably there are lots in between.  So I find it very difficult to judge this book. This style of writing may be very desirable and enjoyable for many people.I would recommend that if you are considering the purchase of this book, in e-form or paper, read a sampling.

"*I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review, for which I am honored to oblige*Debra George has written a book of poems from A to Z - there is one for every letter of the alphabet - and one for many moods and emotions.I found that I could relate to some of these poems more than others.  In general though, they are written from the heart, with a deep desire and longing to help you get through your day as a mortal human on this planet, and as for that I think that they do a fair job.Debra has chosen a free form rhyming meter to express herself.  In some poems, the rhyming is forced and the meter is awkward. Still, as others have pointed out, I do not believe that she set out to be Housman or Whitman or Longfellow, just give us a bit of human understanding and relating to when we go through strong emotions.  It would be nice to see difficult emotions  in other than a rhyming meter.As to the technical aspects, other reviewers have spoken to the numbering issue.  Otherwise there were few errors, typographical or otherwise, for which I am truly grateful in this day and age of that lack of perfection for the printed word. The errors that I encountered were in tense (present instead of past) and where an extra word was left in that should have been removed in a line.I did like some of the poems such as Crazy, Anger and Zealous more than others.  I found I could relate to some more than others.  The one that I could actually relate to the most was Heartbroken.I also found that the underlying message from these poems is one of hopefulness and striving. There is a clear spirituality that comes through that I can appreciate. Yet it is not preachy nor is it telling us how we should be or act or feel; it acknowledges what we feel and gives us some companionship on the way.I am a published poet and author myself. I write in a very different style and in different genres. Some people really like my poetry and it moves them; some hate it, and think it garbage. Presumably there are lots in between.  So I find it very difficult to judge this book.  Were I to offer advice to Ms. George, I would strongly encourage her to keep writing. I would encourage her to get as much exposure and feedback as she could for her work. I would encourage her to join writer's groups and go to workshops. If that's what she wants to do. She may be content with right where she is.As others have said, I think I would recommend that if you are considering the purchase of this book, in e-form or paper, read a sampling.

"I loved this second Old Guy book.  It was a little different from the first book in how the narrative ran, and the plat. But the characters and characterizations were excellent.  The enjoyment was very high for me.  Timothy writes so different from how David Weber writes, or how Keith Laumer wrote; yet it is every bit as enjoyable, gripping, and entertaining for me. I really like the concept of the human race having essentially evolved laterally into Bolo type autonomous cyber tanks. What a concept. In treating these machines as humans, and personifying everything about them, Timothy has successfully, in my opinion, managed to create and maintain a high level of interest, a high level of engagement, and a very imaginative plot line and story. Vampires and cyber tanks, who would have thought it. I will certainly be buying the next book, and plan to keep on until Mr. Gawne gets tired of writing them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMDAHSV6DN94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJVN9B2#wasThisHelpful","R1BMDAHSV6DN94","A1DBVVPE6HM1GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DBVVPE6HM1GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second time I have used a Garcinia Cambogia product.  I was actually still using my last provider's brand when I had the opportunity to review this product.  I was getting EXCELLENT results from the other product, which I was so excited about, I reviewed as well.  You can imagine my surprise when I started getting even BETTER results with Nutrapure.The idea behind Garcinia Cambogia is to suppress appetite, suppress cravings, such as sugar cravings, burn fat, and promote lean muscle mass growth.  Sounds like a miracle cure.  IT ACTUALLY DOES THESE THINGS!  IT WORKS!I was previously on a medically managed diet. It was costing me a fortune. It worked for 2 years, and I lost over 40 lbs on it. But I hit a plateau, at the same time I hit stress from job change.I decided to strike out on my own, and began my own herbal diet.The first thing I noticed about Nutrapure's Garcinia Cambogia is that the capsules are a bit bigger than what I was taking before. The other thing I noticed is that if I took one in the morning, I did not get hungry all day. I did not feel like eating at all. None. Zilch. Nada. In fact, I had to MAKE myself eat something during the day.I took another one about 30 minutes before dinner, and my portion sized dropped to about 1/3 of what I had been eating. And I felt F-U-L-L!!! I don't mean satisfied. I don't mean comfortable. I mean I felt stuffed like I simply could not eat another bite.I thought it was a fluke, but it has been going like that since I started testing the product. I have lost 4 lbs. in just over a week. I did not change anything else.  Do keep in mind, I am taking dandelion root for a diuretic, and saffron extract as well. The only thing I changed to test the Nutrapure was swapping out this Garcinia Cambogia for the other brand.This one may be a little pricier than others, but I can guarantee you this is the one I am going with. In actuality, a 90 day supply works out to about the same as the other brand.And this product works.I would advise that it is a good idea to consult a qualified dietician or medical professional before embarking on any program that changes your supplement intake. Particularly be mindful of other factors that can effect your health and metabolism.Everyone is different, but for me, this has been a fabulous find, and I'm sticking with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAY34ZGI2EXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O907SKW#wasThisHelpful","RHAY34ZGI2EXA","A1DBVVPE6HM1GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DBVVPE6HM1GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, Wow, wow-wee, did I love this book. Hoo-Ra! Tim, ya done good!  I am a die-hard Keith Laumer Bolo fan. Which I guess makes me a David Weber fan, but not as much as I loved Keith's books. I INHALED Chronicles of Old Guy like a Hoover run Amok. In fact, I blew away my reading budget, and was over-drawn in that dept. and sleep-deprived for several days. And I didn't care. I loved it that much.Your irreverent, down to earth, stream of consciousness writing style, and natural flow as if a human is narrating just blew me away. And I'm a very hard man to impress. Forget the ""sans peur et sans raproche"", we're going straight to the ""kill because that's what I do"" approach. I loved the characterizations of the other tanks, the names cracked me up. I loved Mondocat. I loved the vampires, the library, Double-Wide. You named a mountain-sized killing machine that can pretty well raze a planet Double-Wide. I don't know, maybe it's a Massachusetts/MIT thing.I was born and raised in Newton, though now that I'm tired and old I've lived all over the world. But I sure recognized that style. I don't know if anyone compared you to Asimov recently, but there are aspects of Isaac's irreverence from the old gang that definitely shown through.So, not 24 hours after finishing the Chronicles, I've already bought SBC and the Library of Doom, and if you keep writing them I'll keep buying them! Your books so totally resonate with me that I am just an out of control giddy fan. Not the staid, laid back erudite professional I usually portray.Thank you so much for feeding my addiction, I really do appreciate it.  And at some point I'll catch up on the sleep. I'm really trying to throttle back on the reading a bit too, just to savor them and make them last a bit longer, but fortunately I can always re-read them.Please do not run out of ideas, get bored, or move on to something else. Just keep writing what you're writing.

"I have bought Omega Soul's Garcinia Cambogia twice now, and I will buy it again.  I was on a ""medically managed"" diet that was costing me about $160.00 a month, but after a while it just wasn't working. I decided to try herbal on my own. After all, I am going to have to sustain and maintain once I reach my goal weight.I was a bit leery about trying this, but the reviews looked good.  I'm very glad I tried it.  I have had no detectable side effects, and I have lost weight and inches.I am working out in a 50 minute regimen once a day, which includes either treadmill or swimming or stationary bike. I try to eat healthy and in much smaller portions.  After about 2 months, I am down 10 lbs. and 2 inches around the abdomen.  So I am making progress. I use the Garcinia exactly as directed.  I am also taking dandelion root, and saffron extract for an appetite suppressant, and I am really pleased with the results.This is a time of great stress for me. I am a stress eater.  So if I can do this under some of my greatest stress, I'm pretty sure it will keep on working.  I know that everyone has a different metabolism and a different set of health factors.  For me, this product is working and working well, and assuming it is a good fit for your condition, I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O6RJ2LJSGJ3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJAV0US#wasThisHelpful","R1O6RJ2LJSGJ3M","A1DBVVPE6HM1GS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DBVVPE6HM1GS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm in my 8th decade (73 years old) and have recently returned to riding horses again, after not having ridden or doing very much athletically for the past 30+ years.  I ride once/ twice per week, an hour each time plus doing the chores of mucking out the stall and grooming the large 15.3 hand tall horse,  I always take this 1/2 hr before I begin my barn activities, and take another dose 10 minutes before my ride, and take another dose immediately after my ride.  It works wonders.  Before, I would get off the horse feeling kind of achy and knowing I would be stiff the next day.  I swear by homeopathic treatments like this.  It still surprises me that the old timey scientists out there still resist homeopathic treatment.  Don't they know understand physics?  Everything is energy including them....and all medicines are energetic forces that coax (or forcibly slam) the body systems into curative patterns.  Homeopathy is gentle and effective without lasting oftentimes harmful/negative side effects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S89Y67P9CMF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0016B3I4M#wasThisHelpful","R2S89Y67P9CMF8","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Was so pleased with them, I purchased the hot pink set (they come in several other colors).  I use them with my riding breeches.  The back is helpful to my instructor since it sits dead center of my spine and waist lines so she can tell from a distance whether I am sitting straight and balanced in the saddle.  I also wear a constrasting color belt (bright red) so my riding instructor can also see from a distance whether I am sitting square and balanced on the horse.  Best of all.....these suspenders are strong and a comfortable width.....the aren't narrow and do not cut into my shoulders when they stretch.

"I've returned to riding after over 30 years.  I never had riding lessons.  I feel sorry for the horses I used to sponsor and ride because I knew nothing about a balanced seat, soft hands on reins, etc.  It was only because of the generous and kind nature of the horses I rode that I fell only once while riding miles of trails, alone, in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (SF Bay area, Marin County coastline).I take this booklet with me to my riding lessons  (three thus far).  I gave a copy to my riding instructor who has incorporated it into my lessons. My confidence has increased because my balance has improved greatly, using Jan Dawson's clear, logical instructions.  My biggest ""aha"" moment was when I could stand up and sit and stand up and sit without my lower legs moving and without having to use my reins or my arms to balance.I would strongly urge every rider and riding instructor to get this book.  It lays out in easy to follow steps what I think is an achievable, solid, correct foundation to gain the ""classical independent seat"" I keep reading about in all the other books on ""how to ride horses"".  Yes, you do have to put the time in on the saddle to master these exercises.  However, if you follow the instructions correctly and in the order they are given, you will eventually get the proper, comfortable, rhythmic  feel of a well-balanced independent seat.Buy this booklet....it doesn't cost much.  The rewards will be priceless.  You will be riding correctly with a light and balanced seat, resulting in our horse being grateful that you aren't pulling on his mouth and thumping painfully on his back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW9CPUQLCFSPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0975371207#wasThisHelpful","RW9CPUQLCFSPV","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Did a lot of research on what materials should be used as a saddle pad to keep the horse comfortable and to prevent skin issues.  The best and most highly recommended are the pads made of natural fibers.  Which is why I chose these (I purchased two) which are all natural cotton and easy to put in the wash to keep clean.  The horse appreciates cotton in our warm-hot summer climate (north-west California, Marin County & Sonomal County).

Press start...run for no more than three seconds....stop.  Start again....run a max 3 seconds....stop.  Repeat.Why the ""3 second rule""?  Because....People nowadays have an attention span of.....3 seconds before they start fidgeting and wanting to see something else.There are a lot more rules, of course.  However....if there is only one thing you can remember....always use the ""3 second"" rule.  And maybe your videos won't suck.  And you won't create video torture...for yourself or others.And when you finally start taking videos that don't suck, take your camcorder to your local animal shelter and make videos of adoptable animals to post on youtube so these animals won't be killed because there's no space left in the animal shelter.

"For those worried about radiation from Japan...the nuclear plant where the accident occurred is northeast of Tokyo.  Look at a map.  The Yaeyama Island group (where this Chlorella is grown, harvested and processed), is located a good distance Southeast of the main Japanese archipelago where the nuclear accident happened.  The Pacific Ocean north of the Equator travels clockwise.  If you start from Alaska, the Pacific Ocean current from Alaska travels south, past California and Mexico, then heads west (towards Southeast Asia) along the Equator.  When this Northern Hemisphere Pacific Ocean current reaches Southeast Asia, the current turns northward traveling  past the Yaeyama Islands then continues north past the main islands of Japan (where the nuclear accident occurred).  Any remaining traces of ocean borne radiation from the nuclear accident that occurred north of Tokyo is carried past China, past Russia, and then travels northeast along the Aleutian Islands and back to Alaska.JARROW Yaeyama Chlorella is my second go-to source.  My first choice,( available only in pill form), is BODYBIO Chlorella which is sourced from Germany, using a completely enclosed system (never exposed to the atmosphere and using distilled water).I mix JARROW Yaeyama Chlorella Powder in my STRAUSS DIARY Organic Yogurt smoothies.  I mix it in my BOLTHOUSE FARMS Organic Carrot Juice.  I sprinkle it on my BOB'S RED MILL Organic Oats.  You can mix it into your scrambled eggs (Dr. Seuss' green eggs!).  I also mix it into my dogs' daily meals,In addition to this chlorella, I add NOW Foods Organic Barley Grass powder (grown on certified organic farm in USA), NUTIVA Organic Chia seed and NUTREX Hawaiian Spirulina (grown in Kona, on the Big Island of Hawaii....which tastes far better than the Now Foods organic spirulina which is sourced from India).All this green goodness in our diets (humans and dogs) turns your poop green, with the benefit that your poop doesn't stink as much (so you don't have to light a match every time you go potty).A healthy, regularly functioning digestive system is essential to your overall health.For serious health conscious people, I highly recommend SEVEN-X PLAN FOR DIGESTIVE HEALTH, by Anil Minocha, MD (2014 edition, paperback, 452 pages,  ISBN 9780991503117,  It's a holisitc approach to keeping your gut healthy, using both Western and Alternative medical knowledge.

"I have been purchasing Moringa products for years directly from MORINGA FOR LIFE through their website.Moringa For Life is a small, family owned cottage industry business.  Their hand processed and hand crafted products are made from plants they grow from seed at their family farm in Southern California.  They adhere to holistic farming methods: their plants are grown w/o use of pesticides or harsh chemical fertilizers. I have been very impressed with the purity of their Moringa leaf powder, which has a lovely rich green color, has a fresh smell and tastes good.I mix the powder in scrambled eggs, add it to soups & smoothies, sprinkle it on my morning cereal, mix it with my favorite berry jam to spread on toast, etc.  I use every bit of the precious powder, right down to the very bottom of the package.  I have never tasted, seen or felt grit, sand, or other impurities.  I also use their Moringa For Life oil, which is also a fresh green color with the same fresh smell. I mix it with coconut oil, macadamia nut oil, kukui nut oil, and hemp oil for a rich facial and body moisturizer (your skin is your largest organ).Other merchants obtain their Moringa from farms in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, etc.  There are inherent problems in this arrangement, the most important one being the difficulties of consistent quality control in these countries.  Even though a company purports to test its products for purity, it would be prohibitively expensive to test ALL the Moringa that is used to make their products.My health is my most important and precious asset.

"I should have known better.from the date of publication that this would not add to my library of horse training and horse care.  Author is not a bad person; she just reflects the majority thinking of the time when she wrote this book.  Although there are still many (too many) adherents to the aversive training methods and approach discussed in the book, there is a rapidly growing population of horse people who want to train their horses in ways that will not harm the horse physically or mentally, based on recent scientific studies and research.  I would start with the book EQUITATION SCIENCE by Paul D. McGreevy and Andrew McLean. There are many books on horse training and riding that avoid punishment and force.

"This goes on my face under my moisturizer to make my skin look softer, smoother, healthier..  I use it for every little nick, cut, scratch on my body.  I use it on my pets.

"TTouch for all my animals....easy to learn and easy to  apply, with fast  amazing results.I have all of Linda Telling-Jone's books.  I got all of them when I gambled and took a two day TTouch workshop-clinic at the Marin Humane Society in Novato, CA with my dog who was (a) reactive to other dogs (he was attacked twice in a dog park), (b) had extreme separation anxiety issues (he'd been dumped on the side of an abandoned road where I found him), (c) had symptoms of vaccinosis (having been over vaccinated too many times which adversely affected his health).TTouch Horse Trainer and dog trainer Kathy Cascade (who is based in Oklahoma) conducted this workshop-Clinic. After the first day of this two day workshop-clinic, my entire approach to training my animals changed dramatically. When I and my dog returned for the second day's session, the other participants in the workshop kept asking me, ""Is that another dog?  What happened to the dog you had yesterday?  I thought you had a different dog yesterday.""  Yes. the improvements were that profound.HORSES.......T-Touch method brought about such palpable positive results in my dog's bahavior so rapidly that I was convinced I should learn more so I could apply TTouch training to the horses I ride.This book does what it's supposed to do.  Increase your bond with your horse in a gentle manner that benefits both you and your horse physiologically (you both have an increase in the pleasure hormones that put you both in a mental framework very conducive to learning new things).The TTouches prepare both you and your horse for the learning experience of training...TTouch quickly helps your horse to learn to trust you....establish the relationship bond that is vital for training.With the combination of using the various TTouches and following the step by step training exercises illustrated by the numerous photographs, you are able to communicate to your horse in a  clear, progressive, non-punitive, calm and gentle manner how to teach your horse so he understands exactly what it is you are asking him to do.  You also are given the whys...the reasons for the way these training exercises are carried out and why and how they affect your horse.This book will help you build a relationship with a horse so he will learn to trust you, come to you voluntarily (often without you having to ask) and be willing and eager to be taught  the lessons you want him to learn.Very highly recommended for every horse trainer's reference library.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F9QC3ZSLVZA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570763208#wasThisHelpful","R1F9QC3ZSLVZA5","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was shocked that the family who got Quill was allowed to keep him outside in the rain and weather.  I thought Guide Dogs were so valuable that the Guide Dogs For The Blind organizations would require, as a condition of receiving one of these exceptionally sensitive and highly trained animals, that the dog be kept indoors with the family.  This video gives the impression that a Guide Dog is merely a commodity, like a tool for a blind human, except it is a living thing.  I expected a more humane treatment of this subject. The man who received Quill should have stuck with finding his way with his stick, as he preferred to do.

"I was without this chlorella for awhile (I ran out during the last six months of 2013). I placed my most recent order for another jar of tablets at the end of 2013 and wrote a review in January 2014.  This is an update to my previous January 2014 review.  It's now July, 2014, my supply is running out, so I am going to order another jar of these tablets, even though the price for a jar has gone up to $184 per jar.After I began taking this chlorella in January 2014, I noticed the difference right away between when I stopped taking it in July 2013 (developed digestive slowness, skin eruptions, low energy when I was without my daily dose of chlorella) and a couple of weeks after I began taking it again in January, 2014 (very noticeable improvements all around).UPDATED: MARCH 15, 2015Still the only Chlorella brand I use.  It's still the most expensive.  My body deserves the best.  Because it's the only one I have.  Anything you put in your mouth or on your skin (your skin is the largest organ in you and absorbes anything you put on it) should be the purest and cleanest you can find.  If you can afford a pair of $150 shoes, you can afford to put this chlorella to work for you.WHY BUY MADE IN GERMANY...EXPENSIVE BRAND?  I choose to buy this higher priced, MADE IN GERMANY brand because it is not grown in outdoor ponds that are open to the environment which has air pollution, bird droppings, impure sources of water, rainfall containing heavy metals, etc, etc.  If I'm going to ingest something to clean out toxins in my body, I want the purest form of chlorella.  IMHO, this German grown and German manufactured product is the best product available because of its purity and because of where it is grown and manufactured (which is reflected in its price).UPDATED JULY 02, 2014:  Yes, of course it is expensive....so are Made In Germany cars....like BMW and Mercedes and Porsche and Audi cars.  Yes, the price of this chlorella keeps going up....so does the Euro to US Dollar value.  I still think this product is the only one I will continue to put into my body....because I consider it as an investment in my continued good health (worth the price of this product).  This chlorella is grown in GERMANY.  It is not grown in China, Taiwan, Japan or South Korea.  I repeat....this chlorella is grown in GERMANY.  It is grown under strictly sanitized laboratory conditions, in a completely enclosed facility, in glass tubes, using clean, filtered water.YOUTUBE VIDEO YOU SHOULD WATCH:  You can watch how this product is seeded, grown, harvested and prepared in a youtube.com video entitled, Chlorella on Glass Tube, Echlorial France = Algomed Germany.  The narrator speaks in German which is voiced over in English.This is your only body.  And since you don't know what body you may inhabit in the other parallel universes, you may as well take the best care of the one you have in this universe.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIX7VQ1SR6MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RSXL7K#wasThisHelpful","RJIX7VQ1SR6MR","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Product came without any leaks, which was a relief, because another reviewer complained about shoddy packing and that the product he/she received had sprung a leak.I ordered this gallon size so I could use it throughout our home in every single room.  We have five indoor pets who have full run of the house. It takes only one flea to infest an entire house.After vacuuming thoroughly, I sprayed a diluted mixture of this (in a bit of dish soap, rubbing alcohol for quick evaporation, some water for volume) in a sprayer bottle (dial it to mist) all over the house in every room, in every nook and corner.The whole place smells deliciously clean and fresh (to my sense of smell) and the fleas seem to have fled.For spraying directly onto my dog's beds, I add a bit of Lavender essential oil.

There is another brand of dog outerwear that closely matches the quality of Hurtta.  I have lots of other high end , durable clothing made by an American company (Name begins with letter ""R"") but they don't make doggie overalls for athletic dogs.

"UPDATE, June 26:  Purchased Granite Gear Long Howl dog back pack in Size XL (from Amazon.com) for our 100+ lbs mastiff.  Fits him perfectly.  He is a pretty laid back dog, so he accepted it with no reaction.  We went for a short 3 mile hike on a sunny, warm day.  No signs of chafing under his armpits! Bags didn't shift around (I weighed each pocket with a bottle of Smart Water).  My smaller dog (57 lbs, chest measures 27 inches around) has an older model Ruffwear back pack (non-removable saddle bags).  I will be adding cushioning wraps to the straps on her Ruffwear backpack.  She has hardly any fur...and her armpits were showing wear (skin was turning brighter pink-red), so I think she'll need padding around the Ruffwear straps.The actual color of the pack I received is a medium orangey-red, rather than a pure red.  I like this color, so no complaints in the color dept.5 star rating is a reflection of my research of other consumers' reviews and my own experience with this pack.I was going to order the Ruffwear Palisades dog pack. The Ruffwear Palisades dog pack also has removable saddlebags.  Plus,  I liked the Ruffwear harness design which didn't cover the dog as much and therefore allowed more air circulation (for hot weather).However,I changed my mind and decided to purchase the Granite Gear Long Howl because of a couple of reviews by users who said the reason they chose Granite Gear Long Howl over the Ruffwear Palisades is the Long Howl has wider, cushioned straps that did not chafe their dogs (compared to the narrower straps on the Ruffwear pack which chafed their dogs).My primary concern in putting gear on my dogs is their comfort; I didn't want a hike ruined by discovering my dogs were suffering from chafed skin (like blisters from ill fitting hiking shoes for me).SIZING INFORMATION:  Measure the circumference of your dog's chest with a regular seamstress flexible tape measure around the widest part of the dog's chest,just behind the dog's front legs.

"I bought this for my newly adopted dog whom I rescued from a Los Angeles County, CA high kill animal shelter. I had used a Gentle Leader Calming Cap size M,  before for another reactive dog I'd also rescued and it worked wonders for her.  I would have given this Large size cap a 5 star rating except it was too small to comfortably fit on my 110 mastiff's head.  It was too snug for him to open and close his eyes comfortably.  I guess I could have trained him gradually to accept wearing it, but I don't want to force or coerce him.  I'm hoping to find a Calming Cap that is an XL size or an XXL size.  There is another company that makes these...however, they do not offer an XL or XXL  size cap. The concept is excellent.

"During childhood in Hawaii, we always had a Moringa tree growing in our yard.  We ate the leaves and bean pods and roots. We dried the seeds and crushed them and rubbed the cold-pressed oil on our complexions.  When I left for college and moved to a cold New England climate, I stopped ingesting and using Moringa as a food and skin emollient because it was unavailable in stores.  Just a year ago, I discovered Moringa products online (from Moringa For Life farms) and started using Moringa again.  What an improvement! I ingest Moringa powder in and on practically everything I eat and drink.  I 2x/daily moisturize my complexion with the cold-pressed oil. People are telling me my skin looks greatly improved...smoother, younger looking.  The only thing I've changed in my beauty regimen of keeping my skin clean and moisturized, is adding Moringa oil to my facial and body creams and moisturizers. When people ask me lately why my skin is looking so much smoother and younger, I tell them about Moringa. I use Moringa oil on my scalp after my daily shampoo, also.  It absorbs so thoroughly into your skin and doesn't leave a greasy feel.I have added Moringa powder to my dogs' and cats' meals and I can see the improvement in their shiny coats (plus, their poop doesn't smell as bad).  I'm so glad Moringa has become mainstream.  It's an ancient health product (Ayrveda) and now it's being used all over the world to improve nutrition.  Feed your body and feed your skin with Moringa.  I think you'll be very happy with the results.  You can do a Google search for Moringa and learn lots more about this miracle plant. My favorite source for Moringa products is the family owned and family run Moringa For Life farms in southern California.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VX6OM5U0G8EM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AS89T8#wasThisHelpful","R2VX6OM5U0G8EM","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've bought many types of reflective leashes: Most of them didn't meet my expectations because (a) when new, the leash was great at reflectivity, but soon the painted on reflective features wore off or peeled off too quickly w/ daily use; or, (b) only one side of the leash was reflective, so too often the leash wasn't effective in alerting  drivers to your presence; or, (c) leashes w/ reflective woven threads in the leash material didn't reflect brightly enough; plus, when this type of leash got covered in dirt/mud, it didn't reflect at all and had to be laundered thoroughly to become effectively reflective again.I ordered one of this Petflect reflective leash just to see how it would work. It's the best reflective leash I have, and I'm ordering three more.  I have two dogs so each dog will have an extra Petflect leash, just in case.There is another leash, by mfg Vedanta, that also has two sides of the leash with reflective material; one side is bright yellow, the other side is silver...however, that Vedanta leash on amazon.com costs $24.00 each, more than twice as expensive as the Petflect leash.Petflect makes a reflective harness also, but I haven't found one big enough to fit my Mastiff and large Amer.

"Anthony Robbins is my premier go-to guru of how to live a valued, fulfilling life.In 1990, I read the first edition of his book, UNLIMITED POWER, which was first published in 1987. Then coincidentally, I saw an advertisement: Anthony Robbins was going to be conducting a seminar in San Jose, CA. I decided I just had to go.  No doubts; just that I had to go. I didn't have the cash on hand. So I put the charges for that seminar on my credit card and told myself I'd worry about paying it off after the seminar, which was advertised as a ""firewalk experience"".  If I could walk on fire, I would find a way to pay off my credit card. Our gross annual income at that time was barely $20,000 before taxes. It would be a stretch, but I was a believer.That seminar ""Unleash The Power Within"" was a life changing experience. My husband was swept up by my enthusiasm and contagious transformation after that. We maxed out our credit cards so we could both attend the longer, 8-day, more intensive, more intimate seminar, ""Date With Destiny"" at the L'Auberge Inn in Del Mar, CA. We were totally committed.We had maxed out our credit cards. Determinedly, we got creative in coming up with the necessary cash to pre-pay (required) for both of us to attend the ""Mastery University"" seminar in Kona, Hawaii which would be held a few weeks after our ""Date With Destiny"" seminar in Del Mar.The ""Mastery University"" firewalk on red hot coals in Kona was just over 40 feet long. We did it (my husband did it twice,and this was his first ever firewalk), no blisters or burns. One of the most amazing things was watching a paraplegic woman ""walk"" those 40 feet on her hands, her partner holding her legs in the wheelbarrow position, as they slowly made their way along the entire length of that fiery path, w/o any signs of blisters/burns on either of them. We also shimmied up a 55 ft telephone pole and stood on top (our feet barely fitting on the tip), then leaped off with outstretched arms to grab hold of a trapeze that swung towards us, just out of reach...so we really had to leap as far as possible to catch it. Total exhilarating adrenalin rush, especially since we had never done this before.It was during that 1991 ""Mastery University"" seminar in Kona, Hawaii, that Anthony Robbins was completing the first edition of his book, Awaken The Giant Within. I read that book as well, and I have read all the updated editions of his books, as well as reading, and listening to, and watching, anything else he's put out.  His TED talk is one of his shortest and best presentations.I've been to other seminars put on by motivational speakers. IMHO, none come close to matching the powerful and illuminating guidance of Anthony Robbins. He's the master. I'm forever grateful I picked up his first book Unlimited Power, out of curiosity. Everything happens for a reason.Anthony Robbins changed our lives in the most positive ways; ways we never even dared to describe, because they seemed so far out of reach.Read his books. Then find a means to participate in at least one of his incredible seminars. My recommendation is to do the firewalk seminar, ""Unleash The Power Within"". If you can walk on red hot coals (mind and emotion over matter), you can do anything you put your heart and mind into accomplishing.  I know.  We did it and are forever grateful for having done what appeared to be the ""impossible"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22A6TQAPZKK3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684845776#wasThisHelpful","R22A6TQAPZKK3L","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unique product from the 4-Star Emu Ranch in South East Kansas, USA: amazingly effective, fast acting pain relief. Goes on smoothly, leaves my skin soft, also smells good. Sure, it may seem expensive compared to other pain relief gels/creams, but look at all the ingredients listed below, then make your comparisons. For me and the relief it gives me, it's worth the price. I also trust this product because it's made in the USA. (Definitely not a ""made in China"" product).I've been using this product for many years.  I've tried many other products (including Tiger Balm). For me, none of these other products come close to matching the positive effects of this gel. In comparison with dozens of other products I've tried, this pain relieving gel contains more different medicinal herbs, essential oils, and other beneficial ingredients. It may seem expensive until you add up the ingredients used. I've listed the INGREDIENTS below.When I've overexerted myself and strained my lower back and hips from a day of weed whacking and hauling garden trash, if I forget to apply this gel on myself (lower back, hips, thighs, knees), I can barely slide out of bed the next morning.  No problem.  I rub a bit of this gel on me where I feel really achey and I'm good to go. I also suffer arthritic-like pains in my hands and wrists (you know...that sharp knife-like twinge when you move your hands/wrists a certain way to turn a screw driver). I rub this gel on my hands and wrists like hand lotion (just a little bit will do) and I can do my chores w/o painful discomfort.INGREDIENTS: Whole Leaf Aloe Vera Concentrate (heals wounds, great for your skin),Purified Water, Isopropyl Alcohol, Emu Oil (reduces inflammation in muscles and joints), Methylsulfonylmethane (commonly known as MSM used for joint helath), Menthol (smells like Vicks Vapo-Rub), Arnica Montana Flower Extract (relieves muscle and joint soreness due to over exertion), Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (surfactant commonly used in toothpastes), Willow Bark Extract (relieves inflammation and pain - the original source of common aspirin), Dimethicone (skin protectant), Polysorbate-60 (thickener), Camphor (relieves pain and itching), Licorice Root Extract (anti-inflammatory uses), Uncaria Tomentosa Extract (commonly known as Cat's Claw Herb - relieves arthritic pain), Ilex Parguariensis (commonly known as Yerba Mate and used for pain relief), St. John's Wort Extract (antiviral, antibacterial, relieves nerve pain), Glucosamine Hcl (slows progression of arthritis and helps rebuild cartilage), Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate (helps reduce arthritic pain), Carbomer-940 (thickening agent),Triethanolamine (used to balance Ph), Grapefruit Extract (commercially also known as GSE and used to relieve pain), Methylparaben (supports joint health and helps relieve joint pain),Diazolidinyl Urea (anti microbial preservative), Propylparaben (used as food preservative), Tocopherol (Vitamin E).CRYO GEL works from the outside in.  To enhance its effects, I suggest you also ingest the homeopathic pain relief formula, TRAUMEEL, manufactured by Heel, Inc. (a USA manufacturer).Made in USA TRAUMEEL comes in pill form (dissolve under the tongue) or in liquid form (place several drops under the tongue).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5OD8YIRZ2RX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BGSZDM#wasThisHelpful","R2T5OD8YIRZ2RX","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My current dog weighs 60 lbs: a muscular, wide chested & deep chested, Boxer-AmStaff mix. I am an unfit, unmuscular 100 lbs weakling. Dog has higher muscle-to-weight ratio than I could ever hope for.  Additionally, dog has unbeatable advantage of superior traction with four paws.Constant jerks & yanking on your dog's collar to make your dog stop pulling often results in permanent injury or collapse of your dog's trachea. This is why choke chains are no longer used by educated, humane dog owners & trainers who do not want to harm their dogs or have their dogs accidentally hanged by choke chain collars.Sense-ation harness (and similar harnesses sold by other manufacturers) is regularly recommended as one of the safest, most humane, easiest to put on and use, for dogs enrolled in training classes at my local humane society, Marin Humane Society in Novato, CA.  Please note: Marin Humane Society does not allow the use of choke chain collars on dogs in their shelter or in their training classes.  Marin Humane Society actively discourages the use of choke chain collars on any dogs.As a paying client-customer I regularly enroll myself and my dog in these dog training classes for the following reasons: (1) my dogs will not pull on the leash, (2) my dogs will become good citizens and pleasant companions to humans, (3) my dogs will be good will ambassadors for dogdom, and (4) I can learn how to be a responsible dog owner and caregiver to my dog.Because I also volunteer at Marin Humane Society as a dog training assistant, I have lots of practical experience in using this style no-pull harness. I regularly help clients in these classes learn how to put the harness on and how to use them to teach their dogs polite walking.  Owners quickly and effectively learn how to teach their dogs to calmly walk at their side without the need to keep pulling/yanking/jerking/popping on the dog's leash.You don't need to go to a training class to learn how effective this harness is. You can follow the instructions in the package to learn.  You can also watch youtube.com videos on how to use this harness to obtain quick positive results.When you purchase this style harness, please be sure to measure your dog correctly.  You do not want a harness that is so tight that it will cause undue pressure on the dog's rib cage, which may compromise his breathing. You also want a proper fit in order to avoid chafing/rubbing under the dog's front armpits. When you first begin, hook the dog's leash to two places: (1)to the front ring of this harness and (2) to the leash ring on the dog's flat collar. (Remember please...no choke chain collars).I purchase my Sense-ation type harnesses from the Marin Humane Society retail store, ""Animal Outfitters"", for about ten dollars less.  You can go to their website, ""Marin Humane Society"" for their store, ""Animal Outfitters"" and in this way, contribute to a good cause.Whatever price you pay, this style harness is worth every penny for the positive and satisfying results it brings to your dog and to you. You will soon be a relaxed, happy dog walker with an equally relaxed, happy dog that does not suffer a collapsed trachea or other injury from constant & frustrated jerking, yanking, & ""pops"" on the dog's neck.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGQ9WF3YHAVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013K0H4K#wasThisHelpful","R3VGQ9WF3YHAVE","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the Integrative Therapeutics Tyler website, you'll find information about the high quality ingredients in this supplement.  We (I, my husband, and our dogs), have been taking Multiplex-2 w/o Iron for several years. (We eat mostly organic foods and tons of veggies and fruits and grains...so we get adequate daily amounts of iron...as shown in our annual blood tests).I used to buy cheaper, off any nearby store shelf, products.  My holistic veterinarian, Pamela Bouchard, DVM, recommended this supplement for my dogs (it's easy to take the capsule apart and mix the powder into dog food).  Dr. Bouchard (who looks about 20 yrs younger, is robustly healthy, with perfect skin, shiny thick hair) also told me she'd done extensive research on multivitamins and decided this was the best...for herself...and for her dogs.  I followed her example and immediately saw and felt the difference after about two weeks of daily use. Clearer skin, healthier looking hair, nails that don't keep breaking/splitting, more energy.  This made a big difference in my dogs' health and physical appearance, as well as our own healthful well-being.The way I see it, you are what you ingest/put into your body.

"This capsule maker works best when the air and weather is dry.  It doesn't work well during rainy season/humid weather.  I read through all the (mixed) reviews. Although every reviewer did not indicate the area of the country they live in, one thing became apparent: reviewers who live in arid or dry climates (e.g., Arizona, Texas, Nevada), are delighted with this gadget because they have no complaints about the capsules sticking or not coming out easily. In my case, I think the moisture in the air where I live (SF Bay Area) affects the gelatin capsules (which I keep with dessicant in a tightly closed glass jar), thereby resulting in capsules getting stuck in the capsule maker.

I would give this Rat Zapper 5 stars if it weren't for the added and continuous expense and inconvenience of having to replace batteries to keep my Zappers at ""kill"" capacity. I searched the Internet for an electric corded rat trap and found none. My ideal rat trap would have capability of both batteries and AC corded power sources.I read through all the reviews for this Zapper and found one person who said he was able to save lots of money on batteries by converting his Zapper from battery power to plug in wall electric power.  A quick Internet search  came up with two easy and effective Youtube instructional videos.Browse Youtube. Search for ""How To Convert A Battery Powered Device to Wall Power"". Also search for ""How To Do It: Basic Soldering"". If you haven't soldered or worked with electric stuff before, strongly urge you to watch both videos before you start.

I secured this mesh to the milk crate with Zip Ties. Buy cheap plastic milk crate, approximately 15"" Long X 13.5"" Wide X 10"" High (The Container Store).  Get small Roll of plastic bird mesh from Home Depot/Lowes, or any garden supply store. Get package of various sized Zip Ties from Home Depot/Lowes/similar stores.Cut two lengths of plastic bird mesh: One piece will be 14""-15"" wide X 36""-37"" long; other piece will be 16""-17"" wide X 34""-35"" long. Leaving top of crate uncovered, secure one length of bird mesh to the front, bottom, and back sides of crate. Secure other length of mesh to other two sides and bottom of crate. The bottom of crate will have two layers of mesh. The top of crate will have no mesh.  Secure plastic bird mesh to the edges and the corners  and sides of the crate with Zip Ties.Final Step: Entry and exit for rodents to access the Zapper covered by the crate. Using scissors, cut two or three 2"" X 2"" openings in mesh on sides of crate near the top edge of crate (the side without any mesh).Place your Rat Zapper down. Turn your crate upside down, open side facing down. Cover the Zapper with milk crate. Pull/thread the cord from you converted Rat Zapper through the mesh.  Plug the cord to your newly electric powered Zapper into your wall outlet.Check your Zapper trap every single day...otherwise, you'll suffer the stench and mess of rotting, seeping, dead rodent (a clingy, thick, noxious stench that burrows into your furniture, clothes and hair).","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O5YODQ6N97I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BWFESU#wasThisHelpful","R2O5YODQ6N97I6","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As another one-star review states, the sizes for ""Small"" breeds (e.g., Chihuahuas, Yorkies) are too large. Additionally, there is no sizing for dogs with chests measuring larger than 26 inches around. The author states that the larger breeds ""are less likely to wear sweaters"". With that assumption, she summarily excludes sizes for the larger, deep-chested, or broad-chested, short haired dogs like Greyhounds, Weimeraners, Boxers, Great Danes, American Bulldogs, Am-Staff Terrers. I will have to look elsewhere to find patterns suitable for my 60+ lb, short-haired, rescued bully breed mix who shivers in 60-degree F temps. I thought I might be able to adjust a pattern, until on close reading, I discovered errors in the stitch counts. Don't waste your money on this poorly edited book.As for the comments of telling people to go to their local library to look up a book before purchasing it online, if that person ever ventured out of his/her little area of the world, he/she would discover not everyone in the big wide world has the luxury of having a library readily available within a reasonable distance. Also, not every library has the finances to include all the books listed for sale on Amazon.com.

"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. My rescued Pit Bull is a cautious dog who is intimidated and shy in new situations and among strangers. She's also fearful of loud noises (big trucks, thunder storms, etc.).To help my dog relax, in general and especially, in her dog training classes, my dog and I attended a TELLINGTON T-TOUCH Workshop where I learned how to ""swaddle & wrap"" my dog with an extra wide (4"") ACE Bandage.  The Ace Bandage wrap worked exceptionally well, but I got tired of having to wrap and unwrap and also having to get new, clean Ace Bandages (the wide ones are quite expensive...and I needed three rolls). So, I decided to invest in this Anxiety Wrap shirt. It quickly paid for itself, plus I can wash it (cold water, hang up to dry) to keep it clean and fresh smelling.The Anxiety Wrap shirt makes a huge difference for my dog. She's much more willing to try new things in obedience classes. She's much more relaxed while working around other dogs and their people. The design of the Anxiety Wrap Shirt is such that the shirt applies gentle pressure on acupuncture points on the dog's body to help increase the dog's sense of security, like putting on a protective clothing or suit of armor before going into strange (and perhaps ""dangerous"" unfamilliar) territory.Additionally, the Anxiety Wrap helps the dog get a better sense of his body so he moves with more assurance. For example, in Dog Agility Training, dogs are put through exercises so they get a sense that they have to ""collect"" their bodies..their legs..to learn balance...and how to place their paws so they can handle the obstacles on the course.  This is very similar to training a horse in dressage in how to ""collect"" his body in order to place his hooves in the correct position to complete a training exercise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27A0ADKT9QFYQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NVBT5G#wasThisHelpful","R27A0ADKT9QFYQ","A2US0I45Z6BR77","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2US0I45Z6BR77?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are by far one of my absolute favorite snacks! They are crisp and flavorful. They taste just like the Baked Lays Potato Chips-but without all the added junk! My kids absolutely love these too, so I have to keep an extra bag hidden in the house so I don't run out before having any! ;) This is one snack we don't get sick of and we have them at least 4 times a week if not more. They are also the perfect side for speidies or burgers and an on the go treat. I feel good knowing that I am eating and I'm feeding my kids something that is as healthy as these chips and we all enjoy them too!

"Oh my gosh! Salsa is so fun! Even better, with Learn to Dance Salsa it is also easy to learn. Each disk is a different skill level and it goes from easy to harder. The first disk shows step by step each move and learn basic stance and posture. By the end you are dancing basic routines that are easy to follow. By disk two you are learning more complicated moves. The beat is great and it really pushes you to learn the dance moves. I found it a little harder to follow, but I think I could have used more time with disk one. By disk three you should know basically what you are doing and it gets harder, the tempo gets faster-it's so fun! I think it would be more fun if I was any good at it!I love the music on the dvds and the step by step directions. This is definitely not a dvd set for someone just looking to fool around and recreationally dance the salsa. I say this because the way it is designed you will almost be forced to learn how to salsa. I love the extra feature on the dvds that give the history of the salsa and also teach about salsa etiquette. I really liked this set and was able to learn a new dance with my husband and have a great time with him. We had a blast learning the steps together and getting creative on the ""dance floor"" If you are looking to learn the salsa-I definitely recommend this set!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BLMGY1JWEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EU1H6M#wasThisHelpful","R2BLMGY1JWEO","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love this hose! It fits in a small plastic tote or conveniently in a drawer yet when the water is turned on it expands to a whopping 100 feet! This is perfect because I am able to use it for so many things! I can water the garden in the back yard or I can wash my car in the front. (our spicket is close to the middle of the side of the house). It reaches both very easily. I love that it is snag proof. It didn't even get stuck in the rocks near the flower bed next to the house! I have been pretty rough on this hose-I'm not a gentle person at times and yet this hose has lasted!This hose is a blast to watch. It expands no matter what the water pressure is and when the water is shut off and the valve closed the hose shrinks back to it's original size. I couldn't believe how easy it was! It also never kinks or twists-it is the easiest hose to use! I hate traditional hoses because they are bulky, kink, and tangle so easily and they get stuck on just about anything. (okay-everything!) It's also super light-about two pounds. This makes it easy to move around and carry around the yard compared to those bulky hoses. Overall, this hose is a great value. It stands up to pressure (no puns intended), is easy to use, doesn't kink or tangle, and is a breeze to store. I plan to have this around for years to come.

"I use these baking cups all the time. There are so many things to use them for! I love how non stick they really are. The first time I used them I still used non-stick spray in them, but after that I haven't since. I found they come out easily every time no matter what. For ease I occasionally use regular muffin pans and put the cups in them, but for quicker baking, I just line these up on a cookie sheet and bake that way. I find putting them in the muffin pans works best when making muffin sloppy joes or mini meatloaves while cupcakes and muffins bake best when placed on the cookie sheet in these awesome little baking cups. They come out light and fluffy and perfectly baked.These cups are great for jello and cheese cake as well-they come out so adorable and add spray whipped cream and a cherry on top and they look absolutely adorable! My daughter wanted me to use these for her birthday party and all her friends LOVED them! They are so colorful and cute. They are also super easy to clean. I just wipe them out when I'm done and they are good to go for the next time. Super easy and so convenient for those quick baking jobs. Oh-and they are great for baking brownies!

"If you have two left feet and have ever wanted to learn Swing Dance, this DVD is for you. I am not by any means a great dancer. My favorite move involved rocking back in forth in a slow dance fashion with my husband. But when I found this DVD I just had to try it! It sounded so fun and since I could do it at home, there was no embarrassing classes to take where I risked being the only person who couldn't dance. This DVD got here super fast and I had to try it immediately.While my husband was not home at the time, it was okay because the way they break up the instruction they show the male and female dancers separately and then show them together. (so I could get some practice in before hubby got here! ;) ) It was incredibly easy to follow. They explained it step by step and showed each step from different angles so there was no missing a thing. My husband and I really liked the music on the DVD and how quickly we were able to pick up the dance moves on here to develop some form of technique. We try to practice with the DVD about once a week and plan to move on to another form of dance soon!

"I really like the Oleavine Moisturizer. It came super fast and I feel like I started seeing results rather quickly as well. Within a week my skin looked more toned and smooth. My skin was feels so hydrated and soft! I absolutely love it! It works wonderfully on my sensitive skin and unlike some moisturizers, this one never made me break out at all. I really like that it is made with natural and organic ingredients so I don't feel bad about what I am using on my face and can feel confident in the product I am using.This moisturizer is especially great during the winter when the air is dry and my skin tends to be less hydrated and supple. The bottle it comes in is super cute and looks expensive while the product itself is actually quite affordable. I love the convenient pump top and that it only takes one pump to cover my whole face and neck meaning it will last quite a long time. I have noticed a real difference in my skin. It is more hydrated-especially for this time of year, the dark circles around my eyes are lightening up, and my fine lines are diminishing.

"This Temperature gun is so multi-purpose. I use it when cooking and my husband uses it for the electrical and also when he is working on the house on different projects. It has really come in handy. While it depends how close you are holding it how accurate it is, it still gets it with in about three degrees making it rather accurate for being a non-contact temperature gun. This product came to me extremely fast. MeasuPro was really great about getting is sent promptly. It was exactly as described and worked right out of the package.I really liked the feature to turn on the laser pointer. My husband uses it much more than I do since I only really use this when cooking meat or in the kitchen, but the option to use it for accuracy etc. is great. It has a great grip on it. I really like how it feels in my hand. It is comfortable and I never feel it slip or sweat. It fits my husbands hand just as comfortably and I love that we both can use it without an issue or feeling like it doesn't fit in our hand correctly. The auto-shut off mode is great because I don't have to worry about wasting battery leaving it running for hours on end (accidentally) and hubby can just set it down and keep working and it'll shut off for him saving him time and energy.I find myself needing this all the time and when I don't need it, I often will just pick it up and play with it. It's so fun and simple to use. This tool is overall super easy to use and very worth the money. It comes with the battery needed to make it work and set up consists of putting the battery in and turning it on. It comes with easy to follow instructions if you want to change settings etc. and has a nice blue lit screen so reading it is a breeze.

"I absolutely LOVE this DVD. I wasn't sure what to expect since this was my first time with Pilates, but I found it to be both one of the hardest workouts I ever completed and one of the most relaxing at the same time. It is to me a mix between strength training and yoga. And I like it. A Lot. It starts by warming you up for the coming exercises with deep breathing, stretching, and a lot of mind focus. Then, it is followed by 24 different exercises that are specifically chosen with all the different skill levels in mind, though this is a DVD for beginners. Don't be fooled-some of these exercises look simple-and perhaps in execution they are-but they are effective as well. Each exercise targets a different body part/muscle group and really targets the muscles in a way you can feel it. Especially the next day. I couldn't believe how much my muscles ached after doing this workout-and I loved it! (you know-pain is weakness leaving the body!)I really liked the music used for this video and the step by step directions and different camera angles used. It was easy to follow and it really worked my body in a way I haven't made it work since I have had kids. I have gotten very slack in my fitness life and this DVD was just the thing I needed to ""ease"" my way back into it while attaining results, having fun, and getting sweaty. It is a great DVD for learners because it does give such great direction and I have really liked doing this every other night.

"This is the best Pedometer I have ever used. It does so much for being so little! I love that while the screen shuts off, it is never truly off. I can sit down for a few minutes and the screen will shut off, but press the reset button and it turns on showing the accurate amount of steps taken and the time. On top of that, it records the amount of steps taken each day and resets each day so you can see how many steps you took that day. Despite it resetting each day, you can also press the mode button and see cumulative steps taken so if you want to keep track or have a set goal in mind for so many days etc. you can keep track of that as well.It comes with a convenient clip and also a detachable lanyard so it is super easy to keep on and is never in the way. It can be worn any way and still keep an accurate account of the steps taken. I have worn it so it is sideways, width wise, in my pocket, attached by the lanyard-every single way I have used it I have been able to track my steps accurately and am confident that I am never missing a step with this pedometer. It is also lighter than any other pedometer I have ever used. Some feel so heavy it's insane considering how small they tend to be.This pedometer is so multi-functional, I don't know how I ever used a different pedometer. It not only counts my steps, but also tracks calories and fat burned, the distance walked/ran, and my exercise time. I thas a built in timer, can record up to 1,000,000 steps for seven days (so you can track and write down weekly steps/progress) and has auto sleep so the screen is not always running wasting the battery. The fact it came with a second spare battery was awesome too! I have really loved using this pedometer so far. I have had it for a couple months and I wear it everywhere. It is so sleek and discreet no one ever notices it. I can set it to my stride and even if it's a little off the measurements come out fairly close to what I have actually done. Such as walk a mile and set it wrong it showed just less than a mile, fixed the setting and it recorded the full mile. It was accurate according to how I set it-that is what's important!

"I have really enjoyed using this Mastery system. I am not a dancer by any means-I have never taken a class that I was able to follow easily enough to pick up the steps and truly get it. This DVD set is definitely great for those on a tight budget who can't necessarily take a dance class or who need a skill touch up or to learn quickly before an event. I love that they show the steps at different angles and showing just the male and female dancers by themselves and also the couple together making it easy enough for a couple to learn their own steps separately and also together.The dance I liked the most was the Waltz because it has always intrigued me and seemed so romantic to me. It was fun learning the steps with my husband and spending that time with him doing something new that we've never tried before. Again, the steps were simple to follow thanks to the different angles and simple directions the DVD offered and we picked it up in no time. The set comes with 7 DVDs that teach the waltz, foxtrot, rumba, and also swing dance. I found the Swing dance extremely fun too-but we definitely did not pick up the steps quite as easily as those for the waltz....Partly due to the fact we are not exactly great dancers and I am also a pretty slower learner at times.I am definitely looking forward to learning the Rumba with my husband and having that fun time with him to learn something new as well as achieve some dancing skills. (I hope! ;) ) I love the music on these DVDs and the dance conversation in them as well and the fact that you can tell this program is specifically designed for beginners. It was the first program I have ever tried that has truly taught me steps and helped me learn the different dances without much difficulty. (minus the few times we tripped over each other...but I'm sure that's common-right? ) I can't wait to see how great we get and possibly get the next Mastery system and learn more dance moves we haven't tried before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MMS0KQETFRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU27QSS#wasThisHelpful","R15MMS0KQETFRK","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He spots a group of dolphins and befriends the littlest one. He sees him learning new tricks and they are immediately intrigued and interested in each other. Unfortunately, Terry's new little dolphin friend ends up trapped in a net left in the ocean and Terry has to save him.This book teaches a great lesson about not littering and considering other creatures on our planet, and also thinking of others.

The toilet was unplugged in less than two minutes. I love that it is easier to use this plunger than most, but it isn't too ""soft"". It is sturdy, but the rubber isn't so hard it hurts to plunge. I love that the handle is plastic. I can't count the amount of times a wooden handle has given me a splinter-plus when the water splashes back up, I'm always worried about what is left in those wooden handles. It is so gross.

I really like that other than the first day when I took two pills instead of one, I haven't had any side effects or issues.

"This Diaper bag/stroller organizer is extremely handy and works great for what I need it for. I have three kids under six and they all seem to come with their amount of needs and since I only use an umbrella stroller for them, it can be extremely difficult to find a place to store things when we go shopping. I found this stroller bag and had to try it. This bag is extremely convenient. The two clips on either side make it the perfect bag for the umbrella stroller because they can tighten up a little and the bag never drags. (this is great because often bags drag and it defeats the purpose)The larger pocket of this is perfect for diapers, a change of clothing, snacks, keys, or even a small shopping bag if needed. There is also a spot that conveniently holds my cell phone so it's always within reach. (plus, with it in front of me, the worry it'll get picked is much less) There is a closed pocket that is great for holding a small wallet or cash, this frees my arm up because I don't have to carry a purse around at all. I also like the side cupholders because then I always have a drink available for the kids. This bag is also great for road trips, I fill it with snacks and a couple diapers and road sickness pills and set it right between the front seats of the car.  This bag is sturdy, cute, and very convenient.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WOQXB7LT04VZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ6A1FE#wasThisHelpful","R1WOQXB7LT04VZ","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love Total Recoil Kinesio Tape. I have been curious about this stuff for a really long time, but was hesitant to try it for several reasons. The first is I have very sensitive skin. I was afraid any adhesive would really bother my skin and cause problems for me. I was happily surprised to find that I was not at all sensitive to this tape. It didn't itch while I wore it and it also didn't leave my skin red when I took it off.The second reason I was hesitant to use this is because I really just felt it was likely just another fad. I mean they come in and go out in a matter of days most often. But after trying this kinesio tape, I found I was sorely wrong. I suffer from terrible shin splints and runners knee making it hard to get back in shape or stay active. I used this tape on my shins and around my knee and felt an instant tingle. I can't really explain what it was, but it felt like my muscles and shins were relaxing and I found I was able to really push through and get my run in and feel great during and after.The third reason I didn't try it is because I expected it to be pretty expensive. What I realized after finding this kinesio tape is that it doesn't have to be! At only $12.99 a roll, this kinesio tape is very affordable. The roll lasts quite a while because it gets cut into strips while being applied, so one strip my actually be used three or four different ways width wise making it last much longer. It has great elasticity and it goes on easily . I can reposition it if I mess it up a little (only a couple times-don't over do it, it isn't duct tape!) and it sticks well. This tape stays on through rain, sweat, rubbing-it comes off when I want it to come off and not a moment more. I have to admit-It hurt removing it more while I was still a little sweaty than after letting it dry off-so I recommend doing that because it won't pull as much...Great for just about any area and any sport or physical activity, this tape has great quality, and being able to run again makes it definitely worth stocking up on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3OD1LBI2KMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPIWN34#wasThisHelpful","R3F3OD1LBI2KMD","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used many True Synergy products, so when I was offered the opportunity to try this for my honest review, it was an easy decision for me. I received this and started taking it immediately. I often suffer from knee and joint pain and get achy pretty easily at times. I had to take this for about a week for it to start working, but most supplements take at least three days to really enter the blood stream and up to thirty to feel full effects. I am very happy with my results.Since adding this to my morning routine, my knees and joints have felt so much better. I rarely have a flare up anymore. I really love that this is in pill form. I am not a huge turmeric fan as far as taste and this really saves me from having to taste it and I still gain results. It isn't just great for my joints and swelling, but I also love that my stomach feels so much better. I am very sensitive to certain foods, so the fact I can now have them without the nasty side effects because my GI is working so much more efficiently is great! I really like this product overall and while it doesn't offer immediate results, it offer results and that is what is important. Definitely worth taking if you have inflammation problems or tummy issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZGKC1CVBVKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP5E06G#wasThisHelpful","RAZGKC1CVBVKT","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Origins by Luxurience is just what my face has been asking for. It is as luxurious as it sounds and leaves my face feeling pampered and beautiful. This particular cream is great for my skin because I have very sensitive skin and this cream is hypo-allergenic. It has a light scent that I wouldn't really describe as girly, so anyone could use it really if they wanted to. It is thick and creamy, but goes on feeling light and airy. My skin feels soft and smooth after applying this cream and I love how bright my face is now beginning to look after a few weeks of using it.I had dark circles around my eyes and they are starting to disappear and my skin is hydrated and healthy for this time of year. Often my skin is left feeling dry and itchy during the cold months, especially in years like this where the weather goes from bearably cool to freezing cold within a few days, or even hours. My skin feels and looks genuinely rejuvenated when I use this cream and it seems my tone is evening out. I use this cream twice a day and it has done wonders for my face and confidence. This is a very good cream and I definitely plan to buy more when I am close to running out.

"If you have never used a peel before, this is the one to use! I've been given other peels for gifts before and they really didn't do the job, but this peel really works wonders! I do recommend you make sure you do it on a day you aren't going out at all or at night before bed so your face has a chance to recover a little before entering civilization again, but really, that's normal. I have seen people spend thousands of dollars on chemical peels, and they really don't have to do that! Dr. Song's Lactic Acid Gel Peel works just like any professional peel and you can do it in the comfort of your own home!This peel has worked to get rid of old acne scars and marks on my face and my skin tone is more even and pores seem smaller. My skin is bright and healthy. It is super easy to use, just take a cotton ball and spread it over the face being careful not to layer over what has already been covered (that will make it peel more). It took a couple of uses and healing times to see any real results, but that is also normal since the healing is what helps restore and renew the facial skin. My skin is much more healthy looking and my freckles are even beginning to lighten. I just love how my skin looks after using this peel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT2D8SJPWJFII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQ2I0G0#wasThisHelpful","RT2D8SJPWJFII","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My friend introduced me to the issues that eating foods with gluten and soy in them could be and I decided to try a new way of eating. One area I always struggled, though, was with my soy sauce. I LOVE it-can't get enough even. Coconut Secret has been great and it has gotten me off my soy sauce ""kick"" because, I have to admit-I like it even MORE than I ever did soy sauce. (and it's way healthier for me too)My only complaint about this product is it's spout is a bit messy. It can be pretty messy, so I ended up going out and getting a special oil bottle with a spout that is ""chef quality"" (or looks it at least!) and put my Coconut Aminos sauce in that instead fixing that problem. I only wish I hadn't needed to go buy a ""special"" bottle for it to avoid mess.This sauce tastes very good and is great in different recipes such as stir fry, over rice, meat recipes, and as a side ""dip"" for certain dishes. I like that it is sweeter than typical soy, because I have somewhat of a sweet tooth and it curbs that desire at meal time by being the sweet I need. If this product were to just get better packaging so that it wasn't messy and didn't spill, it would get five stars from me!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NZCLR36W6I1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XB5LMU#wasThisHelpful","R2NZCLR36W6I1A","A395HU1MWPG9RL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A395HU1MWPG9RL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Finally, a beanie that provides warmth and protection from the elements ALL AROUND your head. I was so excited to receive a sample of this product at no cost for reviewing purposes. As soon as I opened up the package, I could immediately feel that this was made of very nice, high quality, warm materials. I ran my fingers over the fabric, noticed it was made of fleece, and instantly felt how cozy it was. What I liked about this Balaclava Ski Mask, is that it's got a ton of room. It covers your entire head, pulls forward passed your face, and has bungee cords to pull on to close off the opening. This secures your warmth, and doesn't allow for any wind to get inside. AWESOME. The front of the mask has a portion that covers your mouth, and even nose if necessary. This is a rare thing to find in other beanie like products. This does not have huge Velcro straps to close the mouth part, it's just sewn into the Balaclava. It is so warm, and provides the ultimate protection against all cold weather elements. Your face is fully protected. The bottom part of this ski mask, is really long, and fits on top of your shoulders perfectly, providing so much warmth to your throat and neck. The weather is currently dropping in my area. I am so excited that for the first time in all my life, I have finally encountered a product that will provide the warmth and protection I have always wanted. I love the quality, and the durability of this product. It's something I can not recommend enough. For those living up north, or in any area that is really cold. This would be perfect for you. Do not leave your home without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QZVLQVTU6ZA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016GK256O#wasThisHelpful","R1QZVLQVTU6ZA6","AMA68MUXFGLXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMA68MUXFGLXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the cutest Handy Man Childrens Toy around. The quality of the work bench and all the tools that come with it, are really good. The entire set proved to be quite durable, with the exception of one of the yellow side pieces. I had trouble fixing it into the side, so it broke, but honestly it doesn't need it. It's just a piece to place tools in, but doesn't harm the overall functionality of the product.This set is quite adorable, and comes with everything your little man (or little lady) needs to build, and play. The possibilities are endless with these tools. What I loved most was that once your little one is done playing with this toy, you can remove all the attachments, and place them back inside the box. After closing the snap on the box, it doubles as a step stool, which is perfect, because I actually needed a step stool for my little one to brush her teeth. This step stool can also be used to sit on, and comes with a carrying handle affixed to the top. Overall, this toy really has and does it all. It's an all in one toy, with tools, storage, sitting, stepping, and carrying. Very functional, very durable, and extremely cute!

I really like that this selfie stick connected to my phones bluetooth really quickly. I was able to find the selfie stick almost immediately, and got it paired. The response of the button to take pictures works rapidly. It takes the pictures automatically, and does not lag at all.

"Sentey does it again. I am loving my Headphones with Microphone set. It has such a booming, high quality sound that you can't get from too many headsets. These are extremely comfortable, and adjust to the size of any head easily. They are a comfortable fit, and sit on your head so perfectly, that they don't move around or fall off.I love that these can be folded to fit into a case very compactly. They are easy to unfold and set up, and easy to fold and put up too. The cushion that fits around your ears is really comfortable too. It is made of a high quality padded material, that doesn't overheat on your ears. It's comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time.Overall, the sound quality, and the design are pretty awesome. They are holding up REALLY REALLY well, and they fit really nicely. I love that all noise is being drowned out, and I can easily answer a phone call while using the headset. The audio coming in and going out sounds really nice, as does the set as a whole.

"This is one awesome, and unique beanie! I am so in love with it, that I'm thinking of taking it from my hubby for myself. I received the Navy Blue with Gray designs. It's Gorgeous, and definitely something both men and women can use. The quality of this beanie, is amazing. It is sewn perfectly Every stitch, to every knit, it's all of the highest quality you can imagine. The inside has a super soft fuzzy liner, that gives the warmest feel you could want during these brutal winter months. I have never seen a beanie quite like this, and I honestly can not wait for the weather to drop, so that I can get lots of use out of it.The size of the beanie is wonderful too. It has a lot of stretching room, so all size heads would fit in it. I love that there's a lot of room inside too, so you can have a bit of a slouch look at the top of the head which is what I love. It is SO comfortable to wear, and feels very cozy. I can not get over this amazing beanie. It has so much room, so much stretch, and it is by far the warmest beanie I have ever tried.

"These are going to be fantastic for all the Holiday baking we're going to be doing in the next month. The rubber outside, has grooves that make it so easy to grip any pans, whether they be glass or metal. They have a non-slip grip, so even if your pans are wet, or maybe have grease dripping on them, these are going to work wonderfully to pull anything out of the oven.The cotton lining on the inside just makes it so much easier to hold onto any hot items. There is no transfer of heat when you're holding something hot. I have been able to hold on to baking dishes that are right out of the oven without needing to put them down immediately. This is actually a safer way to transfer from the oven to whatever surface you're placing your hot dishes on. I love the cotton. My favorite thing though, would have to be that the cotton extends passed the rubber glove, to give you added protection from heat. I can't tell you how many times the tops of my arms, near the fold of my elbows touch the top of the inside of the oven. I have burn marks in that area because of how clumsy I can be. Not anymore though. These have extra cotton that comes up far enough to protect your arms from heat. I'd say they have an extra 4 inches of fabric, which makes a huge difference when you're cooking.These gloves are fantastic, they are super durable, very high quality, and can withstand some extreme heat. I highly recommend them, especially since the Holiday's are coming. Any cooks, bakers, BBQ makers, you will all benefit from these Silicone Oven Mitts.

"Well, there are a few good and bad things about this case. First of all, it does provide great protection. The case is quite durable, and I feel my ipad is secure at all times. The clasp that closes the lid though isn't too strong. I'm afraid to press on it too hard, cause I don't want to snap it off. I think it could be bigger or longer, to provide a better snap. The keys work wonderfully. They responds really well, and you can feel them as you press them. It's SO much easier to use that keyboard vs. the on screen keyboard for sure. I have never used a keyboard this strong. Not only that, but it paired with my iPad super quickly, which is awesome. The biggest issue I had with this case, was that there is absolutely no way to use the iPad when it's in a vertical position. The ipad WILL fall over, so it does not work at in portrait mode. The iPad is entirely too heavy, and the grooves to hold up the iPad do not hold it at all. I would suggest the grooves be deeper, but that wouldn't help because as I said, the iPad is too heavy. The other issue I had was that you can tilt the screen back. It's almost at a 90 degree angle whether it's on the first groove or the second. The grooves are not far apart enough to make a big difference in the angle of the iPad, so it doesn't really matter much which one you use. All cut outs are in the perfect place. You can get to every button easily. Nothing is blocked. I loved that the iPad settings such as volume, brightness and dimming can all be adjusted through the keyboard. Almost like a computer or laptop. Neat fully functional Features.So angle, portrait mode, and the snap closure could use some updating, but the keyboard, and the ability to connect work really well. I have yet tofind a keyboard that works as well as this one. With a few updates, this would be an awesome case.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6BBC7DGMSHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HMO6A6#wasThisHelpful","RZ6BBC7DGMSHF","AMA68MUXFGLXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMA68MUXFGLXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm extremely impressed with this light bulb. I honestly had no idea that a smart light bulb even existed. I knew right away to look for the Sunlabz app on my phone. I'm on an android, and found it right away. I plugged in my light bulb, turned it on,  turned on my Bluetooth, and through the app, connected directly to the bulb. Super easy to do. There are several different features on the bulb. The standard light can be changed from a cool tone to a warmer toned light, as well as dimming it, and brightening it too. At the top of the app, you can switch the bulb to ""color spectrum"" Here you find a color wheel, where you can select your color of choice. This part also has the bright and dim feature. Under neath the brightening settings, is a mode selector. You have the option to have the colors of the light switch from color to color. I absolutely love this feature, as there seems to be such a vast amount of different hues per color. Reds, Pinks, Aquas, Blues, Greens, Yellows, Purples, so many different varieties of these colors, and they're all gorgeous.The only minor negative issue I've seen with this bulb, is that the app has to find the bulb each time you turn it on. Even if you leave the light on for a while, and go back to the app to turn off the light, you have to kill the app completely, and reconnect in order to mess with the light through the app. It's not a big deal when the light is extremely nice. But it can be a bit of a hassle if you're in a hurry. It's a slight inconvenience. Other than that, this light bulb is pretty neat. I'm super thrilled to turn it on in my living room every night. Especially during a movie, it's super neat. With over 16 million colors, and a lifespan of 15,000 hours, this light will last for a very long time, and be loved by all.

"I finally had a chance to step out and trim some hedges with these Pruning shears. It's been a rainy week here in Texas, so I wasn't able to try them sooner. All good things come to those who wait I suppose, cause once I was able to put these to use, I was pleasantly surprised.Out of the package, the pruning shears, seem like a solid set. They are very sturdy, easy to grip, and have nice bit to them when you open and close the grips. You can hear the blades rub on each other creating that nice sound they make, which shows me they're going to cut through branches and twigs nicely. The handles have a nice rubber grip on the outside. They make it easy for them to stay in my hands, and not slip. I love that they have a safety lock, so that when they are not in use, you can lock them closed, and avoid anyone grabbing them or hurting themselves. The blades are stainless steel. So I would suggest just washing them with a wash cloth, and patting them dry, so they do not rust. They are super sharp, so do not attempt to touch the blades.Once I stepped outside, I put them to use immediately. I was so surprised at how well they cut through my shrubs. It was so nice not having to open and close the grips repeatedly to get a good cut. These were a one snip deal, and cut my trim time in half. I'm always left outside snipping and snipping over and over, but these did the trick quickly, and I was back inside in no time.I can not stress enough how nice a pair like these are. They works really well, and feel really nice in my hands. My hands are not big. They're average-to-small sized hands. Other women have larger hands than I do, and these still felt really comfortable in my hands. I had no trouble gripping them and using them. So I know they'd work well for both men with larger hands and women with smaller hands. I highly recommend these. I won't be doing any gardening without them anymore.Sample was sent at no cost for reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WJXIGQ62X8IX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGEAO2S#wasThisHelpful","R2WJXIGQ62X8IX","AMA68MUXFGLXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMA68MUXFGLXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am so excited that this product has come into my life.  At a 150 lbs. capacity, it makes it perfect for what I'm hauling. I was surprised at how flat the package was that it came in. This made me realize just how compact this product is to store. I opened up the package, and quickly figured out how to set up the trolley. It was so easy! All I did was press both handles together to extend the neck, use my foot with shoes to step on the base plate and push it down. This triggered the tires to open up, and I was all set to go. The aluminum body is really very sturdy. I was actually quite impressed  with how well it was constructed, and how strong it felt. The wheels are thick rubber, which makes it so easy to push around on dirt, and over rocks, as I've done. The base plate is not too large, but it's large enough to transport large boxes, and even boxes with a ton of weight are easy to set on plate. I also love that if my boxes are moving around, this trolley does come with a bungee cord, to help me tie them down.When I'm done moving boxes around, I just press on the handles again, kick the base plate up, which will fold the wheels back in, and it's back to it's super compact, super thin size. I can slip this between my wall and refrigerator, or between my washer/dryer and the wall, anywhere where there is a gap, this thing is sure to fit. It's so slim that it takes almost zero space anywhere you store it. I can not get over how awesome this product is. This is super handy, and super sturdy. You will not regret this purchase.I received this product free, for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1JUFLPIMK0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QRWWS4#wasThisHelpful","R3A1JUFLPIMK0E","AMA68MUXFGLXU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMA68MUXFGLXU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried MANY hair thermal products: Paul Mitchell, Redkin, Aquage.... and out of them all this HSI is my favorite and then probably Aquage. This does NOT make your hair dry or sticky.  It makes your hair smooth, SUPER soft (almost too soft if that's an issue), and smells beautiful.  I have A LOT of hair and it's thick.  I cannot believe how much this thins my hair out (in a good way) when I straighten it.  I feel like my hair looks like Jennifer Aniston's and that's what I mean by it's almost too soft, but that is not a bad thing! I'm not use to it, but I like it! I have tried this on wet hair and then blow dried and also just on dry hair and then a straighter to it and it works great both ways.  I'm not sure which stores sell this product, but I definitely plan to put it in a beauty basket as a Christmas gift for my best friend that I'll make.  Definitely my new favorite thermal product and I'm sooooooo glad I found it.  Redkin and Paul Mitchell just made my hair....dry and sticky almost like a dry shampoo was in it. Ladies, do not hesitate to buy this product. Also, it says it protects 450 degrees which is great since my hair straightener goes up to 400 degrees.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J2YSHXFDNIV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMIVLXY#wasThisHelpful","R1J2YSHXFDNIV0","A17ACYD82FHFUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17ACYD82FHFUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After throwing away my militaryshield  protector since i ruined it after one try,  i decided. .there has to be a hard plastic cover for the edge that is not a wet application.  Thanks to previous buyers who answered my questions,  they convinced me to drop the money on this protector and I'm glad i did.  The instructions are not in English,  but you could easily figure it out.  Wipe screen with dust cloth, use sticker on screen to get additional dust,  then apply protector pulling off sticker backing. This was easy to apply and the were absolutely no air bubbles.  It covers the edges of the phone and most of all,  sticks with staying power. I was even able to put my caseology case on right away.  My screen is fully protected and it still responds to my finger on the screen, but it does take a few taps on buttons near edge part with protector on thus one loss of star.  Finally,  someone who mastered the edge with full,  hard,  protection.  I'm not sure if it's the glass,  but it sure feels like it.

"had my phone for a week and i never drop my phones and somehow i magically dropped my new phone with this case on and NO protector yet. it survived, thank god. i was super nervous. my old S4 had a caseology case and i bought my mom one too and we've been happy with the skinny case (no extra bulk) but still cute and protected. This is why I ordered from them again. i went with the clear because my gold/chrome phone is too cool to hide.... my only complaint is that the back has an air bubble/air pocket showing.... kinda lame... but for the price i paid, i can't complain. it definitely reveals the edge of the phone too, that isn't fully covered, but still protected enough. i'll always pick caseology cases over otterbox. cheaper, slimmer, and cuter cases.

"I am NOT a handy girl, but I was proud of myself for being able to put this together on my own in less than 20 minutes. My dog gets hot, a lot... And it's funny because he's small, but he loves winter. My bedroom is the hottest room in the house, so I figured he'd like this since he lays on the wooden floor in the kitchen. We'll see if he continues to use it...I just introduced it to him today with his toy and blanket as a pillow. I don't plan to cover this with a blanket because this defeats the cooling purpose which is what he needs. I got a medium...which is kinda big for my dog, but he thinks he's big and I figured he'd like the space. I like the gray color much better than that advertised green. Huge huge box that it was shipped in, not necessary Amazon... LolUpdate: my dog doesn't use this as hoped... Every time I get him on it he doesn't stay... He sleeps on the wood floor when hot, so surprised he doesn't like this.... No sense in returning it as one day I'll have another dog to keep mine company.

I haven't decided if I'm keeping this yet as it's for a wedding and that center stitch can't be hidden unless I safety pin a bow. There's also a center stitch in the middle of the skirt in front all the way down that's not a pleat.... But I figured that wouldn't be too noticeable. Maybe in black the stitching isn't obvious..

"I originally gave this five stars because it's working on my dog, but now I have to change my review because the collar broke. It doesn't charge AT ALL. it's not the remote battery, I've tried several outlets, and even attached the charger to my cell phone charger since it connects with usb, but the collar use to light up red for charging and it doesn't anymore. Let it charge anyways for eight hours and still nothing. I'm mad. I'll be contacting customer service. I have a cheap toaster that lasted longer than this collar.The thing I hate about the collar is the shock component is heavy/bulky and it doesn't snap to the entire collar (you know how there's 2 collar parts to adjust the size) it only snaps to one part of the collar so it hangs down low on my dogs neck. The remote is nice, but it didn't come with instructions so I did contact customer service who reported:4 and 1 are one shock5 and 2 are two shocks6 and 3 are three shocksthe shock is not more powerful than the others, but just longer.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BB0BNS8E200P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX6LJ22#wasThisHelpful","R1BB0BNS8E200P","A17ACYD82FHFUB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17ACYD82FHFUB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A relentlessly negative portrayal of one of the central political figures of the Civil War era. In William Marvel's estimation, which may be true, Edwin Stanton was a ""kiss-up/kick-down"" type in a world of extreme political and bureaucratic in-fighting.People close to Stanton, such as Judge Holt and Senator Charles Summner, are heaped with scorn. No one in this story is credited with any disinterested patriotic or public spirited acts. All is done for a desire for personal advancement, lust for political power, money, nepotism, jealousy, stupidity,or hatred. The Radicals were just that; not principled fighters seeking to end the South's brutal system of slavery,While Mr. Marvel makes a strong case that Stanton was not a true and nice man, I can't shake the remembrance that he was in charge of the War Department when the Union defeated the South. And he was sufficiently well thought of to be nominated and confirmed as a U.S. Supreme Court justice as his life came to a close.The most interesting part of this version of history to me are the contrarian views taken on many of the events and incidents familiar to students of the Civil War. Mr. Marvel seems to delight in being a modern day Copperhead historian, more concerned with the temporarily abridged civil liberties of Northern opponents to the Administration and the rights of rebellious states than to the entrenched and crushing reality of Southern slavery.Edwin Stanton remains in need of a balanced, modern appraisal of his significant life and career.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCJKQCTVRCEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1469622491#wasThisHelpful","R1OCJKQCTVRCEI","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nice study of the life of a great Civil War era photographer, Alexander Gardner, as intertwined--at several points during that severe war--with Abraham Lincoln.The basics of photography of the times, Antietam, Gettysburg, and coverage of the fate of Booth's cohorts make up the bulk what's here.  Professor Lowry does a good job of explaining the art contained in many of Garner's finest plates, whether of President Lincoln or of the lonely dead left at the scene of grim battle.Note for a future edition: John Hay was educated at Brown, not Princeton (p. 74).For readers interested in this general subject, I highly recommend ""Photography and the Civil War"" by Jeff L.

Read Dr. Marsh's book and you will learn more about a great poet and something about today's society.I am not on the political left and reject a number of the author's thoughts on American's current economic system.

"A sharp and useful study of what Abraham Lincoln thought and did about the thorny political problem posed by the rebel states as the Civil War wound down. How were they to be brought back within the fold?  Were they conquered territories or as states rescued from misguided local leaders? Could the federal government mandate their election laws to force black suffrage? Were the wayward leaders of the Confederacy to  be treated harshly or with leniency?President Lincoln emerges here as a kindly but pragmatic politician focused on reestablishing a strong national union, with slavery banished. Facts on the ground and his judgments of what was socially achievable at that moment were more important than considerations of abstract racial justice.The ""last speech"" is not to be remembered for literary style, but as a vehicle to better understand President Lincoln's struggle with the complexities of reconstruction.(What a great tragedy for the nation's future it was that Andrew Johnson  came to power after Booth's last act.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O2GX27T6DJRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0190218398#wasThisHelpful","R3O2GX27T6DJRZ","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A popular history of George Washington's two terms as president, with a focus on his closest advisers within the first administration under the new U.S. constitution.This book will do as an introduction to some prominent (Adams, Jefferson, and Hamilton) and some not so prominent (Edmund Randolph, Henry Knox, and Tobias Lear) early Americans associated with the great man. However, those with previous reading on this era will find little new in this volume.In terms of style, the two authors often drift into the annoying habit of summing up their paragraphs with an overly cute twist. Such as ""But when the enormous man with the huge hands and powder blue eyes walked into her shop, she became an American. She would be an American for the rest of her days. She was why the trips were important.""If you only have the time or interest to read one recent book on George Washington, I recommend ""The Return of George Washington"" by Edward J.

"An uneven book in that the author drifts away at times from his ""body"" theme to other topics, such as with a lengthy discussion on Dr. Martin Luther King's complicated relationship with the historical Lincoln. While little is here that would be new to the many that form the Lincoln cult, I still found it to be well-written with many interesting insights.Professor Fox is strongest when he is relating the factual history of the various physical representations of Abraham Lincoln over time, since the assassination and lengthy burial ritual to the present day's movie by Steven Spielberg. For example, the materiel on the spirited debate over the proper siting of the memorial in Washington,D. C., and then its eventual racially insensitive dedication is well done.As is not uncommon of late with Lincoln commentary, the undertone of this book is decidedly prone to view our first Republican president as someone who would be in the camp of modern day Democrats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336LTMX449MC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393065308#wasThisHelpful","R336LTMX449MC6","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A view of the events associated with President Lincoln's assassination and its aftermath taken from common people's diaries of the period.Professor Hodes has mined a lode of primary documents, but has produced little new or surprising, at least to one who has read many books on that troublesome era. For example, the idea that people reacted with shock to Lincoln's death, but quickly turned to every day chores and duties would not be too difficult to understand for most adult readers of today. And it is not novel to learn that Northern Copperheads didn't love the martyred president or that Southern freedmen did.My real difficulty is that this book did not flow smoothly for enjoyable reading, because, I think, the author inserts an excess of direct quotes from various diaries in a very repetitive fashion to prove whatever historical point is to be made.I did find an ending essay on sources to be useful and interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VRWOACUO2RF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030019580X#wasThisHelpful","R1VRWOACUO2RF6","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While the author clearly respects his subject, its hard to walk away after closing this book thinking ""I wish I had known this fellow."" But he did live in interesting times.This competent but not flashy representative of the British Empire was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the Civil War and had other significant tours working with the Sublime Porte and the Quai d' Orsay. He saw the decay of the Ottoman Empire and, from Paris, the rise of Bismark's Germany.Reading this solid effort by Professor Jenkins helps one understand the confused world of today.

This book looks at his influence and leadership during the half-decade between the conclusion of the war and the start of the federal government under the newly ratified Constitution.Professor Larson provides the reader with an enjoyable and deeply informative book, one that makes clear the central role Washington played in not only fashioning the content of our country's foundational law, but also in the the practical political process necessary for its not-so-certain ratification.Along the way, one is reminded of such things as Washington's vision for western expansion and economic growth, why the electoral college came about, how the Bill of Rights was later tacked on, and the intense fight by many leaders of the day against a strong federal government.It is difficult to fathom where we would now be as a people--even if we would be a people--without the popular, decent, and wise George Washington during the years covered by this most excellent book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21I5KN8UAT7L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062248677#wasThisHelpful","R21I5KN8UAT7L2","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A sharp, insightful, and interesting analysis of the writings and political thinking of George Orwell.While this book follows the arc of Orwell's life, this is not a conventional biography. Little is said about his family or friends. Instead, one is given an intelligent tour of Orwell's development over time, through the means of his published works and the topical political events and social realities he confronted.Professor Colls firmly places Orwell within a specific English context and deftly explains the trouble with any attempt to politically pigeonhole this great writer.Readers may also be interested in a book released in 2013: ""George Orwell: A Life in Letters."" For any serious student, ""The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell"" (1968) is indispensable (and enjoyable).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SMNP8IB0NCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199680809#wasThisHelpful","R23SMNP8IB0NCC","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A collection of short papers by various scholars; work arising from an academic conference. While interesting personalities are introduced, most readers familiar with this historical era will not be surprised at any of the information delivered.George Washington remains the Indispensable Man, but this is not the book to unfreeze his personality or unlock the key to his greatness.I did find it odd that some of the chapters were devoted to people who had hardly any, or no, personal contact with General Washington, such as Captain Kirkwood, while our greatest chief justice, John Marshal, and close associate of Washington is ignored.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12EV8DQLKZHU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813934389#wasThisHelpful","R12EV8DQLKZHU6","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are interesting extracts from letters written by Eleanor Pray, an American living in the port city of Vladivostok during tumultuous times. Somehow amidst wars, occupations, and revolutions, Mrs. Pray keeps her sanity and also her love for her adopted Far Eastern city.Her life centers around daily household duties and the social swirl of the upper class foreign community planted in this Far Eastern Russian outpost. The evolving political situation eventually undermines her comfortable world, but Mrs. Pray adapts due in no small part for her enduring attachment to the scenic beauty of Vladivostok and its people.I especially liked one letter to her Red Cross superiors in Washington, D.C. wherein she reported on the dismal conditions facing the local population in 1922. It is a model for a field report made during a humanitarian crisis.As editor, Professor Birgitta Ingemanson has performed a scholarly task with great insight and precision.

"A book for anyone with an interest in the nation's political affairs, especially at  the presidential level, from the 1940s to the early part of this century.Dr. Schlesinger wrote well and often. He was involved in the highest levels of Democratic party politics. He was a friend and defender of the extended Kennedy family. He was a public intellectual with sharp elbows, but also with a strong mooring on the side of political freedom and free speech.A creature of Harvard and later Manhattan, he penned interesting and vibrant letters to the famous of his era.While I am not of the same political faith as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., I nonetheless admire his dedication to this democracy and the spirit with which he so clearly argued his many and varied views.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R217N81GCK30N0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993098#wasThisHelpful","R217N81GCK30N0","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Professor Shelden tries a little to hard to show how everyone just got swimmingly along on Capitol Hill in the 1850s and early 60s, whether Northerner or Southerner, whether of one party or another. She often uses as evidence social correspondence that says nice, flowery things about the recipient. I would discount many of these notes and letters as simple formulations of polite things that are routinely said between people (especially politicians), things that are not necessarily the brutal truth.More seriously to me is that the undertone of the book seems to argue that if everyone (e.g., Mr. Lincoln) would have simply compromised, such as advocated by John Crittenden, war would have been averted. No mention is made of how slavery would ever have been abolished or the federal system preserved.The author is gentle on Senator Jefferson Davis: I would have tied him to a sour apple tree.I did enjoy the detailed descriptions of the varied housing arrangements of the senators, representatives, cabinet officers  that made up the floating population in our capital in the years preceding the Civil War.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UA2VU4CNQX6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146961085X#wasThisHelpful","R1UA2VU4CNQX6U","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A much better book than one would imagine from its dry title. The authors tell the tale of the formation and popularization of the great song of the Civil War and bring its impact forward over the past 150 years.The Battle Hymn has been put to use by various political leaders, social reformers, religious groups, labor organizers, and others through the many decades since the days of Julia Ward Howe. Within this book the song itself provides a vehicle to tell many interesting historical stories, ranging from the rise of Billy Sunday to the days of the Wobblies to Martin Luther King, Jr., and 1960s civil rights movement.As this is an effort by two university professors, not surprisingly almost every use of the Battle Hymn by conservatives is belittled.

"An interesting book focused on the career of J. Carter Brown, the legendary leader for three decades at the National Gallery of Art. Professor Harris provides the reader with a nicely written look back on an exciting time for culture in our nation's capital. (Having said this, one should not look to this book for much on the theater, music, or dance.)While the main story here is about Mr. Brown and the National Gallery's rise as a force in the rarified world of top-flight fine art museums, there are side trips to the Smithsonian Institution and the many spirited aesthetic disputes involving our capital city's urban development since the 1970s, such as the fight to build the World War II memorial on the Mall and the one to tear down the Rhodes Tavern.At times, it seems to me, the author does rely too heavily on contemporary news articles about the various special art shows that are mentioned in this book.If you are interested in Mr. Brown, the Smithsonian, the funding and management of modern art museums, how ""international blockbuster art shows"" are pulled off, urban planning, and/or the special diplomatic and cultural life of Washington, D.C., this would be a very good purchase.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SSXMGMN9GMPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022606770X#wasThisHelpful","R2SSXMGMN9GMPH","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The North won for more reasons than brute strength; Lee was far from an unblemished hero; the cause of effective voting rights for blacks was set back for a century; there is a reason there are no public monuments in Washington, D.C., for President Andrew Johnson; and Grant deserves his honored place in our country's history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CHVBC3BP8CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199751714#wasThisHelpful","R18CHVBC3BP8CI","AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AN4ZE5MO8Z1IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A very good book on the First Amendment and how the great Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes came to put his polished interpreting mark on this fundamental protector of free speech.The author, Professor Thomas Healy, avoids academic jargon and keeps the reader interested not only in the evolving law but of the life story of the elderly jurist and his many younger and liberal friends, including such notable people as Learned Hand, Felix Frankfurter, and Harold Laski.If you want to learn about the 20th century history of free speech protection under the U.S. Constitution and how personal friendships can influence the thinking of a judge, this book is a bright starting point.One quarrel: I do think Professor Healy too often discounts the real threat Soviet communism did pose to the United States for most of the last century. Millions did die under this misguided system. And Alger Hiss, who once clerked for Justice Holmes, while targeted by the FBI's reactionary Hoover was, in deed, a Soviet agent.Also, readers of this book will notice a few references to the ""House of Truth.""

No mom needs that when she has a new born. Author Marianne Ryan is a master of making the reader feel like we are at a lovely cafe enjoying tea and talking about what needs to be done after baby.I love the approach she takes and the encouragement and practicle advice she dispenses along with an exercise regime that is doable and great diet and nutrition tips.

Within the characters there is a certain tone I hear almost of laughter if you will as Author HGW throws a whole new twist of plot out there leaving the reader to briefly pause in reverent silence at his or her brilliance once again.I never tire of seeing just what is in store for me it could be Clark Gable it could be Abe LIncoln the Vampire Slayer but whoever is introduced into the book is going to surprise, delight and give you a few if not a lot laugh out loud funny moments.Now without great writing, editing and formatting it would all be for not so rest assured when you read a HGW book you get the whole package well worth the time to read a delight page after page love this guy or girl.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WU1QXKJFU46Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4ZFEIK#wasThisHelpful","R2WU1QXKJFU46Y","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is from: Amish Romance; To Have You (Aubrey's Change of Heart) (Amish Romance; Torn series Book 2) (Kindle Edition)I was in the mood for a change of pace I am usually a die hard Chick Lit reader but variety is the spice of life and Memorial Weekend loomed large and lonely on the home front. So, decided to make it a weekend all about me downloaded a couple of books, grabbed a few bottles of wine, some good cheese, crackers and fruit and locked myself in for the duration.Author Saraah Sowells book was the second of the weekend and quite frankly it went to fast even as I slowed my read down to savor each and every page of this new genre for me Amish Romance. I know a bit of an oxymoron but after you read it you'll agree there is something to be said about the Amish way of doing things. LOL. It was really enjoyable and very well written.I can honestly say nothing inferior in Author Sowell's writing either she had what I call the Holy Grail of character development great pathos, enough subtext to keep it interesting and amazing that's right I said amazing dialogue. Some people can write and some just can't this author is diffinitely on the side of ""girl got back in her dialogue.Not only is the dialogue realistic but it also serves a purpose who knew that was possible, it helps to move the story line forward so you don't get bogged down in the minutia of the narrative. Yes overall I would say don't be afraid of the Amish Romance well worth the time to read and this cutting edge writer is going to be heard from mark my words.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AT20X7Q8ULHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT4DA3E#wasThisHelpful","R1AT20X7Q8ULHY","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well designed product that functions better than average., it should also be noted that I love the holder it is smooth and easy to clean with a bleach wipe. This thermometer fits nicely into the tray I have under the bathroom sink for medical supplies. I actually have two of these one for the pets marked with a bit of red nailpolish and the one I use for my little baby grands who spend a lot of time at Yaya's farm.Because they are all between the ages of 1 and seven fever is a regular event in our world when the kids are here visiting. I can promise you at some point during the visit one of them will not be feeling well and need a little TLC. It is easy to place in the child's mouth and once again very easy to wipe down with a Lysol wipe vs a bleach but the same clean effect.It came packaged nicely and did not require surgical equipment to remove from the wrapping but it is secured enough you feel good about the sanitary handling of the product. Over all a good product that does as described and arrives as promised. It should be noted this actually arrived two days early.I would patronize this seller again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R60PTIKYQ4LIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBSGHLA#wasThisHelpful","R60PTIKYQ4LIH","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great quick read about Aaron Rogers the man, the player and the icon. It was a well rounded piece of work and very focused on the success story of pro sports. There are not to many who have successfully handled all the craziness associated with pro sports. It would appear this is one of those rare exceptions to the rule.I learned a lot about football. the Packers and of course Aaron Rogers so overall it was well worth the read, it was well formatted and edited which made it even more enjoyable.

"This is one of the most delightful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, it was also a very interesting study in people who do the bird watching. Lots of interesting side notes about the birds the process and the religious fervor behind bird watching, But the part I locked into was the personal story of this really fun kooky family.By the end of the book you are if anything like me feeling a little disappointed you were raised with such traditional not fun parents LOL I write this review still giggling over some of the antics of this family when faced with the master plan that somehow didn't turn out quite as expected. Whether it was the accommodations, the surroundings or worse each other.At the end of the day this book is a great read about family and really finding that point of common interest that keeps a relationship healthy, happy and growing. Is this book going to change the world probably not but it will give you an insiders view of the odd bird watching fellows you have always pictured in your mind. After the read I think you will as I did realize that there really is no stereotype birdwatchers like people come in all sizes, shapes and colors.By the way, I loved the cover and the title intrigued me so I googled Painted Bunting and it is a real bird that is difficult at best to track even though it is from Florida to the Carolina's it is an elusive member of the bird clan but once seen never forgotten. Kind of like this book it will stay with me for a good long while.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NDUWX3FE7PDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FL6OUOA#wasThisHelpful","R2NDUWX3FE7PDA","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking for entertainment for my Grands who visit my little country place often on the weekends. I thought music at nap time might just be the ticket. In my search I came across these delightful music tracks geared for kids and perfect for naptime quite frankly. I speak of my fav Alice In Wonderland when I say nap time perfect not to exclude the other adorable numbers attached to this same talented artist.Songster Gina Deeming sings like an angel with wings it is the kind of voice that children are drawn to part Fairy Godmother part Forest  Imp the end result being a delightful blend of lilting soprano with fun camp fire counselor.Most kids will hum along and learn the lyrics very quickly in my estimation this is a wonderful example of the new artist out there allowing us to now listen to our favorite children stories with a lyrical twist. Bravo to Gina Deeming for this important work she is doing in the Arts and Education movement.This music does what children s art's should do inspire, educate and entertain grand slam and I feel like an artist with over forty years in arts and education I'm an authority of sorts on the quality of this work.

"First let me say I was interested from the beginning in a book that explores the dynamic between father and son not often do you get to see an example of that in books, Probably for several well thought out reasons men are not known to be great emotional communicators ;historically but Author James Bowman breaks all the man rules and writes a story that is deep and meaningful.The plot line is fast paced and original I don't believe in spoilers so feel free to read the authors perspective in the summary but suffice it to say I enjoyed every page. I thought that the building of the characters throughout the story rather than all at once was an interesting and workable twist to what could have been a very one dimensional story.The dialogue not only assist the reader by giving an event time stamp tot he flow of the story it also helps to see the subtext of the characters and eliminates the need for long boring narrative.

"I found this book disturbing in a good way the way books are suppose to disturb your thought processes and make you see things from a different perspective. Written in a first voice narrative allows for the reader to actually get inside the mind of the character and understand the pathos and subtext that the story doesn't tell by design, Rather leaves some things to readers imagination and mind to search out a true answer.Author Emanuel Grigoras has managed to raise the veil on the culture and day to day living of a place I have only heard of but now can see with more clarity and certainly with a new sense of understanding for the thinking and sub culture that prevails. While not all grey and dark it needs to be said that there is also a sense of poetry underlying what at first you might perceive to be random thoughts linked together, but early on in the read you will see the puzzle pieces expertly being lined up.Seven degrees of separation has never had a better defined space to flourish in this is an extraordinary story told with skill and much research or first hand knowledge that allows for not only the words but the sights and sounds around the stories being told, In retrospect it was much more like watching a film than reading a book and I liked it . . . a lot. .","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19G0Q3LJ312KL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG3V1LQ#wasThisHelpful","R19G0Q3LJ312KL","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to start by saying that I love the geographic/cultural sub story of this very touching and moving book. I came with an empty cup not really sure I wanted to read this but the blurb got me and I succumbed to the visual it left in my head.,The entire book was very visual and for lack of a better word touchy feely in a most positive sense of the word. Because this story is all about subtext and pathos and rebuilding not just a family but a culture as well.Healing and forgiveness are the main message but I also got a great sense of healing and moving forward as a victor by finding a way to make things matter. I enjoyed the differences in the sisters and in their purpose of the relationship.The dialogue was meaningful and not a word is wasted in this complex story that just sucks you in and before I knew it I wasn't sure if I was reading letters from friends or reading fiction. It's that moving and personal of a journey recommend this book highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XXJOAAN55Z34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XD5XZA6#wasThisHelpful","R2XXJOAAN55Z34","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is so many different faucets of this complex issue that to use a guide to understand and get to know the players is essential, in order to grasp the entirety of the situation.It is detailed and exacting in it's honesty this guide if you will breaks everything down that you might just have missed in the big picture while focusing on the details.This book also deals with the underlying social issues that are forced to be dealt with as a result to the serious issue of sexual assault on campuses specifically this one in Montana.

"Besides being an enourmously well written book with impeccable editing and formatting this book was an interesting and insightful read to boot. As I read I could relate the issues each family member experienced from their technology DT's.But more than being about technology this book is about defining the modern family it is not the same family it was back in the 60's even the 90's. Modern families have become entrenched in technology at the expense of their personal interactions.There are pro and con in each corner but interestingly enough this book falls in neither camp rather the focus is on the individual relationships that began the year and the changes in them over the year. Of course everyone will read into what they want.But for me Author Sharael Kolberg wrote in such a familiar, friendly tone that I found my self fascinated with the individuals rather than the group project. Either way you fall on the coin this book will give you much food for thought.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQ265RCQ8D48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U95ZMSG#wasThisHelpful","RKQ265RCQ8D48","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I read this book I had a craving to listen to some Arlo Guthrie or The Weavers what a great mood Author Eldon Spady set for this wonderful real story. The fact that I was raised on a ranch in Inyo County California allowed me to understand some of  inside humor a little more perhaps then someone who never got up early. That would be while it was still dark to feed hungry animals regardless of how cold the morning.I think he really captured for the teen reader a different time and place that because of the Urban setting most kids are raised in these days will never experience except through the musings of authors like him,The stories were from the heart and had a wonderful folksy feel to them as if you were sitting around that potbelly stove trying to dry out while your mom set the oil cloth red gingham table for dinner. You could almost smellf fresh harvest food and farm raised chicken in the oven being stoked by wood. Browning and sizzling as Arlo sung on the radio and you tried to listen over the static. Yeah it is that kind of book,Just awesome a must read for all kids should be on the reading list of all 8th and 9th grade classes well written, edited and here's a switch great formatting yeah team Spady!So buy it and enjoy and don't forget the Apple Cider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NHRE5GBEZUFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ72I30#wasThisHelpful","R1NHRE5GBEZUFR","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is book two of  the series and so I decided to give this new series the critical test of becoming a fan. Book number two the true test of a great series. Author Ann Gimpel did a great job hooking me with her writing style and creative plot in book one. Enough so that I kept my eye out for this book.I'm happy to report I'm officially an Ann Gimpel fan what a great continuation of the story I love the way she synced it right up to the end of book one and kept moving. Rather than bogging me down in a big rehash of what I just read. I think that will come in handy when someone buys the series in a swoop and starts reading.I have to say I did like the way she sneaked in a few rehashes very cleverly by utilizing the characters and the dialogue  to do it with, circumventing the problem that rehashing brings out in my reading enjoyment, This was a great weekend read and allowed me to kind of get away after a rough week.For me what is becoming a real trademark when I read her books is the quality of editing and formatting which to me is as important as the story line as I can't relax and enjoy a book that is not at this level of professionalism,  In otherwords this is a first rate book written by a first rate author who knows what a reader wants and delivers in spades.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R852E4CLI4TK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4BDZT8#wasThisHelpful","R852E4CLI4TK0","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

LOL that would be the ultimate understatement for this raw, well developed story line.The characters were very real of course I think that Author Ethan Holmes has a real knack for character development that include characters who are rich in pathos and subtext. He also remembers that even in the most stressful moments humans tend to get by with their sense of humor. ,.It's not a short or a long read it seems to be the right amount of space used up for the story no draggy spots or where did that come from kind of moment, I did like the fact that I could relate to alot of the geographic regions I'm on the left coast.Overall I thought it was a well researched scary kind of possiblity book that was entertaining and had some substance","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R53WBZ80JCYOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZK5RGO#wasThisHelpful","R53WBZ80JCYOK","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okey Dokey totally creeped out and I mean that in the best way whoa what a book of a book. Here is the thing I had nothing to do all last weekend and needed to kick it up a notch so decided this was the genre I needed to read. Had no clue I would find a book that sucked me in and had me screeching out loud. Not to mention leaping from bed to as close to the bathroom door I could get just in case . . . there was something under my bed. LOLIt was that gripping my dog even felt the intensity from me and huddled down closer in bed which for him to get closer well I didn't know it was possible he is now a part of my femur.But seriously besides being terrifyingly fabulous a few notes dialogue absolute perfection and does what it should do explores the pathos and subtext of the character so the reader can better understand him or her. In addition Author Christian Masters has a sense of humor that is ironic and irreverent and of course I'm a girl who loves both.So overall did not miss anything staying at home last weekend except sleep Saturday night but I've missed that before and not had nearly as much fun as I did reading this book. I recommend it highly you will not be disappointed, terrified yes disappointed no.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IYVF7B1Q82Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKZOFW4#wasThisHelpful","R1IYVF7B1Q82Q1","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Ann Gimpel shows exactly why she is a future up and comer in the Mystery, Suspense, Horror Genre her characters are spot on and the story line is unique and well researched. Don't want to give spoilers away but suffice it to say the success of a story like this depends on the research of the author just my opine.In the area of believable writing in a complex and scientific choice of plot lines Gimpel hits this one out of the park. In addition the necessary technical information is broken down to sound more like a really cool professor giving you the information in a creative and nail biting style.  Keeping the reader fully engaged regardless of the level of technical information.The dialogue brings the characters into focus and makes them human and susceptible to any number of frailities and weakness built in around a subtle strength of the unique and interesting woman who takes center stage throughout the book Glory is quite a girl to get to know whose sense of spirit stays with her throughout all the transitions for lack of a better word she goes through.This is book one and written with a solid eye on the upcoming series that I personally will be reading as soon as they are out great book incredible writing job and well done on the editing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUH4YRJL83KS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VXAL2BC#wasThisHelpful","R3MUH4YRJL83KS","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not your standard fantasy it is off beat, funny whimsical and well written. I am so impressed with Author M.R. Mathias with this fifth installment of his well read series around our house. It really is a group enjoyment both my husband and myself find it to be a great book to discuss on our commute into town or hanging out in the garden.What stands out the most is the flavor and style of the story and of course the characters who break through stereotypes of Fantasy cast members. Because it is such a visually written book for me it was more like watching a film open in front of my eyes.I also like the way the dialogue added to the subtext and pathos of the characters which allowed a closer look at what for some could be SOP in the fantasy genre, I hate plot spoilers so none in this review but suffice it to say there is a plot and it moves quickly and efficiently.At no point, will you scratch your head and wonder how the characters or you got where you are, Mathias is spot on in his editing and the formatting is a piece of art.

This was a natural extension for me when I found it hidden among the other offerings of the book site.I really enjoyed the back history of the principle characters making you see from another perspective why the characters might have reacted as they did with the original. I was particularly glad Author Denise O'Hara stayed true to the characters and rather than try to build a better mouse trap with them. Took the blueprints and ran with subtext and pathos to not change but introduce growth.The first person style is not for everyone but it didn't bother me I thought there was so much more to the story than that it was enchanting and interesting.

I remember Jodi being the guy who steals your girl when you are away in VietNam.The characters in this book are ones anyone who lived the late 60's would recognize from their neighborhood they are well defined and full of pathos and subtext. The dialogue is first rate and assist the reader as it moves the storyline forward in a comprehensive way. Rather than a bunch of boring, endless narrative.I liked the way the story unfolded rather than being shoved down your throat giving you time to savor and enjoy like a good wine or weed of the era. LOL. It is on task for creating the mood and the ambiance of that time in history and in capturing the quirky characters who were just learning to express themselves and breakout of society's mold.For those not around then fear not you will enjoy the compelling story line and artful writing of Authors Rob Kop and Dan Doyle, the editing is excellent and the formatting is done to perfection adding to the pleasure of this little jewel. I think everyone will enjoy the book but for those of you who lived it get ready for a great ride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VSID5HNXOS2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0M0DYY#wasThisHelpful","R1VSID5HNXOS2O","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"They should hand out a copy of this book with every member of the military who is getting discharged. What a great contribution for Vets who are ready after serving their country with bravery, valor and commitment want to take advantage of the benefits available. We all know it entitles them to a college education and the funding for Veterans is the easy part, relatively speaking.The tough part is all the other details that go along with that decision, what will they be and how to take advantage of opportunities that are available to them. Kenneth A. Bracewell breaks it down in simple easy to comprehend language. Tips and Tricks might be a more apt title of this little jewel of information.Through his real life struggle he shares his heartbreaks and his victories and at the end of the day is always the one that finishes at the top of the pile through dogged determination, guts and a little finesse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQPF1YUJEN3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBYERIA#wasThisHelpful","R1VQPF1YUJEN3C","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really have to admit I'm a romance junkie and there is nothing I love more than finding a new author to put on my list. Lisa Shadow has officially made the list after this read. She has managed in an over full category to stand out from the crowd with this book. Firstly you can tell she spent a lot of time with the plotting and flow of the story line. Not a glitch in the book and I would notice I see all the flaws in films books are no exception flow problems jump up and bite me.The characters are strong and well developed more importantly she does not inundate you mind with all the different faucets of their personality in one paragraph. Rather she introduces and then for lack of a better work unveils their quirks and pathos slowly, like a dance of the vails.  Up until the last page of the book I was learning things I didn't know.I also like the way the dialogue helps to move the story line forward so there is not page after page of narrative that becomes a blur and frankly makes me scan. For me the scan is the kiss of death for any book. I did not scan one sentence it held my attention throughout. Author Shadow also built a lot of tension that ebbed and flowed until the final big bang. No spoilers from this reviewer suffice it to say from page one forward it is a roller coaster of a ride.Overall the editing was good always nice to see and the formatting held together great job on the technical end as nothing ruins a good book like bad formatting. Just happens to be my buggyboo. Overall I would say great pathos, great subtext and marvelous absolutely marvelous characters I will be reading more of Lisa Shadow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YH0TQUZQYULS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WCSGOOE#wasThisHelpful","R1YH0TQUZQYULS","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great story for a weekend read when you want to get away from the madness of reality and spend a little time somewhere else with someone else doing anything but what your nine to five Monday through eternity. That is where I found my self last weekend and after glancing through the look inside I made a decision and hit the button. There was no going back LOL.The characters are quite unique and have an irreverent sense of humor, between each other. The story either works or not based on the two main characters  who while much different have a few key values that are the same. I think the relationship between them works because of the balance Author Lana Axe has achieved with them the ying and yang if you will.I enjoyed the way the characters were revealed not all at once but slowly like a dance of the seven veils with the removal of each veil so to speak a little more came into focus. The dialogue was great and not at all robotic or stilted. The whole story line flowed like melted butter. There is no point that stands out in my mind rather the whole story comes to mind when I think back on the book.This was my first book read by Lana Axe but it won't be my last great job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWWEXOBT8D2E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKBZS5Q#wasThisHelpful","RWWEXOBT8D2E6","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For starters just let me say this is a book among books if you are into Sci Fi Fantasy and tough determined may I say ass kicking female heroines. I loved this book. I'm not even sure where to begin this review there is so much I want to share without giving all the good stuff away. So let me just say the characters are well written and detailed. Not boring details to fill up space but incredibly detailed as in lots of food for the imagination.The dialogue is fast paced and helps move the story line forward in a cohesive manner without the reader being bored out of their mind with a bunch of narrative that puts you to sleep. Rather the dialogue punctuates the action and helps define where you are and who you are with in the story line. Besides that it also gives you a glimpse or two of the subtext of the characters and where they are coming from within the story and as they relate to each other.I think author Ann Gimpel is delightfully witty with moments of laugh out loud humor, not the stand up comedy pretentious humor instead a funny  and jaded humor that feels just right for the overall story. She is a bit egocentric with some of the characters and that is not a bad thing. There is no heavy handed irony it all just sort of flows into one very cool read.The characters by the way are full of wonderful pathos and quirks that make reading them a delightful journey not to mention the incredible and concise detail of the alternate universe she creates. Everything about this book from page one to the end is well written and purposeful. No meandering prose or unnecessary violence or drama. It's all perfectly placed in an impeccably edited story. Great formatting adds to the enjoyment of the book. This was my first Ann Gimpel book but it won't be my last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AC5MD3X2GWAJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U4BDTKS#wasThisHelpful","R3AC5MD3X2GWAJ","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AB Bradley has really gotten the party started with this first book in a new series. As a series aficionado I search Amazon for just this kind of book. One that the writer has the skill to pull of this big of a projet without annoying me LOL.The female Mara is strong and sure of herself but not at the price of looseing a very good soul that is grounded and certain of what she believe's in, confident in what she knows has to be done to make it happen.The alternate Universe is well written with no gaps in the planning and creation which is a pleasant change. I also like that the main characters are not perfet and have plenty of space to grow into who they are in upcoming sequels.This is the kind of story a girl can wrap her heart and brain around with action, adventure and excitement. The action is well palaced and does not appear to be dropped in at an opportune moment. Rather is there in an organic way that feels natural and right.Would recommend with a five for any and all Series Lovers looking for a little fantasy/action with a whole bunch of adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDMPB28HIP2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQUV2YG#wasThisHelpful","R3TDMPB28HIP2C","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Ava Archer Payne has brought together some well written characters added killer dialogue that both adds to the character developoment as well as assisting her in moving the plot line ahead so that the story does not get bogged down in boring narrative. The characters are ones you can identify with especially if you are a college age or young adult.I will say it is a bit steamy so if you have issues with the New Adult Romance style of the younger hipper authors be forewarned that said there is nothing out of line. The ""hot"" scenes are not dropped into the middle of a chapter with no rhythm or reason. Each word and deed in this book serve a purpose. It is a very organized well written and structured lay out. The formatting is done nicely as well,The author nailed current day standards and it is a relevant book that will hold the attention of people who are well versed in the genre of Romance/Suspense and those who are taking a walk on the wild side for the first time. You can tell the exuberance of the writer for her craft. The book is at times written in the first person which is a nice break from the standard he said she said style of romance.Over all it was a great story with imperfect and readable characters that you could really sink your teeth into and cheer on. Pathos and subtext are introduced at just the right spot to either show dimension of the character or help define a scene that would be unclear without the little known or used technique in most current books being offered in this genreI'm giving this a five star as it is entertaining, at times a little scary and enjoyable every minute of the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R303HFRKAFV440/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VOLIECA#wasThisHelpful","R303HFRKAFV440","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do a lot of reading it is for sure one of my favorite pastimes, I like being sucked into the story with this book trust me, you're dropped smack dab in the middle of it, from soup to nuts. Author Edward V'Kanty has set up the story line so that you become a member of the jury if you will. Sort of like a virtual ""You We're There"" concept. It adds a new twist to reading a book based on historical data and imagination.I found the journal entries fascinating and began to see just what a changing moment this little known historical event was for the state of origin. Often times living in the shadow of the Salem Witch Hunts that has taken center stage over time. This period in history happening long before anyone heard of the town of Salem.Author V'Kanty writings are professional and well done the dialogue that is not of historical record is well written and serves to move the plot line along with no confusion or boring narrative. Exaiming the patho's, subtext and mood of the period. This is a really scary book by the way just my opinion. The descriptions are visual and realistic.I'm giving this book a five for everything it is and nothing it isn't","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFMHOJNPE7H9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP33BDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3GFMHOJNPE7H9","A2FO5R2D6DCZMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FO5R2D6DCZMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a brief prologue to this novel, an English clergyman named Chrysostom Trueman tells how he found the manuscript we are about to read sealed in a metal box encased in the stone of a meteorite that buried itself in his garden one night. It is the story of a pair of young men, Stephen Howard (the manuscript's author) and Carl Geister, who built a spacecraft and journeyed to the moon. Finding themselves unable to return, they shared their remarkable story by placing the manuscript in a metal case and dropping it into a lunar volcano just as it was about to erupt.Howard describes how he discovered a 17th century manuscript in which a Spanish monk relates an expedition into the uncharted mountains of New Spain. Besieged by hostile natives, the Spaniards dig a moat and erect a barricade in front of the cave where they have taken shelter. Suddenly a portion of their barricade simply flies up into the air and disappears.When Howard tells his friend Geister about the monk's tale, Geister immediately conjectures that the Spaniards have stumbled upon an outcropping of minerals which, when mixed, acquire the property of repelling the force of gravity. Geister eventually locates the minerals near what would now be the southwest corner of New Mexico, and resolves to use this discovery as the means to realize his long held dream of flying to the moon.Anti-gravity material had already been used to propel spacecraft in several previous 19th century novels. What the anonymous author adds to the genre is the means of providing fresh air for the long voyage to the moon and back (realizing that there may be no breathable air on the moon itself). Geister's spaceship, the ""Lunaviot,"" is a huge, self-sustaining biosphere which its builders nickname the ""Flying Greenhouse."" We are even shown the equations by which Geister computed the amount of soil and vegetation needed to sustain two travelers.In previous science fiction novels the moon (or other previously unexplored world) is the setting for one of two things: a farcical satire or a utopian discourse. The History of a Voyage to the Moon is of the latter category; the author even uses the term ""Utopia."" But this moon is not so much a model community as a Garden of Eden where the reincarnated souls of those who had suffered tragic lives on earth could have a second chance at happiness. It is a world devoid of disease, hunger, violence and jealousy. The theology behind this lunar paradise is rather vague, but there is no suggestion whatsoever that we could remake our own world after its pattern. It could only be the work of God.Up to the point when our adventurers reach and crash-land on the moon, theirs is an adventure story worthy of the pen of a Jules Verne or Edgar Rice Burroughs, and I couldn't help but wonder why it wasn't more widely known. The problem is that the people of the moon are constitutionally disposed to be perpetually happy just making music and painting landscapes. Good for them. But reading about an unchanging world devoid of conflict, romance or danger is, frankly, dull and pointless. It's a shame that the author wasted such a promising beginning on a story that falls so flat in the end.(Note that the pseudonymous author's first name is spelled ""Chrysostom"" in the book itself. The ebook ""cover"" spells it ""Crystostom"" (deleting the H and adding a T). Amazon's catalog listing adds another O, spelling it ""Cryostostom."")","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4UX4NSF1RYZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGDYGGE#wasThisHelpful","R4UX4NSF1RYZ8","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Star is a unique and remarkable work of utopian fiction--the epic history of another world. ""Star"" is the name of that planet, and while it is awkward in English translation to have a planet named Star, this was not a problem in the original French (where it is ""Star"" and not ""Étoile""). The author, Charles Ischir Defontenay, was a physician and a pioneer of plastic surgery. Star is his only known work of fiction.A prologue describes how the manuscript we are about to read fell to earth in the Himalayas enclosed in a metal box which was encased in a meteorite. After years of deciphering and translation, it proved to be the proud history of the planet Star and its inhabited moons. It is a history presented in several forms. Prose narrative alternates with verse, and there are two complete plays embedded in the work as well as a lengthy prose poem.The Starian solar system is very different from ours in that it has four suns. There is a large central star comparable in size and brightness to our own sun. A much smaller sun orbits it closely, a third shines from beyond the orbit of Star, and a fourth tiny sun circles the planet Star itself. ""Four suns of diverse size and coloration, four bowers of celestial light, enamel the sky and sparkle from different points on the horizon."" With each sun a different color, rising and setting in complex patterns and combinations of infinite variety, the landscape of Star is an ever-changing kaleidoscope of tints and shadows. Its firmament is also adorned with four large moons, one of which is translucent: ""Elier is the diamond in which all the fires of suns, moons and stars play, cross each other and are reflected."" The beauty of its sky is echoed in the vegetation and animal life of Star and in the language in which it is all described by Defontenay.The people of Star are human, but there are races which differ fundamental ways. On one moon, for example, the people are all hermaphrodites. On another they are transparent (as is everything else), and on a third moon the inhabitants are immune to aging and disease, but ""Death"" haunts them in the form of a species of corporeal predators. In this last society the greatest heroes are those who have done battle with the Deaths, killing them by the score before succumbing. Did Defontenay the physician picture himself as one of their number?These human variations and the history of their development are the vehicles the author uses to present his ideas on society. Early in their history the Starians dispense with religion, replacing it with a cult of beauty that venerates the marvels of nature and works of art. They allow no family to own more land than it can cultivate, and thereby control covetousness and eliminate class distinctions. Without the stress of religion and class, they are able to eliminate war and all forms of civic violence. Orphans, the disabled, and the aged are generously supported by the community out of a sense of pride and duty. The more prosperous Starians channel their wealth into the sponsorship and collection of art. It is art, in fact, which becomes the supreme goal and symbol of Starian civilization.There is a dark side--from our perspective at least--to Defontenay's utopia. The Repleus are a race of sub-humans described as being to Starians what the donkey is to the horse. They are capable of speech and understanding, even love, but, left to themselves, descend into savagery. They are the ones who do the menial and unpleasant tasks while the Starians pursue the arts and sciences. Did Defontenay mean to suggest that a European utopia could be built on a the basis of keeping other races in perpetual servitude?Defontenay's science is a mixed bag when it comes to plausibility, though clearly some of his concepts (like the transparent world) were meant to be allegorical rather than practical. His conception and description of a multiple star system are marvelous optically and aesthetically, if not astronomically. Starians travel between their planet and its moons on ""abares,"" ovoid vehicles containing their own air supply and plated with a material that is opaque to gravity. (This was not a new idea. An American, George Tucker, had written of it in 1827. H. G. Wells would imagine a similar space vehicle almost 50 years later in The First Men in the Moon). And Defontenay wrote the following five years BEFORE Darwin published On the Origin of the Species: ""Their first moralists and philosophers attributed the original creation or generation of mankind to ancient transformations of animal species, that happened when some individuals, by chance, gave birth to superior types which formed a new stock.""In a concluding poem to this beautifully written book, Defontenay writes:Myself, I’d much rather see the intuitionAmong us of destinies which, in future eras,Will send us soaring toward celestial shoresAnd will, at last, lead us in our migrationsFrom one globe to the next as so many stationsTo the Heaven foreseen by the inspired soul,Where humanity, transfigured and beautiful,Will find voluptuousness, perfection, joy.And he closes with this apology:Under a great subject I bow almost crushed:But what does that matter!If I’ve done badly, I’ve attempted much.Much indeed! If only he had written more. Star is not a novel with plot and characters, but it is a thoughtful and poetic work of fiction that will appeal to those who enjoy books such as Last and First Men by Olaf Stapledon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16TF6PWI65NJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0066DKIMK#wasThisHelpful","R16TF6PWI65NJ6","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Brunist Day of Wrath is a sequel to Robert Coover's very first novel, The Origin of the Brunists, which he published in 1966. The sequel is set in the same place, a run-down mining town named West Condon somewhere in the American Midwest. It has many of the same characters and takes place five years later.In The Origin of the Brunists there is a coal mine explosion at West Condon which kills dozens of men and traps almost a hundred miners. Only one of the trapped miners is found alive, a man named Giovanni Bruno, and he appears to have suffered brain damage. But his seemingly miraculous survival, and the cryptic nature of the few words he manages to speak, lead to the founding of a new apocalyptic cult of Christian evangelicals, the Brunists. They see the mine disaster as the first step in the coming end of the world.Now, in The Brunist Day of Wrath, the Brunist sect has spread nation-wide, and many of its members are converging on West Condon for the fifth anniversary of the rescue of Giovanni Bruno and the founding of the church. But along with them comes a loosely associated motorcycle gang calling itself The Wrath of God, and they are descending upon a town already riven by ethnic divisions and a local power struggle.The events in The Origin of the Brunists are key to what happens in the sequel, but they are recapped so that you do not need to have read it--or read it recently--to enjoy the later work. But I do recommend that you read The Origin of the Brunists first if at all possible. The Brunist Day of Wrath is 1100 pages long. If you're going to invest that much time and effort in a book, why would you not want to read its 400 page predecessor so you can get as much enjoyment out of it as possible?There is a large cast of characters, and the novel shifts the point of view every chapter--and often within chapters--so as to tell the story from every possible side. One character, a brash college student named Sally Elliott, can be considered the author's voice. She makes a study of the Brunist cult with particular attention to the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance--holding beliefs that contradict each other or the observed facts. Her observations apply to all religions, not just to extreme sects like the Brunists.The events in The Origin of the Brunists were plausible, if unlikely. That isn't the case with the sequel, which is way over the top in violence, sex, and general craziness. It can be read as a searing satire of religion and the ignorance which nurtures it, but the novel is more than that. Its constantly shifting points of view show us the same events from different perspectives, demonstrating that what we call ""facts"" are simply impressions built upon the observer's preconceptions and biases. The road from ""facts"" to ""truth"" is a difficult path for which logic alone may not suffice. A saying repeated in the novel is that when you stretch things, they become more transparent, and sometimes it is necessary to stretch the truth to see it better. So the novel, in this sense, is a massive justification of itself and of the craft of fiction as a path to understanding.The Brunist Day of Wrath is a huge and hugely entertaining work filled with memorable characters and insightful observations about religion and human nature. It is a deeply humanistic work that is sympathetic to even its most violent and ignorant characters as products of their environment. If this turns out to be Robert Coover's final novel, it will have been a worthy culmination of his career.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CP4SWI8VTR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IS9B36K#wasThisHelpful","R1CP4SWI8VTR3","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cervantes considered The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda to be his best work, and for at least the first century after its publication most readers agreed with him, even though his Don Quixote had been highly popular.The story follows a brother and sister named Periandro and Auristela as they make a much-interrupted pilgrimage from somewhere in northern Europe to Rome. We learn immediately that these aren't their real names, however, and that they are actually a betrothed couple. Auristela has made a vow to make this pilgrimage to the seat of the Catholic church before she gives herself to Periandro, though their reasons for concealing their identities and relationship is not revealed until the final chapters of the novel.The novel consists of a series of adventures and encounters as the pair (who are often involuntarily separated) travel mostly by sea from the islands of the far north to Lisbon, then overland through Portugal, Spain and France to Italy. The opening chapters are especially chaotic, as every ship they board is either wrecked or taken by pirates. And at every turn they meet other travelers or exiles who have their own stories to tell. One castaway, for example, had been kidnapped in Italy and flown to the northern wastes on a magic carpet by a witch who turns out to have been a werewolf. There are also sea monsters, sorcerers, and cannibals. Cervantes drew much of his inspiration from the History of the Northern Peoples, published in 1555 by Olaf Mansson (also written as Olaus Magnus), and his descriptions of Scandinavia are bizarre to say the least.Once the travelers reach Portugal the adventures into which they stumble are more conventional, usually involving jealous lovers or girls running away from forced marriages. Auristela stirs up quite a bit of jealousy herself, because she is the most beautiful woman in the world, according to the narrator. Periandro is also extraordinarily good-looking as are all the young people who have become their friends along the way and are taking the pilgrimage with them. Their physical beauty reflects both their noble birth and their goodness. As one character put it: ""Never, or very rarely, do high virtues find a place in lowborn people, and the beauty of the body is often an indication of the beauty of the soul.""The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda is a product of the Catholic Counter-Reformation. We are told repeatedly that the northern countries have fallen into error and heresy, and Catholicism is no longer perfectly practiced or understood. Auristela is making the pilgrimage to perfect her understanding of the Catholic religion. The novel is both pious and patriotic, as Cervantes never fails to praise the Church or his native country. Though the novel is sprinkled with wit, it is on the whole a serious work with a message that was designed to endear Cervantes to the establishment.For modern readers there are some subtle themes running through the book that make it worth study. One of them is Cervantes's curious treatment of sexuality. When we first meet Periandro and Auristela they are each dressed as the opposite sex (and each considered remarkably attractive in such guise). There are several other episodes of cross-dressing in the novel. The name ""Periandro"" itself suggests an uncertain gender, and Auristela is not the only female character to assume an assertive role while a male takes the passive. There is even a confession of lesbian love.Another undercurrent is found in the author's repeated comments on the nature of narrative itself. Cervantes not only tells us the story, but also tells us how he is telling it and why. He frequently digresses on the art of storytelling and at one point even asserts that books teach us more than reality. ""But lessons learned in books often teach us more about things than is known by people who have actually seen them, since a person who reads with care thinks over and over again about what he's reading, while a person who looks without paying attention observes nothing, and so reading can, indeed, surpass seeing.""As a novel The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda can not begin to compare, of course, with Don Quixote. There is no development of characters--they are perfect from beginning to end--and its message is a product of the religious climate of a different age. But it is a novel by Cervantes, and that means it is peppered with his wit, wisdom and invention. The translation I read by Weller and Colahan did an excellent job of preserving the atmosphere of a 17th century text while using clear, modern English, and was enhanced by very useful end notes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FDF0I3PB35YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0872209709#wasThisHelpful","R1FDF0I3PB35YQ","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sex! The Punctuation Mark of Life is an autobiographical work focusing entirely on the author's sex life. Its purpose is to present ""real stories with real men, and women... not some made up fantasy that is highly improbable,"" to demonstrate that sex is not only fun, but is important to our physical, emotional and spiritual health. She condemns the ""puritan, or guilt-ridden point of view"" that only ""leads to more perversions and addictions."" The stories are taken from her own life, are presented in chronological order, and appear to have been fictionalized only to the point of disguising the identities of Torva's sex partners.The stories span the author's entire adult life from age 18 to the very recent past (she is now in her 50s). Most of the episodes deal with her first experience with a particular sex act or combination of partners, including bisexuality and group sex, and are quite explicit. Romance is noticeably absent. With only a single exception, her encounters are with casual acquaintances or, more recently, with men and women whom she meets via the Adult FriendFinder dating service. She limits herself to one or two meetings with any single partner to avoid stale, long-term attachments. Torva promotes sex as a form of recreation like bridge or tennis, not as the culmination of a love affair.Unfortunately the author's message is clouded by some of the few details she gives us about her life outside of the bedroom. She had two failed marriages followed by a long period of dependency on anti-depressants. She needs alcohol to release her inhibitions before having sex, and not long ago was celibate by choice for several years. These admissions seem to contradict her claim that an adventurous sex life has brought her emotional and spiritual well-being, or at least to beg for further explanation. Still, she makes a good point when she says ""I feel that I need to be uncomfortable with regularity whether it's about sex or business or art or whatever. I don't grow without being uncomfortable.""The language in which the book is written is youthful, casual and conversational. Interjections like ""Tee hee!"" and ""Yum!"" aren't to my taste, but some readers will enjoy them. What I found more objectionable is that the author includes only her adventures where everything goes perfectly, so while these may be ""real stories"" they aren't all that different from the ""made up fantasy"" of flawless bodies and uninhibited pleasure typical of most erotic fiction. Getting drunk and going off to have sex with a stranger, as she does more than once, is also not a wise thing for a woman to do. So while this book's ideal audience may be a young person who needs some erotic instruction or a pep talk on getting the most out of his or her sex life, it could lead both to inflated expectations and risk-taking if taken too seriously. The author's claims regarding the therapeutic value of recreational sex may be true, but her memoir is best treated as erotic entertainment only.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T6CKAYEWGZWE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7XX526#wasThisHelpful","R3T6CKAYEWGZWE","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who has read Don Quixote should recognize the name Amadis of Gaul. He was Quixote's role model as the perfect example of a chivalrous knight-errant. By the time Cervantes wrote his novel, the story of Amadis had been in print in Spanish for over a century, and parts of it in a more primitive form had existed in Spanish and other languages since the 14th century. Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo collected and translated the early Amadis texts--which consisted at the time of three books--modified them and added a fourth book entirely of his own invention. He died in 1504, leaving his Amadis to be published posthumously in 1508.The story of Amadis takes place at a time several generations before that of King Arthur. There is still a Roman Empire, as well as a Byzantine Empire, but Great Britain, Gaul and Spain are independent kingdoms. The tale begins with the meeting of Amadis's parents, King Perion of Gaul and Princess Elisena of Brittany. They have a secret moonlight tryst, then separate. Elisena becomes pregnant as a result, but manages to hide her condition from her parents. When she gives birth to Amadis, her maid takes the baby, puts him in a boat along with a note, a ring and a sword, and shoves him out to sea. He is found (of course), and reared by foster parents in Scotland who call him just ""Child of the Sea."" Years later Amadis's parents actually get married, but Elisena doesn't tell her husband about the child she bore and abandoned.The Child of the Sea, having remarkable good looks, physical prowess and moral rectitude, desires nothing more than to become a knight. He finds a patron in King Lisuarte of Great Britain, and falls madly and permanently in love with the king's daughter Oriana. Just as Amadis is the most perfect knight in the world, Oriana is the most beautiful woman in the world. Amadis goes on one adventure after another, fighting other knights, rescuing captives, slaying giants, and doing battle with a fire-breathing monster. Along the way his parentage is disclosed, he learns his real name, and he finds that he has two brothers--both of them exemplary knights. His travels take him to the shores of Bohemia and the isles of Romania (obviously Montalvo's geography was a little fuzzy) and as far as Constantinople. He is aided from time to time by the mysterious sorceress Urganda the Unknown, and tangles more than once with her arch-enemy Arcalus the Enchanter.Amadis pines constantly for his lady love, Oriana, who loves him just as much in return. They keep their affections secret from all but their closest friends, but when chance gives them a night together they make the most of it. Oriana gets pregnant, secretly bears a son named Esplandian, and in trying to hide him accidentally loses him in the woods where he is nursed by a lioness, then reared by a hermit. He is destined, as we are told many times, to become an even greater knight than Amadis and eventually Emperor of Constantinople.The overriding theme of Amadis of Gaul is the institution of knight-errantry. A knight is expected to go in search of adventures which will add to his glory and honor. His first duty is to help maidens and matrons in need, but he is also to aid and defend the poor and downtrodden of either gender. He is devoutly religious and displays proper Christian virtues, but he fights for personal glory, not the glory of the Church. He also seeks to be worthy of his lady love, if he should have one. Those knights who do not have a lady are free to enjoy the bed of any willing maiden, but once a knight-errant has fallen in love--even if it is his own secret--he must be true to his lady, no matter how many years it will take him to win her. A knight's martial prowess reflects his moral worth, for God would not have made him strong unless he were good. This leads to a system of justice based on trial by combat. Even a beauty contest is decided by a joust, with the damsel whose champion emerges victorious being crowned most beautiful.Knights-errant usually go about in full armor with their helmets secured, thus keeping their identity hidden. Inevitably this leads to several accidental battles between brothers, fathers and sons, etc. Amadis especially seems to make a fetish of secrecy, using assumed names on most of his adventures. (One wonders how he expects to earn glory if no one knows who he is.) In this and other respects, knights-errant are the precursors of our modern-day fictional costumed superheroes. In their less noble aspects they resemble Wild West gunfighters.The first book of Amadis of Gaul consists of a series of loosely connected short adventures, some of which readers of Arthurian legends will easily recognize as having been borrowed from the exploits of Lancelot, Parzival, Tristan and Gawain. The second and third books, however, appear to have been heavily re-written by Montalvo to weave Amadis's adventures and those of his friends and brothers into a larger, more coherent story. The author keeps several quests going at once, shifting scenes to maintain the suspense. In the fourth book, which is Montalvo's own, action is on a much grander scale, as Amadis and Oriana are the focus of clash of empires.The novel regularly addresses several moral and emotional dilemmas. Are we obliged to sacrifice our personal honor for the general good or the welfare of our friends? (Amadis refuses to.) What do we do when our personal honor and our duty to our sovereign are at odds? (Amadis puts his pride before his king, and is praised for doing so.) And how do we handle that moment when we realize that we are past our prime and it is time to let the next generation take the spotlight?The writing in Amadis of Gaul is the least stylized and formulaic of any of the romances of chivalry I have read. This is not to say that it is the best, or that the language is modern, but that the dialog and feelings of the characters are the most natural, and the actions are the most believable. This is especially true of the many combat scenes. Montalvo writes like a man who has been there. Every joust and every battle is distinctly different and filled with believable and vivid detail.Montalvo followed up his Amadis with a volume called The Exploits of Esplandian (which he shamelessly plugs throughout Book IV). Other writers of various nationalities followed it up with their own sequels until, by Don Quixote's time, the Amadis franchise consisted of at least 24 volumes. The sequels, however, are markedly inferior to the original four books of Montalvo's as Cervantes himself tells us in Don Quixote. The only complete modern English translation is the edition in two volumes by Edwin Place and Herbert Behm, which is the one I am reviewing. It appears to be a very literal translation, preserving the occasional long and ornate phase at the expense of readability. For a work of such size and antiquity, there are surprisingly few explanatory notes or other aids. Robert Southey's 1803 translation is also widely available, but the prudish poet removed the few references to sexual activity and the female body, as well as some moral asides by Montalvo that he thought were boring. Southey's translation was published in three volumes, but it does contain all four original books. Sue Burke is publishing a translation of Amadis of Gaul on her blog in biweekly installments, but is only about half finished. If you want to sample the story, you can do so at [...].I found Amadis of Gaul to be often entertaining and occasionally moving or suspenseful even though the leading characters, as is typical of medieval romances, are unbelievably perfect. It would certainly be more widely read if it were shorter, but its length of 1400+ pages no doubt has intimidated translators, publishers and readers alike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICFL0QCNKB01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGVN1RW#wasThisHelpful","R2ICFL0QCNKB01","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Origin of the Brunists is a novel which uses bizarre events to illuminate the lives and ideals of commonplace people. It is set in the 1960s in the town of West Condon, somewhere in the American Midwest. West Condon is a blue collar town with a high proportion of Italian immigrants. Its chief source of livelihood is a single coal mine, Deepwater Number 9, but the coal industry is in decline, and so is the town. A few days after New Years, tragedy strikes: There is an explosion in the mine. Hundreds of panicked workers rush for the exits. Most make it out alive, but 98 are trapped. Days later, rescuers reach the trapped miners. All are dead from burns or asphyxiation but one, Giovanni Bruno, and he is comatose.When Bruno regains consciousness, his first words are of having been saved by an apparition in the form of a white bird. His vision seems to coincide with that of another miner, a Nazarene minister, who left a cryptic dying message for his wife. A local mystic sees these visions as confirmation of spiritual messages she has received prophesying the end of the world. Before long, a cult is born which calls itself the Brunists. Within weeks the cult's existence becomes an issue which tears at the social fabric of West Condon.Robert Coover tells this story through the eyes of a number of West Condon residents, but principally two: the skirt-chasing former athlete who now edits the town newspaper, and an aging mine foreman who fears he will never find work again if the mine doesn't reopen. The stress of the mine disaster and the cult seem to bring ordinary events into sharper focus: children rebel against their parents, teenagers clumsily explore sex, politicians and businessmen maneuver for power, ministers strive to control wavering congregations, husbands and wives have extramarital affairs, and gossip continuously feeds the fears, attitudes and prejudices of the community.The Origin of the Brunists is an outstanding novel which illuminates the individual lives of its characters to produce an excellent composite portrait of an American small town. Yet at the same time it also examines the psychology of religious cults and movements and shows us America's media culture in its formative stages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDW6LP7ECRXZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802137431#wasThisHelpful","RDW6LP7ECRXZ7","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Would you like to know the chief occupation in war, the only one that matters: I was afraid.""What sets Fear apart from most other autobiographical war novels is the author's stark and unapologetic admission that he was afraid, not just at the most intense moments of combat, but all the time. Nor was he in any way different from his fellow infantrymen. ""We were cowards and we knew it and we could be nothing else. The body was in charge and fear gave the orders.""The narrator of the novel, Jean Dartemont, is a 19-year-old student when he is called up for military service late in 1914. His initial feelings of mixed apprehension and curiosity soon turn to disgust for the mechanical and irrational aspects of military life. Nine months later, its training complete, Dartemont's unit is marched down endless dusty roads into the combat zone. ""We had just marched over the crest of a hill, and suddenly there before us lay the front line, roaring with all its mouths of fire, blazing like some infernal factory where monstrous crucibles melted human flesh into a bloody lava.""Dartemont serves the entire rest of the war as a private in the French infantry. His experiences run the gamut from front line combat, to boring rear area duty, to special assignments. At one point he is wounded, recuperates, spends a few days leave at home, and is then sent back to the front. The author's description of trench warfare is as intense, harrowing, and grisly as any you will find. Throughout it all there is fear, but most especially during intense artillery bombardments. ""Every explosion of the bombardment hits me in the chest. I am ashamed of the sick animal wallowing in filth that I have become, but all my strings have snapped. My fear is abject. It makes me want to spit on myself.""The narrator's attitude toward war and those who make it is equally frank. Speaking of the beginning of the war, he says ""In a few short days, civilisation was wiped out. In a few short days, all our leaders became abject failures. For their role, their only role that mattered, was precisely to prevent all this."" Dartemont also blames the Church for ""ordering me to kill my brothers,"" he blames women who insist that their sons and lovers come back as heroes, he blames flag-waving patriots who shame others into dying for empty causes like ""national honour,"" and he blames the industrialists who make war for profit. But ultimately the fault is with mankind itself. ""Men are sheep. This fact makes armies and wars possible.""Gabriel Chevallier did not publish his fictionalized war memoir until 1930, by which time memories of the horrors of war were fading into nostalgia and Europe was rearming for another war. His strident anti-war novel met with a cool reception, and was eventually removed from publication lest it impair French morale. Its subsequent obscurity is unfortunate, for Fear is one of the most powerful, vivid, and convincing war novels I have ever read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13M900J72QILG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065MBDRG#wasThisHelpful","R13M900J72QILG","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The World Set Free is considered the first published work, fiction or non-fiction, to mention the idea of the atomic bomb. The scientists who actually constructed such a bomb, some 31 years later, were very much aware of H. G. Wells's novel and the implications of nuclear war which the author had explored.But theorizing about nuclear war wasn't the author's chief purpose for writing the novel. He wanted to propose a new world order, ruled by scientific and socialist principles. He felt that society in the early twentieth century was still in a ""barbaric stage... aimless, untrained and unorganized to the pitch of imbecility."" The trigger getting mankind to recognize its folly and embark upon the Modern State would be the War to End All Wars, a nuclear war.Ironically, The World Set Free was published in 1914 on the very eve of a war that H. G. Wells didn't see coming--at least not for decades. His one great war would not occur until the mid-1950s, by which time nuclear power had revolutionized life on earth by making energy virtually free. It is the discontent of the laboring classes such as coal miners whose jobs have been eliminated by nuclear power that eventually brings war about.The World Set Free is written in the form of a future work of history. Most of it is narration of events and discourse upon the principles upon which the new society is founded. There are a few characters brought in at different times to provide eyewitness accounts of events--a scientist, a soldier, a king, and an educator--but the novel is not about them.Wells does not attempt to predict the future of technology, and I don't think the novel should be harshly judged just because his 1956 is different from 1914 only in that atomic engines have replaced steam engines and gasoline motors. His atomic bombs, for example, are carried to the target in open cockpit biplanes. The observer/bombardier drops the bomb simply by pulling the fuse with his teeth and heaving it over the side. He signals to other airplanes with a megaphone and shoots at his enemies with a rifle.The atomic bombs which the author imagined are far removed from the eventual reality but, ironically, have much the same effect. They don't explode in a single blast, but erupt like miniature suns which keep on burning at an ever-diminishing level according to the radioactive element's half-life. It is a generation before the major cities of the world can be safely entered.The annihilation of 218 cities across the globe shocks the surviving leaders of the world into the realization that they must abandon pride, nationalism, materialism, and traditional prejudices. They meet in northern Italy and agree to form a single world government based on equality, universal suffrage, a common language and currency, standard education, and the complete renunciation of military force. Local traditions and religious practices are respected, but they conclude that ""There can be no real social stability or any general human happiness while large areas of the world and large classes of people are in a phase of civilisation different from the prevailing mass.""It almost seems that mankind awakes from the horror of war to find itself a new species. ""The peace between nations is also a peace between individuals. We live in a world that comes of age. Man the warrior, man the lawyer, and all the bickering aspects of life, pass into obscurity...."" Free energy and other scientific advances relieve some economic distress, but it's hard to see how Wells can be so optimistic. Further, he says ""The majority of our population consists of artists, and the bulk of activity in the world lies no longer with necessities but with their elaboration, decoration, and refinement.""The final chapters of the novel address the role of women in the new world. In a scenario where an elderly male educator is addressing two female medical personnel, it is ironically the women who need convincing that they should consider themselves equal to men. One of the women says, almost as if to defend her gender's subordinate position, that ""you could nearly write a complete history of the world without mentioning a woman's name."" But the educator responds: ""To think of yourselves as women is to think of yourselves in relation to men. You can't escape that consequence. You have to learn to think of yourselves — for our sakes and your own sakes — in relation to the sun and stars. You have to cease to be our adventure, Rachel, and come with us upon our adventures. ...""After two world wars and the failures of communism, and while violence, paranoia and militarism continue to dominate international relations, it is difficult to share H. G. Wells's optimism that a new world order is possible. He gives us an appealing utopian vision, but he doesn't show us a path for getting there except by plunging to the brink of self destruction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MKRMBU8PUIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082RZ8CI#wasThisHelpful","R15MKRMBU8PUIZ","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Atterley of New York, finding himself in the doldrums after the death of his wife, resolves in 1822 to undertake a sea voyage to the Far East on one of his father's merchant ships. In the Indian Ocean the ship is caught by a mighty cyclone and driven ashore somewhere in the Burmese Empire. Mistaking the Americans for their enemies the British, the Burmese take Atterley and the crew captive. Atterley is eventually placed under rather loose house arrest, which allows him to meet and befriend a reclusive Indian Brahman who lives in the nearby hills. One day the Brahman reveals an astonishing secret: he knows how to build a machine to fly to the moon, and has already been there and back twice.George Tucker was a Bermuda-born Virginian, a former Congressman, a friend of Thomas Jefferson and professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Virginia. In addition to A Voyage to the Moon he would publish a number of books on history, biography, economics and political philosophy. Ever since Utopia and Gulliver's Travels, the ""fantastic voyage"" genre had been a popular vehicle for political and social satire, as well as for Utopian conjectures. Tucker would cleverly use his lunar civilization to both satirize American culture and public life and to propose an ideal society.The moon vehicle Atterley and the Indian construct is a cube made of copper and reinforced against the vaccuum of space with iron bars. Its source of motive power is a metal discovered by the Brahman which, which separated from other ores, repels the gravitational force of the earth. He calls it lunarium because it is attracted to the moon to the same degree that it is repelled by the earth. The Indian has also discovered that lead has opposite properties, being repelled by the moon just as strongly as it is attracted to the earth. They bolt large plates and smaller spheres of these two element to the outside of their spacecraft in such a way that they can be released individually by a screw mechanism from inside the cabin. Dropping some of the lead allows to craft to ascend from the earth, and the attractive powers of lunarium automatically steers it toward the moon. When approaching the moon, the pilot drops lunarium so that his descent can be slowed by the remaining lead. The trip takes several days, so they carry compressed air in spherical tanks affixed to the outside of the craft.Tucker's spacecraft design is imminently practical, and would no doubt be workable if there were such a thing as lunarium. (The idea would be revisited decades later by H. G. Wells in The First Men in the Moon.) Likewise his description of the how the ascent path is affected by the earth's rotation, how the earth would look from space and from the moon's surface, and the effects of lower gravity on the moon are all completely accurate. In political matters the author's prescience is even more uncanny. He predicts that the United States would eventually span the North American continent, whereas the nations of South America would remain disunited and weakened by civil wars. He projects a population for the country in the early 21st century of ""three or four hundred millions"" with a declining birth rate, and said at that time the U.S. would be the most powerful nation on earth with Russia as its chief rival.The people that Atterley and the Brahman find on the moon are of our own species. This is because the moon was once part of the earth, it's separation leading to the formation of the Pacific Ocean. (This is a theory which some scientists still hold, but of course it would have happened long before the appearance of life on earth.)For the most part the lunarians are ridiculous people whose customs lampoon the fashions and political excesses of Tucker's native land. Some women, for example, dress completely in feathers, while others wear caged butterflies on their heads. The more daring and shapely moon maids wear dresses in which ""were inserted glasses like watch crystals, adapted to the form and size of the female bosom."" Religious sects eat only the worst part of plants and animals and think it superior to descend stairs by walking backwards.But there is one isolated community in one of the moon's circular valleys (craters) where everything has been designed for the best. Democracy is practiced without demagoguery, trade flourishes without poverty, each man and woman is educated at public expense to his or her full potential, religion has no place in public life, and criminals are reeducated rather than punished. One of the keys to this paradise is that the citizens have calculated exactly how many people their valley can optimally support, and have found the means to keep their population at that level. Atterley wonders how the lunarians can restrain the natural growth in population. The Brahman hints at birth control and says it is already secretly practiced in Asia, but in the United States it ""might do more harm than good to be made public, by removing one of the checks of licentiousness, where women are so unrestrained as they are with you.""As an adventure story, A Voyage to the Moon lacks suspense. Its satire is amusing at times, but not exceptional in any way. Tucker's utopian society is intriguing, chiefly for its pragmatism, but this is only a small portion of the novel. What I found most appealing about the novel was how astutely the author managed to foresee the future and to view his own world and his own culture as an outsider. The author also comes across as an affable, ingenious, iconoclastic and practical sort of man it would be a delight to know in person. I suspect there is a lot of Tucker's late friend and neighbor Thomas Jefferson in this novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDOA49WOXV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084AXRGW#wasThisHelpful","R2PDOA49WOXV4","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Denis Diderot was 34 years old and working on his famous Encyclopédie when he published, anonymously and illegally, his first work of fiction The Indiscreet Jewels. It is a bawdy satire of manners and morals of the French court under Louis XV, and attacks many of the arts and institutions of the time. King Louis is not, of course, mentioned by name in the novel, or we might never have heard from Diderot again. Instead the novel is set in the Congo in the year 1,500,000,003,200,001, and tells the story of the great sultan Mangogul and his magic ring.Mangogul (Louis XV) is married to Manimonbanda (Queen Marie), but like many diplomatic marriages it is without affection. Instead Mangogul bestows his love and attention on his mistress Mirzoza (Madame de Pompadour). One day he confesses that he is bored. He suspects the ladies of his court are up to all sorts of romantic intrigues, and he would love to hear the details, but he knows they'll never be honest about such things. Mirzoza suggests that the genie Cucufa may have a way to learn their secrets. Mangogul summons Cucufa with a clap.The genie appears and, on hearing Mangogul's request, presents him with a magic ring. It can make the wearer invisible and take him instantly to any place he wants to go. But more importantly, when pointed in the direction of a woman and turned a particular way, it can make the lady's jewel speak. And her jewel--that second set of lips beneath her petticoats--will always speak the truth about its experiences.Mangogul wastes no time in putting the ring to the test, both in private and in public, but even he--who expected to be scandalized--is shocked by what he hears. Could it by that not a single woman in the Congo is faithful to her husband or betrothed? Is there anyone who doesn't entertain a regiment of lovers? Mirzoza accepts Mangogul's bet that there is not a single example of fidelity and pure love in the kingdom (Mirzoza herself excepted).Meanwhile, the mysterious talking jewels have all the Congo astir. The Academy of Sciences debates the matter and concludes that is a phenomenon of celestial origin like the tides. Tests are conducted and demonstrations attempted, but to no avail. Nonetheless rumors take flight, and jewels that Mangogul hasn't even been near are accused of the most outlandish speeches. Nervous women flee the capital, and a brisk trade arises in devices their inventors claim will muzzle the voice of even the most loquacious jewel.While this is going on, Diderot inserts comments on a number of topics. The theater, he says, has degenerated to the point where everything is artificial and stylized. Actors can no longer adapt their meager talents to a role, and instead ""there was little hope that a play would be performed with any measure of success unless the characters were tailored to the defects of the actors."" This leads to a discussion of whether the arts, like the sciences, can build on the work of the past. There follows a debate on whether the arts are obliged to imitate nature, or whether obvious and intentional artificiality is acceptable.Like most satires, The Indiscreet Jewels has lost some of its bite over time, and many of the personalities and issues are unrecognizable by modern readers and must be explained by footnotes. Louis XV is depicted as a good-natured but mischievous overgrown adolescent easily bored by matters of state or intellectual topics. The heroine of the piece is Madame de Pompadour, wise beyond her tender years, compassionate but firm, and a brilliant patroness of the arts and sciences. Women in general--despite being ruthlessly humiliated by Mongogul and his ring--come off favorably in the novel as persons with their own identity, ideas and sexuality.This is a delightfully funny, offbeat and racy novel that both shows us life in the decadent French royal court and previews some of the ideas of one of the Enlightenment's most important thinkers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFAGSWYIT2A3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0941419835#wasThisHelpful","RFAGSWYIT2A3R","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Interim is the fifth novel in Dorothy Richardson's autobiographical opus Pilgrimage. It's a fairly short work and spans about eight months of the life of Miriam Henderson, Richardson's alter ego. True to its title, this is not a period of great change in Miriam's circumstances, but there is considerable development in her social life and outlook.At the beginning of the novel, Miriam is rather forlorn, saying things to herself like ""Life has passed me by; that is the truth. I am no longer a person."" And: ""Nobody knows me. I grow more and more unknown and more and more like what people think of me."" But change comes about when the rooming house in which she lives becomes a boarding house, and tenants begin to socialize every evening instead of staying alone in their rooms. Most of the tenants are young, single men--doctors and artists--who take an interest in Miriam. She, in turn, begins to grow in confidence and in her ability to express herself in public. The turning point comes one evening when Miriam more than holds her own in a friendly argument against three doctors. Yet it seems that Miriam still doesn't trust men enough to consider a closer type of relationship with one.Interim is not a novel that in any way stands on its own, and I found it the least interesting thus far of the series. Yet ironically it earned Richardson a much wider and international audience when it was serialized in the American magazine Little Review alongside Joyce's Ulysses. And while largely uneventful, it does contain some of Richardson's most beautiful language, such as this passage describing London as a storm approaches:""She set out from the house of friends to meet the darkened daylight . . . perhaps the sudden tapping of thunder-drops on her thin blouse. The street was a livid grey, brilliant with hidden sunlight.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA93ZXM1203WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YOSNU8#wasThisHelpful","RA93ZXM1203WL","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gabriel de Foigny was a French Franciscan monk who was defrocked at about age 36 for licentious behavior. He fled to Calvinist Geneva where he renounced Catholicism and took up a career teaching and writing. But his expectation that Protestant authorities would be more open-minded than Catholics was disappointed when he was persecuted for heretical ideas, drunkenness, and sexual misbehavior. His response to this was to write The Southern Land, Known, which is a very strange combination of utopia, dystopia, and religious allegory.The story is told by Nicholas Sadeur, who was born at sea to French parents but shipwrecked and orphaned by a storm off the Spanish coast. Sadeur is an hermaphrodite, with both male and female organs, but he self-identifies as a man (and I will follow the author's lead in using the male pronoun). As a young man, Sadeur is kidnapped by pirates. Their ship is wrecked, and he is rescued by merchants bound for the East Indies. After visits to the Congo and Madagascar, the merchant vessel is driven south and westward across the Indian Ocean. It, it turn, is wrecked not far from the shore of the rumored great southern continent, the Terra Australis, or Australia. Sadeur is the only survivor, and after battling giant carnivorous birds, he is taken in by the natives of this exotic land.The Australians are manlike, but eight feet tall with six fingers and toes and an occasional extra set of arms. Like Sadeur himself, they are all hermaphrodites--a fact easily ascertained because they wear no clothing. He later learns that his intersexuality, as well as the fact that he was washed ashore naked, saved his life. The Australians despise ""half men"" and consider clothing a form of blasphemy. They don't even need coats because Australia is a land of perfectly mild climate where it never even rains. Fruit is so plentiful (notwithstanding the lack of rain!) that the natives never need to work. They don't even have houses, since they sleep just fine on the open ground. Nor are they bothered by pests, since insects and disease are unknown in Australia.When it comes to the social, political and religious institutions of the Australians, it is difficult to tell at times whether Foigny wants us to admire the Australians for their peaceful efficiency, or laugh at them as parodies of Calvinism. In religion, for example, the Australians practice a form of pantheism that holds all life sacred, yet they make it a crime to discuss their religious beliefs, and they make desperate war against the neighboring kingdom of non-hermaphrodites. They hate their carefree lives so much that they almost always end them in ritual suicide--a practice so compelling that the law requires them to produce at least one offspring before they are allowed to kill themselves, otherwise the race would have long ago destroyed itself.Exactly how the Australians reproduce is another forbidden topic, and Sadeur never learns the answer even though he lives among them for 35 years. When Sadeur shows signs of sexual arousal, his hosts threaten to put him to death. There is a suggestion that the hermaphrodite condition of the narrator and the Australians may be a commentary on the poor treatment of women in Europe at that time. Sadeur ""was forced to admit that the great empire that the male had usurped over the female was rather a form of tyranny than a just cause.""Foigny's Australia is a carefree communist utopia, yet it is made carefree largely by impossibly benevolent surroundings and the absence of sexual tension. The inhabitants' response to their seemingly perfect existence is to despise it, yet by censorship and xenophobia they prevent any possible new ideas or challenges that might make life bearable. It is a strange world indeed. Like most utopian fiction, the bulk of the novel is devoted to description and debate, but there are some fine action scenes in the opening and closing chapters.A final note: In 1692 a second edition of The Southern Land, Known appeared in French. It was severely abridged to remove sexually explicit passages, some of the more extreme violence, and potentially heretical religious ideas (whether the bowdlerization was by Foigny himself or someone else is unknown). This edition was translated into English and was the only English edition available until David Fausett's 1993 translation. The 1692 edition is also still being published in French. If you want to read the author's uncensored work, be sure to get the original 1676 version.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LX6GQWY0Y0WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0815625715#wasThisHelpful","R1LX6GQWY0Y0WQ","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Blazing World is perhaps the earliest published work of science fiction by a woman. It's ironic that a book with its title should have been published in London the same year as the Great Fire of London, but only a coincidence.Margaret Cavendish was a member of the English court and a patroness of the sciences. She published under her own name a wide variety of works on philosophy, science, drama, poetry, and the novel The Blazing World, which was intended to showcase some of her ideas on science and political philosophy.The novel begins with the story of a merchant who falls in love with a high-born lady. He knows that because of his lowly station he can never openly declare his love for her, so out of desperation he abducts her and carries her away in his ship. The ship, however, is caught up in a great storm and blown into the polar regions where no ship has sailed before. The cold is so intense that everyone freezes to death, ""the young Lady onely, by the light of her Beauty, the heat of her Youth, and Protection of the Gods, remaining alive."" The ship was ""not onely driven to the very end or point of the Pole of that World, but even to another Pole of another World, which joined close to it.""In the new world the derelict ship encounters a group of bear-like men, who rescue the lady and treat her kindly. Sailing south, the bear-men turn her over to some fox-men, and by such stages she eventually comes to the palace of the Emperor who rules this world. By this time she has learned their language. The Emperor (a human) falls in love with the lady, marries her, and gives her full power over his world as his equal. The Empress's first project is to form academies of the arts and sciences and call for a report on the state of scientific knowledge in her new realm. ""The Bear-men were to be her Experimental Philosophers, the Bird-men her Astronomers, the Fly- Worm- and Fish-men her Natural Philosophers, the Ape-men her Chymists, the Satyrs her Galenick Physicians, the Fox-men her Politicians, the Spider- and Lice-men her Mathematicians, the Jackdaw- Magpie- and Parrot-men her Orators and Logicians, the Gyants her Architects, &c.""Almost half of the novel consists of the reports of these various advisers and the ensuing debates between them and the Empress. There isn't much plot here, but it's a good overview of the state of scientific knowledge in mid-17th century Europe. The Copernican view of the solar system was still under debate. The telescope and microscope were both new inventions. As for the nature of the multiple conjoined worlds, it seems that there are an infinite number of worlds connected at their poles like pearls on a string. Each has its own sun, moon and stars, varying from one world to the next in configuration and brightness. The stars of the new world are so bright that it never knows darkness, and is therefore called the Blazing World.After conferring with her scientists, the Empress meets with the immaterial spirits who dwell in the air. She learns how souls can move from body to body, and even from world to world. When she decides she needs a personal scribe, they recommend a certain Duchess of Newcastle from another world. (It is only at this point that we realize that the world the Empress originally came from was not our own.) So Margaret Cavendish's soul is fetched from England, which is how she came to learn of the events she relates in her book. She and the Empress become great friends, and continue to pay soul-visits back and forth between the two worlds. When news comes that the Empress's home country back on her native world is on the verge of being conquered by its enemies, they confer on how to send military assistance from world to world. There's a marvelous passage where they consider sending a host of immaterial spirits to reanimate the recently dead and create a zombie army, but they eventually rely upon a more ""conventional"" expeditionary force of fish-men, worm-men, and bird-men.As far as the Duchess of Newcastle's utopian vision is concerned, it can be summed up in two words: absolute monarchy. The Blazing World is the happiest and most peaceful of worlds because it is ruled by one man and his consort. Their closest advisers are all eunuchs, and their palace is an unassailable island fortress. Strangely, the author has very little to say about the role of women in society, and her heroine seems content when her advisers tell her that in their world the women are not allowed to attend religious services, but stay home ""For Women and Children most commonly make disturbance both in Church and State.""The Blazing World is not very entertaining as a novel, but it is still an interesting specimen of its era and certainly a landmark in women's fiction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N6ZUH2QLJT87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006M9JH70#wasThisHelpful","R3N6ZUH2QLJT87","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Suspecting that the moon is just another world like the earth, and that its inhabitants have visited us, the adventurer Cyrano de Bergerac devises not one, but several means of paying a return visit. His first attempt is based on the known fact that dew is attracted to the morning sun. ""I attached to myself a number of bottles of dew, and the heat of the sun, which attracted it, drew me so high that I finally emerged above the highest clouds."" But this has him headed for the sun, not the moon! He realizes his error and releases enough dew to return to earth.His final attempt, one that is more accident than intention, involves a contraption with rockets attached to it so that they fire in stages before falling away. Cyrano is left drifting through space and heading for a fatal impact with the moon, but he is fortunate enough to come straight down into the Garden of Eden where his landing is softened by the boughs of the Tree of Knowledge.The Garden is tenanted by a handful of prophets who explain to Cyrano how Adam and Eve came to be expelled to the earth. Cyrano is about to learn the greatest mysteries of all, when it is his bad timing to make a rather crude joke involving the Almighty. The prophets don't share his sense of humor, so he is expelled to wander the surface of the moon.The moon people are giants who walk on all fours. Their speech resembles the music of the flute. They take Cyrano to be some sort of monkey, so he is captured and used to entertain passers by. He is rescued finally by a being who is one of the natives of the sun. Sun people don't have bodies in the way can understand, so they animate the bodies of the recently dead of other races. This particular sun man says he has spent much time on earth as a teacher and adviser, most recently with Tommaso Campanella (author of The City of the Sun). He takes Cyrano to the moon's royal palace where he becomes something of a pet of the king's daughter. There he meets a Spaniard named Domingo Gonsales, whose voyage to the moon by swan-power was decribed in Francis Godwin's book The Man in the Moone. Gonsales had returned to the moon because ""He had not been able to find a single country where the imagination was free.""Cyrano finds the culture of the moon people to be in many ways the opposite of Europe's. They venerate the young, and the father becomes a servant to his son. They do not use money, but pay their bills with poems. They've found that smelling food gives one more nutrition than eating it, and avoids those excretory complications. They honor the body and have made virginity a crime. The higher rank a person holds, the fewer clothes he wears; royalty and sages go about naked. It is a mark of honor to expose one's genitals, and when Cyrano says that in his country men of rank wear swords, they are indignant: “O little man, how insane the nobles of your world must be if they pride themselves on a tool used by executioners, one that is made only to destroy and that is, in the end, the sworn enemy of all that lives. And they hide, on the contrary, a part of the body without which we would not exist, one that is the Prometheus of every animal and tirelessly repairs the weaknesses of nature! How unfortunate a country is where the marks of generation are ignominious and those of annihilation are honorable!"" Christianity gets much of the blame for this, as one moon man observes: ""I am indeed astounded at how much the religion of your country is against nature and is jealous of all the pleasures of men.""If Cyrano de Bergerac is remembered for anything these days, it is for the size of his nose. Moon people also have large noses. They say that ""a large nose is a sign on the door of our face that says 'Herein dwells a man who is intelligent, prudent, courteous, affable, noble-minded and generous'."" Boys born with a short nose are castrated so there is no chance they can pass on their unfortunate infirmity to another generation.Of the many scientific and technical theories discussed in this novel, it must be noted that Cyrano de Bergerac invented the idea of the audio book and the iPod. Lunar people do not have a written language, but record their books on miniature devices like music boxes. Cyrano was given several of these books, and marveled at how he could ""read"" without occupying his hands or his eyes. ""I attached the books to my ears as pendants and went for a walk in town.""Near the end of the novel Cyrano has a debate with a young moon man who is an atheist. Among the moon man's arguments is the observation of God that ""if he gave me a mind incapable of comprehending Him, it wouldn't be my fault but His, since he could have given me one capable of doing so.” Cyrano the character defends the faith, but it's fairly obvious from all that has come before that Cyrano the author is more interested in the arguments against God than those in favor.Voyage to the Moon is quite entertaining and inventive. It's obvious from his reference to earlier works that Cyrano de Bergerac sought a place in the growing body of utopian science fiction, though he doesn't offer any radical new social ideas. His novel is a broad satire of religious narrow-mindedness and puritanism, and many of his barbs still hit their mark today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LFP9HYPE61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0548588260#wasThisHelpful","R7LFP9HYPE61","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Western philosophy was born in Greece in the 6th century BCE. It is no coincidence that this is when the Greeks became a literate culture, as writing is an essential prerequisite to the transmission of complex ideas. Unfortunately the original writings of philosophers before Plato have perished; all we have are fragments quoted in other works and the commentaries of others on their ideas. These ""Presocratic"" philosophers are still no less important to the development of Western thought than Plato, Aristotle, and the others who built on their ideas.The Sophists were a group of teachers active in Athens at the time of Socrates and Plato. They tutored upper class young men and gave lectures, all for a fee. In training men for political and legal careers, they emphasized being able to argue either side of an issue, not necessarily finding the truth, so they were often ridiculed as mercenary teachers of elocution and rhetoric rather than great thinkers. The term ""sophistry"" is still used derogatorily. Yet many of them produced works of original thought as well, and deserve to be ranked as contributors to our intellectual heritage.Robin Waterfield, the translator, has organized the bits of surviving information about these men into two categories: fragments (their own words, usually quoted or paraphrased by someone else), and testimonia (comments by other classical philosophers and historians on their ideas). Each philosopher or school is in its own chapter, Presocratics first, then Sophists. Each chapter has an introduction of several pages summarizing the philosopher's ideas and contributions. The fragments and testimonia are then arranged in a sequence that logically presents the source material for that person. The fragments and testimonia are numbered and cross-referenced to the introduction, so you can either read the essay first, then the source material, or read each fragment or testimony as it is mentioned in the introduction. There are end-notes to explain names and obscure references.I found the organization of this book to be perfect in the way it clearly distinguished the ideas of each philosopher, explained them in a clear and readable manner, pointed out which ideas were original and which had been passed down from a predecessor, and clearly distinguished what the philosopher had himself said from what was attributed to him.Philosophy in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE was a much broader field than what we now associate with the term. It included not only abstract thought and the nature of knowledge, but religion, astronomy, physics, biology and medicine. There is great variety in what the philosophers represented here chose to write upon:-- Anaximander of Miletus, for example, developed a theory for the origin of life that we would be tempted to call proto-evolution, as he imagined all life coming originally from the sea.-- Zeno of Elea grappled with the idea of infinity and finally concluded ""If every existing thing is infinitely divisible into parts, then either nothing exists or everything is one."" He also famously argued that motion is impossible! Because before you can reach your goal you must reach the halfway point...then the halfway point of the remaining distance...then the next halfway point...and so on. Since there are an infinite number of halfway points, it would take an infinite amount of time to move even the shortest distance.-- Pythagoras, known chiefly as a geometer, explored the nature of the soul and believed in reincarnation. He preached vegetarianism and, for unknown reasons, the avoidance of beans. His disciple Empedocles of Acragas wrote emphatically: ""Wretches, utter wretches, keep your hands off beans!""-- Empedocles also gave us the theory of the four elements--earth, water, fire, and air--which Aristotle later developed and which remained state-of-the-art knowledge for two millennia.-- The amazing Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus of Abdera, using no instruments but their intellect, developed the atomic theory that is still the basis for our understanding of the universe: All matter consists of combinations of a few basic elements comprised of tiny, indivisible particles separated by empty space. You have to read the ideas of their predecessors to realize how truly revolutionary a notion this was at the time. They also correctly described the formation of the earth, stars and planets from spirals of material in a vacuum condensing into solid bodies. They knew that the sun, moon and stars were solid bodies just like the earth, and postulated the existence of other worlds, other moons, and other suns. Centuries before Galileo they theorized that some worlds could have several moons and even multiple suns.-- Protagoras the Sophist declared that ""Man is the measure of all things."" What he meant by this, though, was not our concept of Renaissance humanism, but the idea that what we know of the universe and ourselves is based entirely on the evidence of our senses, and one man's senses are as valid as another. If I say the vase is red and you say it is green, then it is both red and green; it has no intrinsic properties, and there is no such thing as an absolute truth. All is perception.The above are just samples of the often profound but sometimes laughable ideas presented in this marvelous volume. Robin Waterfield's writing and translations are superb. Best of all, you can enjoy this book with no background in philosophy whatsoever, because this is where it all begins.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S0I2SCER0CG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064A4VUA#wasThisHelpful","R2S0I2SCER0CG4","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not speaking the language of literary theory or being familiar with the writings of Martin Heidegger and Michel Foucault, I didn't get as much out of this anthology as I had hoped. Two of the essays focused on the author's relationship with Kathy Acker, and said more about the author herself or himself than Acker. Two were quite informative. But the other four essays went mostly over my head. One might also have expected an introduction summarizing Acker's life and career, but there was none. Nonetheless there was some useful insight to be found, and even though each essayist approached Kathy Acker and her work from a different direction, there was consistency in their conclusions.Acker regularly used textual devices such as repeating the same paragraph or inserting random text using the ""cut-up"" technique inspired by William S. Burroughs. Her stories are fragmented, discontinuous, and inconclusive. Her characters sometimes suddenly and inexplicably change gender. Peter Wollen see in this ""an example of how a literary technique could be given a political twist as a mode of resistance, envisaged as a way of subverting the control system inherent in verbal discourse..."" To Robert Glück the purpose is ""to keep the reader off balance.... Rather than drawing conclusions, developing identifications or thematic connections, that is, making judgments that lead to knowledge, Acker creates a reader who is lost in strangeness. She pitches the reader into a welter of contradictions that do not resolve themselves, but replace each other continuously: a text that hates itself but wants me to love it...."" What this also does is to distance the reader from the narrative by refusing to allow him to engage himself with plot and characters and instead refocus the reader's attention on the author herself. Leslie Dick says that Acker's work is so disturbing because ""it's not just the violence, the self-mutilation, the incest, the pain. It's that her text won't let us read in the way we automatically like to do.""One way in which Acker focuses attention on herself is by interjecting herself personally, and especially sexually, into the narrative. Nayland Blake sees an affinity between Acker and the other artists of her generation (visual and musical as well as literary) in the way she ""combined formal editing strategies that had previously been used to produce an effect of intellectual distance with the content of overwhelming intimacy."" To Blake, Acker's pornographic interludes have the urgent effect of ""bringing me back to the desire to be in the land of make-believe."" So there is a constant tension between the distancing effect of unconventional style, and the attractive effect of erotic content. To Barrett Watten, ""Sexuality is not necessarily liberation in Acker; rather it is the energetic disturbance of a wound and an attempt to repair it.""Other themes addressed are Acker's treatment of identity and her persistent borrowing (plagiarism, piracy) of other writers' text. As noted above there are recurrent references to Heidegger and Foucault, as well as Nietzsche, Freud, Bataille, Sade, and a host of other influences. Acker's themes may be contemporary and her language brash and profane, but her ideas are thoroughly grounded in a deep study of literature and philosophy.Persons with an academic background in contemporary literature will, I'm sure, find this collection of essays most rewarding, especially if they are also familiar with the philosophers cited. Without that kind of a background myself, I found quite a bit of it to be obscure, but I did gain enough insight into the work of Kathy Acker for it to have been worthwhile.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21BWT5AMWSLRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JZWY92#wasThisHelpful","R21BWT5AMWSLRB","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I'm so sorry for you. I hate humanity too. Isn't it a lovely day? Isn't it? Just look.""Such jarring juxtapositions of despair and euphoria are found throughout Dorothy Richardson's fourth autobiographical novel, The Tunnel. It portrays events in Richardson's life starting in 1896 when she moved to London's Bloomsbury district. Miriam Henderson, her alter ego, is 21 and for the first time in her life completely independent. ""Her mind was alight with the sense of her many beckoning interests, aglow with the fullness of life."" She has taken a job as a dental secretary, a position she loves despite the meager salary. But it is in her friendships and the contacts they bring that Miriam begins to blossom. She meets H. G. Wells (called Hypo Wilson in the novel), and finds that though she disagrees with almost everything he says, Miriam is so fascinated by the confident way he expresses himself that she can't wait to hear more. Her enthrallment is dangerous, she thinks, so she avoids him.Feminism is a recurring theme. Miriam takes delight in the freedoms associated with being a New Woman. She smokes, she buys a pair of knickers, she rides a bicycle, she goes unescorted to the theatre, and she attends scientific lectures. Yet Miriam's every encounter with a man becomes a reflection on the unfair position of the female in society. Thinking of how science categorizes women, she is driven to thoughts of suicide: ""There was no getting away from the scientific facts . . . inferior; mentally, morally, intellectually, and physically . . . her development arrested in the interest of her special functions . . . Woman is undeveloped man . . . if one could die of the loathsome visions . . . I must die. I can't go on living in it . . . the whole world full of creatures; half-human. And I am one of the half-human ones, or shall be, if I don't stop now.""At other times, Miriam is more sarcastic: ""The knowledge of women is larger, bigger, deeper, less wordy and clever than that of men. Certainly. But why do men not acknowledge this?"" She refers often to the language of women as something different than that of men, something men can't understand. Language becomes its own element in the novel. ""All that has been said and known in the world is in language, in words . . . all the dogmas of religion are in words; the meaning of words change with people's thoughts. Then no one knows anything for certain. Everything depends upon the way a thing is put . . . language is the only way of expressing anything and it dims everything.""Richardson's style continues to evolve. Most of the novel is now in interior monologue, with few passages of dialogue and even fewer of description. The chapters are snapshots at irregular intervals, and we must often infer what has happened from clues in Miriam's thoughts and moods. The Tunnel isn't at all difficult to read, but there are a few confusing moments when new characters spring into Miriam's consciousness without introduction. As this is a realistic autobiographic work, there is no conventional plot structure or symmetry to the novel. It is simply one phase in the life of a young woman who reflects upon herself and everything around her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQVI2Q9Z6879U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008WRCPPQ#wasThisHelpful","RQVI2Q9Z6879U","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Man in the Moone is an early work of science fiction that is remarkable for how accurately the author Francis Godwin, an Anglican bishop, understood and conveyed many of the scientific principles of astronomy and interplanetary travel.""O Reader prick up thy Ears, and prepare thyself to hear the strangest Chance that ever happened to any Mortal,"" says Domingo Gonsales, a diminutive Spaniard who says of himself that ""my Stature is so little, as I think no Man living is less."" Having killed a man in a duel, Gonsales is compelled to leave Spain and his family behind. He goes on a trading voyage to the East Indies and meets with great success. Returning to Spain in 1599 a wealthy man, he takes ill and is put ashore on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic.After a long but successful recovery, Gonsales discovers on Saint Helena an unusually powerful and intelligent but tame variety of swan. On a whim, he invents a type of harness which allows teams of swans to carry a burden from one point of the island to another. Excited at the prospect of being the first man to take to the air, he rigs a chair for himself and--thanks to his small size and weight--finds that the swans have no trouble carrying him aloft. A series of adventures and emergencies ensues, ending with Gonsales's using his swans in a desperate attempt to escape with his life.The swans, having a mind of their own, take Gonsales straight up through the clouds, and it isn't long before he realizes they are heading for the Moon! It turns out that this is their customary pattern of migration. In twelve days the intrepid Spaniard is landed on the Moon and greeted by a party of Moon Men.Assuming that there would be breathable air and moderate temperatures both on the Moon and in the space between Earth and Moon is Godwin's big mistake. Otherwise he gets most things right, if a bit out of proportion: the diminished gravity and eventual weightlessness as his craft coasts most of the way between the worlds, the fact that the Earth would appear larger from the Moon than the Moon does from the Earth, the phases of the Earth as seen from the Moon and the illumination of the Moon by earthlight during the solar night, the lighter gravity on the Moon and the fact that this would allow plants and animals to grow to larger sizes, and more.The Moon people welcome Gonsales as soon as they realize he is a fellow Christian, but that's all the author has to say about religion. The entire Moon--most of which is covered by ocean--is a single kingdom ruled by an aristocracy based on height. The taller a Moon Man is, the smarter he is and the longer he will live. Short Moon people are looked down upon socially as well as literally, and extremely short children are abandoned on Earth in exchange for tall Earth children. (Gonsales assumes this happens somewhere in North America because the Moon Men all heavy smokers and must get their tobacco on these child-swapping trips.)The Moon is a paradise of peace and contentment, but not for any reasons that might be exported to the Earth. Food grows in such natural abundance that they don't need to work for it, and there is no jealousy because ""their Females are absolute Beauties, and by a secret Disposition of Nature, a Man there having once known a Woman never desires any other.""Godwin wrote at a time when the Catholic church was still opposing Copernican astronomy and putting men like Galileo on trial, so it's curious that he made the hero of this pro-Copernican work a Spaniard and presumably a Catholic. Though Godwin's Lunar civilization has some of the characteristics of Thomas More's Utopia, The Man in the Moone can't be considered much of a work of utopian fiction since the reasons for the Moon's happiness are unique to that world and wouldn't apply to Earthlings. Nor does this novel appear to have a satirical purpose. But it is an amusing adventure story that displays a remarkable astuteness in working out the implications of scientific theories that were then very new, controversial, and imperfectly understood.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SR6G073PDBSU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N87GS6#wasThisHelpful","R2SR6G073PDBSU","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The narrator never introduces himself, and we don't even know his nationality, only that he and his shipmates are Europeans.After weeks of contrary winds and storms, the ship is desperately in need of provisions, and many of the crew are sick. They are in previously unexplored regions when they come upon a large island or continent and enter the harbor of a fine city. The inhabitants, who seem to be fluent in several European languages, warn them off, saying they want nothing to do with strangers. But when the explorers explain their desperate plight, they are given reluctant leave to re-provision their ship. The islanders finally begin to warm up to them when they learn that the narrator and his companions are devout Christians.They learn that the island nation is called Bensalem, and that it already knows everything about Europe even though the Europeans know nothing about it. The narrator is invited to make inquiries about Bensalem, and his first question--which pleases his hosts to no end--is how they came to be Christians in such a remote part of the world. Their answer is that a miraculous ark brought them a copy of the Bible shortly after the resurrection of Christ. This remarkable Bible could be read by anyone in his own language and contained books of the New Testament that hadn't actually been written yet.Explaining further the history of their land and how they came to know so much of the world, they say that ""about three thousand years ago, or somewhat more, the navigation of the world, (especially for remote voyages,) was greater than at this day."" This was the time of Atlantis, another name for the Americas. Atlantis actually had two civilizations, one in Mexico and one in Peru. They were the enemies of Bensalem and had attempted to conquer both it and Europe. But a massive flood destroyed both Atlantean nations, and the survivors reverted to barbarism. Bensalem, meanwhile, chose to remain unknown to Europe and China, but for centuries has sent spy missions to all parts of the globe collecting all the cultural and scientific knowledge of the world.Inquiring after their social life, the narrator learns that the people of Bensalem are thoroughly devout and chaste. Prostitution is unknown, adultery is rare and severely punished, and ""as for masculine love, they have no touch of it."" The native goes on to tell the narrator: ""I have read in a book of one of your men, of a Feigned Commonwealth, where the married couple are permitted, before they contract, to see one another naked."" This is a reference to Thomas More's Utopia, the forerunner of Bacon's novel. The citizen goes on to say that in Bensalem they have improved upon this system by permitting only a female friend of the bridegroom to see the bride in her bath, and vice versa.The pride of Bensalem is its institute of scientific research known as Salomon's House. The narrator is permitted an interview with one of the Fathers of Salomon's House, and he is told of the wonders that they have discovered or developed. They include: improved crops and livestock developed not only by breeding but by spontaneous generation from inanimate matter, artificial light, hearing aids, telephones, human flight, submarines, and more. (Of course I am using modern terms for what Bacon describes by function.)At this point the novel comes to an abrupt end. We learn nothing about the government of Bensalem except that it has a king. They apparently use money, but that's all we can deduce about their economy. Of their personal lives we learn very little except that they are devout and chaste Christians and they honor the male heads of large families with a special ceremony. As a utopian novel, New Atlantis is quite disappointing. It appears to be nothing more than an idealized version of Bacon's own culture. But what stands out in the novel is the litany of scientific advances, most of which wouldn't be realized for centuries. It's remarkable that almost everything Bacon imagined has come true in some form or another.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9L94F72ALK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0084A6VNI#wasThisHelpful","RC9L94F72ALK0","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The City of the Sun is a very short utopian novel written by a man who took his ideas very seriously. He wrote the novel while in prison for having tried to establish a community based on the concepts he was now describing.The fictional framework for the story is sparse and simple. A Genoese sea-captain has returned from a voyage and is relating his discoveries to his host. He tells of a previously unknown land he discovered near Taprobane (Sri Lanka) that lies directly on the equator. Coming ashore the Captain is met by a party of armed men and women and escorted to their capital, the City of the Sun.The City is built on a hill, rising in concentric walled rings like a giant wedding cake. Within each ring are built houses that look to the Captain like palaces and are interconnected by graceful arches and aerial walkways. The walls themselves are profusely decorated with images and artifacts that represent the accumulated wisdom of the inhabitants. At the summit of the city is an open plain large enough for the entire population to congregate, and at the very center an open-air temple surmounted by two great globes depicting in full detail the earth and the heavens.The nation is ruled by a priest whose title is ""Hoh."" He is accounted the wisest among the citizens and is elected by life. Serving under Hoh are three high magistrates: ""Power"" (in charge of military affairs), ""Wisdom"" (responsible for the sciences), and ""Love"" (domestic affairs, education and agriculture). They are also elected for life. Under each of these is a hierarchy of elected magistrates with more specialized functions. Hoh, Power, Wisdom and Love are all men, but the lesser magistrates are a mixture of men and women. All residents over age 20, male and female, are eligible to vote and do so in a grand Council meeting where the entire population is assembled around the temple.The City is a communist society where there is no private property, no money, and no family structure. Reproduction is under the control of a magistrate. ""He sees that men and women are so joined together, that they bring forth the best offspring. Indeed, they laugh at us who exhibit a studious care for our breed of horses and dogs, but neglect the breeding of human beings."" Men and women may share each other's company as they please, but unauthorized sexual intercourse is severely punished. Children are nursed by their mothers for two years, then taken away and raised in classes by tutors. They are sorted into various occupations according to their aptitudes, with the brightest becoming scientists and astrologers, the simplest being sent to work in the farms.Citizens dress in identical garments and are assigned to communal housing by sex. They are moved every two years. Men and women eat together in large dining halls while listening to lectures on scientific topics. Learning is a passion for them, and the city walls are their text books. Children study by walking the circumference of the City and reading the walls, and this helps keep them physically fit as well. The nation is so obsessed with physical fitness that seated pastimes such as chess are forbidden.Though the City has only just been discovered by Europeans, they have been aware of Europe for centuries and have sent explorers to all corners of the globe, learned every human language, and accumulated the wisdom of every culture. They have technologies far in advance of any other nation, including ships that move without oars or sails, and their military is both fierce and a source of great pride to the City.The City of the Sun is a work full of novel and sometimes quirky ideas. One wishes Campanella had filled in more details, especially on the lives of average citizens. He obviously drew upon both Plato's The Republic and Thomas More's Utopia for some aspects of his City, but was more radical than either in his social organization. At the same time, as a lifelong believer in astrology, Campanella added a mystical aspect to his utopia that to a modern reader seems totally out of synch with its scientific accomplishments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LCC3DJ4I9WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083Z7LGA#wasThisHelpful","R7LCC3DJ4I9WR","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Utopia is simply one of the most important and influential books ever written. Its ideas were then (and for the most part still are) so revolutionary that it can be difficult to believe a man with Thomas More's subsequent history even intended them to be taken seriously.More wrote Utopia in Latin, the language most widely read at the time by educated persons in Europe. It is also a language independent of place and time, which translator Paul Turner says is ample justification for using informal contemporary English in his translation. The result is highly readable and entertaining, but no less thought-provoking.The structure of the novel has More himself recounting a conversation he had with a traveler named Raphael who had spent five years living in Utopia, an island roughly 200 miles in diameter located somewhere in the New World. More has all the opinions and observations come from Raphael's mouth rather than his own, obviously to protect himself from being charged with promoting seditious ideas. But while Utopia does satirize a few of Europe's governments and institutions, it is not an attack on any particular person or country, and this is what has kept it relevant over the centuries.The most radical and most important feature of Utopia is that there is no private property and therefore no need for money. People dress identically and live in identical houses in identical towns. They each work at the trade for which they are best suited, usually the same as their parents. Families are sent in rotation to work on farms, the assumption being that farm work is less pleasant and should be shared by all. Military training is compulsory for both sexes, and the entire town is turned out from time to time for major projects such as roads, bridges, and fortifications. Slavery exists, but only as a form of punishment for serious crimes. All children are born free and equal and raised in identical circumstances.With no need for luxury goods and no idle classes, productivity is so high that Utopians need work only six hours a day. The rest of the time is devoted to self improvement and recreations such as music. Utopians do their work gladly, for the most part, out of community spirit. But those who might otherwise slack off know that ""Everyone has his eye on you, so you're practically forced to get on with your job, and make some proper use of your spare time."" Goods are taken to markets and storehouses where anyone who needs something just helps himself. Meals are served in communal halls where the elders are served first out of respect.There is freedom of religion in Utopia, at least to a point. Citizens are expected to believe in a creator and an afterlife and to attend religious services, but there is no official dogma, and sects are allowed to follow their own beliefs and practices as long as they don't proselytize in public. Atheists are tolerated, but they are considered contemptible and are barred from positions of public trust. That Thomas More would write something advocating religious toleration has always been puzzling, since he later ordered heretics burned at the stake and gave his own life in defense of the supremacy of the Catholic Church. More also mortified his own flesh by wearing a hair shirt despite having written in Utopia that it was as important to be kind to yourself as it was to be kind to others, and that it was ridiculous to suffer unnecessarily.Women in Utopia are subordinate at all times to their husbands, but may serve in the military and even as priests (provided they are widows). Their role in political life isn't addressed. Considering how revolutionary Utopia is in other respects, it is strangely conventional in sexual matters--probably reflecting More's own prudery. Marriage is for life except in rare circumstances, and any sex before or outside of marriage is severely punished, sometimes by enslavement or death. In a country where there is no private property and therefore no inheritance and no need to worry about legitimacy, where the pursuit of pleasure is considered a laudable goal, and where children are moved from one household to another to learn different trades, such rigid insistence on monogamy seems out of place.There is much more in Utopia on such things as foreign trade, warfare, education, medicine, aging and city planning. But what comes across most forcefully is the evil of the inequitable distribution of resources which is inevitable in a capitalist economy. The Utopians found one way to address this, a communist solution which many have since tried to emulate, at least in part.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBC504ZYRLZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BD6QAQ#wasThisHelpful","REBC504ZYRLZK","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the early 19th century opium was as cheap and widely available as aspirin is today, and used almost as freely. Taken typically in a liquid form called laudanum, it was an effective painkiller for persons of all ages, and a cheap intoxicant. Thomas De Quincey first took opium as a youth for an affliction that sounds like a sinus infection. He so enjoyed its effects that for several years he took a dose as a treat every Saturday night. He found it made him more sociable and enhanced his enjoyment of the opera. It was only when he started taking laudanum daily for a chronic stomach pain that he became physically addicted to it. As he took greater and greater doses, De Quincey experienced vivid, exotic and terrifying dreams, some of which he describes in his writings.De Quincey tells us in no uncertain terms that he is THE expert on opium addiction. He disputes what the medical profession says about the drug. ""And therefore, worthy doctors,"" he proclaims, ""stand aside, and allow me to come forward and lecture on this matter."" He also lets us know that he was, and is, an unparalleled scholar of the Greek language and as at home in Latin as Cicero. But he seems to have disdained any form of regular employment and spent most of his life in poverty, living off of the charity of a prostitute at one point, and later becoming something of a parasite of the poet William Wordsworth. De Quincey moved frequently to stay ahead of debt collectors, and wrote his Confessions while in hiding in London.The Confessions are largely a self-justification of his predicament, but there is some valuable insight into the effects of opium from a person who has gone through all stages of casual use, dependency, addiction, and withdrawal. As an example of one of his dreams: ""I was buried, for a thousand years, in stone coffins, with mummies and sphynxes, in narrow chambers at the heart of eternal pyramids. I was kissed, with cancerous kisses, by crocodiles; and laid, confounded with all unutterable slimy things, amongst reeds and Nilotic mud.""""Suspira de Profundis"" (A Sigh from the Depths) is a sequel of sorts to the Confessions, but one that mostly goes back to fill in details of De Quincey's childhood. His point apparently is to show the raw material for some of his opium dreams, but he doesn't tell us a lot about the dreams themselves. Instead he, once again, seems chiefly to want to impress us with how exceptionally brilliant and sensitive he was as a child. He writes with such a combination of insufferable arrogance and rambling, purple-prosed Victorian sentimentality that it becomes an unintentional self-parody. De Quincey would have us believe that he was in tears when his housemaid killed a spider, and was only consoled when she explained that it was necessary to save the lives of the fifty flies that the spider would have murdered.""The English Mail Coach"" begins with a much welcome bit of humor, as De Quincey describes the public express coaches which he rode frequently between Oxford and London. The coaches held four passengers inside, and three on the roof with the driver. ""It had been the fixed assumption of the four inside people,"" he explains, ""that they, the illustrious quaternion, constituted a porcelain variety of the human race, whose dignity would have been compromised by exchanging one word of civility with the three delf ware outsides. Even to have kicked an outsider might have been held to attaint the foot concerned in that operation; so that, perhaps, it would have required an act of parliament to restore its purity of blood.""In the second half of the essay De Quincey gets serious again and describes in detail an accident in which the massive mail coach in which he is riding at the furious speed of thirteen miles an hour overturns a small gig. The horrified De Quincey sees a young woman go flying, and he assumes she is killed (though the coach apparently never stopped). He then describes five opium dreams from later years, each a bizarre and unique variation of that accident.De Quincey's condescending tone and his rambling, repetitive, but incomplete narrative can be infuriating, but his Confessions do offer valuable insight into the social and psychological aspects of opium use in early 19th century England.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LQV9EX73AY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYEWDQQ#wasThisHelpful","R27LQV9EX73AY0","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Phantastes is a beautifully-crafted story of a young man's adventures in Faerie Land and the lessons he learns there. Anodos, the narrator, on coming of age is given a key to a cabinet belonging to his late father. When he opens the cabinet a tiny woman appears who tells him he has faerie blood in him, and will be granted his once-expressed wish to enter Faerie Land.Anodos awakens the next morning to find his bedroom slowing changing into a woodland glade, and his wash basin overflowing to become a forest stream. He follows the stream into a world of mystery and magic, peopled by talking flowers, walking trees, ogres, giants, knights and damsels.Inside a cave he encounters a young woman apparently frozen into a block of alabaster. She is more beautiful than anything he has ever seen, and Anodos is sure that she will become his if he can only free her from the stone. He can't reach her to kiss her, but on a sudden inspiration he tries song. Sure enough, his singing gradually melts away the stone, but when she is free the young beauty jumps up and runs away. Anodos spends much of his time pursuing this ideal beauty, but is frustrated at every turn.Anodos's adventures are numerous, bizarre, and sometimes unsettling. There are also several stories within stories, such as one where a young man in Prague attempts to free the woman he loves from an enchanted mirror. Mirrors and reflections figure prominently throughout the novel, with the common question being: ""Why are all reflections lovelier than what we call the reality?--not so grand or so strong, it may be, but always lovelier?"" And later: ""All mirrors are magic mirrors. The commonest room is a room in a poem when I turn to the glass.""Anodos learns that the pursuit of the ideal, be it a woman or a reputation, is a sign of false pride. ""I learned that it is better, a thousand-fold, for a proud man to fall and be humbled, than to hold up his head in his pride and fancied innocence. I learned that he that will be a hero, will barely be a man; that he that will be nothing but a doer of his work, is sure of his manhood."" He also learns that the joy is in loving, not in being loved.Most of the images and events in Phantastes have no obvious meaning or message, and appear to be there just to stimulate the imagination. There are some obviously Christian concepts and values, but no overt theological message or allegory. The purpose of the novel may, perhaps, be revealed in this passage:""But is it not rather that art rescues nature from the weary and sated regards of our senses, and the degrading injustice of our anxious everyday life, and, appealing to the imagination, which dwells apart, reveals Nature in some degree as she really is, and as she represents herself to the eye of the child, whose every-day life, fearless and unambitious, meets the true import of the wonder-teeming world around him, and rejoices therein without questioning?""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36EH18ZWMJSGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UJKS18#wasThisHelpful","R36EH18ZWMJSGG","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Herbert Lottman's biography of Albert Camus is a richly detailed and highly sympathetic examination of the writer's life--too much so in both cases for my taste. The book's strongest point is that it shows how much of Camus's life and work were devoted to areas that are apart from his popular image as novelist and philosopher.Camus was born in Algeria, then a French possession, in 1913. His father was soon to die in the First World War, so Camus was raised by his mother and extended family. As a youth he developed tuberculosis, which chiefly affected his stamina and was partly responsible for directing him toward artistic pursuits. His principal lifetime love was the theater, first as an actor and later as playwright, director and manager. To pay the bills he started work as a journalist, and would continue to do so off and on for most of his life. Camus lived in Algeria, with occasional trips to Europe, until the German invasion in 1940 left him stranded in Paris. Under Nazi occupation he worked openly for a publishing firm while secretly writing for and editing an underground newspaper.Camus's early political allegiance was to the French communist party. But stories of Stalin's atrocities led to a break with the communists who insisted on maintaining their loyalty to the USSR. This was also responsible for Camus's very public break with his friend Jean-Paul Sartre. For the rest of his life, Camus maintained an independent stance that was left of center, but not communist, and resisted France's alignment with either the USSR or the USA. When the Muslim population of Algeria rebelled against the French government, Camus was torn between his belief in self-determination and his desire to protect the lifestyle of his family and other Frenchmen in Algeria. Much to the consternation of his friends, Camus withheld his voice during the Algerian war.Lottman obviously felt that Camus's sex life was off limits. Camus was married twice, and was still living with his second wife Francine when he was killed in an automobile accident in January 1960. But he spent much of his time with other women, particularly actresses, often travelling with them unchaperoned. There is also mention of a ""ravishing young woman associated with neither his literary life or the theater"" who was Camus's frequent companion for the last two years of his life, but the name of this young woman was apparently withheld out of delicacy.Despite Lottman's enthusiasm for everything he did and said, Camus comes across as less likable than I had expected. He was always sensitive to insult and criticism, and flit from one project to another his whole life. His literary production was rather slim altogether, and even he suspected that the Swedish Academy awarded him the Nobel Prize more for political reasons than for his accomplishments. His best moments appeared to be when he was out of the limelight and not under pressure, when he could be quite unassuming and companionable.I read this particular biography, not because of favorable reviews, but because it came readily to hand. I'm sure there are better and newer ones that make use of sources that were not yet made available to researchers when Lottman was writing. Lottman nonetheless gives us a wealth of detail on Camus's daily life, but I found the author too quick to defend Camus. There is very little insight into the man and his philosophy. Instead we have details such as the names of his friends' dogs, the itinerary of a traveling companion's maid, and the family history of a blacksmith with whom Camus chatted a few times.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CVOLJ4U1O3MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTF02ME#wasThisHelpful","R1CVOLJ4U1O3MC","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Karen Finley is a countercultural performance artist and writer known for her strident denunciations of sexism, racism, homophobia and consumerism. She is a sex-positive feminist whose use of nudity and explicit sexual language in her stage performances has been labeled obscene by critics. Shock Treatment is an early collection of some her performance monologues, essays and poetry.The subjects addressed in this collection are varied and include child abuse, sexual stereotyping, racism, poverty, homelessness, objectification of women's bodies, reproductive freedom and materialism. Writing at a time when some religious leaders were referring to AIDS as a punishment from God, Finley compares the treatment of AIDS victims to the Holocaust and refers to the 700 Club as ""America's SS."" The general tone of her writing is one of despair that that the liberalism and idealism of the '60s and '70s has been replaced in the '80s by yuppie materialism and religious fundamentalism.Shock Treatment lives up to its name. The text is filled with profanity and contains explicit descriptions of violent and coercive sexual acts including incest, coprophagy, rape and self-mutilation. However, there are also sensitive moments depicting illness, death and grief. As this is just a broad sampling of ideas and opinions, you won't find much depth on any particular topic. Yet there are definitely some thought-provoking comments here, and I don't think any of her pieces has become dated in the 20+ years since they were written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZIZ9F8Y3268/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0872862526#wasThisHelpful","R1PZIZ9F8Y3268","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, Poe's only novel, is a nautical adventure with elements of science fiction and horror. It reads like a series of brilliantly told stories somewhat arbitrarily connected and capped by an abrupt and mystifying ending.The story takes place in 1835-36. Pym, a young New Englander, desires to go to sea with a friend, Augustus, whose father captains a whaling brig. Pym's relatives refuse him permission, so Augustus helps him stow away in the hold. Pym's confinement in the dark, unhealthy hold last days longer than he expects, and he fears he will die there, alone and forgotten. Finally Augustus gets word to him that there has been a mutiny, and that Augustus, because of his youth, had been the only non-mutineer allowed to remain alive on board the vessel.There follows a succession of adventures involving a counter-mutiny, a storm, a shipwreck, and a prolonged survival ordeal at sea. Pym eventually finds himself on board another ship which is off to explore the Antarctic in the hope of finding some previously undiscovered land where there are seals to hunt or natives to trade with. His adventures have only begun. Each episode in the novel is told briskly with edge-of-the-seat tension. Poe's descriptions are as vivid and rousing as any nautical adventure I have read.At the time of Poe's writing, a number of European and American expeditions had attempted to determine if there was an Antarctic continent. Most had been turned back by ice. Two or three explorers had only recently come upon dry land within the Antarctic circle, but were unable to determine if these were the shores of a continent or just isolated islands. There had been some reports or rumors that the waters actually grew warmer as one approached the pole, leading to speculations about hidden tropical civilizations. Others believed that the Earth was hollow, and that the poles were the points of entry to a second world inside. Poe recaps much of this in the novel, and Pym and his companions make discoveries that begin to hint that some the wildest theories may be true.The science fiction elements of the novel are found in the ""lost world"" idea, though this surfaces only in the final chapters. The horror elements are found in the terror of premature burial (a common theme in Poe's short stories) and in the superstitious fear of the reanimated dead. But there is nothing overtly supernatural in the novel.There are two objectionable aspects to the novel. One is the abrupt and unsatisfying ending which has frustrated and mystified readers since its original publication. The other is the strong presence of racial stereotypes. I found myself, while reading the novel, unable to put it down and wondering why it has been so neglected relative to Poe's poems and stories. The puzzling ending is the answer to that question, but it remains a memorable reading experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VNHP54OZOZ3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088P4QPY#wasThisHelpful","R3VNHP54OZOZ3M","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part history, part homage, London: The Biography tells the story of London from its mythical beginnings to the end of the 20th century. The opening chapters, from prehistory to the middle ages, are conventionally chronological, as are the closing chapters from roughly 1880 to 1999. Everything between is thematically organized, though there is a general chronological drift. There are chapters on food, prisons, mobs, children, plagues, trade, fires, smells, sounds and so forth--over sixty topics in all.Though Ackroyd's history gives the impression of being based on sound research, he writes more from a novelist's perspective about ideas, feelings of identity, and cultural traditions. Most of the quotes he offers come from the fiction or travel writings of literary figures rather than histories and biographies. This is a history that will especially please those with an interest in literature and local heritage; it's likely to disappoint those who want to learn London's place in the larger picture of British or European history.There are several sections of black and white and color plates, as well as a couple of rudimentary maps. One could wish for more, especially when specific paintings or photographs are mentioned in the text but not included in the illustrations. Instead of footnotes and bibliography there is a twelve-page essay on sources. All of the sources appear to be previously published works; the book makes no claim to include original research. There is an index, but it is not comprehensive. When I tried to find the first reference to Whitehall, I discovered that the term is omitted.London: The Biography is highly readable, entertaining and imaginative. It is meant for popular rather than scholarly consumption, and its informal thematic organization may frustrate those who want to learn more about a particular period in London's history. The author's love for his subject is obvious and occasionally carries him away. He is apt to see mystical connections where there is only coincidence, and the notion ""only in London"" is overused. But Ackroyd makes a convincing case that London is not only a great city, but perhaps the greatest, and one whose history and heritage are certainly worth our attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNP8JNHANIBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QCQ9MU#wasThisHelpful","R1TNP8JNHANIBF","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The silk department was like a huge bedroom dedicated to love, hung with white by the whim of a woman in love who, snowy in her nudity, wished to compete in whiteness. All the milky tones of an adored body were there, from the velvet of the hips to the fine silk of the thighs and the shining satin of the breasts.”In such sexual terms, Émile Zola repeatedly describes the merchandise on display in Paris’s first and greatest department store, “The Ladies’ Paradise,” or simply “The Paradise.”The fabrics and articles of clothing are designed to appeal to all the erotic senses. A pair of leather gloves smells “like an animal in rut which has landed in a girl’s powder box.” Women plunge their hands into bales of silk and piles of lace, their rapture reaching an orgasmic intensity which translates into a frenzy of spending. The shop floor, seen from above, was a “sea of bosoms bursting with life, beating with desire.” And at the end of big sale “the customers, despoiled and violated, were going away in disarray, their desires satisfied, and with the secret shame of having yielded to temptation in the depths of some sleazy hotel.”The setting is Paris in the 1860s during the extravagant, materialistic years of the Second Empire. The owner and manager of The Paradise, Octave Mouret, is one of the two principal characters of the novel. An ambitious young widower of modest origins, he has built The Paradise up from a simple draper’s shop to become the marvel of Paris through his audacity and his merchandising genius.The other principal character, Denise Baudu, appears on the scene as an orphaned teenage girl from the provinces throwing herself and her two brothers unexpectedly upon the charity of her uncle. But the uncle, the owner of a small fabric store across the street from The Paradise, is in the process of being driven out of business by competition from the monster store and can barely feed his own family. Facing starvation, Denise winds up working as a shopgirl in the very store that is ruining her family. Here the pretty teenager soon attracts the eye of the lustful Mouret, a man as accustomed to manipulating women into his bedroom as he is to enticing them onto his sales floor. But Denise, he finds, does not share the casual sexual attitudes of many Parisiennes. Instead he discovers in her a strength and intelligence that both frustrates and inspires him.The Ladies’ Paradise is a novel in Zola’s “Rougon-Macquart” series. The series relates the fortunes and misfortunes of an extended family during the Second Empire period. Many of the titles focus on the influence of heredity and environment on the character of family members, but that is not so much the case here. Octave Mouret, the Rougon-Macquart descendant in this case, is not as much the subject of the novel as the institution he has created. (He actually first acquires The Paradise in Zola’s previous novel, Pot Bouille, translated most recently as Pot Luck.) The Ladies’ Paradise is actually rather short on plot and character development compared to Zola’s other novels.A major theme in the novel is the effect The Paradise has in driving out of business the small, family owned competitors, which can’t complete with The Paradise’s low prices and sex appeal. One constant contrast is between the brilliantly lit interior of The Paradise and the dark, dingy spaces of the other stores where “the dark shadows were falling from the ceiling in great shovelfuls, like black earth into the grave.” The misery into which the small shopkeepers descend is often depicted melodramatically, yet Zola never suggests that the large department store is evil or unfair, but rather that we are witnessing a natural stage in the evolution of commerce.It is fascinating to see in this novel the beginnings of retail practices with which we are now quite familiar. The physical arrangement of departments within a store is done for psychological, rather than logistical purposes. Traffic flow in busy aisles is deliberately impeded to create the illusion of bigger crowds and more excitement. A generous return policy encourages impulse buying. With a staff growing into the thousands, the store becomes a community of its own with dormitories, dining halls, and recreation rooms. Cutthroat employment practices are softened in the interest of employee loyalty, and we see the emergence of employee benefits such as onsite health care, maternity leave, and education programs. On the outside there is a new business/government partnership for further development, and we see the buying power of a large retailer begin to control its suppliers.Octave Mouret explains at one point that he has built his success upon “the exploitation of Woman.” Is the novel demeaning to women by depicting them as so easily exploited--so readily seduced into an orgy of spending? Not necessarily, because what we also see is the increasing power of women in the marketplace as independent consumers. Inside the store Zola shows them growing in power and responsibility as managers, department heads, and buyers (though we still never see a woman supervising a man). Behind the scenes they have additional influence as key investors.The Ladies’ Paradise is a fascinating and enlightening look at the birth of an institution which is still a dominating force in retail. It can be seen as a critique of materialism and greed, but as such is not as forceful as some of the author’s other works. Nor is the novel particularly strong in plot or character. But Zola’s immense powers of description are on full, sensuous display.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NOI750NJTXMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NVE55I#wasThisHelpful","R1NOI750NJTXMQ","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As Flies to Whatless Boys is Robert Antoni's imaginative recreation of what he presents as a part of his own family history. In 1845 the William Tucker family of London immigrates to Trinidad with other members of what is called the Tropical Emigration Society. Their leader, a German named Etzler, proposes to set up a utopian socialist community where most of the work will be done by an amazing self-propelled machine of his own invention called the Satellite. A number of poor families, and a few more prosperous idealists, invest their life's savings with Etzler and set sail for Trinidad. Whether Etzler was a fraud or delusional, they never learn, because soon after their arrival they are abandoned on an isolated strip of land that is mostly mud and fever-ridden mangrove swamp.The novel has several parallel narrative threads decades apart. In 1845 William Tucker had a 15-year-old son, also named William but called Willy, who immigrated to Trinidad with him. He is the principal character of the novel. But we first meet him in 1881 when he is preparing to return for the first time to England. He is telling his own son the story of how he and his family came to Trinidad, and the poignant story of his first love.Interspersed with the father/son scene in 1881 and the story Willy is telling about 1845 there are whimsical pieces of correspondence between Robert Antoni himself and a Miss Ramsol, the director of the Trinidad & Tobago National Archives, concerning the research Antoni is doing into the Tucker family, his ancestors. Antoni is making no headway with the obstinate Miss Samsol in his request to use the office photocopier, notwithstanding the fact that the two are carrying on a torrid romance after hours.In 1845 the romance is between 15-year-old Willy and Marguerite, the 18-year-old niece of one of the wealthy emigrants. Marguerite is mute, born without vocal cords, but it is their social difference that stands between the two. Willy's machinations to get to Marguerite before they sail, on the long voyage across the Atlantic, and in their early days in Trinidad are both humorously inventive and romantically touching.At five points in the novel there are notes with links to websites which supplement the text. Not all of these were available yet, as the book has yet to be released to the public, but those that were active brought up beautifully done video clips showing images from Willy's dreams.The title is a Trinidadian version of a quote from King Lear: ""As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods / They kill us for their sport."" The strange and capricious working of fate would be the principal theme to the novel. I found this a very entertaining novel, unpredictable, often funny, and occasionally moving. I'm not sure that it is necessarily an accurate portrayal of Trinidad in the 1840s or of the experience of utopian settlers in general, especially when the author has his characters using anachronistic terms such as ""blitzkrieg"" and ""seat belt."" The use of multiple narrative lines, however, added value to the novel, was never confusing, and helped keep it interesting to the end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y16PJF7GOM2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENI2PT4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y16PJF7GOM2E","A3VIS19QJDY8YD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VIS19QJDY8YD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summery: The L12S Smart Bracelet features an attractive design, and several interesting features ('massage mode', 'pedometer', 'mp3 player'). However, the limited screen size leaves reading text messages tedious. With that being said, consumers on the fence about whether they really need a smartwatch in their lives, could purchase this as a foray into the world of smart wearables. Overall, the price is compelling, and as long as one's expectations are modest, the L12S doesn't really disappoint.Extended Review:*A full video version of my review can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBgajyiJ5w8Packaging- Other than the watch, instructions, and microUSB cable (fully charging the watch takes +/-2 hours), there's also an included dock. The dock is constructed out of plastic, and allows for the L12S to be elegantly positioned when charging. The instruction manual includes a QR code for an application called 'BTNotification' to be downloaded from the Android Play Store. This app allows the phone/tablet to send notifications to the watch, so don't lose the manual!Hardware- From a design standpoint, the Smart Bracelet looks futuristic, and stands out. For a product that's only $30, we were impressed by the use of metal accents, soft touch rubber, and rugged plastic. The bracelet feels solidly built, even in weight distribution, and comfortable to wear. The front features the power/select button, two capacitive touch buttons (for moving up/down, or long pressing on either to go back), and the OLED display.Performance- To begin, the L12S is designed for Android, and does not work with any iOS products. Connecting the bracelet over Bluetooth was straight-forwards enough, and the wireless connection range was around 30ft. With the L12S powered on, we averaged 12-13 hours of usage. That means owners should expect to charge their smart bracelets every day or two. The OLED screen is on the smaller side of the spectrum, but it's bright enough to be read outdoors and indoors. As aforementioned, the watch relies on two capacitive buttons to control navigation. These buttons were surprisingly response, making the user experience coherent and pretty easy to figure out. Next, we're discuss the various features of the watch:Contacts- Once synced with a phone, the watch can display the contacts stored in your phonebook. Users can then call or look up specific number. Although this feature worked, it's an area where the smaller screen size (roughly 0.5 inches) is a limitation. Plenty of scrolling around is needed.Music- The bracelet acts as a Bluetooth speaker, playing back music from your phone. The speakers on the bracelet are loud, although not especially crisp. Regardless, we found it to be a slight upgrade over the speakers found in most Android smartphones. A limited number of tracks (3-4) can be directly saved onto the watch's memory, via a computer. These tracks will play (mp3 player) even without a connection to the smartphone. Tracks can be show song titles and artist names within the menus.Calling- Users can directly answer incoming calls with the watch (alarm and vibration notification). The built-in microphone is generally good, although it doesn't eliminate background noise. Overall the speakerphone experience is good, but nothing spectacular.Messages- Easily the weakest link of the smart bracelet. Notifications are regularly and accurately pushed to the watch, but the small screen size means you'll be scrolling up and down quite a lot. Unless the messages are exceptionally short, we think using your phone/tablet will be a more comfortable experience.Pedometer- As a fitness tracker, the smart bracelet works pretty well. We're seen more accurate trackers in the past, but general footsteps are recorded without any issues. We would have liked to see a way to store our steps on our phone (with the app), through.Massage- One of the novelty features that turns the vibration sensor on, and promises to 'ease any sore or tired wrists'. It works, although expect the battery life to reduce after use.Anti-Loss alarm- Easily the best feature of the bracelet. If someone steals your phone, and the Bluetooth connection to the watch is severed, an alarm will immediately ring. Similarly, users can 'find' their lost phone/bracelet by using either the watch/phone app.Conclusion- There's certainly room for improvement, mainly with the screen size. However, good call quality, a beautiful design, and the rock-bottom price, provide the L12S with saving grace. For first time smart watch owners, this is a decent option to consider.Rating: 3.6/5 stars, Good(Rounded to 4/5 via Amazon's Rating System)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WKL6MP85YSHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRY1ZJO#wasThisHelpful","R1WKL6MP85YSHM","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summery: The L12S Smart Bracelet features an attractive design, and several interesting features ('massage mode', 'pedometer', 'mp3 player').

The dock is constructed out of plastic, and allows for the L12S to be elegantly positioned when charging. The instruction manual includes a QR code for an application called 'BTNotification' to be downloaded from the Android Play Store. This app allows the phone/tablet to send notifications to the watch, so don't lose the manual!Hardware- From a design standpoint, the Smart Bracelet looks futuristic, and stands out. For a product that's only $30, we were impressed by the use of metal accents, soft touch rubber, and rugged plastic. The bracelet feels solidly built, even in weight distribution, and comfortable to wear. The front features the power/select button, two capacitive touch buttons (for moving up/down, or long pressing on either to go back), and the OLED display.Performance- To begin, the L12S is designed for Android, and does not work with any iOS products. Connecting the bracelet over Bluetooth was straight-forwards enough, and the wireless connection range was around 30ft. With the L12S powered on, we averaged 12-13 hours of usage. That means owners should expect to charge their smart bracelets every day or two. The OLED screen is on the smaller side of the spectrum, but it's bright enough to be read outdoors and indoors. As aforementioned, the watch relies on two capacitive buttons to control navigation. These buttons were surprisingly response, making the user experience coherent and pretty easy to figure out. Next, we're discuss the various features of the watch:Contacts- Once synced with a phone, the watch can display the contacts stored in your phonebook. Users can then call or look up specific number. Although this feature worked, it's an area where the smaller screen size (roughly 0.5 inches) is a limitation. Plenty of scrolling around is needed.Music- The bracelet acts as a Bluetooth speaker, playing back music from your phone. The speakers on the bracelet are loud, although not especially crisp. Regardless, we found it to be a slight upgrade over the speakers found in most Android smartphones. A limited number of tracks (3-4) can be directly saved onto the watch's memory, via a computer. These tracks will play (mp3 player) even without a connection to the smartphone. Tracks can be show song titles and artist names within the menus.Calling- Users can directly answer incoming calls with the watch (alarm and vibration notification). The built-in microphone is generally good, although it doesn't eliminate background noise. Overall the speakerphone experience is good, but nothing spectacular.Messages- Easily the weakest link of the smart bracelet. Notifications are regularly and accurately pushed to the watch, but the small screen size means you'll be scrolling up and down quite a lot. Unless the messages are exceptionally short, we think using your phone/tablet will be a more comfortable experience.Pedometer- As a fitness tracker, the smart bracelet works pretty well. We're seen more accurate trackers in the past, but general footsteps are recorded without any issues. We would have liked to see a way to store our steps on our phone (with the app), through.Massage- One of the novelty features that turns the vibration sensor on, and promises to 'ease any sore or tired wrists'. It works, although expect the battery life to reduce after use.Anti-Loss alarm- Easily the best feature of the bracelet. If someone steals your phone, and the Bluetooth connection to the watch is severed, an alarm will immediately ring.

" 3:40 Mins SUMMERY:kdLinks's Ultra Slim-Fit case offers an excellent combination of functionality and style. The case itself maintains the slim chassis of the iPhone 6 plus (0.5mm!), while adding a grippy soft-touch coating and sturdy TPU construction. Overall, it's a case that works exactly as advertised.Extended Review:Packaging- The Ultra Slim-Fit case comes in an attractive, transparent box that contains the case, and some details regarding the product.Design & Performance- The main selling point of the Ultra Slim, is how it maintains the sleekness of the original iPhone 6 plus while protecting it from scratches and bumps. All ports are still fully accessible when the case is inserted, from the camera grill to the volume buttons.Construction quality of the case is surprisingly study, considering the slimness of the design. As a hard-shell case, the Ultra-Slim is built from Thermoplastic Polyurethane, which allows for a certain degree of malleability. This means that if you drop the phone/case, the case will absorb some of the shock, protecting the iPhone inside.Otherwise, the texture of the case is described by the manufacture as a 'sandy' texture. I'd say it's closer to being soft-touch, which provides a gripper surface for users to hold their devices. A benefit of this finish, is that it resists fingerprints, and covers-up scratches easily.Lastly, applying the case to the iPhone 6 plus was a simple affair. There are no moving parts, so the phone simply slides in. Removing the phone requires a bit more pressure, but can still be done without harming the device. During our testing, we never had the iPhone slip out from the case- it's a snug fit.Conclusion:Although not the flashiest iPhone case out there, the kdLinks Ultra Slim does a great job in merging form with function.Rating: 4.8/5 (Rounded to 5 on Amazon's system)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~We were provided this sample to create an honest emulation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E9PIQ9RBW74J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHAPDNY#wasThisHelpful","R1E9PIQ9RBW74J","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:04 MinsSUMMERY:THE GOOD: DBPower's 1080P Dashboard Camera offers aluminum construction quality, no-frills video looping, and an excellent wide angle lens.THE CON: Lacks integrated GPS, user manual can be difficult to dissectVERDICT: Despite minor caveats, this dashboard camera still offers incredible value for the money.EXTENDED REVIEW:Packaging- DBPower pairs the camera with a windshield mount, car charger, USB data cable, and user manual. The contents are nicely protected via foam and cardboard. Our review unit arrived within 3 days of ordering.Design- The hardware of the dashboard camera is attractive, with curved edges, and an all-metallic finish. As a small camera, the back is almost entirely dominated by the 2.7"" LCD display and navigational controls. The side houses a miniHDMI port that can connect to HDTVs (cable is not included in the box). Note that the wide-angle lens does protrude from the unit quite a bit, so take extra care when handling the camera!DBPower throws in a 2 year warranty with the unit, along with its quite stellar customer support.Functionality- As advertised, when the car engine starts (camera plugged into charger), the dash-cam automatically begins recording looping video. On this particular unit, audio is also recorded, although the microphone is only passable, and there is no speaker built on the camera to play back sound.Speaking of, the video quality itself is quite good. Fine details are easy to interpret (i.e. license place numbers), and colors are vibrant. Low-light performance is considerably weaker, but still acceptable. The 170 degree angle lens does 'stretch' shapes, but this is a common trait among most wide-angle lens. During operation, the camera also remained cool in temperature.Motion sensing is another feature this camera offers. Users can set the camera to automatically begin recording videos when movement is detected (security) in looping intervals of 22 seconds, 1 minute, 3,5 and no loops. One flaw we noticed was that looping sometimes cuts of 1-2 seconds of in-between video (processing). Again, not a deal-breaker, but hopefully an area future models can improve on.Adjustments to contrast, resolution and looping can be found in the menu- which took some acclimation to get used to. The menu layout is clear enough, but the controls didn't always correlate to their intuitive functions. The user manual isn't that much of a help, with the instructions lacking clarity. However, most functions can be figured out by playing around with the product.For memory, users will need to separately purchase a SD card (camera supports up to 64GB). Files are saved in the .mov for video, and standard JPEG for photos.CONCLUSION:Overall, DBPower's dashboard cam is a solid product that does what it's supposed to: capture looping video with enviable resolution. The instructions can admittedly be improved, but this flaw is made up by DBPower's excellent customer support (helping users with the set-up process).Rating: 4.7/5 Stars(Rating rounded to 5/5 on Amazon's System)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARWJQUO1IMP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFIG6KO#wasThisHelpful","R1ARWJQUO1IMP7","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 5:22 Mins SUMMERY:THE GOOD: Aurin's Mini Bluetooth Headset is inexpensive, attractive in design, and sound quality is excellent. The headset can be used to either listen to music or answer phone calls.THE CON: The 'stereo' label can be misleading because only one earbud is included.VERDICT: As long as your expectations are modest, Aurin's Mini Bluetooth Earbuds are a decent value for the money. Audio quality was better than expected, and the battery life is stronger than the category average.EXTENDED REVIEW:Packaging- Aurin bundles the earphone with a propitiatory USB charging cable (Bluetooth takes 2 hours to fully charge), and an instruction manual. The box is made out of recyclable cardboard.Design- The Mini Bluetooth Headset comes in two color iterations: black or white. Both colors are crafted out of glossy plastic (attractive and sturdy, but attracts fingerprints). A single power/answer button rests on the surface of the unit. This button is easy to press, and resembles an enlarged iPhone 4S home button. Below the surface of this key is an LED that will illuminate when the unit is on.Performance- Aurin's headset can be worn with/without the earhook attached. In testing, we found the Bluetooth headset to be comfortable enough, although there are no adjustable ear pieces included. When jogging around, the Bluetooth headset did not fall out.Pairing up the earbud was easy enough, with a supported range of 10 meters. Once paired, the headset becomes the speaker for the tablet/phone.Audio quality was pleasant (crisp, audible, suitable for general music playback), although the lack of a second earbud makes 3D/true stereo impossible. That means this Earbud won't do the trick for watching immerse films. Call quality was good, with the microphone picking up our voice even in louder environments.Battery life is rated at 3 hours, although we reached 3.5-4 hours in our tests. The standby time is stated at 100 hours.Rating: 4.6/5 Stars(Rating Rounded to 5 via Amazon's Review System)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REG8540NOZVS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP097EA#wasThisHelpful","REG8540NOZVS5","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 8:46 Mins DBPower's Mini Bluetooth Speaker is small. Really small. The speaker can actually disappear behind a U.S. 25 cent quarter. In fact, when I first removed the product from the packaging, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I knew the product would be portable, but a speaker the size of a smartphone charm? This may very well be one of the world's smallest Bluetooth speakers...In terms of design, the speaker is nicely constructed out of durable plastics. A bundled lanyard makes it possible for the speaker to hang from a tablet/smartphone's headphone port, and a power button rests on the very top. The sides also contain the microUSB charging port (cable not included in the box, takes 2 hours to fully charge), and microphone (speakerphone function).Sound quality actually surprised me with the clarity (no static from the Bluetooth) and sheer loudness. No, the speaker won't fill a large room, but it'll more than work for tighter spaces. In the video review, I compare the sound on a Samsung Galaxy S3 with this speaker, and found the latter to be exponentially better. Regardless of genre, music sounded rich and a little bass was even present!However, this wasn't the only thing that startled me... The manufacture decided to record audible 'sounds' to notify users of the unit's different modes. Case in point, when the speaker powers on, a female voice says, ""Power On, Ready to Pair!"" This is a neat feature, the first time this happened, I nearly jumped out of my skin (was not expecting the speaker to talk to me).The Bluetooth paring went smoothly enough (speaker is called JTL-8). Once paired, the speaker can also take calls, although the built-in microphone was on the fuzzier side of the spectrum. Interestingly, the Bluetooth speaker also acts as an 'anti-loss' alarm. Essentially, once the Bluetooth connection of 30m has been severed between speaker and phone, an alarm will sound on the speaker.One caveat I did find, was with the 'taking photos' (remote) functionality. The feature requires a separate app to work, and is only compatible with Android phones. Sadly, when I tried to install the app (QR code on box), an error message prevented me to go further on a Galaxy S3. Hopefully this software issue will be ironed out down the road!All-in-all, this Mini Bluetooth Speaker is an impressive piece of kit. It's small, relatively powerful, and offers a dense set of useful functions. A job well done!Rating: 4.8/5 stars, Excellent(Rounded to 5/5 on Amazon's System)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H2BDQB9UZZUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX2YXVM#wasThisHelpful","R2H2BDQB9UZZUW","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:21 Mins Summery: The A7-T is useful for companies looking for a swift way of checking employee attendance, using the built-in biometric fingerprint reader. When not scanning or recording attendance, the device dubs as a digital clock, with an HTC-inspired look. Otherwise, the device takes some initial set-up to get up and running, but does work as advertised.Extended Review:Packaging- DBPower boxes the A7-T with an AC adapter, wall mount plate, and an instruction manual. The box itself is well cushioned by foam in the interior, and has an attractive exterior.Design- The A7-T is crafted out of plastic and metal components. The part containing the screen and scanner is glossy, whereas the rest of the unit is textually matte. The manufacture adds that the fingerprint scanner surface is durable tempered glass. On the front, users will also find a t-9 keypad (text and number entry). These buttons are large and easy to press, with a tactile response to them. A loudspeaker also sits on the metallic front.Performance-Screen: Under brighter environments, the LCD can become washed out, with extreme viewing angles going against the device's favor. With that being said, this isn't a large concern, with most users opting the use the A7-T indoors. At 3"", the screen is also generously sized. During moments of inactivity, the unit can display a custom wallpaper.We do have to note that the user manual doesn't do the device justice. However learning the menu system was still relatively easy to learn by trial/error. As noted by the manufacture, up to 1,000 fingerprints can be stored on the unit.For fingerprint recognition, we found that dry fingers did not work as well as moist ones. With that being said, the scanner does have little preference when it comes to orientation of the finger being scanned, and recognition speed is very fast (2 seconds). After recognition, the user's name will appear on screen for confirmation, and the speaker with announce, ""thank you"" (can be disabled). The data is then stored on the unit, and can be exported by a USB flash drive, or connecting a computer (no drivers needed- Mac or PC). Attendance will be laid out in an Excel document form.Summery:Overall, this Biometric attendance unit does the job well... as long as you are willing to play around a bit with the menus. This is all-in-all a very interesting piece of technology!Rating: 4.8/5 Stars, Excellent(Rating Rounded to 5/5 on Amazon's Review System)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHK2R8EGEWMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQDKWY4#wasThisHelpful","R3AHK2R8EGEWMN","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:03 Mins Summery: Aurin's Mini All-in-1 Reader stands out for its minuscule dimensions. No larger than a compact flash drive, this USB 3.0 Reader recognizes all SD and microSD formats. Aurin's reader is also plug-and-play, requiring no additional driver to work with Mac and Windows computers.Extended Review:Packaging- Aurin's Eco-conscious packaging consists of the reader, and a quick warranty guide. The box itself is made out of cardboard and fully recyclable. We received our review model within 5 days of ordering the product.Design- The Mini All-in-1 Reader is coated in a layer of soft touch rubber, which resists fingerprints and smudges. The grippy texture also makes the Reader easy to plug/remove from USB ports. On the front is a simple blue LED that will illuminate when the accessory is plugged in.When a SD card is inserted, the card mostly protrudes from the body of the Reader. Although this doesn't impact the unit's functionality, it does mean the card is less securely inserted (increased chance of damage). However, this is a natural trade-off for having a smaller design. As a USB 3.0 device, the Reader is also backwards compatible with USB 2.0/1.1 ports.Functionality- When tested with a range of computers and tablets, we experienced no recognition issues (Windows XP, 7, 8). In most instances, the USB device was recognized within 10 seconds of being plugged in. Because Aurin's Reader is USB 3.0, data transfer speeds were close to reaching nearly 5Gbps. This meant that copying files from a camera's SD card to a computer was fast. Really fast. Case in point, a full 16GB card (filled with QHD video clips), copied onto our computer hard drive in under 55 seconds. Aurin's reader is also compatible with all SD card formats (SD, SDHC, SDXC, MicroSD, TF Cards).One aspect the company could add in a future iteration, is the ability for the USB cap (protection) to be fastened onto the Reader's 2nd end (like marker caps!) when not being used. This would decrease the odds of losing this cap when traveling.Summery:Aurin's All-in-1 Reader functions like a charm, and boasts one of the smallest form factors we've ever seen. This makes Aurin's Reader ideal for road warriors looking to add SD/microSD slots to tablets/ultra-portables.Rating: 4.7/5 Stars, Excellent(Rounded to 5/5 via Amazon's review system)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KJC5MJUK5YST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLU7XE6#wasThisHelpful","R2KJC5MJUK5YST","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 7:52 Mins Summery: The well-designed Huion P608N graphic tablet is easy on the wallet, but rich in functionality. We were particularly impressed by the pen's 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity, which felt as natural as drawing with an actual pencil/paper. The tablet's quick access controls are well laid out, and the unit was compatible with all art programs we threw at it.Extended Review:Packaging- Huion's Eco-friendly packaging contains the tablet, pen, instruction manual, four extra pen tips, (1) AA battery (for the pen), and a CD-Rom. The tablet is securely protected by layers of foam and cardboard.Design- The P608N offers an ergonomic look, with curved edges and a matte plastic finish. When placed on a desk, the tablet looks classy, and doesn't slide around (rubber feet on the bottom). We're fans of how the curved ridge on the tablet's top actually holds the stylus when not in use. Along the sides of the 6""x8"" touch area are 26 buttons that can be programmed for quick-access functions. For instance, one button can 'cut' artwork, while another 'opens' a blank document.The pen is turned on/off by pressing on the eraser end. The button is spring-assisted, and quite easy to press. Otherwise, the pen is easy to hold, with the thick rubber grip contributing to this trait. However, because the pen lacks any protruding edges (no other buttons or clips), it rolls around quite easily.Functionality:Before the tablet can be used, a software from Huion must first be installed. Unfortunately, the driver that came on the CD-Rom was antiquated, and at least for us, refused to work. An up-to-date version of the driver can be found (free!) on Huion's website. This driver did work, and installed within a matter of seconds on our Windows 8 laptop.During testing, we used both Gimp (free!) and Adobe Photoshop. We found that that the stylus glided smoothly on the tablet's surface, providing little to no resistance. Overall, drawing using the graphic tablet was enjoyable and a no-frills experience... simply press harder to make the drawing/lines darker, and vice versa. The tablet also does a good job being a mouse/cursor for a computer.When compared with a Wacom tablet, there are really only two areas that Huion could improve on. The first is the usage of a battery for the stylus. Although battery life is excellent (rated at 1 year before a replacement is needed), note that some graphic tablets don't require a battery to function (at least not one the user needs to charge/replace). A second area is would be making the eraser tip also pressure sensitive.Summery:All in all, Huion's P608N tablet is a compelling tool that is sleek in design and usability. Huion's close attention to details (quick access keys, stylus holder, grip) are evident in the day-to-day usage of this tablet. For $50, this is a bargain that's difficult to beat...Rating: 4.7/5 Stars, Outstanding(Rounded to 5/5 Stars on Amazon's Review System)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PWEGOU1CMS9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JIIOULA#wasThisHelpful","R2PWEGOU1CMS9D","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:30 Mins Full Review:The 1byone iPhone 6 Battery case is unique because it offers a high capacity 3100mAh external battery, a wealth of color options, and customizable bumpers. 1byone did a great job retaining the slimness of the iPhone. Compared to other battery cases, this one is compact, easy to slide into pockets, and does not add too much bulk. The case contains enough juice to charge the iPhone 6 1.5 times.As aforementioned, the bumpers can be swapped out. This provides an excellent amount of customization (transparent and black colored bumpers are included in the packaging, others colors available for separate purchase). The iPhone is also easily inserted, with a two-piece (snap on) design. The back of the case features LED indicators that show the amount of juice remaining in the battery case. The case is charged via a microUSB cable, a process that takes roughly two hours to complete. When inserted, the iPhone can also be externally charged/synced using the standard microUSB. A really cool feature!Since the bottom of the case is recessed (lightning pin connects to the battery case), 1byone includes an extension cable for the 3.5mm headphone jack. This means that users will still have access to all features of the iPhone 6 when placed in the case. However, the extension cord does subtract from the sleekness of the smartphone.With the case, charging the iPhone 6's battery took 2.5 hours to finish, and extended the use time for videos, calls, and web browsing. This makes this case perfect for longer road-trips, or emergency situations. As a MFI certified case, the battery (li-polymer) prevents overcharging, and 1byone states the case won't interfere with cellular reception. During testing in Seattle, we found the reception claim to be accurate (iPhone retained 3-4 bars in connectivity).Overall, the 1byone iPhone 6 battery case comes heavily recommended for its customizable design, slim portfolio, and high-performing built-in battery. The case itself is also solidly built, and protects the iPhone against scruffs.

" 3:55 Mins Aurin's 4-Port USB Hub features one major advantage over competitors: its size. With its slim portfolio, lightweight design, and bendable cord, Aurin's USB Hub is perfect for road warriors. The entire Hub easily tucks away into pockets, and is a fraction the size of most modern-day smartphones.  What's more impressive, is that the Hub draws power from a standard USB port. That means it doesn't require an AC Adapter/Brick. But don't be fooled by its small size. This is a truly capable computer accessory.For starters, Aurin's USB 3.0 Hub has a smart circuit preventing back-flow/short circuiting. The USB Hub is also plug-and-play, with no additional software needed for Mac/Windows/Android usage. Other USB 3.0 advantages also exist here, such as backwards compatibility with USB 2.0/1.1 products, and file transfer speeds up to a blazing 5Gbps. An Eco-friendly, fully-recyclable packaging is also thrown in.With all this being said, there are a few caveats. For example, in order to make the HUB so small, the USB ports are more closely spaced than I'd like. Users with wider USB products (i.e. Patriot Snowman Thumb Drive), may find it difficult to fit 4 devices into the Hub's ports simultaneously. A second point of weakness is the short cord length. This could inconvenience desktop users looking for a permanent USB Hub.During testing, we were impressed at the functionality of the Hub. When tested with several tablets, laptops, and desktops (Windows 7/8), we encountered no recognition problems. Aurin's Hub also worked fine for Hard Drives and wireless mouses we threw at it. The Hub also charged most smartphones (in addition to data syncing, of course), although it's by no means a rapid charger. For example, an iPhone took 4 hours to reach 100% capacity. A blue LED indicates when the Hub is being plugged in.In conclusion, Aurin's 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub is a compelling buy for its size and ease-of-use. In particular, we'd recommend this product to owners of ultra-portables, tablets, and laptops looking to extend the number of USB ports on their computer.Rating: 4.8/5 Stars, Outstanding(Rounded to 5/5 Stars on Amazon's Review System)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NCPDUVVQ7W8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0H5FW2#wasThisHelpful","R2NCPDUVVQ7W8M","AP0R93539E7KD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AP0R93539E7KD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We needed an inexpensive but nice-looking reception desk for a small office. We chose this one because it can be set up as a right or left return, and you can also choose where to put the drawer pedestal. Please be aware that it will be delivered on a pallet to your driveway, and it is 400 pounds!! Ask your driver if he will put it inside the garage at least; ours did, for which we are so thankful, because it was raining when he delivered it.The desk arrived quickly and in good shape.Once the box was opened, my husband and son carried the pieces individually into the room where it would be set up. It took the two of them, who are both mechanically inclined, about 2 hours total to get it together. It would be hard for one person to do this, although not impossible.The finished product is exactly what we wanted, and works perfectly in the front office.

"These work very well for me. I put all of them in the dryer and just leave them there since it's just easier that way. As noted by other reviewers, they do make a bit of a banging noise when the load first starts, and more so if it's a small load. It doesn't bother me at all, but thought I'd mention it for those of you who live near a fussy apartment neighbor or landlord.As also noted by other reviewers, synthetic fabrics seem to create a lot of static when dried with these balls. I took one star off for that. However, there is zero static with a 100% cotton load, and only minor static on the synthetic items if most of the load is cotton with a few synthetic items included.I always use the auto-dry sensor setting on my dryer, not the timer, so it's pretty obvious that drying time with these balls is definitely shortened by about 10 minutes for a full load. Given that I do 5-7 loads per week, that eliminates almost an hour of drying time per week. That saves me ~4.2 hours on my monthly utility bill of the most expensive electricity use in the house besides the fridge. Thank you very much!BTW, why do most people use the timer on their dryer, instead of the auto-dry sensor setting? That makes no sense to me, as the timer either stops too soon, or else it keeps going long after the clothes are dry. In contrast, the sensor setting makes sure that you don't inadvertently leave a load of partially damp clothes in the dryer, or that you don't over-roast them and thereby shorten the useful life of your favorite threads. Plus, the sensor setting saves utility costs and lessens your time and effort to keep checking on the load. Yet I know of few people who take advantage of this energy-and-time-saving option on their dryers.Do yourself, your clothes, and your utility bill a big favor: buy some of these dryer balls, throw ALL of them in the dryer, and use the sensor setting on your dryer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YAKYN86SWAO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA9P5P0#wasThisHelpful","R2YAKYN86SWAO0","A3A56XDU9H2WUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A56XDU9H2WUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sure enough, about 20 minutes after taking them, they eliminated symptoms of seasonal allergies such as watery eyes, coughing, sneezing, and congestion. The effects weren't as dramatic as prescription meds, but we had no noticeable side effects, and the relief lasted 3-4 hours before another dose was needed.For us, those kind of results beat the heck out of prescription nose sprays and antihistamines, all of which have horrible side effects for me. Also, my husband can't take any of those things because of potentially fatal interaction with his other meds. So we were very glad to find this stuff!

"I was a little nervous about purchasing this since other reviewers had trouble. Also, I had one of these long ago, and it didn't work well at all. But after reading the directions online, I realized I had never used it properly, and I decided to order another one and try again. Sure enough, by following the directions EXACTLY, this product works perfectly for me.  Here's what I did:1. Don't overfill the container. As stated in the directions, only fill it half full, so that there is room for the air build-up that is necessary to achieve a fine spray.2. Tighten the cap that holds the spray nozzle VERY tightly. Of course, you don't want to crack the plastic, but do your best to crank the cap down very tightly. Otherwise, the pressure won't build up and you won't get a good spray.  This is where I blew it before as I didn't realize that was such an important issue.3. Pump vigorously for as many times as it takes to feel the pressure build up. For me, this is 15-20 fast pumps.4. After you spray, loosen the cap that has the sprayer nozzle so as to release all the pressure.By following these instructions, you should get a nice mist for coating that egg pan in the morning, or for the top of your bread loaves before they go into the oven.

"I ordered this to replace a copy that I lost while traveling. This is an incredible, Christian alternative to yoga that works the whole body and refreshes your spirit, too! For Christians who want to be above reproach and avoid the spiritual connotations of yoga that do not line up with Scripture, you can't go wrong with this workout. Even if you aren't a Christian, the work out is great, and I don't think you will find the Scripture cues offensive. I also have the Basic, Intermediate, and SloFlow workouts and love them all.If you are new to this type of body work, please give yourself time to learn the moves. Modify as needed to make the postures work for you, and go at your own pace. When I first started with the Basic DVD, I could NOT get through the whole thing, and honestly felt very discouraged. But if you keep at it, your body will learn the moves, and you WILL see results. My stance is taller, my stomach is flatter, my thighs are more toned, and my arms are definitely MUCH stronger.

"I just wrote a very long review about how I make Kombucha in my New Wave Enviro Porcelain Water Dispenser, Black.  These bottles are an essential part of that process, and I'm so glad I finally got them! I got so tired of making a nice, bubbly batch of booch, only to have it go flat and vinegary within days after decanting.I decanting my brew into these bottles, and then do a second ferment with some juice for a few days on the counter. Now my kombucha tastes as good and is just as fizzy as store-bought stuff, without all the packing, processing, shipping, and landfill waste that accompanies store-bought products.The only thing I would change is that I would try to find 12oz bottles, since 16oz is more than I usually drink at one sitting. Yes, I can recap and put back in fridge, but like any carbonated product, it's best when first opened.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMSZJID5S8HA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CIFIDO#wasThisHelpful","RBMSZJID5S8HA","A3A56XDU9H2WUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A56XDU9H2WUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read other reviews about broken crocks and leaking spigots, and almost didn't buy this product. Amazon had one that was used for a good discount, so I decided to give it a try. It arrived in perfect shape and on time. Per the instructions, I tightened the inside of the spigot, and then filled it with hot water to help seal the gasket. No leaks!After putting in my first batch of kombucha, I used the plastic top ring as a weight to hold down the two handkerchiefs that I use for a top filter. From the first batch of booch until now, this has worked perfectly for me! It sits in an out-of-the way corner of my kitchen counter until I need to fill it or decant it. Because it is opaque ceramic, I don't need to worry about excess light ruining the brew.Decanting is so easy with the spigot on this crock! I insert the end of funnel into one of my flip-top bottles. Turn on the spigot and fill the bottle to desired level. Repeat until there is just enough tea to keep the SCOBY floating above the spigot. That leaves enough starter tea for the next batch. If desired, use a mesh bag over your funnel to strain out the ""mother"" that will come through the spigot, especially as you get towards the end of your decanting process. You can also strain/decant quickly into a larger container, such as a one-gallon jar, and then decant a second time into bottles without the need for straining. Do whatever works for you and what you have around as far as materials.To make a new batch of tea, boil six cups of water. Stir in two cups of sugar until dissolved. You can also leave it on for 5-10 minutes to make a sugar syrup (I do this because I think it makes a better-tasting booch, but that's up to you). Turn off the heat and steep about five tea bags, or 2-3 T of loose-leaf organic tea in a mesh bag, for about 30 minutes. This is way less tea and a longer steep time than often recommended, but I find it a good way to economize on that expensive organic tea.When everything has cooled down to room temp, pour it into the crock. The tea level should not go past the narrow neck of the crock, since the SCOBY needs room to breath. Put on your cheesecloth or other cloth cover (I use two handkerchiefs), weight down with the plastic top ring that came with the crock, and wait for your booch to brew itself. Begin tasting after 4-5 days to make sure it doesn't go all vinegary on you.I also like to do a second decant on the counter. This requires filling the flip-top bottles just to where the neck begins to narrow. Add some pure fruit juice (POM is amazing) until there is just 1.5"" of headspace left in the bottle. Put on the cap, and let bottle sit out on the counter for two days or so. The mixture will build up carbonation and get a bit sweeter, too. You may need do suction out (or pour and strain) some large blobby ""mothers"" that aren't bad for you but may give you the creeps if you have texture issues and accidentally ingest them (ask me how I know, haha).Best wishes for a successful batch of booch!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PG56U4MC5S0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AW6PD04#wasThisHelpful","R3PG56U4MC5S0H","A3A56XDU9H2WUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A56XDU9H2WUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This SCOBY arrived on time and in great shape. It sat in the fridge for a few days (oops) until I had time to brew my kombucha tea.  I made a one-gallon batch, put it in a large crock, and added the SCOBY. Ten days later, I had some good kombucha!Since then, this SCOBY grows like crazy; it usually covers the entire top of the liquid in my 2-gallon crock. I have to trim it down at least once a month or it starts to grow out of the top of the crock! Due to the size and strength of the SCOBY, and the fact that I keep the crock next to the fridge (which generates some warmth), my brew is normally done in 5-6 days now. I make 6 quarts at a time. When combined with the two pints or so of starter tea that I leave in the crock each time, the end results are just perfect for filling 12-14 flip-top bottles.I'm really happy with this SCOBY and recommend it to anyone who wants to get started making kombucha. Also, the Amazon price for this SCOBY, along with a 2-gallon crock and some flip-top bottles, was WAAAAYYY less than those kombucha starter kits that are advertised on some websites.

"Unfortunately, the mesh isn't fine enough to keep the tea from floating out into the water. Since I bought this primarily to use loose-leaf organic tea leaves for making kombucha, it doesn't really work for my intended purposes. However, I have been able to repurpose it for putting bay leaves in soup or stew. I wouldn't have purchased it solely for that reason, but now that I have it, I do appreciate not having to fish around for the bay leaves and hope I got them all out.Back to tea - I ended up buying a nylon mesh nut-milk bag and use that instead for steeping the tea leaves in my kombucha tea. The bag is way larger than needed, but I use the extra to tie around the pot handle so it's easy to take the bag out when I'm done. Works very well and keeps all the leaves out of my tea.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354ZI72ZETZDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BU7TV2#wasThisHelpful","R354ZI72ZETZDW","A3A56XDU9H2WUQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A56XDU9H2WUQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I do think that fellow shoppers would appreciate the feedback, though (as I would), so I will share that this was the most awful soup that anyone in my family had ever tried. we enjoy bean soups and veggie soups, are big fans of chickpeas and LOVE Moroccan food, so we expected to enjoy this soup. the flavor has nothing to do with Moroccan flavors, though, as it is not reminiscent of chermoula, tagine, harissa (which is what we thought it might taste like) or any other Moroccan flavors. instead, it is a tart and sour soup with no other discernible flavors. worst, it has a very thick, slimy, translucent quality to it, as it has been made with a ton of cornstarch--similar in texture to chinese egg drop soups (but without the egg). I really cannot say anything positive about this soup. the picture looks appetizing and the name makes it sound like something exotic and tasty, but it is nothing more than deceptive marketing. those who made it must know how foul it is, and that it does not resemble Moroccan cooking in any way.

"I bought one for myself and one for my mother, who was delighted with her gift (she literally can't stop looking at her mug). : ) what a pretty mug. aside from the aesthetics, I love how light and ergonomic these mugs are. there is something about the weight and shape, feel, size, and the way the fingers wrap around the handle that feels more comfortable than most mugs. the dot design along the top of the pattern makes me think of a headscarf that an old polish gypsy woman might wear, with little beads dangling from it. I now have three different designs by this company, and they all make my tea--or hot cocoa, or coffee--seem that much more special. at first I thought the mugs were slightly smaller than the mugs I was used to, but then I realized that my tea tastes so much better now (which means I have been diluting it by filling my larger, 14 oz mugs to the brim, just because I could). these mugs are so very beautiful, pleasant to hold, and have the perfect balance and light, airy weight. they are great quality stoneware with a lovely natural, unpainted ceramic on the inside, and the designs are even more beautiful in person. it might sound silly to say this, but when I first put my fingers through the handle and felt the weight of the mug, even when full of hot tea, it felt obvious to me that every other mug I have owned had been forcing me to contort my fingers in some uncomfortable and probably unnatural way--and that I just hadn't realized it before. drinking from this mug does not leave a welt on my fingers either, which I have always gotten from mugs (maybe they have all been too heavy, and the handles too narrow and placed in a weird way?). this mug is the perfect large size (meaning not TOO large) and somehow feather-light. it just seems like the stoneware is both lighter than commercially produced (and also easily breakable) ceramic mugs, and that it was specifically designed for a human hand (make sense? if not, just buy yourself one, and you'll see..).

I initially purchased one to give away and now add one or two now and then to complete my orders to qualify for free shipping, as I have found them to fit even my own large, adult woman head, which made them all the more perfect to keep a couple for our use at home and also to give away (in fact, I would dare to call them ""one size fits all"" hats rather than ""toddler kids"" hats). the fabric is cheap, which makes the 2.99 price just right, but the assembly is not bad. these are good looking disposable (or at least mourning-free, when you eventually lose them) hats for kicking around in, and I especially like them for giving away, as they are both warm & comfortable and also happy looking (and who doesn't like peace signs?). they are knit on the outside, fleece inside, and very soft and toasty. for a cold house with no heating system, they make great night caps that you can pull over your ears for added coziness. I used to carry a couple of extra clean, warm accessories that no one was using anymore in my backpack for giving away to folks when I was working in the city, specially in the wintertime. these would have been perfect. I love the beige one that I kept for myself, and my mother loves her black one (the grey one is very nice too).

"I purchased these elsewhere, but am surprised to see what they are selling for here. these mushy, stringy clams are not what I would call ""prized."" fresh littlenecks, which are available from our own seas and without need to purchase imported or from out of cans, are tastier, cleaner, and both sweeter and brinier tasting, with a much more delicate texture--all without the mushiness. the razor clams from this brand are better than this ""prized"" variety, and worth the try. they have a pleasant flavor and a very nice texture once cooked that reminds me of squid (and they are very nice out of the can as well).

"inferior cereal. it used to be wonderful a couple of years ago and had a lovely crunch and a very authentic cacao taste (very different from the synthetic, chocolate candy taste of cocoa crispies) and was just a joy. we used to purchase it regularly. the quality has since dropped dramatically, while the pricing has skyrocketted to almost twice the retail price from a couple of years ago. I am not sure what these prices are based on. one box was always just over 4 bucks at WF stores, and two boxes could be purchased for 5 or 6 bucks when on sale. I have no idea what is going on with the manufacturing of this cereal that could have made it both an inferior product now and also somehow justify the added expense.

"folks, this is not a sipping tea. it is not a tea time drink for sharing or anything that you are meant to drink simply for pleasure. you really do need to use your computers to educate yourselves on what things are for--specially when it comes to food and health supplements. slippery elm is slippery--that is why it is called slippery elm. it is right on the box--it is not just an ingredient in a tea blend. you are buying a box of the powdered inner bark from a tree. before purchasing this product, you really should already be familiar with what it is and be looking to treat a specific ailment. slippery elm bark, when simmered in water, releases a mucilaginous substance that is typically used to lubricate your entire digestive tract, in and out. it is traditionally used for soothing sore throats (are you familiar with thayers throat lozenges?), digestive discomfort, and even for calming hemorrhoids. it does not have any kind of taste at all. if you want to feel like you are drinking tea, you can add something to the water you are going to simmer it in, or you can drop a tea bag in when it is done simmering, turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let it steep. personally, I simmer my slippery elm for 15 mins with a couple of broken up star anise, as the spice has benefits that I am also in need of. it makes a pretty pink brew that tastes great too. you can drink your slippery elm any way you like (in fact, you can also simmer it with a half tsp of cloves instead of the star anise for a sore throat, as cloves have a very numbing effect), if you do not like it plain. it is a great carrier for additional herbal or spice remedies. it is not slimy. it simply produces a slightly thickened water that is extremely soothing to your entire tract, on contact (if and when you need it). it is the main ingredient in a wonderful lozenge that has been around for a very long time and is used by singers for its soothing effect on the throat: Thayers Slippery Elm Lozenges, Cherry, 150 Count. if any of this sounds like what you are in need of, I highly recommend this tea to you. if not, and if you are one of those folks who confused this herbal remedy for a box of sipping tea and then came to review it as if it were a box of sipping tea, you really need to be more aware. this brand sells herbs that are meant for medicinal, therapeutic purposes and can be prepared as teas--that is all. small children are known for picking random things up and drinking them, so we need to be mindful of them. we are adults, though, and should really know to be mindful of these things for ourselves. we are none of us above errors in judgment, but I think returning to review a product unfairly even after our error has become apparent is a bit unfair, both to the brand and to other shoppers. this is a wonderful product with benefits that will be very well-received by anyone in need of them. fyi, though, a box will typically be found in-store for 11.99 or less (ie, at WF).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29K9HWA0FS9GQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001W3BJHM#wasThisHelpful","R29K9HWA0FS9GQ","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these sardines, as well as the regular king oscar double layer which are similar, because of the positive references to these ""tiny tots"" on different reviews for sardines of all kinds here, and cannot help but share that I was disappointed. I was able to try one can due to an issue with my 3 pack order but, even within the realm of us folks who enjoy canned fish, sardines in particular, it is all an acquired taste, and tastes do differ. some folks like their sardines big, some small. I tend to enjoy all varieties of a favorite thing for their own merits, but I cannot join the club in favor of these tiny tots. they are not just tiny--they are soft, mushy and flavorless. I am a fan of bela portuguese sardines, which are huge (maybe 4 sardines per can), plump, and very, very meaty. they are firm sardines that can stand up to a fork without a problem, and feel like a substantial fish meal. I like that. they also taste and smell incredible. but that is my personal preference. I gave these tiny guys a chance and I know I would have liked them just fine, had I not found them to be mushy and flavorless. I sprinkled some paprika on them and ate them anyway. they were not at all unpalatable, just not my cup of fish tea. they were tail-on and headless, and they were clean enough and packed nicely. I have no complaints. but I will not be trading in my belas for these or any other tiny sardines any time in the future. if these are the sardines you grew up with and you have some nostalgic associations with them, then these will likely always hold a special place in your heart. but if you do have an opportunity to try bela, I highly recommend you do so, specially the plain olive oil variety: Bela-Olhao Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive Oil, 4.25 Ounce -- 12 per case you may discover something you've been missing out on, and may enjoy switching it up from time to time (hey, I gave your tiny tots a shot) ; ) two other brands that I highly recommend are sclafani: Skinless and Boneless Portuguese Sardines in Pure Olive Oil Eight Packs of 3.75 Oz Net Weight and angelo parodi: ( http://www.amazon.com/Angelo-Parodi-Portuguese-Mackerel-Fillets/dp/B001UFZETQ/ref=sr_1_3?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1429639685&sr=1-3&keywords=angelo+parodi+sardines). they are both equally delicious, and are also both bit smaller than the bela (both are 3.99 at your local italian grocer, btw).

"I did not ultimately enjoy these kippers. : ( I had once relished TJ's smoked kippers (my favorites in texture, flavor, and smell), until I realized that they had been swimming in canola oil all along and I had not noticed. I had not found any kippers to substitute my favorites that I really felt good about until I came across these Harbor Bay kippers, which are also naturally smoked (not smoke flavored), and I liked that they are simply packed in a tiny bit of water. however, the filets are so very limp, mushy, slimy, and gritty, with chunks of...salt? to be found and crunched through randomly. the filets are also skin on and have bits of fin still on them. they are very pungently fishy, reminding me of a scandinavian delicacy that consists of fish left to ferment for months in a pail (no, I have never tried it--but the smell and flavor of these kippers certainly reminds me of what I imagined that fermented fish to taste like through my tv screen). I ate two tins with a lovely mustard from TJ's that much improved them: Trader Joes Mustard Miscellany Gift Set: Provencal; Blackcurrant; Chablis; Basil upon opening the third tin, though, these kippers began to go downhill, and I began finding stringier and slimier bits in the tins, found them to be mushier and mushier, and also found I no longer found the smell in the slightest bit novel. I gave these a chance and was very positive at first, but they did not grow on me, but rather...shrunk on me?. if you are a fan of anything I am describing, I recommend having them with a nice mustard, particular the TJ's assortment I shared, if you can find any past the holidays (it is lovely with sardines or made into salad dressings). in my opinion, though, these kippers may be up there with the best quality, most natural, and healthiest, but they do not win any prizes in taste, smell or texture.

"we have been missing our traditional sorini brand marrons glacee and marzipan panettone every holiday since williams sonoma switched bakeries a handful of years ago for an inferior product. we have tried several different brands since, and this panettone is the first one that we have been impressed with. we purchased a fiasconaro panettone with candied pineapple and pistachios for a friend, and it smelled so good through the wrapping that we returned to purchase this pear and chocolate panettone for ourselves. it was soft and moist (though neither as much as our old favorite), and the aroma was very nice, as it is flavored and scented with pear william liquor. it is dotted with raisins throughout, glazed with white chocolate and sprinkled with chocolate ""b-b's,"" and had (and this is our only complaint) only a few tiny pieces of candied pear at the very bottom of the cake, as if they had dropped to the very bottom of the batter in the pan and stayed there. we would have loved it with more candied pear, but I still could not rate it 5 stars, after having known and loved sorini. compared to every other available brand out there, though, including williams sonoma's current holiday offering in a collector's tin (priced at twice the price of our fiasconaros), fiasconaro is the clear winner so far, and our recommendation.

"we really enjoyed this mackerel, and found it to be the best we have had on all counts (we had previously enjoyed the conservas de cambados brand of mackerel, but have found the brand to be entirely inconsistent, and with recent batches of fish appearing rubbery, grey and tasteless). we had tried several different brands of fancy smoked and in-olive oil mackerel in between, and angelo parodi was a pleasant surprise, and exactly what we had been hoping for. the mackerel is skinless, boneless, and completely clean of any internal organs or vessels, as all other brands of mackerel have also been. angelo parodi's mackerel in particular is firm and meaty, not mushy or flaky, and the taste is something between the cleanest and highest-end tuna and chicken, of all things. it is also very juicy. the taste of the oil in the can is also like a very low-sodium chicken broth, which we enjoyed (no, there is no actual chicken flavor in the fish or its oil--they are just so entirely absent that typical fishy flavor or smell one would expect, that I can think of nothing better to compare them to). this brand is new to us, and we really appreciate that they are not heavy handed in their use of salt--there is the merest whisper of salt in the can, enough to accent but also respect the naturally clean flavor of the fish. we did not purchase these from amazon, as our local italian grocer sells the same product for $4 a can (same size), and so will only purchase here when the price is right, either as an add-on or in bulk. aside from the current pricing, I recommend this product very highly, and without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6UB1D3TKRRHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UFZETQ#wasThisHelpful","R6UB1D3TKRRHS","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I LOVE toasted hemp seeds, and I LOVE chocolate, but I did not enjoy this product. I tend to be unable to set chocolate aside for more than a minute. this bag arrived several days ago, I had about a teaspoon's worth of it and put it in the fridge (it arrived fine), and I have yet to feel the urge to have any more. I just did not find the hemp and the chocolate to be compatible textures or flavors, and the chocolate glaze being subpar does not improve on the idea at all (it is that very kind that you have to chew and swirl around your mouth for too long a time before you realize that it is waxy and not at all dissolving, like real chocolate would). the chocolate is also very sweet. the hemp seeds as well are not ideal, and I found them not to have the crunch that toasted hemp seeds alone usually have (to be fair, I am not implying that they were not fresh--coating them with this waxy chocolate glaze probably imparted some unwanted moisture to them). food products that are at first unexpected to me will always grow on me if they have redeeming qualities. I just am not finding this to be the case with this product.

This looks like a good light and feels light and comfortable to hold, but apparently there are some defects. catching Amazon Customer Service on a bad or off night was not a positive ending to a bad experience either, regardless of my eventual refund, which I am expecting to see in the next couple of days. Amazon really needs to supervise its reps, specially those that work during the Help Chat night shifts, because there is a lot of insensitivity towards customers and occasional mocking and disrespectful behavior like putting a customer on hold and not ever returning, so a customer might wait 20 minutes before realizing they were being had, or having fun at a customer's expense by hearing them ask for help regarding one item or issue and replying regarding a completely different item or order, over and over, while the customer is correcting them, just for fun.

"the nuts were all stale. the expiration date on the bottom of the bag was well off, which makes me think that either the manufacturer sourced some already stale nuts for its mix, or Amazon might not have its act together as far as temperature and storage for its raw and organic food products. either way, I am going to give it a bit of time and then re-order, as the mix itself is, I think, the best I have had. perfect combination of fruits and nuts, and the flavor combination was delightful, aside from the stale nuts. it is currently on sale and I thought of purchasing a couple more bags, but now that I think about it, Amazon might indeed be refreshing its stock, so I think I will wait until the price goes back up again and cross my fingers that I receive a new batch. by the time you read this, I think you should be fine, and I highly recommend this product. just give Amazon some honest feedback on those nuts if they seem off (or, better yet, the manufacturer?). cheers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT7UEPCSGDE22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP6LIQI#wasThisHelpful","RT7UEPCSGDE22","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Living Intentions Superfood Cereals, and so is my family. We love the Hemp & Greens as a morning cereal with bananas and milk, and also as a dry treat, straight out of the bag. As a really special treat, we also enjoy the Cacao Crunch and Acai Blueberry (though these two are more difficult to stop snacking on). We were really looking forward to trying Chia Ginger, being lovers of both ginger and chia seeds. We were shocked at how awful this variety was, though, finding that it tasted as if some kind of soap or cleaner had gotten into the mix. I looked at every ingredient on that bag and nothing would explain the flavor. Chemical or botanical-based, there is a very strong soapy flavor in this bag. It may have just been the one batch, but I would not repeat and definitely not recommend Chia Ginger.

"""Natural Honey Flavor, Natural Lavender Flavor, Natural Vanilla Flavor.."" that is a whole lot of ""flavors""--what are the actual ingredients? Petrol-based flavorings are often snuck in as ""natural flavors"" under warped FDA loopholes designed to support the industry. Not to mention that many things that you or I would not put in our mouths, however ""natural"" they might truly be, are often used in place of costlier, authentic ingredients, with the FDA's full blessing. And even when a legitimately natural and truly food-based ingredient with a similar flavor profile is used as a substitute (as in the case of lemon myrtle for lemon), folks have a right to know what is in their food regardless of a manufacturer's proprietary concerns. Along with Yogi's unhealthy choice in tea bags and its sudden obsession with adding stevia to most of the teas in its line (aside from the manufacturing process of powdered, white stevia being about as bad as any of those commercial artificial sweeteners, doesn't Yogi think its customers have a right to decide whether to sweeten their teas or not, and what with?), now we see ""flavors"" on all of their teas, as opposed to a genuine ingredients list. I don't know what changes have been made at Yogi at a corporate level, but it is just not the same company any more, with anywhere near the same ethics. Some of their teas are better than others, but this is not one of them. Always take a look at that ingredients panel if it is pictured here. If it is not, then purchase from a store where you can pick it up and look at it. I definitely do not recommend this one tea. All my ingredient concerns aside, it isn't just aromatic--it actually tastes like body lotion or soap and leaves an itchy feeling behind in the throat (and, for reference, I enjoy lavender honey, violet ""mints,"" rose tea and preserves, and all of these floral flavors and scents in marshmallows).","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVBY3T4VNWWXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007M8FRV0#wasThisHelpful","RVBY3T4VNWWXN","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"this caramel was a very nice treat. it has a lovely, liquidy texture (I assume because it is made with goat milk rather than cream) and has an amazingly rich, creamy, buttery caramel taste. it is not at all gamey or ""goaty,"" and is just perfect for folks with lactose issues and who cannot enjoy conventional dairy products. it is a little sweeter than I would have liked, and I think that maybe Fat Toad Farm overcompensated a bit much for the natural saltiness of the goat milk with the extra sugar (and I actually think the slight saltiness of the goat milk, if allowed to shine through, would have been a very nice and special touch, something like gourmet caramels topped with fleur de sel). I have to say, though, that I really did not make the mental connection I should have, for how tiny this little jar would be (that picture above is fiSHEye mAGNIFied, my friend). this jar is literally the same jar used by manufacturers of eye cream (yes--it is that small), and two fairies could have flown away with this itty bitty jar between the two of them without straining a single teeny tiny fairy muscle. I tend to go for the smaller size of a thing, specially when that smaller size is on offer here, until I know I love it enough to order a larger portion or even a bulk order. In this case, though, I am kicking myself for not holding out for a friendlier price (or at least Free Shipping) for the very largest--but actually just closer to normal sized--jar. I will not make that mistake in my next order. I am keeping an eye out for Amazon Free Shipping offers of one or even two full-sized jars together--hopefully a variety pack of this same Original plus one of their more exotic flavors (like Bourbon, which sounds like something a lover of vanilla would enjoy). : ) If you ever spot that, grab it without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBWYUQBSFR90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHXSV1O#wasThisHelpful","REBWYUQBSFR90","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really enjoying this tea, which I have purchased from Amazon many times now. I can see why it is called ""honeybush,"" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are. If you are looking for a mellow and pleasant cup of tea that is smooth and easy without being harsh on the stomach or nerves or, alternately, putting you to sleep, I recommend giving this honeybush tea a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P3JWHNHG2TWP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00142DPE6#wasThisHelpful","R2P3JWHNHG2TWP","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These chocolates have a very thin dark chocolate shell and inner milk chocolate shell surrounding a ball of both almond and pistachio marzipan with a tiny hazelnut chocolate center which has a touch of liquor in it. They are pretty sweet but good, and the chocolate is high quality. I did not realize, though, there was more than one company out there making Mozart Kugel chocolates. I enjoyed them, but they were not the chocolates I remember having and which I thought I was ordering, of the same Mozart theme. The ones I remember had a decadent, thicker, deeply dark chocolate and thinner milk chocolate shell. I remember being floored by the flavor and aroma of the almond and pistachio marzipan layers, which I somehow also remember being a little bit warm and heady, as if there might have been a touch of stronger brandy or some other liquor in them (or maybe it was in the hazelnut center?). Also, I think the chocolate hazelnut center was a larger part of the center. My memory is a bit hazy because it has been a while since I last indulged in these chocolates, but I do remember them being a little bit warmer (though not overly boozy) and with a more pronounced, almost amaretto-like marzipan taste and richer dark chocolate. Maybe my taste buds have aged and lost their tolerance for sweet notes, but, although these chocolates were not at all bad, I did find them to have a sweeter and maybe slightly commercial flavor to them (does that make any sense?), and I also found them less aromatic, overall. I did enjoy them and do recommend them, but am basically sharing my more detailed input in case another shopper out there can maybe help jar my memory to the right direction, and maybe the right Mozart kugels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D7V3W9JEKN4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LW4NCI#wasThisHelpful","R3D7V3W9JEKN4C","A1NL9K9DR9QT4L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NL9K9DR9QT4L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like spicy, warm, exotically fruity molasses, leaning more towards a honeylike base flavor than a fruit preserve fruitiness. Not tart, but rather rootsy, botanical and warming. I had tried one other organic chyawanprash, from Organic India, and had reviewed that one as having a tougher texture but also a higher quantity of medicinal roots, fruits, herbs, and botanicals, and also had originally found it less sweet, and so had preferred it. I purchased about a dozen jars direct from Organic India after first ordering here, but as I worked my way through the first couple of jars, I found the texture in each progressive jar becoming tougher and tougher to work out (apparently, they dry rather quickly), until I finally unsealed a fresh jar to find a solid mass my spoon could not push or break through. I recently placed another order with Banyan Botanicals and included a few jars of their chyavanprash, and was very pleased, again, to find its consistency so spreadable and easy. I just finished one jar of this chyavanprash and will have to get back to my Organic India stock and do my best with those jars, but I wanted to come back and share my reconsidered review. These are still my two favorite chyawanprashes (sp?), but I now feel that Banyan is probably the better of the two. It does contain fewer botanicals, but that may even be by design (how many of those things can possibly be compatible all at once to our human system? after all, these ingredients are all potent!). I also had originally thought it was much sweeter than the Organic India chyawanprash, but, on second thought, I may have had that other chyawanprash after eating a piece of fruit or something, because I find them almost equal in sweetness now. If you are interested in trying both, please do. If you get a fresh jar of Organic India chyawanprash, it will be a nice treat too. If you are only looking for one, though, maybe Banyan Botanicals would be your best bet. The product is more consistent and smooth in texture, there is nothing grainy or gritty in it, it is delicious, and it is easy to spoon out from the jar. After one jar, I am sure you will return for more. Please contact your seller and request care in shipping, though, as these jars are glass and fragile, and can break in transit (it happened to me once).

"I received two of this product in error, as I had ordered one bag of these ""Nougat"" twists, and one bag of the ""Classic,"" pistachio marzipan and hazelnut nougat twists (one from a seller, and the other from Amazon stock). I enjoy marzipan, and so was looking forward to the one bag I did not receive, and ultimately did not enjoy this other chocolate very much at all. I found the chocolate itself cloyingly sweet, with the sugar level overpowering any flavors in the filling, which was a disappointment, specially since I now had two bags of the product. They were also very tiny, oval chocolate eggs, the kind you see around Easter (but tinier), which is not what I expected, from looking at the picture (the chocolates in the photo reminded me of those Toffifay caramel cups, and so I thought these chocolates would be either cups or maybe actual chocolate balls and that the picture was intended as an inside view of the filling). I gave both bags as a treat to a senior center and then regretted it, realizing there are probably a few diabetic folks over there.

"We LOVE these chocolates at home, and so does everyone who we have ever shared them with (and they are often described back to us years later by folks wanting to know where they might find them). The chocolate is high content, high quality, deep, dark chocolate (the kind that actually melts in your body-temp fingertips) that is rounded in character and not bitter, the marzipan has a very recognizable almond taste and aroma and a great, naturally chewy texture, the plum marmalade is delightful, and the madeira is incredibly warm and heady. This is the perfect chocolate for mature palates that enjoy their chocolate deeply dark and not overly sweet (they are still sweet, mind you, but short of becoming cloying), and who enjoy a touch of liquor in their desserts, but not anything overly boozy. I have tried the apricots in brandy as well and they are very good, but these plums in madeira are the very best of the Anthon Berg fruits in liquor, I think. I would love Amazon to offer mixed boxes at the same price (a box of plum and a box of apricot, for example, or all four, including cherry and grape, which I have not yet tried), as I have been wanting to share around the other flavors as well. These being our favorites, though, I have not been able to bring myself to ordering two whole boxes at a time of any other variety except plum (and this offer of two boxes for 24.99 is the reason I opted to purchase these here, through Amazon. If you look very hard, it is possible to find them elsewhere for less, but they have always been hard to find, like any good thing). They come in generously sized, individually wrapped, single-serving pieces, and are so very easy to share with a special friend or loved one. If you have not tried these chocolates yet and are reading our reviews, you should dive in and order the two boxes of this plum in madeira variety.

"I purchased the three varieties of Iceland seaweed available here: Kelp, Dulse, and Wakame. I have yet to try the Kelp (I purchased it for use in beans and for dashi broth) and found the Dulse extremely salty (compared to the Maine Coast Dulse that I also purchased, and which was more minerally-sweet than salty), but I really enjoyed the Wakame. I have yet to cook with this Wakame like a serious adult. I did, however, pan toast a few strips in a bit of olive oil (gnawing on a raw piece was very difficult, as it felt more like a chew toy than like something that would eventually biodegrade). This made a fantastic snack that was incredibly crunchy and flavorful, with no need for salting. I have not tried soaking this Wakame yet (or the Dulse, for that matter).

"This is an interesting addition to your Gardena watering system, but one that I'm not sure you really need if you already own something like their multifunction sprayer. The thing is, unless you want to use a nozzle instead of a spray gun, there really isn't much difference between using the multifunction sprayer on the fine spray setting. Just like the spray gun, you can vary the intensity/throughput (rotate the orange part of this nozzle, vs. the knob at the back of the spray guns), but there is no changing the pattern.Additionally, and this I am not too thrilled with, when you first open the sprayer, that's when you get the most intense spray. You have to then dial it down from there. It works similar to their ""classic"" nozzle in this regard. Takes some getting used to, for sure. Another drawback vs. the spray gun is that while you have an on/off on the gun without changing intensity settings, there is no means to do that here. As with the ""classic nozzle"", to stop the flow of water, you need to close off the valve and completely shut it off. That can be a bummer if you're going between nearby plantings, since you'll spend a lot more time re-opening and adjusting the spray intensity downward each time you need to re-start the flow of water.Does it work? Yes. Does it do anything special or particularly better than the spray gun? Not really, quite the opposite actually. On the other hand, if you want the control mechanism of a nozzle, but with the fine spray output instead of a stream, this will do the job. The question is why you would choose to use this over a spray gun in any circumstance? If you don't have a spray gun with this type of pattern, this is a better option than spending the money for another sprayer, but most people have a spray gun that has this pattern (or something close to it) already.So there you have it. If you don't already have a watering implement that covers this type of pattern, this would be a good addition to fill the gap, but I don't think it's necessarily worth adding if you already have a multifunction sprayer. There may be instances where the form factor is more suited, or issues of personal preference, but on balance, it's a niche watering tool that most people already have covered with their multifunction sprayers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4IBIETWBI6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OY0KHU#wasThisHelpful","RJ4IBIETWBI6B","A333636QFPT073","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A333636QFPT073?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Top quality, made-in-Germany adapter for your garden hoses, to be used with the Gardena system. Typical set up is to screw one of these on the female end of your garden hose and then slap a model 39004-G onto the hose bib and couple the two together. This is nice, except that if you want to connect two hoses together, you then need a double sided male adapter, which is not sold (to my knowledge) in a metal configuration (and I wouldn't trust a plastic one). If you need one, you can make one by combining this 39004-G with a 39022-G to get a double-sided metal version, but that's an expensive setup.In my case, I prefer to use a 39018 screwed onto the (male) hose bib connection, a 39022-G screwed into the female end of the hose and another 39018 on the other (male) end of the hose. In either setup, you invest in 3 pieces of the Gardena system in order to be able to quick-disconnect your hoses at both ends, but if you go with the latter, you can connect two hoses in series without ever needing an adapter. Furthermore, if you remove your hose from the hose bib to store it, you won't leave your 39004-G out in the open with its rubber seal rotting in the elements. The only downside is that if you have a 39018 on the hose bib, the water-stop features means you can't use the hose bib without a hose or other connector inserted into it. For dedicated outside gardening/watering hose bibs, I don't know the last time I wanted to use it without a hose connector, so this is a non-issue for me, but your measurements might vary.An alternative to mitigate the water-stop on the hose bib side, albeit more expensive, would be to get a double sided female adapter and connect this 39017 directly to your hose bib with that, rather than using a 39018. This way you get the benefit of not needing an adapter to connect hoses in series, AND you can flow water out of the spigot/hose bib freely when you disconnect the hose (via the 39022-G).All that said, I did purchase one of these 39017's just in case I needed it or wanted to change configurations, or if I needed to build an adapter of some kind. These are top quality, German-made components and miles beyond the Melnor, Gilmour and other imported China junk you can find at the stores these days. I'd been a Luddite for years, avoiding a quick disconnect system, because of quality issues with the components. Gardena has been a welcome change and I'll gladly pay the premium for their authentic, German parts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IBLCJCW81U2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y9YGQC#wasThisHelpful","R3IBLCJCW81U2S","A333636QFPT073","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A333636QFPT073?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Top quality, made-in-Germany adapter for your hose bib (or garden hose) to be used with the Gardena system. Typical set up is to screw one of these on tot he hose bib instead of the hose, and then slap a model 39017 quick disconnect onto the female end of your garden hose and couple the two together. This is nice, except that if you want to connect two hoses together, you then need a double sided version of this tool, which is not sold (to my knowledge) in a metal configuration. If you need one, you can make one by combining this 39004-G with a 39022-G to get a double-sided metal version, but that's an expensive setup.In my case, I prefer to use a 39018 screwed onto the (male) hose bib connection, a 39022-G screwed into the female end of the hose and another 39018 on the other (male) end of the hose. In either setup, you invest in 3 pieces of the Gardena system in order to be able to quick-disconnect your hoses at both ends, but if you go with the latter, you can connect two hoses in series without ever needing an adapter. Furthermore, if you remove your hose from the hose bib to store it, you won't leave your 39004-G out in the open with its rubber seal rotting in the elements. The only downside is that if you have a 39018 on the hose bib, the water-stop features means you can't use the hose bib without a hose or other connector inserted into it.

"I've become an avid fan of the Gardena system since trying out one of their spray guns and some of the quick disconnects. I don't usually use a spray nozzle like this model, but for some tasks, it really is better than anything else, so I decided to pick this up and give it a try. Why not have one more quick-disconnect accessory to play around with, after all?I was pleasantly surprised to find that this actually does the job extremely well, in fact better than some of the brass nozzles I have used in the past. You get a lot of power on the jet/pinpoint stream setting, in fact more power and narrower stream than you can achieve with, say, their trigger-style, 3-in-1 sprayer on the same stream setting. This makes it excellent for things like cleaning/pressure washing. The wider fan settings are also good, giving you an easy way to handle most watering tasks if you don't have a spray gun around. You also get pretty easy one-handed operation, unless you have unusually large/small hands. I saw reviewers state that it was an issue to adjust without using both hands, but I did not encounter that problem at all. And, in case anyone is wondering, yes, you can shut the sprayer completely off/closed by turning it all the way. Works perfectly and no leaks.As others have noted, the mechanism in this nozzle has one peculiarity, in that if you shut off the water and turn it back on, you get the jet/pinpoint stream setting again, regardless of where the nozzle is set (say a wide, fan setting). I was not able reproduce this by simple snagging the hose, as some suggested, but if you completely cut off the flow, it can happen. What you need to do is then turn/twist the sprayer completely off, then re-open / twist back to your desired setting. It's a little annoying, yes, but honestly I don't know how much of an issue it really is. Are you going to snag the hose in the middle of watering something? Probably not. Are you going to have the sprayer running while walking around and when the hose might actually have a chance of getting snagged? Probably not. Even if you snag the hose, will it be bad enough to completely cut the pressure off and cause this hiccup issue? Probably not, especially with pressure in the hose.Bottom line, I watered my whole backyard with this thing today, including moving around, purposely snagging the hose, purposely trying to bend it and cause this issue, and I wasn't able to do it. The only thing that worked was shutting it off at the hose bib/spigot and turning it back on. My humble opinion, but the few reviews that harp on this seem to be making a mountain out of a mole hill, and downplaying the really good features of this nozzle. It's well made (in Germany!), has a very nice grip, is easy to operate with one hand and gives you all the patterns you could possibly want for in a nozzle of this type. Output is very narrow and powerful on the stream setting and works superbly for cleaning and blasting away dirt on pavement/sidewalks/etc.A nozzle like this has its place and if you use the Gardena system of quick disconnects, you really shouldn't be without one of these. Well made and well functioning, I'd highly recommend it to anyone. Much preferred over any brass model I've used before and any of the plastic import junk at the stores.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38A5NI0HZ4GCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VED4NI#wasThisHelpful","R38A5NI0HZ4GCO","A333636QFPT073","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A333636QFPT073?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another nice pair of underwear from the ""gigolo"" line, this time in an aqua color. As with the orange mesh underwear they released last fall, this pair is a bit more concealing than, say, the white or black see-through kind. No, nothing is left to the imagination, but details are still obscured for some minimal amount of modesty, I suppose.Fit and finish wise, these are as good as any other AC offering. The waistband is nice, comfortable and a step up from the regular style (about twice as tell, if not more). Piping on the leg openings is nice and adds some contrast, while also snugging everything up. Plenty of room in the pouch on these as well, so everything sits right where it should.If you're into the ""gigolo"" line, these are definitely another nice pair to have. As I have said before, in this line, you really do feel 'almost naked' while wearing them, in addition to looking as such. Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0GJQNIJ521A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SZH4AOM#wasThisHelpful","R1P0GJQNIJ521A","A333636QFPT073","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A333636QFPT073?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you already have the Gardena 7-in-1 spray gun of the same style, you can definitely benefit from adding this particular 3-in-1, fully adjustable model to your lineup. The description on Amazon is misleading (although the item name and model # are correct), so I'll elaborate a bit on how this one differs from the 7-in-1 model.First, while you can somewhat replicate 2 out of the 3 modes this 3-in-1 model gives you with the other 7-in-1 sprayer, you have to realize that those are the 3 specific points along an infinitely variable spectrum, hence the ""fully adjustable"" part of this item's name. To put it another way, if you adjust the nozzle end of this 3-in-1 sprayer all the way to the left, you get a fine mist. This is not doable with the 7-in-1 spray gun. As you adjust from left to right, at the mid point, there is a mark with a wide spray pattern. This is approximately the same as one of the modes available on the 7-in-1 spray gun. If you turn/adjust furthest to the right, you get a narrow jet stream, again demarcated on the tip and another pattern you can get with the 7-in-1 gun.Where's the difference then, you ask? All the in-between for those 3 specific patterns! You can adjust this spray gun much like the familiar brass spray nozzles, it just so happens that along that spectrum, you can approximate some of the fixed patterns on the 7-in-1 sprayer. In a nutshell, this gives you the flexibility of a brass spray nozzle, but in the venerable Gardena trigger-operated sprayer form factor. You can control the flow at the back, you get on/off flexibility and auto-locking on/off as well. The advantage here is that, unlike a brass nozzle, if you have a setting you like, you can leave it there and still cut off the water flow, whereas on a brass nozzle you'd have to either shut it off at the hose bib or turn the nozzle all the way off, losing the spray pattern.Definitely a nice addition to your Gardena arsenal and something I highly recommend if you like their 7-in-1 sprayer of the same style. Both have their places and there's very little redundancy to having the pair as opposed to only one or the other. A bit pricey, but it includes a two year warranty and has German engineered, German built quality behind it. No leaks, no fuss, no muss and better features and ergonomics than anything else I've used. I won't go back to a brass nozzle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21ERJ5W7MOE6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJ92AP4#wasThisHelpful","R21ERJ5W7MOE6R","A333636QFPT073","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A333636QFPT073?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Took a chance on one of these from another retailer, before it became available on Amazon, but I felt compelled to write a review on here and share my enthusiasm for this pencil. I've used a lot of nice, higher end mechanical pencils, such as the Kuru Toga high grade lines and some of the Platinum OLEenu stuff, all of which have their own innovations to either hold the lead, rotate the lead, absorb shock, and so forth, and this pencil is right up there with them.What makes this one special, however, is that you get a couple features in one. First, there are two sets of stabilizing springs, separate from the standard spring when you advance the lead. One spring absorbs direct up/down shock, another is there to buffer the side to side load on the load by way of the floating tip. It's definitely cool to see the multiple springs there, and watch them in action, and they do work beautifully. It's no panacea for habitual lead breakers, but it does definitely cut down on it for most users. With other pencils, you probably break lead despite your best efforts, now and then, but with this one, you will notice readily that it happens very rarely.The other nice thing is that the entire pencil is very well made (in Japan) and looks stunning. The lead advancement has a very short throw, so you don't have to click it too far. Some people take issue with this, but for me, it kind of feels more finessed and easier to control, so I don't mind it at all. Also sounds more muted when you click it to advance the lead, not loud like some other mechanical pencils. Again, this gets to what I said about finessed and refined. All around, this thing oozes good design blended with eye-catching style.For anyone that's interested in high quality mechanical pencils with some advanced features, this is definitely a keeper. I purchased two, just to have a spare on hand, and have not been able to use anything else since I got it. It seems like in this market, there's always something new and exciting coming out, so who knows what's next, but as of this review, it is my favorite and my go-to pencil.

"This is a nice product, a good quality wing weeder that works as advertised. The metal is 12-gauge, not 7-gauge, as some have asked. Apparently Amazon has the right description in the detail section, but the title is incorrect. Still, fairly heavy duty for its intended purpose and it does work well. It's not a sharpened tool, so you might have to do that yourself, but depending on the medium you use it in, that probably won't be necessary. In my case, I have small 1/2"" to 1"" rock that I need to get into and weed between, and this tool will take the abuse that my hula hoe wouldn't be able to.If I have one gripe, it would probably be the angle of the head. Perhaps personal preference, but I would like it a bit wider than it is. As it stands, I feel like you have to bend over way too much to get the angle you need on the weeding head, especially when using a pulling motion, or edging along a line. The handle would be better if it were angled up more, so you don't have to stoop quite so much to get behind it and push/pull. Still, it's not a huge issue, but one I'll deduct a star for.Otherwise, build quality is excellent. You get the standard, albeit heavy duty fiberglass handle that Bully is known for, as well as pretty decent length and a very stout connection to the weeding head itself. Weld quality is very good, much better than the crap in the big box stores. I don't see how a human being could ever break this thing, so it will probably last a lifetime and the head will surely outlast the handle.Overall a nice addition to your weeding arsenal. Not the end all / be all, of course, but for situations where you want to weed in rough terrain or do close cuts against a border/wall/etc., I think this would be a superb choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZSJLPJC3D00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031575JU#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZSJLPJC3D00","A333636QFPT073","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A333636QFPT073?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awesome adapter for use with the Gardena system, superb quality and built like a tank. These things are weighty, properly coated to resist rust and have a very nice set of flutes cut into them to make it easy to tighten by hand, even when wet/slippery (or wearing gardening gloves). They are also fully interchangeable with their plastic counterparts, so you can mix and match without having to replace an entire system at once.As I pointed out in another review for the 39018 connector, I purchased one of these and two of the 39018 connectors, and was able to rig up a complete system for my backyard needs. Slap the 39022-G (this item) on the female end of your hose, then one 39018 on the male and a econd 39018 to your hose bib and voila! You can now quick disconnect your watering implements (e.g. sprayers, sprinklers, etc.) from the end of the hose AND you can quick disconnect the entire hose from the hose bib at will. For those that might want to store their hose indoors or be able to quickly remove it to make it easier to untangle or coil up, this will save you tons of time. Being able to swivel it on both ends will also make it easier to deal with snags/kinks. Because the connection the hose bib is entirely metal parts, you don't have to worry about stress from pulling on the hose either, since these connectors and adapters are considerably overbuilt and heavy duty.I could not be happier, and I am re-ordering another set to do the same setup with the hose in my front yard.

"I've wanted to switch to some kind of quick disconnect system over the years, having seen a plot of professional/commercial applications in nurseries and the like (and tiring of the battle to spin accessories on/off hoses over the years), but up until now, nothing had been satisfactory. The few I tried, whether metal or plastic, were always just absolute junk and turned me off to the whole concept.Enter the Gardena products and, in particular, this adapter. I bought it to swap out for the plastic one that came with my 7-in-1 Gardena sprayer, because you can't snug the plastic ones down without fear of breaking it and I wanted something that would endure better in the desert sun. There are still plastic parts on this adapter, of course, but not the critical connection to the hose where you want to snug it up and prevent any leaks. And, for those curious, unlike the grey vs. orange (Euro vs. North American) thread issue, I encountered absolutely no leaks when using these on my good old USA-made hoses. Whether it's because you can tighten them more or because they fit North American hose, I cannot say, but they don't leak a drop and that's the bottom line.In terms of fit and finish, these bad boys are miles ahead of the junk at the home improvement and big box retail outlets. They are heavy/weighty in the hand and that heft almost always correlates with quality. No cheap parts, no cheap metal, just loads of German engineered and German-made, uncompromising quality. The connections are quick, simple and rock solid, especially when coupled with metal adapters, although these will work with either metal or plastic versions, as they are fully interchangeable.In my case, I snagged two of these and one of the 39022-G premium metal adapters, and was able to rig up a complete system for my backyard needs. Slap the 39022-G on one end of your hose, the 39018 on the other and then a second 39018 to your hose bib and voila.

"Once you plug the device in, it starts filling the room with the smell of menthol, which really helps clear stuffed noses, especially children's, as their noses are so much more sensitive.  The smell is very pleasant and soothing, and the night light adds to this effect.  My only caveat is that, unlike a humidifier you can use and reuse, the device requires refills, which if bought regularly will no doubt end up costing more than the product itself (which is not that cheap either).  Also, you can't use it continuously in a sick room, as the device can only be used once every 8 hours.  For this reason, I've been using in the evening, just before I go to bed, so that I remember to unplug it first thing when I wake up.Overall it's good but it has limited usage unless you continue to buy refills.

"I'm giving this four stars because it seems to work better for men than for women, and for short hair than long.  I have fine hair with some curls, and when I used this it made it feel stiff and crunchy, like when you use too much hairspray. When hubby used this, however, it worked as good as his hair gel and made the waves in his hair look more molded and defined.

"I thought this mask would help me with an acne problem caused by age and hormonal changes.  While it reduced the redness beneath my eyes and made the rough skin left by a flattened pimple feel smoother, the mask itself felt gritty and too drying.  I think this product is best for teenagers and young adults who have problems with oily skin and acne.  My skin doesn't have as much oiliness anymore, so it felt irritated.

"I was a little wary about using this muffin mix after the oat cookie mix by the same company turned out to be disappointingly bland.As a result, I went all out, adding the less healthy stuff that would make vegans shudder:  a cup of dried cranberries that's been boiled for a few minutes in orange juice, 2 eggs, and a spoonful of blueberry jam.  After I poured the batter into my cupcake tray, I sprinkled some sugar on top of each one.  In addition, I followed the Bona Dea advice to add a tablespoon of white distilled vinegar to prevent dryness. It worked.My cranberry/orange muffins turned out pretty tasty, though the texture still wasn't the same as regular muffins.  If I had tried to stick to only healthy alternatives, however, I'm pretty sure these muffins would have turned out bland.  However, the fact that I had to add so much of the unhealthy stuff to make these more edible kind of discourage me from buying more in the future.  I mean, it's nice that it's organic, gluten-free, etc., but if I have to load it down with more fat just to get more flavor, I might well as well settle with getting a regular mix and add less sugar.It's too bad, since it has healthy, non-GMO ingredients and is perfect for those with a gluten allergy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VCTS03E5VCN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOWUUG#wasThisHelpful","R2VCTS03E5VCN0","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend of mine recently bought a ""fixer-upper"" house for cheap that he intends to renovate and flip for a higher price.  This set is not too expensive compared to other tools on the market out there.  The Lotos 2-in-1 comes with a staple gun, a small supply of oil to grease the gun, a rubber mallet, and a case.  It says goggles are included, but for some reason, mine didn't come with any.  It doesn't include staples or cleats, but they're easy enough to obtain from a hardware store.The tools are solidly made and heavy duty, which is good because installing a wood floor is not an easy project to do.

"The foam is very light and has a strong woodsy/after shave lotion cologne smell, like all the other AXE body care products. My husband didn't think it really ""cleanses"" your hair as the label claims.  It feels more like a dry shampoo or leave-in conditioner to disguise the fact you haven't had a real wash yet.  He used it right after a run and said it makes your hair feel less gross when you don't have time to shower, but unlike gel, it doesn't provide much hold.  He thinks the foam is mainly good for disguising the smell of sweat but it wasn't a product he'd feel compelled to use all the time.So overall this product might work well for others, but it didn't for him.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRG7WQDJ3KU8Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q70R43I#wasThisHelpful","RRG7WQDJ3KU8Y","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely set of three portable atomizers - each one has a nice glossy surface, which makes it easy to confuse it with a tube of fancy lipstick. When I got this set, I had no idea how to open it up so that I could fill it with my favorite cologne. As it turns out, it needs to be poked from the bottom, which is not easy and led to me spilling some perfume.I would have liked this design so much more if you could simply screw it open from the middle and pour in your oils or perfume. As it is, I wish the seller would include a clear diagram and instructions with each set they sold, as I had to go on the internet and research it in order to learn how to use it.Otherwise, it's a nice set to take with you while traveling (as long as it doesn't leak over time).

I deliberately did not use conditioner to see how well this shampoo would work on its own.

"After using this for 15 days and trying to eliminate the crows-nest wrinkles around my eyes, here's my review:PROS:• Easy to use, if a little uncomfortable (the laser makes your skin feel tingly and sensitive)• Short length of treatment: one minute, just before bedtime (recommended)•The light on the device tells you when to stop treatment – goes from green to purple then stops• Wrinkles are less noticeable but still visible, but overall it seems to be working.  I will update this review after the recommended 8 weeks and let you know.CONS:• You have to be very careful using it around your eyes.  The instruction warn that the laser can cause problems with vision if held too close, like to the eyes or eyelids. Yikes!• Don’t use if pregnant – which is ok, since the device seems made for older, postmenopausal women• It's not meant for people who have darker skin - according to the instructions, the laser can cause redness on dark skin.• I can't use this if I've just had a botox treatment or any other “professional cosmetic treatments"", like skin peels, etc).  Unfortunately, the instructions are unclear about how long you should wait – I assume after the effects wear off?!• Effects are meant to be TEMPORARY.  The instructions say you can only use it for 8 weeks straight (7 days a week), but it doesn't say anything about how long you can wait between treatments, or if the device is even reusable after 8 weeks.  If not, you're basically paying over $200 for a device that you can only use ONCE.• The instructions are confusing.  The study they mention say that results were best after 8 weeks, with a slight decrease after 12 weeks, even though the device is not meant to be used after 8 weeks straight.  I assume it means the treatment keeps working even when you're stopped the nightly routine of using the laser, but it's unclear.•The Instructions recommend purchasing more Tria products, like tria priming cleanser and nourishing rye removal cream, to supplement this product.  I'm not surprised by this, but I used my own cleanser and cream, and it worked just as fine.Overall, it seems to be working, but I'm disappointed that, despite the high price tag, it's apparently a disposable device - after 8 weeks, you're not supposed to be able to use it anymore.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336DZNOE6V4GT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CR44C4#wasThisHelpful","R336DZNOE6V4GT","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We hold a monthly “Game Night” at our house and felt this was the perfect opportunity to introduce the Pathfinder Card game to our friends.  Unfortunately, it took at least two hours to explain the rules of the game and our crowd is mostly people over 40, so keeping track of each character’s journey, remembering what powers they do or do not have, and explaining strategy was somewhat difficult, especially as everyone was a first time player.  I think this game is best suited to a younger crowd (under 40) but it’s still fun for those who really stick with it.A few of us played Dungeons & Dragons years ago, so this playing this felt very familiar.  Every player is given the opportunity to ""customize"" their game play, in that they can choose to be a particular character. The characters are individually possessed of different powers, spells, weapons, and capabilities. You choose a specific character and a “scenerio” (a.k.a storyline) and draw cards that determine the path of your journey.  Your objective is to maximize your advantage, using the cards and dice to advance or retreat.  The objective, of course, is to win the game by overcoming monsters and capturing the bad guys for points. It’s like a video game in that they are different levels and you can move on to different stages. The game shifts scenes as you advance, so it feels like a continual maze. The game can technically go on forever as the company encourages you to buy “expansion sets” that give you additional cards and new adventures to go on.Two people in our group are big science fiction and fantasy buffs, and they absolutely loved it.  For the rest of us, it was challenging, and after playing this for two hours, a little tedious, since it requires so much thinking.  This is not a game to be played when you’ve had a few cocktails!  But for devoted game geeks, I can see this being a big hit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TBE3X4MZ9P3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1601257457#wasThisHelpful","R2TBE3X4MZ9P3T","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Honestly, this is the most economical option to see a movie in NYC - less than $9 and the popcorn and soda cost about the same as if you were living in a small town in the Midwest or upstate; in other words, insanely cheap, which makes me wonder how on earth this place can stay in business, given NYC rent prices.It's in a very cool location as well - not a dingy, look-over-your-shoulder dangerous neighborhood but on trendy Metropolitan Ave (take the bus that runs along it and you'll end up in Williamsburg in 20 minutes!).  It's near one of the few Michelin-starred restaurants in NYC - Danny Brown's Wine Bar - and a bunch of very classy eateries.

"I recently had the privilege to try out several AXE products and have been very pleased with the scent and the eye-catching packaging, which screams ""masculine"" and no-nonsense.  This fits in my hubby's ethos, so when I gave him this deodorant to try he was very pleased.  He runs twice a week and works up a good sweat (he does a six mile run no matter what the weather), so he found this works well for him.  It has a nice woodsy pine scent, very manly, and not too strong (he hates strong fragrance, being a natural, outdoorsy type of person).Best of all it's NOT an antiperspirant - sweat is human and normal and to keep your body from producing it is not good for you, so we prefer using deodorant sticks wherever possible.  Like other AXE products, this stick looks like frozen gel but glides on smoothly and doesn't leave the bathroom swimming in powdery flakes like other ones he's tried.Overall he's very pleased - his only complaint is that Axe products, despite the stated size, tend to get used up fairly quickly in our house - perhaps the packaging is thicker than the amount of allotted product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M5LZLXC352HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBX99S0#wasThisHelpful","R2M5LZLXC352HU","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far, so good. My Russian Blue isn't a very picky eater, so the fact that she ate this without hesitation doesn't necessary mean this food will be right for every cat, but she apparently likes it. However, as someone who tries to eat organic and avoid subpar quality food as much as possible, I pay attention to the ingredients and this Nutro product lists a number of natural ingredients, including whole brown rice (!) which I didn't know cats could eat or like.  In fact, the list contains such a good number of natural food that I wouldn't mind seeing a similar list of ingredients on the food I'd eat myself (though of course I don't mean to say I'd eat cat food :)Since my cat Maggie is already fairly healthy, I didn't notice any significant change in her behavior or appearance since she started trying Nutro, but then no news is good news.

"These pads won't prevent severe incontinence, but it does a good job of preventing minor accidents. The pad is noticeably thicker toward the middle and appears most absorbent there.  Unlike maxi pads, it has a cloth backing with a little bit of elastic on the sides.  This makes the pad bunch up a little, like a diaper, but actually makes it more likely to stick to an undergarment, as the pad's shape tends to curve instead of lying flat, to prevent leakage.  For this reason, it works well and I'd echo the views of other reviewers who mention that women who have moderately heavy periods can also use this as well.

"This tea infuser looks like my husband when he's drinking beer, so I knew I had to have it.  I was a little wary of dunking plastic into hot water (I try to avoid doing this, as we don't know how much plastic can leach into water) so I was relieved to hear that it's made of BFA-free plastic.  Still, I prefer to pour the hot water and let it cool down for a bit before dunking him in.As an infuser, it's amusing to look at but I found that the tea tastes best when he's fully immersed and you're basically drowning him for a few minutes.  Putting him in a position with his arms hanging off the sides of the cup, looking really chill, should be done just to make others laugh as this position doesn't give your tea enough flavor.This set came with not one, but four little Mister Tea infusers, which is a little unusual - that's great for the money (and would make ideal stocking stuffers!) but I hope that doesn't mean each one isn't intended to last that long.I received this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGRG9XZUVWIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010KOQ2XY#wasThisHelpful","R1YGRG9XZUVWIX","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is probably the second ""hipster"" movie I've seen.  What exactly is a hipster movie?  Well, it has certain elements in common.  First, there's the preoccupation with ""how things look"" over an intelligent plot or good dialogue.  Every shot in this movie calls attention to itself, whether it's necessary or not - dunk Tilda Swinton in a sea of tomatoes, show her staring wordlessly into the camera, focus on a fan blowing the edge of a poster, show a bunch of broken eggs in an egg carton, capture the ""look"" of raindrops reflecting traffic lights.Do any of these shots reveal anything about the characters, give us any real insight to a character's mind?  No.  It's just a young director showing off, a presumably privileged youngster who lacks experience in the ""real world"" and is trying desperately to prove that, despite his MFA-buffeted life, he has ""suffered"" and can convey that ""suffering.""The other sign of a hipster movie is the deliberate use of relentlessly cheery, vintage music to underscore a few serious scenes in an ""ironic"" manner.  It's a device that's so obvious and self-important I kept cringing.If you're looking for a meaningful movie about what motivates kids and parents and explores the complexities of a dysfunctional family, skip this.  The ""edgy"" plot is just an excuse for the director to play with his camera.  The real test of a good movie is to walk out for ten minutes, come back, and see if you missed anything important. I walked away for 30 minutes, came back, and didn't miss anything.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS7AHDB537TDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007C3TVNA#wasThisHelpful","RS7AHDB537TDC","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this product, but the taste is not that great. I was expecting a smoothie-like taste, but since this drink is overwhelmingly flavored by veggies and not fruit, there is more of tartness than a sweetness.It's certainly healthy for you - it's got spinach, a combo of cucumber, celery, green bell pepper, even romaine lettuce(!), 2 apples, yellow carrots (never had these, only the orange kind), and ""hint"" of pineapple. One 8 oz glass is deemed equivalent to one serving of vegetables.  Health-wise, this is the perfect beverage for the type of person who lives off coffee and cigarettes or eats lot of junk food, but since I eat relatively healthy (I try to have a side meal of veggies for dinner every night), the benefits seem a little lost on me, especially since I find sauteed spinach and onions, grilled peppers or roasted broccoli are far more tastier than this drink.My other quibble is that this product doesn't seem to be organic - spinach, apples, and green bell peppers are members of the ""dirty dozen"" that are better bought that way, especially if you're juicing them.  V8 should seriously consider this, especially for a drink purported to be healthy.On the plus side, you do get a huge bottle for the price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6A5ZF156XBRW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S0AOIFA#wasThisHelpful","R6A5ZF156XBRW","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reading the other reviews, I was worried this would be too big for me (I ordered a Medium).  Fortunately it was fine - it fit true to size and felt very comfortable.I tested this shirt under ideal conditions - I went out at noon on a day when the humidity was near 70% and the temp was in the upper 90s.  Though my face still felt hot, the shirt kept my upper body feeling reasonably cool and not sticky or too sweaty.  It was great being able to gallivant in the hot weather without feeling my shirt stick to my skin, for once!The color is great, the electric violet is very attractive. Though the material has a stretchy material often used in workout clothing (and a small logo at the hem of the shirt makes it feel like a sports shirt), I was able to wear this to work without anyone noticing that the shirt was specially made for active wear.  This makes it very versatile.

"This is a surprisingly inexpensive set of cycling sunglasses that comes with five interchangeable lenses. This review is for the one with the yellow and red frame.It comes in a zippered hard case with five layers of foam inserts that protect each individual lens - very compact and great for travel. The set includes a blue, yellow, clear, reflective, and black polarized lens.  I don't feel the need to change my lenses during a bike ride, so it's clearly intended for times when you know how light or dark a place will be and adjust accordingly - I prefer using the polarized during times of brightest sunlight, whereas the clear ones will come in handy for a nighttime ride.  I also like the fact the set includes a plastic glass frame with no lenses - the inner spectacles are for prescription lenses that you can wear behind your sunglasses. Since I wear contacts, I doubt I'll use this, but it's a nice option to have (though I wonder if it will work for someone with thick prescription glasses, since the frame feels kind of flimsy).It wasn't hard for me to pop the lenses in and out - just make sure the edges of each lense fit into the groove and fit it over the nosepiece. The hard rubber nose piece felt comfortable for the first hour or so, but it started to make my nose itch a little afterwards.On the inside of the frame you will see ""Italy Design"" written on it - not grammatically correct (it should say ""Designed in Italy"" or ""Italian Design""), which tips me off this product is likely made in China and is paying a ""homage"" to Italian-style sunglasses. That's a shame, because the glasses, despite made of inexpensive plastic, are very well made (I've seen more expensive sunglasses that are flimsier than these) and a great buy for the money.Disclaimer: I received this set in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LR4F71CH9PQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YU4GFR4#wasThisHelpful","R3LR4F71CH9PQJ","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I'm no longer a spring chicken, this gel is just what I needed for my hair, which is on the dry side and graying.  As it provides more softness than volume, I prefer to use it on my dry hair.  My hair has become dry and dull after years of dyeing it, and pumping a few squirts on my hair did make it feel more silky and smooth.  It has a pleasant, fruity smell to it that's not too strong, which is good. The only downside is the pump, which tends to clog and I have to press it a few more times.  Since it's really a gel, I would have preferred a tube rather than something that resembles a spray.Other than that, I find the product works well for my hair.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4SS2RIYAS50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS7ZVN8#wasThisHelpful","R1L4SS2RIYAS50","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gel pomade looks like petroleum jelly and has a slightly chemical scent when you first uncap it but thankfully it goes away once you use it.  A little gel goes a long way, so unless you want to look like the Fonz or John Travolta in ""Grease,"" it's really not necessary to use a lot of it. I took a dab of it and ran it through my hair after washing it.

"This review is for the Tomato Soup.I love the fact that this is made of 100% organic ingredients. I also like the fact that the soup comes in a box rather than a metal can - it's lightweight and I can take boxes of it to work. It resembles one of those cardboard juice boxes, and when it first arrived I was tempted to look for a hole to poke my straw through, then I remembered it was soup. Best of all, such packaging is recyclable - it's clear Campbell's is making a serious effort to join the upscale soup market, where those soups (like Nature's Promise, etc.) package their soups in boxes.The size is just enough for one person, though the servings say it's enough for 2.  It's a little pricey, but then most organic foodstuffs are.I remembered to shake it before pouring. It's creamy with some tiny chunks of tomato in it but I couldn't taste the basil at all.  It was a little sweet, but I prefer my tomato soup that way. I added some croutons and bits of shredded cheddar cheese and it was delicious. I think this soup makes a great base for you to add your ingredients - by itself it's OK, but not great.The downside is that it's fattening (40% of calories from fat) and very high in salt (650 mg of sodium for 1 cup of soup!!) so if you're on a diet where you have to avoid salt and fat (to paraphrase Seinfeld's Soup Nazi), no soup for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZTCVJH1H8PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5WYVCG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZTCVJH1H8PW","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very pretty earrings with an eye-catching array of delicate stone in different shades of blue. I bought these at a party thrown by a friend of mine a year ago, when she was still a Lia Sophia consultant (as you know, they went out of business as of Dec 2014).  Although I read some negative reviews about their jewelry (stones will fall out and tarnish), so far I've been very lucky with these earrings - I still wear them frequently and they've never lost their tarnish and all the stones are still there!

"I received a set of three to review: #10 (Rosy), #40 (Bronzed) and #50 (Luminous). All are very light and subtle in color, and best for those with light to medium skin tones. Fortunately it works for me, but I doubt these would work well with those with olive or darker skin complexions.While I found the ""Rosy"" too light to use alone, I found it easy enough to add some of the darker ""Bronzed"" color to give my cheeks a more textured color. Of the three, #50 didn't do it for me - it's too close to the color of ""nude"" or light beige foundation to have any impact, and I had to mix it with a darker coral Benefit blush that I had to make it stand out more.All three blushes contain Vitamin C and botanical conditioners. Neutrogena products have always worked well for my skin, and each blush went on smoothly with a soft, lightly powdery consistency. While I think the colors could be a little more textured, this is a good set for those who want to wear makeup but prefer the ""natural look"" as opposed to the louder, more defined makeup that some women wear.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39K2EEQOUGNYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2VQWFE#wasThisHelpful","R39K2EEQOUGNYW","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This heart-shaped necklace has a lightweight and delicate quality despite having a silver frame that gives it some depth.  Like most jewelry from Amazon's Curated Collection, it came beautifully packaged in a gift box that makes any jewelry piece feel special.I was a little disappointed, however, in two things:  the color and the thickness of the chain.  The photo shows a deeper purple color but the amethyst is actually on the light side, so if you wear it in bright light, it looks almost like clear crystal.  Also the chain feels dainty and easily breakable, more so than the pendant. Its lightness makes it almost invisible when worn.Overall, however, this is a pretty necklace, and since it is silver and uses a real gemstone, the under $20 price tag makes it a decent buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVW2HMAVV3803/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPJVAYE#wasThisHelpful","RVW2HMAVV3803","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This highly entertaining novel by the author of “Five Men Who Broke My Heart” starts off with an opening reminiscent of Stefan Zweig‘s “Letter From an Unknown Woman” – what if you were a young, impressionable poet who had a life-changing love affair with a much older Pulitzer-Prize poet who, years later at a book signing, fails to remember who you are?Such is the opening of Susan Shapiro’s “What’s Never Said,” an endearing and funny novel that manages to combine an eventful plot with characters so immersed in the competitive literary world that they ironically fail to see and understand the unspoken boundaries and vacillations endemic of personal relationships.  In depicting what could have been a stereotypical older professor-younger woman/student love affair, Shapiro successfully upends expectations and captures how relationships begin, progress and then fall apart in a way that never feels contrived, judgmental or moralistic.In addition, by switching skillfully between two points of view, Ms. Shapiro manages a feat that few writers have managed to do – create a convincing portrait of an older man who has an affair with a student for reasons that aren’t lamentable or pathetic, but realistic; and the same for the young blonde poet who falls for the older professor with a passion that can’t be categorized as Lolita-like or entirely naïve.If you’re looking for a fast-moving, entertaining and emotional summer (and winter) read, you can’t really do much better than ""What's Never Said.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35GGYHJLKVO5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942762178#wasThisHelpful","R35GGYHJLKVO5E","AMB2Z4FMDBWQY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMB2Z4FMDBWQY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am very impressed with the quality of this baby wrap. It is in the same category as the Boba and the Moby wrap at a better cost and quality. The wrap is a lengthy piece of jersey stretch cotton material (95% cotton). What makes the wrap better than the Boba that I already own is that it is a thinner cotton, yet just as durable and secure. I prefer the thinner fabric which I found to be less hot and more comfortable. I received the wrap in the navy blue color, which is perfect. I have used it with my 4 month old in the toddler and front carry position and will post some pictures when I get a chance. Additionally, because the fabric is a bit thinner than other similar wraps, it fits better into the carry bag and is more compact. What also sets this wrap apart, is the packaging, the lifetime guarantee and the pamphlet that comes with it. I loved that it came with detailed picture diagrams to show how to correctly wear the wrap. I never even knew I could use to to do a front carry and was so excited when I saw that!

"This is a beautiful, great quality head scarf. I ordered the scarf in the corral color and it came as described. The packaging was excellent. It was beautifully wrapped and felt personalized. There was even a thank you note attached with a touching message. Thankfully I am not a cancer survivor, but I did purchase the scarf for personal use. I am a jewish and have a ritual to light candles every friday night. It is customary to cover the hair when lighting the candles, and I got tired of placing a napkin on my head. When I came across this headscarf, I felt it would be perfect for my weekly needs and I am so glad I ordered it. I attached a couple of pictures showing me wearing the scarf as well as the lovely packaging it came in. I think this would be a very touching gift for a loved one who is battling cancer or for someone like me, who does cover their hair at times. The scarf was well made and had nice stitching along the edges. It was easy to fold into a triangle and tie around my head. The scarf also comes with a scrunchie which can be used to hold the scarf together or put your hair up in a ponytail. I would definitely recommend this head scarf to others.

"I wear heals often and make the mistake of walking barefoot at home. After some time in the kitchen, the heels of my feet are in a lot of pain. These slip on socks really make a difference. The heals of my feet get the additional padding and support they need. I can now stand longer hours in the kitchen cooking without feeling that uncomfortable pain. I would suggest maybe making the socks a bit longer to even cover the front pads of the foot and maybe loop around the big toe so that they don't twist upwards.

"I have a 4 month old baby, and am always searching for my diapers and where I left the wipes. I found this nursery and diaper organizer to be very useful. The diapers stack easily in the inside compartment and can be easily removed as well via the open slit. It was able to hold a full pack of 35 diapers and likely even 2 packs at a time. The wipes can be placed at the top for easy access and there are also several more slots for creams and other essentials. My only negative comment is that the left side does tend to slouch down a bit with the weight of the diapers/wipes and maybe adding an additional piece of velcro to loop over the wipe container, may have done the trick.

"These Lunch Box Tupperware containers are great for rationing meals. I love that it comes with 3 compartments. I tend to cook healthy and have a protein, grain and vegetable with every meal. This lunch box makes it easy to place left overs for next day's lunch. My husband is also not very hands on in the kitchen so I like that he can just grab a tray and have a meal ready. The lids close firmly on the top and I haven't had them leak when placed flat. I have not attempted to put them sidewalks or really shake them much and they probably are not intended to be super leak proof. My only comment would be that I wish they were made from a thicker plastic. I notice that when you do heat them in the microwave, they become soft and hard to hold onto.

"This is such a fun toy that I often find myself playing with it too. I already owned the Magformers brand set of 16 pieces and bought these 30 piece set to try. The two sets can be used interchangeably without a problem. So if you already own Magformers, you can add these sets to provide yourself with more pieces to work with. These pieces feel a tiny bit thinner/more hollow than the magformers. However, they seem to hold up well to play and I have not had any pieces break apart. I believe these tiles are more affordable and would reassure anyone who is hesitating by the lesser known brand, to go ahead and purchase with ease. The pieces are durable and the magnets work well to hold pieces together and be able to build a variety of structures. I loved the added instructions, and was able to make all kinds of fun towers and balls with this set. My 3 year old plays with these tiles daily and I love that they are compact and can be easily stored. We will take them on out trip to New York this upcoming week since this is a toy that can occupy his attention for more than 5 min. I think I will be ordering a larger set soon! I received these magnetic tiles at a slightly discounted rate for review purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.Review Edit**** I originally mistakenly wrote that I owned magna tiles and that the Tinsky were interchangeable.

"I started using my nursing scarf right away and have to say I am really impressed. It is such a lightweight and thin material that feels pretty breathable. My son was not super sweater with this nursing scarf over his head, which I have had with other nursing covers. Additionally, it is not stiff like other nursing covers and I like that easily drapes over his body. I wore it like a giant loop when nursing and felt pretty covered up. I have a family get together this weekend and plan to use it. Also, I tried it as an a scarf by wrapping it twice and this scarf felt comfortable around my neck and not constricting. I have looped other scarves around my neck twice and always felt hot and ""choked."" I think the the fact that this material is so thin really helps. Finally, this scarf stores easily in a diaper bag. It is able to fold in half and fold into a very compact rectangular shape without taking much room up. It folds much smaller than traditional nursing covers or muslim blankets. I would highly recommend this item to nursing moms like me and feel this would make a great gift item as well.

"This Shopkin compatible organizer is exactly what I needed! I do not own or collect shopkins, but I have been looking for an organizer that is small and compact that I can use for my jewelry when traveling. My regular jewelry organizer that comes on a hanger is way to big to take with me. This organizer is exactly what I was looking for. The pockets fit eatings, rings, and necklaces. I love that I can zip up a row and have my jewelry stay securely in place. When I would previously travel, I would just lump all my jewelry in  a one pocket case and then when I needed to wear it, I would have all my necklaces tangled up in one giant mess and it was an absolute nightmare! Another great feature about this case is that it has a hook you can use to hang it up.  Additionally,  you can also fold the case and close it using the velcro. I have attached some pictures to show how well it works with my jewelry. It will also store compactly in my luggage in a closed position.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REIDWLCGAV32C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZSDEJCY#wasThisHelpful","REIDWLCGAV32C","A1G2NIQIC7V94N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1G2NIQIC7V94N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a stay at home mom with a toddler and 2 month old. I am regularly cooking homemade food for my family. I am looking forward to making pureed food in a couple of months for my younger son and am so glad I came across this book. This book was an easy read with great suggestions for foods to avoid. There was an explanation on baby led weaning, and even how to's on freezing, storing, and thawing purees as well as transitioning from puree to solids. I particularly liked that this book was broken up into age ranges. For example there were recipe's for 4+, 6+ etc. At the top of each chapter there was an age range for when that particular puree's can be introduced. Every chapter also had a quick overview of the recipes in that particular chapter (main ingredients i.e, Beets+Squash+Basil 71), I found this particularly useful since I can readily choose what puree I will make based on ingredients already in my refrigerator. Each recipe is outlines with how many ounces, prep time and cook time as well as how long the puree can be stored. Also the recipe's were easy to follow and I appreciated the detailed tips provided for many of the recipe's.

"I have had several food processors/blenders and they really don't compare to the Ninja Master Prep. I was most impressed with the ice crushing feature of this blender. The Ninja was very simple to set up. It had a large basin a lid and then the motor goes on top. You also have an additional lid to use when storing the leftovers in the fridge. The blade is two levels and this is a feature I have not previously had in a blender before. The Ninja also comes with a smaller bowl which is great for chopping up veggies. I used the large basin to make smoothies for my entire family and did so with ease. I placed all my ingredients in and it really didn't matter if I put in the ice first or last. I was really impressed at how quickly and uniformally my shake was ready. There was no lumpy pieces and it was a perfect consistency for drinking out of a straw. Both containers are made from a strong plastic and the entire system is very easy to disassemble and clean. In my previous Cuisinart blender, I could never remove the inner blade and found that cleaning it was very difficulty.

"This is a terrific piece of gear!  The blades are sharp and work well, and the device is very easy to adjust. The veggie tray works very well and is easy to use.  It doesn't hold a lot (you'll have to empty if frequently if you're doing a lot of work).  It could also be a bit wider, but of course I knew the size when I ordered it and they make a wider one.  This really is a classic and nearly every kitchen I've worked in has had one of these stashed somewhere.I use mine in a restaurant kitchen and it works very well.  If you're doing a very high volume you're probably going to be better off getting a Bron but this will certainly do a great job if you aren't banging out twenty pounds of vegetables per day.

"This is a case where I should have dug into the reviews before I purchased them.  Since I've used the same case but in Orange I ass/u/me'd these where the same. Wrong!  Every other brand these are sold under has a sheet of striker material rolled up and placed in a baggie inside the tube.  Not these ones, though.  It's not easy to find the striker material in sheets as a stand-alone item.  Just as an FYI the old school strike-anywhere match have the red phosphorus on the head of the match; that's why friction will light them.  Safety (ie strike on box) matches rely on a striker impregnated with phosphorus for them to work.  The ""striker"" on the bottom of the case isn't a striker at all- it's a ferrocerium rod (aka fire steel). This is made to create a shower of sparks when scraped briskly with a metal edge, not light matches.I can't fault the basic case itself, especially for a buck and a half.  It's sturdy for what it is and well sealed against dust and water.  But you're left having to cut the striker off the box of whatever matches you choose to fill this container.  Since you can get the Orange version of this case at Wal-Mart, branded by Coleman and filled full of matches, for $1 this isn't really a bargain.  I ordered ten of these because I think the Safety Yellow is maybe a bit more visible than the Orange ones but I wouldn't have got them had I known there were no strikers.I still recommend them if you want to use them for something besides matches or if you don't care about the strikers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TH043458VIPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB3EMPS#wasThisHelpful","R3TH043458VIPL","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this us to use as a tablet bag to carry my Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 with a few accessories.  It's great for that!  The Tab 8.4 in it's cover fits in this pack like it was made for it.  The pack is a little smaller than I expected from the listing but it's plenty big for the intended purpose.  The material is pretty lightweight but it feels well made. The stitching is neat with no loose ends or runs.  Internal organization is minimal; there's one big main section with a thin divider that makes a shallow pocket about 2/3 the size of the back.  The outer zippered section has a similar pocket but split into two and about 4/5 of the height of the pocket.  These are sized about right for a large tactical flashlight such as a Surefire 6P, or of course a wound up USB cable, etc.  Right about the body of the pack at the base of the strap there's a small mesh pocket with an elastic shock cord.  This is really nice touch as it puts whatever you store in it right where you can easily reach it on your shoulder.  It's almost exactly the size of that 6P flashlight I referenced above.  I should also mention that this bag has really nice zipper pulls!  They're sturdy and ergonomic, and the bright plastic dip stands out from the body of the pack.  You can remove them if  you don't like them, too.  Lastly there's a strap that connects the front and the back; this strap would keep the pack closed even if both zippers failed.  You don't normally see that on a pack this small and it's probably not necessary but it's a nice touch.The only minor downsides are the small size and the fact that there's minimal padding.  The padding on the shoulder strap isn't too bad as long as you don't try to carry a lot of weight.  Again, in a pack this tiny it's not likely to be an issue.  Also, the strap is permanently attached to the bottom right side (if looking from the back).  This means it's not quite as ambidextrous as it would be if the strap attache in the middle or better still, clipped to a D-ring on either side.This is a borderline five-star pack, especially considering the low price (I think I paid $12 or so).  It could use a little bit more internal organization but if you're looking for a small bag for a tablet it's great so long as you stick to probably an 8"" model (I'm not sure anything bigger would fit).  This could be a good bag for day hikes if you only plan to carry minimal gear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLS2KNYOAGEQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117S9RW0#wasThisHelpful","RLS2KNYOAGEQ1","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third Elzetta light, and tt's an extraordinary device that's just short of perfection.  Like all Elzettas there's nothing to fault in the construction.  The parts all screw together as smoothly as silk, and when assembled it's bank-vault solid.  The anodizing is rich, velvety perfection.  Just looking at the body, tailcap and bezel this light is flawless.  Only the tint/color temperature leaves a bit to be desired.  The Malkoff engine is powerful but it's biased a little cooler (to my eye) than the newer Alpha light engine.  Subjectively the beam is as nice and artifact free as the spot lens of my Alpha, it's just a smidge cooler/bluer than I'd like.  It's certainly not bad by any means, it's just a little short of the flawless performance I was expecting.  I also have to say that as fantastic as Elzetta lights are none of them that I have seen can match the color of the Malkoff M61N that I dropped into my Elzetta Bravo.  I have an AVS head coming, and perhaps this will be superior to the M60S unit in this light.I only purchases this older/legacy version because Amazon had it on markdown for $133. That's basically less than the body, tailcap and bezel normally costs, and the light engine was essentially free.  So this was still a great deal.  And by any objective measure this is an awesome light.  I do feel that a three cell light could be a bit brighter.  Of course, that's why sell the AVS head (900 lumens) and run time with three cells should be outstanding.To someone that likes a cooler colored beam this is probably about as good as you can get for a tactical/hard use light.  I fully expect it to last at least the rest of my life!  Great light, but if like me you prefer a warmer/more neutral color temperature you'd be better off getting just the body, bezel and tail cap switch of your choice then adding a Malkoff M61N or M61W.Lastly, I should point out that this isn't built for ""lumen drag racing"".  It's not as bright as those piercingly blue Chinese wonder lights.  Elzettas are designed for absolute, never-say-die reliability. They don't push the emitters too hard, they don't drive them with crappy drivers, and they don't set them up to blaze at turbo level for two minutes and then drop off.  It isn't hard to find a brighter light in stated lumens but it's hard to find a better practical illumination tool than an Elzetta.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0Q3BKC5ZGSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BMTKWK6#wasThisHelpful","R1B0Q3BKC5ZGSP","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt that the Elzetta Alpha is in a league of its own.  I've got a lot of very good flashlights including several from Streamlight, Surefire, Inforce and JETBeam but they can't match the build quality of an Elzetta.  Everything about it screams quality.  First off the anodizing is simply fantastic.  The level of precision in construction is unmatched by any other light I've seen. The machining is very precise; when you screw it apart and back together it's incredibly smooth.  The entire light is like a tank.  All the electronics are fully potted.  This means that after assembly of the electronics they're filled with an epoxy resin.  This makes them incredibly durable and tough and nearly immune to shock.The power of this little one CR123A is also exceptional.  There are other small lights with this lumen level but the beam quality is extraordinary due to the use of optical lenses instead of the reflectors other lights use.  I will note that the lens is replaceable, too, with a flood option being available for ten bucks.  Just as impressive is the color temp- this one is much much more neutral than almost everything else out there.  Compared to the Alpha most of my other lights are annoyingly, shockingly blue tinted. Well, except for my Surefires.  They're annoyingly green compared to the Elzetta.  To date the only LED I've seen with better color is the Malkoff M61N module (which I dropped into my Elzetta Bravo body).Another great feature of the Elzetta line is modularity.  You can swap out lenses and change switch modes easily.  I added a crenelated bezel ring to mine and got a flood lens, and both installed in about 30 seconds.  The Bravo and Charlie lights from Elzetta are even more modular with many parts you can ""Lego"" into the same body.  The Alpha has only one option for light engines but the bigger ones can accept any P60-type module.  Luckily the emitter of the Alpha is terrific.This light is very close to being perfect, but it does have a few minor flaws. First it comes with no pocket clip.  You can buy one for $15 but it's kind of a kluge; it's a two piece ring design that uses a friction ring to lock the clip ring in place.  It's difficult to install, bulky and the clip itself is inferior to something like the one on my Surefire E1b. With the clip on the body it's about midway up the light, meaning if you clip it to the body it rides about halfway in and halfway out of the pocket, a bit too high.  The clip can be mounted on the tail for deeper carry but this interferes in a minor way with operation the twisting switch.That switch is mostly outstanding, with one minor issue.  If you toggle rapidly between high and low it usually gets stuck in low. If this happens it can't be switched back to high until you turn it off for a second.  This is a known issue reported by a couple of other owners of the light over at CPF.  Elzetta is apparently aware of the issue and doesn't think it's important enough to worry about.  I actually agree with them. In actual use it's not a big deal at all in a $150 flashlight anything short of flawless is worth noting.But forget those very minor nits- this is an stunningly great light!  I used to think Surefire made the best lights in the world but Elzetta is simply on a whole other level.  It's hard to imaging that humans could build a more bombproof light with present technology.Two thumbs way up!  I highly recommend this this light along with the Bravo.  IMO there is no better light on the planet at any price (that I am aware of).  No single product will the best choice for every user but if reliability and bullet-proof build quality are you top priorities then search no more.  Elzetta makes the best tactical lights in the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVCLPC5CC3O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWG2XZY#wasThisHelpful","R2XVCLPC5CC3O5","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall I like the Speed Clip but it's not perfect.  First off it is pretty hard to install.  According to a pro review site I frequent it's a lot easier after you've done it a few times, and I can see how that's probably true.  Second, as another reviewer here pointed out it's pretty easy to knock it loose compared to how difficult it is to seat it.However, I like the actual clip pretty well.  I also like the fact that it allows the clip to be positioned anywhere, and removed if necessary.  And in actual practice I can't imagine that the clip would be dislodged in normal use.I'd rate this as not quite as nice as most Surefire clips but much better than the ones provided by JETBeam.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHBTGB1Y1UM9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3XYNKY#wasThisHelpful","RHBTGB1Y1UM9Y","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the very low price I'm really surprised at how awesome this case it!  It fits perfectly as it very well made.  It covers the tablet and protects well while offering good access to the ports.  The magnets do a great job of keeping it closed and allow it to fold into a stand.  And as a stand it works exceptionally well!  It's a little too straight up and down to read for long periods but I balance it on the stand while tipping it back and that works great.

"Overall this is a decent pack for light duty use.  It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, though.  It's fairly well made but very lightly constructed.  The nylon is a very light denier and there's very little padding, either on the back of the pack or the strap.  I was a bit disappointed that there's no belt tab/slot to affix it to a belt to help distribute the load but then it's a tiny pack so I suppose that's not a critical omission.  The stitching seems fine and it should hold up pretty well.I kind of hoped to use this as a day bag for hikes but it's too small for that. It's really more like a purse.  It would be fine for a small tablet or e-reader (probably an 8"" tablet, tops) with maybe a few things like a charger, keys, wallet, etc.  Not a lot space but there's a ton of internal organization, though.If you're looking for a book bag or day pack it's going to disappoint you- it's simply too small.  As a case for a tablet or as  purse/murse it's not too bad.  It could be a four star pack for you if you don't need a lot of room.EDIT:  I've used this pack a bit more and I'm revising my opinion upwards.  It is small but my Galaxy TAB PRO 8.4 fits perfectly.  The internal organization is minimal but effective for a basic pack.  It has held up really well and I've begun to appreciate the little details that make it easier and more convenient (like the really nice zipper pulls).If you're in the market for a really small bag to use as a purse/murse of for an e-reader or tablet this is a nice little pack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9OSDNTKUU8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2PCW84#wasThisHelpful","R1Z9OSDNTKUU8O","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really superb WML for an M4-type rifle.  I think that momentary-only is the way to go on a defensive rifle; for predator control maybe a constant on would be useful but most trainers advocate short bursts of light combined with movement for CQB.  I've been alternating between this light and my Surefire X300 Ultra on my AR and it's hard to decide which I like more.  The Inforce is smaller and lighter and has a better switch.  The Surefire is brighter.  For outdoor use, and again maybe for varmints, the extra light would be useful.  Indoors though it's overkill.  Overall I think the Inforce is better for the role I envision for this particular rifle.The construction is great and it mounts securely to the rail, yet it's easy to remove, too. The set screw is an ingenious way to ensure it won't fly off when you need it.The only minor downside is probably going to be battery life.  I expect that like my 1-cell Inforce APL it won't have the run time of the 2-cell Surefire of JETBeam lights I run on my other long guns.  That and of max brightness- if you're looking for a blowtorch this isn't your light.  But the angled push button switch is very intuitive and run at 12:00 on my carbine it's perfectly ambidextrous.Highly recommended for an AR!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R45XPZR7D8XIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8V9GDA#wasThisHelpful","R45XPZR7D8XIW","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this Seahorse SE920FPL for $100 with Prime shipping!  It's just slightly more than that now and still a bargain.  I use mine for a range bag/case for my handguns.  The case itself is extremely well made.  The latches are solid and secure.  The wheels work well and the extendable handle is smooth and solid when extended.  The pluck foam takes a bit of practice to work with but does the job well once you get it scienced out.  I created slots for four sidearms with a compartment for ammo, one for ear pro, one for eye pro and a few for misc stuff and mags.  Eventually I might get a spare set of foam for it; my first layout works okay but could be improved with another attempt.Pelican makes great cases too but one this size would cost twice as much- and not be much better, much less twice as good.  In this class I feel Seahorse makes cases that offer better value.I'm adding a few pictures of case as I have it set up.Apologies in advance for the crap in the background, I took this in my basement shop which is kind of cluttered with junk right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MWHGVBIUO2NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLNMT7W#wasThisHelpful","R1MWHGVBIUO2NJ","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This adapter works very well.  It does require a bit of fiddling to get it adjusted properly, but once adjusted you don't need to mess with it when you swap bottles.  Not much else to say.  Screw it to a 12oz paintball tank and put it in the Sodastream.  Works just like a stock bottle, although occasionally you have to tighten it.  For some reason it works itself loose from the machine early on.  Once you use it awhile it seems to quite doing it, not sure why.My local bike shop fills a 12oz container for $3.80 with tax.  Compare that to a $30 bottle plus tax.  It's a no brainer.  The taste is exactly the same.

"Overall this rack from Sanus is really amazing, especially for the price.  It's rock solid and very attractive, and the design is superb.  The center post is far enough back from the front that it's not visually intrusive but it adds strength to the rack.  There's plenty of space for a small to medium AV system; my Denon receiver fit's nicely on one shelf with my universal player and BRD on the other, leaving space for maybe four more components.  The feet can be adjusted individually to level the rack- a very nice touch.  The finish is a very attractive matte on the shelves with a durable powder coat on the tubing.  Lastly there are six clips you can add to the back with velcro ties to manage the cables.  Nice!The most remarkable thing about this rack is how easy it is to assemble!  Generally I loath putting furniture together.  Many times I have opted not to buy something simply because I don't want to got through the hassle of assembly.  Man, this rack was a nice surprise!  All the parts are very well made, something I don't see much nowadays.  Everything fits well and the parts are well finished.  Another nice surprise is that the instructions are clear, simple and accurate!  Once I had it unboxed I think it took only 15 minutes to assemble.The only thing I can ding about this deal is the seller (3 Kings).  They shipped the rack in just the manufacturer's box and it was trashed when it arrived.  An item this heavy simply can't be shipped without some kind of overbox to protect it.  One of the panels was dented and chipped and the bottom tube that holds the feet was also dented.  The box was so beat up that I even took pics of it in case I needed to make a claim.  Honestly I didn't want to mess with putting it back in (what was left of) the box to return it but it's a bummer to spend $200 and get a dinged up bit of kit.

"I've carried my little E01 for about a year and a half now and it's among my favorite small lights.  It's compact and light and very reliable; the twist switch is pretty robust and very simple.  There's not much to go wrong.  The light is waterproof, a necessity for an EDC light in my opinion.  Brightness is good but not mind blowing- it's a very small light.  The manufacturer claims 9 lumens for it.  While this isn't a powerhouse it's plenty for most tasks you might use it for like illumination a lock at night.  And it's actually bright enough to change a tire by.  It's always a trade off, output vs run time, and the E01 seems to nail it.  Lastly, the throw is good.  Enough spot to have decent range but lots of flood to light up close-up tasks.It won't tail stand (if you care about such things) but that's fine with me because it does something more important to me:  It attaches to a keyring via a lanyard hole.  This is really crucial for my EDC setup as it allows me to keep it with my keys and knife so it won't get lost.  Not much good if I can't find it when I need it.This is very nearly a five star light.  The only minor quibbles that detract from it:- The finish isn't very durable.  The color came off pretty fast when carried daily.  Not a big deal by any means.- Output could be better.  Again, it's a trade off- more lumens would mean less time.  But I wouldn't mind a slightly more potent light.  I wouldn't mind changing the batteries more often to get more output.Again, very minor issues.

"Okay, not grammatically correct, but the CS Kudu might be the bestest cheapest knife out there.  I purchased mine here at Amazon for $6.09 shipped; at that price there is nothing, literally nothing, else that you could buy new that would be comparable to this one.  The edge is serviceable out of the box, the lockup is rock solid (supposedly will withstand 60 lbs of force) and the knife is very sturdy.  The Krup steel isn't high end but it's a good steel.  It's hardened to a point where it holds an edge adequately without being excessively brittle.The Kudu is a copy of a popular African knife called an Okapi.  The CS version is probably better than the original.  It's awkward to close but that's due to the close copy of the design and not really a flaw.  It's pretty ingenious actually.  It's a solid blend of maximum strength with minimum cost.Some reviews point out the flaws of this knife and mention things that could be improved.  While that's perhaps true it completely misses the point of this knife.  CS designed it to copy a traditional design while improving on it, but making it even cheaper.  In that sense it must be said to do exactly what it was intended to do.I think the Cold Steel Kudu would be a great knife to store in a survival kit, tackle box or glove compartment.  It's not a knife I'd want to use daily (awkward mechanics & ergos) but it would be great to have for emergencies or occasional use.  You can stash a few of them in places where you know they will be used infrequently without tying up a lot of cash.Even at full retail the Kudu is supposed to sell for $8 or so.  At six bucks there's no reasonable knife you could select instead.  An Opinel, a Mora, or even the CS's own superb Pendleton Lite Hunter will still cost $10-$15, nearly twice the cost of the Kudu.  This might be the best value in a sporting knife that I've ever seen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQN990QY5CESV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001S86S54#wasThisHelpful","RQN990QY5CESV","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The InForce APL is a superior product in almost every way; the best WML I have found for use on a sidearm.  It's very light, considerably lighter than the Surefire X300 Ultra.  It's also more compact.  This is especially nice since the dust cover & rail section on modern polymer handguns is very short compared to older designs like the 1911.  This means that the end of most WMLs extends out past the muzzle resulting in a lot of soot and carbon being deposited on the glass/plastic lens and bezel.The APL isn't as bright as the newest uber-lights from Surefire and Streamlight.  But after using it for awhile I realize that this is actually a positive, not a negative, at least if you anticipate deploying your sidearm inside.  The 500 lumen X300 Ultra (and likely the new HL steamlight) will blind you when reflecting off the walls and ceiling of your home, totally ruining your night adapted vision.  The APL is still plenty bright enough to blind any potential opponent but not so bright as to blind you as well.  And the ratio of hotspot to spill is actually a bit better than that of the Surefire.But the slam dunk for me is the switching system- it's here that the InForce leaves Surefire and Streamlight in the dust.  The ambi paddle switches of the APL is vastly superior to the odd toggle switches of the competition.  Tap it on either side and it activates; press and hold for momentary.  Unlike the competing lights it's easy to reach the switch without changing your grip on the sidearm.There's only one minor drawback to the paddle switch- the easy of activation also makes it easy to inadvertently turn on while being stored or carried.  Turning the bezel about 1/5 of a turn will lock out the switch; a good option for storage but not ideal for CCW.While my Surefire X300 Ultra is much brighter than the APL I find that the APL is superior in every other way.  In my opinion the APL is the best general purpose handgun WML on the market today.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7EII2PL4V25J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKJ24BY#wasThisHelpful","R7EII2PL4V25J","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think this saw is for arborists but it's really amazing for camping.  I've taken down and sectioned 5"" diameter standing dead oak trees in minutes with this saw.  It really does zip through wood, and is way better for most people than an axe.  It's hard to believe how fast this saw cuts until you actually use it.  Even my substantially smaller Pocketboy is efficient at cutting wrist size chunks of wood.This saw only cuts on the draw, and you do have to watch your technique to avoid kinking/bending it.  I'm not sure how long it will stay sharp; I've cut with mine on ten trips throughout the last year and it's still sharp.  Replacement blades are moderately expensive but so far I'm still using the first one.I can't recommend this saw highly enough.  It's a lot faster than the (admittedly smaller) Bahco Laplander.  To do work much faster you'd need a chainsaw.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YCQQA4MDFTY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014CA3JQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YCQQA4MDFTY3","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been carrying this little Fenix E01 on my keychain as my EDC for almost a year now so I thought I'd post a short review.  It's been a great light.  On the plus side it's very small and light.  I can't stand having a bunch of crap in my pockets but I always need to have my smart phone, wallet, keys, knife and light on me.  The first three are what they are, no practical way to change the amount of room they require.  So with the knife and light I need to compromise a bit.  My knife is a Spyderco Ladybug in ZDP.  If I went with a little larger knife I'd have to go with a bit smaller knife and vice versa.  The E01 is a great blend of size and power.  It's not super bright but plenty for the intended uses (eg unlocking my vehicle and house locks, changing a tire, checking the oil).  If my eyes are night adapted then the little guy is bright enough for general outdoors use.  It casts a beam with enough flood to be broadly useful.  Best thing about it is the switch; a twist switch reduces the odds of having it fail and prevents it from activating in my pocket.So far the little Fenix has been completely reliable and easy to carry.  A bit more power would be nice but it's great for a single AAA cell (I use a lithium in mine) and battery life is superb.  In fact I think I've been running the same battery since I bought the light last October.All in all a superb small light!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N33SIAIIJT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YLTU3Q#wasThisHelpful","R2N33SIAIIJT7","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would have to say that the Garden No8 is my favorite Opinel overall.  Most I like the handle and the drop point knife shape.  It fits my hand better than any of the others and is the perfect size for me (large enough for most tasks yet compact enough to carry easily).  My Opinel collection numbers around fifteen knives, and I use this one the most.The only downside really is the blade steel- I've only ever seen it in INOX. INOX is the generic term for stainless steel in much of the world. Personally I prefer carbon for most things.  It's really a challenge to put the kind of edge on this knife that I like.  I can get it to push cut really well but no matter what I do I can't get the shaving edge that I can easily get on the carbon models.If Opinel would offer this same exact knife with a high carbon blade it would be a five star, out-of-the-park home run for me.  Perhaps they do but if so I can't find it, and there's nothing on the company website.  So I give it four stars, docking one because their INOX just isn't as good as their carbon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUE7QI9Z6QE5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035HCLPC#wasThisHelpful","RUE7QI9Z6QE5Q","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Appaloosa is one of the finest unsung westerns in my opinion.  Perhaps in the top five of the last 20 years.  There's not a lot to say that hasn't been said.  The cast is superb (with the exception of Renee Zellwegger; she's not terrible but I too feel she was miscast).  The direction by Harris is very solid.  The film transfer is very good and the sound is great.  I'd give this a solid four out of five for the technical aspects (ie sound and image) and five out of five for the actual film.

"There's not much to say about this adapter.  It's very solid, and it fits both the 9mm/40 USP and the slightly larger USP45.  The only minor complaint I have is that this rail adapter is much, much larger than it needs to be to do the job.  I can't imagine your sidearm will fit in any holster with this adapter on.  The GG&G adapter, on the other hand, is very slim and low profile; it's enough smaller that the USP will still fit some holsters with the adapter attached.Still, this is a minor issue if you don't plan to carry the firearm.  The ProMag rail adapter is well made and will do the job at about 40% of the cost of the GG&G.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2RXPIQIUHBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E6P2WO#wasThisHelpful","R3P2RXPIQIUHBC","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall it's hard to find much to criticize about the GG&G rail adapter.  It's superbly designed and precisely manufactured, and about as sleek and low profile as you can get.  It adds virtually no bulk to the HK USP, and the gun will still fit many leather holsters with the adapter attached (no such luck with tightly molded kydex holsters, though).  It's also rock solid on the gun; it ain't going nowhere.I have only one serious criticism of the adapter, and it's enough for me to dock a star.  A Surefire X300 Ultra won't fit on this rail adapter.  Perhaps that's a fault of the light more than the adapter but since Surefire is the 'gold standard' for weapon mounted lights they should have designed it to work with that light.  Some rail keys will fit better than others but to really get it to work you have to mod the key of the light.  Not something I want to do to a $225 light.That said the GG&G works perfectly with the Inforce APL.  I actually prefer that light to the Surefire due to the smaller size and superior user interface.  I have read but cannot confirm myself that Streamlight units fit this rail just fine, too.If you have a light that fits this rail correctly it's a five star piece of gear.  If you have a Surefire you might be better off getting the ProMag or NCStar adapter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJH9C31HEACU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002E6R218#wasThisHelpful","R1YJH9C31HEACU","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's not an awful lot to say about this magazine holster.  It does what it's supposed to do.  It's well constructed and the magazine fits fine.  It says it's for a Glock on the back. The magazine of my HK USP9 was a little snug at first but once it broke in it fits okay.  I wish I could give this 4.5 stars; there's really nothing functional to complain about but it's not as nice as the SHTF Gear Horizontal Mag Carrier.  The velcro is a little harder to get open than a snap.  The velcro belt attachment though is actually better than a snap since it allows some adjustment to different size belts.  The only minor ding I give it is that it's not all that nice looking, just a little rough and ""cheap"" in appearance.  A minor thing since it's designed to be concealed for the most part.  If anyone does see it they'll probably not recognize it as a pistol mag, but a better looking case would be easier to pass off as a holster for a cell or i-something.I highly recommend this model if it fits the mag you're trying to carry.  I'm not sure how many models they make but this one is a good fit for the average 15-17 round double stack 9mm mag.  A little more refined appearance would be nice but it's fully functional and seems to be built to last.  If you carry a pistol with a single stack mag I'd say the SHTF Gear model is better but this one's great if you carry a sidearm with a double stack mag.EDIT:  Okay, after using it a long time I'm bumping it up a star.  Whatever minor issues I had with the appearance it's clear that this is about as good as it gets for actual CCW.  The best feature of this thing- and one that I missed at first- is the ability to adjust the fit to very snug and solid on any size or thickness of belt.  This is awesome since I've purchased three new gunbelts since I started carrying this.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVHX179URQ98A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PL4AX2#wasThisHelpful","RVHX179URQ98A","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After owning it for a couple months I must report that I really love this SHTF mag carrier!  It's extremely comfortable, so much so that it's easy to forget I'm wearing it.  Vertical carry is fine if you're wearing the mag at 8 or 9 o'clock but it jabs me in my [ample] gut if worn in the front.  But horizontally I can run with the mag between my belt buckle and left front pocket comfortably.  The design is really clever.  It's secured by one snap, making it easy to don and remove but mounts very solidly.  I'm not sure what belts it will fit but I generally wear mine over a 1.5"" wide gun belt that's 1/4"" thick it fits this just fine.  And since it completely covers the mag if my shirt rides up a bit it just looks like a cell phone case.The only minor complaint I have is really my own fault.  I ordered it with the intention of carrying a magazine for an HK USP9 mag, but that mag is a little too large for the pouch.  Rereading the description it does say 'for 13 round or smaller mags'.  I really do wish SHTF would offer a slightly larger version for service pistol type mags.One last thing I'd like to point out is that my Surefire E1B Backup flashlight also fits nicely in the carrier (although obviously not while you have mag in it).  I might pick up a second one just for carrying my flashlight.Great product, and great service from SHTF.  If you need to carry a spare mag, and that mag will fit this case, you can't go wrong.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZX1SBLLMKBT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ALI4HMI#wasThisHelpful","R38ZX1SBLLMKBT","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this canner for my mom and it's fantastic.  She's been canning everything you can imagine for at least fifty years, so she knows a few things about the process.  She'd been wanting a good pressure canner to replace a worn out Presto and this one fit the bill and more.  For the record, it works just fine with quart jars and also works just fine on her glass-topped electric range.  It's the best canner she's ever used, and she said the most surprising thing was how easy it was to regulate the pressure compared to the cheaper ones she's used in the past.

"This is a really bizarre flashlight!  And it didn't make a very good first impression.  When I opened the envelope I found a blank white box with the light & lanyard in it.  There were no instructions of any kind in the box nor the envelope.  No markers as to how to insert the batteries.  Hell, it doesn't even indicate what batteries will fit!  Since it took 1 month and 3 days between ordering and receiving it I'd forgotten, and actually had to bring the listing up on Amazon to check.  That's not ideal.  I pulled the lanyard out of the box and the plastic/loop fell right off the cord.  Hmmm, that's not ideal either.Okay, the light itself if just weird.  It's got a weird fish-eye lens.  Initially I thought it was broken as the lens end spins freely and telescopes in and out (!).  Once I figured out what battery to use (AA, or 14500...more on that later...) it did function.  With the ""tube"" pulled all the way in the light is very diffused would work well as a candle.  And will tail stand, kinda sorta, in a weeble-wobble way.  Used as a regular flashlight it will illuminate an entire room.  When you pull the ""tube"" all the way out, however, it projects a very nice outline of the emitter on the wall!  As in, you can see see the chip as though it was a slide on an overhead projector!Suffice to say this light is of limited usefulness as anything but an oddity.  It would provide enough light to navigate your home in the event of a power outage; with the spot set to max flood it actually casts an incredibly wide beam, and is pretty bright.  It's virtually useless at any distance past 20 feet though, and the light is almost violet.  The outline of the face of the emitter chip is rendered in a very lovely shade of purple.Lastly, I a/ss/u/me-d that with a 14500 cell it would be appreciably brighter.  Well, not so much.  I couldn't tell any difference in output between a SAFT LS14500 and a regular Energizer.  Not that it would have much mattered given the bizarre output.Three stars is probably generous but to be fair, nothing in the description promises that it won't be truly bizarre.  And since it cost about four bucks when I ordered it I'm not out much.  It will be worth much that just to baffle and perplex people.

There's minimal need to swap trays around, but for long drying projects it will be helpful.  The variable temperature control is a good feature and it works quite well.  I was a bit concerned that a 500 watt machine might not produce enough heat but those fears were unfounded.  Perhaps it's the shape of the unit, or maybe the fact that it fits together so tightly, but it generates a lot of heat.  In fact, my first batch of jerky really got way too dry.  It was my fault; I didn't expect the meat to dry nearly so quickly as it did.  But so far I've done apples, peaches & bananas and all came out great.  As I write this I have some garden tomatoes and some zucchini drying.As some have noted, the included fruit-leather/catch trays warp pretty fast.  To this I say- so what?  They still do the job.  If you want to make a lot of leathers  you'll probably get a Sil-mat anyway.This is a great dryer.  The only minor knock I could give it is that the capacity isn't huge, but of course I knew that when I bought it.  It's supposed to be able drive a dozen trays, so it's expandable.  Of course, for the cost of six more trays I could simply buy a second unit!  Probably the best use of extra trays is incremental expansion.This is more of a unit for a hobbyist or someone who wants to experiment with stuff.  It's simply too small for someone who wants to preserve the output of a huge garden.  But for the size it's really superb.  The great ergonomics and near-silent operation will win you over.One last note; obviously I can't yet comment on if it will last for ten years.  But before purchasing the unit I did e-mail the seller.  I received a response within 10 hours.  So the provided e-mail address is valid and response is quick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKIEOHXP4C2N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z4GQ#wasThisHelpful","RKIEOHXP4C2N2","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first book of this ""trilogy"" was an unalloyed gem. I was blown away that this unknown writer had created such a compelling work.  True, the villain was a ""Shnidely Whiplash"" mustache-twirling cliche.  But overall the book was superb.  From what I've gathered it was meant as a single book, and one that McCarty was lucky to have published at all.  The second book, therefore, seemed perfunctory, yet I enjoyed it.I've looked for this third book for a decade with no luck, and for whatever reason I decided to search for it on Amazon.  I found it for a very good price!  It arrived in great condition and the seller shipped promptly.If you clicked on this looking for a review of the book I'm sorry to disappoint.  School and work keep me from reading it yet.  Plus, I think the point of these reviews, especially as regards older OOP books is to identify the good sellers.On that note, I give an A+.  The transaction was perfect.For my take on the further adventures of Palamon and Berengeria...stay tuned! ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CTSAM10MIJTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345338650#wasThisHelpful","R1CTSAM10MIJTQ","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It appears that the second time is the charm!  I ordered MoKo Cover to replace a case that, while really nice, didn't really fit my Kindle.  This one is great!  There was no odor at all when I opened it.  I haven't had it long but it appears to be pretty well made.  I really love the bright purple color, too.  The main thing from my perspective is that it offers an absolutely flawless fit for my $79 basic 5-button Kindle.  It allows easy access to all the buttons as well as the micro USB port with no material impeding the operation of the Kindle.Lastly, the case is very functional.  It's just large enough to accommodate the Kindle with no wasted space (although there is a small flat pouch on the inside cover).  When in use the front cover folds completely flat against the back making it very easy to hold with one hand.  When not in use, magnets hold it firmly closed.  This is a great feature and much better than straps or snaps IMOHO.Overall there's nothing to complain about.  However, if they made a version that was identical in all respects but made of real leather I would gladly pay two or three times as much for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WECJI8CO9PI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0062H71SO#wasThisHelpful","R2WECJI8CO9PI4","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The case showed up the day before my Kindle, and I really fell in love with it.  The color is great, the construction seems solid...just a really nice product.  Unfortunately my Kindle really slops around in it.  I dunno, maybe it's my fault.  I read all the first few pages of reviews and really thought it would fit my $79 Kindle (not the Touch, not the version with the keyboard, but the one with 5 navigation buttons).  The Kindle is a good inch too short, and seems slightly too narrow.  Overall the device is usable but it's not ideal and constantly wants to move around.Maybe this is what I deserve for trying to save a few bucks.  My brother, sister & mom all have the Amazon covers with my sister's being the one with the light.  They all fit like they're part of the Kindle...but I'm not gonna pay $40 for a cover for an $80 device!  And the reviews are actually better for the Marware cover.Oh well.  I guess I'll use it for awhile and if it won't do the job I'll suck it up and buy a different one.  If you have the larger Kindle this is probably a five star case as so many have said.  But the smaller model simply doesn't fit it very well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39JBET884PE3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X237ZG#wasThisHelpful","R39JBET884PE3J","A30H8Z5M1LDW9U","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30H8Z5M1LDW9U?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I jumped at the chance to review this. My husband and I live in Louisiana where bug bites are prevalent. He has a very difficult time with bites from any insect and when he gets a bite it swells and causes issues for days.He has been using this on his mosquito bites for approx. two weeks and is loving life. Aloe can be used to help calm the irritation, as well as for sun burns. Since I just came in from a visit to California, I am using this for my burn.This seems more water based than many aloe gels that I have used but it does soak into the skin very fast. I have spots of skin that seem like eczema, very dry, and have been using this on those spots as well. So far the results are great and we have barely used a quarter of this bottle. I feel like it will last a few months.The one downside is the smell. I would prefer something a bit like lemon, orange, or lavender.I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUF2NQH9847M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X84YG3M#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUF2NQH9847M","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book... With such a fabulous title I so wanted it to hit the spots! To grab me and to really help me see the sparkle in myself and in others too!Well, right out of the gate I had some issues.To begin with, I did enjoy the talk about trauma. Trauma is literally traumatic, so much so that it can stop someone in their tracks just by a trigger! I have some issues that are triggered out of nowhere so I was hoping this would be a positive experience. So many people are hurt by trauma and the drama that surrounds them.Sadly, it doesn't quite hit the point in her questionnaire. The Drama Quotient Quiz seemed a bit off. Things that I said yes to, like I enjoy watching reality television shows, do not seem really dramatic. A more pertinent question may have been if that reality show is mired in drama. I get her point but there is a difference. For the reality shows I watch, they are all art based. Project Runway DOES have drama but it is not based around drama. Neither is watching Pitbulls and Parolees. I love dogs and want to help them have a voice. Some drama in that one, but not enough for this list.Also, I am one of the hardest working people I know. This question definitely got a yes from me. I work hard and I enjoy putting in 100% effort. If I do not put in 100% effort I know it. Other people will know it. Again, I'm confused about this question as well and so many others.So, while the questionnaire was interesting, it also frustrated me and put me on alert. This book is supposed to be about losing the drama right?The book then continues to point out places where there may be drama in your life that you are choosing.•Choosing friends or romantic partners who have high-drama personalities•Focusing upon low-priorotiy activities, instead of working on what matters to you•Ignoring your inner knowingness, which is warning you to stay away from a person, behavior, or situation•Sending more money than your budget allows•Abusing substances that magnify your anxiety (for example, stimulants, including caffeine, nicotine, and sugar) or depression (depressants, including alcohol, for instance)•Not planning ahead and facing an impossible deadline that has you racing against the clock.While I agree that these can cause drama, she then says""This isn't to blame you (after all, blame never helps anyone or anything). Instead, it's call to engage in detective work to help you recover your beautiful sparkle and everything that goes with it: happiness, health, peace, abundance, and high self-esteem.""I did agree with her idea on how some people just live for the drama. I have a few people in my life that are like that. Sometimes I am too. I prefer not to deal with drama but there are certain subjects, dogs for example, that I will do everything and anything for. There are people out here that would do anything and everything JUST for the drama of it all. Seems exhausting to me!Although I did start enjoying her points she wrote a book that seems to be pointed out for a younger audience. It's almost as if she is condescending and making things even more simple than they have to be.Something I am hoping to get my PhD in is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and this portion really was my favorite. I love how she addresses this as a serious and overwhelming reaction to trauma that ANYONE can have. It is not just for those in the military. She talks about the reactions and what can be done about them. And most importantly, that anyone with PTSD can have a life!Prior to the PTSD chapter I was ready to quit reading. This chapter was the book saver for me. Everything that I've studied (so far) about PTSD she has in here.The diet chapter though. I understand needing to reduce sugar but some of these foods seemed interesting to me. Dieting is already hard enough and she is adding in egg whites and black tea, among many others! I have not done any studies on histamine but I feel like there is already so much out there that taking away all of these foods also, as well as KALE, I mean... we would starve due to not being able to eat anything. It isn't her fault that all these studies are out there but my goodness...Part two explains how to regain your sparkle but my goodness. After all of this now comes the positivity! I almost wish she would have edged some of the positivity into the beginning parts of the book. It may have felt like less to digest.""Sometimes we have drama-filled lives because of fears that peace is boring.""While I may not have believed this for myself, I totally felt this from a family member. My Dad cannot sit still for two minutes. And maybe that is why I hate drama so much. Both of my parents absolutely love drama in its various forms. I can see how this statement can be true, even if we do not know it is.For me, it is not that peace is boring but that, especially with the reality shows I watch, I want to see growth. That's why we go to films, or read books; to see the character arc. It does not have to be a horrible, drama filled character arc to be good either.Overall, I think the book was okay. I really enjoyed some portions and some really frustrated me but overall it was a good book. I'm curious about her other writings.Received from Hay House, via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKELDVL0JPPX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401946275#wasThisHelpful","RKELDVL0JPPX9","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While on vacation I received this so my sister and I decided to each try it. I have heart palpitations and she has very high blood pressure so we both have to watch what we ingest.That said, neither of us showed any adverse signs. We started with one pill and then worked up to one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon. After a week of feeling good and no negativity, we both decided to take two in the morning. Even on one pill I felt much better. Alert and energized. She did not get the same feeling but she also drinks 6 Red Bulls a day. I'm a one coffee and then strictly water type. I'm not sure if the Red Bull's throw off her system (probably!!) but we definitely did not get the same positive reactions.Having depression, I have to pay attention and prefer to not ingest anything I do not understand. This made me feel WONDERFUL! I'm sure it is the dosage of caffeine but it is nearly like what some call a happy pill. I feel much more energized and feel as if my mind is sharper.I realize this is for dieting but while on vacation neither of us have been watching our diet.

"Being a book reviewer I rarely buy my own books. This sounded encouraging and exciting and fortunately not expensive so I thought, why not?I am so glad that I did. This does have some things that I have heard before. My husband is overweight and I am working on it. I'm only 15 pounds away from my goal but some days that feels like 100. I can tell that I am losing energy as I get older but especially since I now work from home.The insights into this are great. I love the working for your brain idea. I'm getting my degree in psychology and this just seems to make sense. There is so much that our brain can do for us, if only we let it! But most people do not even know how they are hurting their brains or what to do about it.This is a simple, yet effective way of introducing people to ideas that may be a bit beyond what they are used to. The biggest thing that hit me was all the talk about sugar. While watching my niece and nephew we went shopping and it seemed that everything they wanted had an inordinate amount of sugar in it! Why are we allowing this much sugar to get into our bodies?! And more importantly, why are we feeding our children this crap?Fortunately, I was in a store where they have a diverse selection of multiple items. After looking at juice I found one (ONE) that did not have sugar in it. Spaghetti sauce was the same way. Applesauce seemed like it had more sugar than apples. My niece and nephew now think I'm a health nut but I would much rather them think that than to ingest all the amounts of sugar that we are getting used to every day.This book is just a wake up call. It has an enormous amount of information that I found very appealing. It is also not that difficult to incorporate. Even for children!A must read if you care about your brain and what you're putting into your body!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPD7YD5Q5VUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004C43GJW#wasThisHelpful","RAPD7YD5Q5VUG","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The packaging could definitely be better. The moisture from the mud was leaking before I opened it. Once opened it leaks everywhere.This is my first mud mask and being that it is mud I expected a smell but this really smells. I am curious if others smell as strongly but after reading other reviews I am finding that no. I'm not sure why this is so pungent but I tried it anyway. Do not love the smell but it is not a deal breaker. Consumers just be prepared for a very muddy smell. I live in Louisiana and I could probably dig up some mud and it would smell similar.As for the mixture itself, it is easy to put on. A bit messy. The moisture and mud did not mix well so I mixed it with my fingers before applying. It does dry quickly so the five minutes was not a huge deal. After a few uses I do not see a real difference and it is uncomfortable enough that I do not see myself buying more in the future. I think had I been more aware of mud masks that I may use it more. That is going to have to be for each consumer to decide for themselves.Overall, it was not bad.

"What a great second book. As thrilling and exciting as the first. Kept me on the edge of my seat.If you have not read the first recently you may feel compelled to do a quick re-read. I sadly did not have the time and there is very little in this one to remind the reader of the story in book one. There is a brief beginning which covers the first book but again, very brief and not much is in that.That said though, I was able to jump in and pick this up without many worries. I wish I had read book one recently but I still feel really good about the plot and the characters, which are amazing!Once again, Madeline is fighting for her life. She’s also fighting for the love of her life, Samuel. It is strange to have him seem so distant to her so I can only imagine how she feels.Ryan threw me off a little bit. But, as I warmed up to him, although he is not in a lot of the book, I grew more accustomed to his weird speech and way of holding himself. He talks to Madeline as I am sure she talks to Samuel. I like Ryan though and hope to see more of him in book three.As for the plot, this one takes Madeline back to Portugal. Going from cell phones and internets to medieval times I can only imagine how she feels. She’s constantly saying and doing things that they have to ask her about. You think she would e more quiet but she is too strong willed. I love that she uses frigging all the time. It throws everyone off and just makes me laugh. But, still… talk about not being aware of where you are at! In those times she could be burned as a witch just for her vocabulary!!As for her message this time, she is totally thrown off (as anyone would be) and is just trying to find her way in the world, when of course she sees Samuel. It is quite interesting to see him so different but the message was interesting. I think I would have preferred a few more clues in present day to go with her message. Just to help bring everything together.As it was, though, I loved it and the way Pamela Dumond is able to take someone from today and etch them back into time. The story is amazing and I cannot wait for the third. Time travel romance at its best. Very different and edgy and yet still has the soft romanticism.Received by the authors, through Xpresso Book Tours, for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7DGNCZN6DOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01117YZI8#wasThisHelpful","R2I7DGNCZN6DOA","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

As I read I had more and more questions but then had to dig through some less exciting information. I loved the narrator but the next couple of chapters kind of threw me.Fortunately for me, I stuck with it. Once Elian is added to the story, the plot really picks up. The characters are amazing but Elian wound up being a step above some of the others. Sadly, he also winds up being SO different that he gets not only himself, but everyone else, into trouble. Even so, I just loved the addition of Elian. He was a wild card that really needed to be added to stir things up.Greta is a bit two dimensional at first but Elian helps her to think differently than what she’s been taught. This side of her is compelling but dangerous. Their lives are always on the line and one step off of that line, they are tortured.Xie is also one of my favorites. She keeps herself in line but is different from the others. She walks the tightrope but dares to jump around when she can! Between her and Elian they really shake things up.The plot of the story was quite interesting. I want to compare this to Hunger Games but really it is its own story. There were a few hiccups where the story was a little slow but only small speed bumps. I was curious what dairy and goats had to do with the story but really the background to the story is what helps to create such a good plot.The ending was amazing. This is a love story of sorts but definitely was not what I imagined. I loved how it played out but the ending… the ENDING! Fortunately Erin Bow said on Goodreads that she is setting up another novel that will be a companion. Which is great because I want to know what happens next, and you will to!In short: Great read. Good dystopian. A nice addition to the YA dystopian genre.Received by publisher for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IK10NVOT7CLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBKUWQC#wasThisHelpful","R1IK10NVOT7CLV","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun, flirty with a lot of philosophical ideals for pleasure.This is one of those that I picked up and had a completely different idea of what it was. I read the synopsis but for some reason didn’t get the LGBT thing from it. That doesn’t bother me, I’m not that much into it, nor erotica, but after I started reading I thought, why not go with it and see where it ends up. There wound up only being a very few parts where I skimmed.That being said, had I picked this up FOR the LGBT element, I may  have been more disappointed. There actually is not that much. What is there is sexy and enticing but it is a short book, just do not expect it to jump in and sizzle.The plot line is actually interesting. So easy to read that I got through this in one evening. I really like Ken. He’s stressing a bit and his leaky faucet is driving him crazy. Especially since he has to finish a paper soon. Insert sexy plumber. Having had a completely different idea of the plot I didn’t think of anything until Ken said the plumber was really sexy. Threw me a little but not enough to not be interested. But that portion wasn’t even until 36% in! Most of this was about Ken and his ideals, giving a really good idea of where he was coming from before Mark even enters the picture.The thoughts that go through Ken’s mind are just like any horny teen’s! I loved how he handled (or didn’t) the situation. He was really normal person with a crush.That said the plumber, Mark, was a bit more two dimensional. They talked a bit but I wanted to know more about him. Ken was stressed though and it came through in their conversation. Only portions that really felt stagnated.Sexy, fun, and very easy to all in love with. I loved the philosophical elements!Received by publisher for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23HOXCPKDNEMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0153QCU2Q#wasThisHelpful","R23HOXCPKDNEMA","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not realize when I saw this that it had so much to do with the book To Kill a Mockingbird. It was apropos since my family’s book club had decided on reading Harper Lee’s books this month.Upon starting I had not read To Kill a Mockingbird and put this on hold until I finished. Although that was not necessary since Matt Rawle gives a synopsis, and in some cases talks a bit more in depth about the book. I wanted to read To Kill a Mockingbird to get a good understand of where Matt was coming from but really, it is not required.Many of his chapters have to do with the characters and plot of the story but the main plot of this book is about loving one another. Matt Rawle constantly goes back to biblical passages to remind us what love is and how we can use the ideas of TKAMB and put them into our own lives.For those on the blog it is known that I am a new christian. I am not one that goes around professing my feelings but I do try to follow in Jesus’s footsteps. Or Mother Theresa’s, Buddha’s, etc. The people who really made a loving difference in this world are the ones that I look to for what to do. Matt is able to take the things that happened in the Jim Crowe times and adjust them to our beliefs and ideals of today in a Godly way.Jesus’s main idea while he walked this earth was one of peace and love so it saddens me to see so much violence today. TKAMB sheds some light on why the violence is prevalent but Matt Rawle is able to bring it all back around to biblical sense; to shed light on the problems and how to fix them within ourselves.In short: This is an amazing book. Even if I were not a Christian I would want to read this. The ideas are biblical but the message is transcendent. The message is clear if only we would open our minds to really listen.Received from publisher for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DAPZKC48831G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501803697#wasThisHelpful","R1DAPZKC48831G","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is set in Paris and the way Mary sets out the scenes it is nearly like you are there! Beautiful descriptions with a lot of French thrown in, which didn’t totally throw me off and was mostly fun!This is about a group of gals that are tap dancers set up to dance on July 14 on a riverboat! Can there be anything more fun?! The gals themselves are adorable. Each different in their own ways.Sadly, this is my first time reading Mary McHugh so although I loved the plot I was not totally into the book. It seems like it can be read (as I did) without reading any of the other books in the series but at times I felt like I was missing portions of the plot. Meeting the gals was a very quick moment and then the plot moves along. Although, having not read the synopsis for a while, I was curious if this was a first because there is a lot of background added in.It was cute enough for me to want to read the others in the series. I stopped about halfway through, not to DNF (do not finish) but because I really want to get to know the characters more and then I’ll come back to this one.Also!! I was surprised to find some recipes! A little gift from the author! They sound fabulous too!Received from the publisher for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RSAAS67IKJ5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617733636#wasThisHelpful","R2RSAAS67IKJ5Z","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, this starts and if you have seen the film Aladdin you’re basically going to know the plot, verbatim. Sadly, it is like the author wrote it word for word from the movie. I love the move. LOVE the movie and have probably watched it with my daughter 100 times. Seriously. But, sadly it threw me off and as much as I loved the movie, the more the book was the same, the more bored I got.Sadly, it does not stop until about a quarter of the way in. This in itself turned me off a great deal. I think it was the fact that it would have been easier to just put the movie in! I can say the movie word for word so why would I need to read it? Liz Braswell does have a few things that are added in but it wasn’t enough to give more depth to the story like someone would want from a book. I wanted to really know the characters, not just the versions from the movie.This does have a twist where Jafar actually gets the lamp but I have to be honest. It came too late for me. It makes me a bit sad because my hopes were high for this one. I’m a huge Disney fan and normally love everything Disney but, like I said. It would have been easier just putting the movie in.Sadly, this will be DNF.Received by publisher for an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLJV6K9IQ9LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148470729X#wasThisHelpful","R3LLJV6K9IQ9LW","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great book full of different stories to explain how great and how scary prayer can be! Dangerous prayer is letting God know that you're ready to do as he wants and giving your life over but the dangerous part is asking.It's like that old adage be careful what you wish for. In the stories there were so many great things that happened because people were willing to ask how they could be used to help others.Out of the stories here, the one that resonated with me the most was the girl that had a really hard time after she became a teen. Her parents had a hard time as well trying to understand her, as all parents do during that time. They almost lost her when she tried to commit suicide. Fortunately they wanted to help her but they also knew that there were some things that they couldn't do without God.There are many stories like this one, that really delve into life and how hard it can be but how great it is to pray and surrender yourself.Very short, easy read that is an inspiration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MUPMG06NRLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQMEJYM#wasThisHelpful","R29MUPMG06NRLD","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was fabulous! Being a fan of Gail Carriger, I figured after reading the synopsis that I would love this. The main character is quirky but scientific and just really fun! Once I started reading I did not want to put it down.First of all, Veronica has a good head on her shoulders. She likes to think scientifically, gathering all evidence before forming a hypothesis, but is not always right. She’s even strong enough to say when she’s wrong!The beginning of this book showed that Veronica was going to be in for some hiccups with her new life. Her aunts just died and she is determined to take on the world, one butterfly at a time. While doing so she winds up getting into quite a bit of trouble and has to figure out a way out of the mess without digging herself in deeper.Then there is Stoker. They are like an old married couple, getting along one minute and grouching at each other the next. Always at odds I’m not sure where I was hoping their relationship would go. It is just another curiosity out of this outrageous, but fabulous plot.While they are not totally sure if their lives are in danger, they may be in danger of killing each other!It’s a fantastically wonderful tale with a lot of fun and drama thrown in. Just when I thought the plot was about to slow, something else would come from left field! But nothing truly was from left field. Lots of clues are left for the two to decipher.Fantastic!Received from publisher for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC9GGBBKBIRBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451476018#wasThisHelpful","RC9GGBBKBIRBB","A270WQDVN0X6J7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A270WQDVN0X6J7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only thing you can personalize is type your child's name when in parent mode.Other than the disappointment from the incorrect advertising, this was my 2 year old daughter's favorite toy from Christmas.

There is still many different modes and options so it doesn't get boring, but it's not too overwhelming.

We use it at the top of the stairs (despite the warnings) and I know it has saved our mischievous daughter.I don't like how difficult it is to open.  I get that you don't want your baby to be able to open it, but it is not intuitive and any adult that comes by my house can't figure it out.  We've had this up for 1 1/2 years and it no longer swings all of the way closed by itself.  Granted, it gets opened and closed a lot by my 4 year old who isn't as careful and gentle as he should be.

Luckily, I was able to find this bag in a local store for much cheaper than this online price. I wasn't expecting to find a bag that could hold shoes as well but, this bag does and comes with a small shoe pouch which was a big plus. I was able to fit 1 suit jacket, 3 dresses, 4 pants, and 4 shirts into this bag. I had the hangers for the pants and shirts joined together. I probably could've fit more clothes in if needed. In addition, I was able to fit 2 pairs of pumps, 1 flat loafer, and 2 pairs of flat sandals in the front zipper compartment and still had room to fit more. I used the shoe pouch for both the sandals. Everything fit neat and perfectly in the bag without looking packed/bulky. I didn't notice until I was putting the bag away that it had a hook on the bottom for easy folding while the clothes are in it. That is another plus! This bag has a new  canvas smell when taken out the package. I let mines air out for a couple of days before putting my clothes in.

"I've purchased many different brands of lotions (Avon, Aveeno, Body Butter, Palmers, etc.) to relieve my extra dry skin. Neither was able to fully moisturize my skin or last long enough to keep the ash away. I remembered using Nivea (blue bottle) years ago & wanted to give it another try. But, I saw this 48 hr extended lotion & decided to get it instead of the original. This lotion works wonders on my skin especially after a shower! I've noticed a difference in my skin not  becoming ashy after a couple hours at work...particularly on my elbows. The smell is nice & subtle, not overpowering.

The laptop would boot for another minute showing my desktop screen then, the blue memory dump screen appeared. Luckily, I kept the old memory stick. I took out the Crucials and put my old stick back in. The laptop indicated to boot in safe mode which I did, then I restarted normally. Thankfully, my laptop came back up as normal!

"I purchased this handle to replace the Moen 100710 shower knobs that keeps breaking on the inside. I didn't want to waste money on another one of those knobs. I found this and another brand (Danco) while shopping around for longer lasting alternatives. The Danco brand has metal adapters but,  I wasn't fond of the shape/design of the handle. So, I was a bit skeptical when I read previous reviews for the Moen mention that the inside pieces/adapters were plastic. I thought it was made of the same material as the knobs but, it seems to be more durable because it is a hard plastic versus acrylic like the knobs. Installation was simple only because I found instructions on which adapter to use online. Would've been nice if instructions were included in the box. The handle looks a bit weird because the opening is a little wide, plus I'm use to the knob fitting closely. Otherwise, it's working good for now.

Therefore, you have to take off any cases you have on the phone before putting it in the pouch. To be on the safe side, I put my phone in a ziplock bag, put it in the pouch then, tested it in a sink full of water first. It floated just as described and no water leaked into the case. The inner material is clingy (making it a bit difficult to put the phone in), but for a reason. If you put your hand in the case first to separate the plastic then, you can drop your phone in. You have to be sure to press the case down against the phone to squeeze out the air and seal the pouch to the phone and seal the closure flap together. Then you fold & velcro close. Would've preferred if it had a different material closure instead of velcro but, this will do for now.UPDATE 9/10/2014 - I used this case on my trip and it worked GREAT!!!! This case allowed me to carry my phone to the pool and beach while taking pictures with no worries. Every picture and video I took came out clear with no blur as if it wasn't in the case. I am so glad I decided to get this to capture every moment of the trip.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TU1THVK1PJD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LN9QG0#wasThisHelpful","R3TU1THVK1PJD1","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this product when I was in my local grocery store doing my usual weekly greens & fruit purchases to make my morning green juices. Recently, I've been cutting down on the fruits and additional veggies that I would normally purchase because it gets expensive. Also, some of the items spoil before I have a chance to finish it. As I walked pass the refrigerator aisle, I noticed this green juice. I read the label and saw that it included many of the things I like to juice. Then, I looked at the cost and compared it to all the items in my shopping cart. It was definitely cheaper, so I decided to give it a try. I did not expect it to taste so good. It's sweeter than I expected it to be but it definitely tastes better than the raw veggies and fruits that I normally juice. The only things missing from the ingredients are flaxseed and ginger. I will continue to drink this instead of juicing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260QK1KFIHDSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DAKOW06#wasThisHelpful","R260QK1KFIHDSE","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't heard of this gel until my hairdresser tried it in my natural hair to see if it will make my curls wavy and shiny. To my surprise it did just that and it HOLDS! It's very thick and best used mixed with a little water because it may begin to flake when applied on dry hair. It really keeps your style or whatever you're trying to do in tact. Unlike other well known gels I've tried (S-Curl and Eco). Those gels did nothing to hold my curly edges down, my hair up, or straight (made my hair more curly when I wanted a slick look).I love this Gummy Gel product but it's best to find in a local beauty supply if possible because the packaging when shipped is poor. This is disappointing because my hairdresser advised she hasn't seen it in the local stores. It appears so because it's not a known brand like Eco which could easily be found anywhere. :-(","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REWXA54DORS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077XDTMO#wasThisHelpful","REWXA54DORS8","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After many years of relaxers, hair pulling, brushing, and braiding, I never paid much attention to my edges until now. I decided to go natural and take the big chop plunge which took some getting use to. Therefore, I would use lots of headbands and braids in my hair until I reached a decent amount of growth. However, the last time I got braids it made my edges break so bad because they were too tight. I was highly upset!I did so much research on products that say it will make edges grow, such as, Dr. Miracle, ORS, Soft Sheen, Jamaican Castor Oil (this I actually tried), etc. Then, a friend introduced me to BB Pine Tar and I've been using it ever since. It's cheaper to buy from a local beauty store. It's not the best smelling but it's not unbearable either as others make it seem. You get use to it after the first couple weeks. I only use the Pine Tar on my edges. In the beginning I would use a different hairdress on my scalp to help counteract the smell but now it doesn't bother me. The results may be slow depending on your hair growth pattern, but it definitely works with consistent use. The directions says to use 3 times a week, but some weeks I use every day or 5 days a week. Plus, I am more careful with how I wear my hair making sure not to pull it back too tight, I comb instead of brushing the front of my hair, and no more braids.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSDMQ26OUFVIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RVGV0E#wasThisHelpful","RSDMQ26OUFVIY","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this conditioner after reading some bad reviews. Plus, it wasn't easy finding a local store for purchase. Eventually, I was able to find it after calling a few local beauty supply stores.It's been a challenge finding deep treatments for my natural hair that doesn't cause tangling. I used the Cantu Deep Treatment Masque on my dry hair after pulling out cornrows. It felt very soft and smooth during application. And it smells soooo good. However, it is a bit oily/greasy on the hands and takes a little effort to wash off. Then, I put on a shower cap and slept with it overnight. My hair wasn't tangled and I was able to easily finger comb it. The treatment rinsed out of my hair with no problem. In the end, my hair felt soft and moisturized.

"I recently started to go natural and did the 'Big Chop' a few months ago. Since then, I've been trying out many different products to see which ones work best for my color treated, curly hair texture. I've been using the As I Am Twist Cream and decided to look at other products within that brand. For a while, I've seen and heard of people doing co-washes with conditioner versus using shampoo. But, I always figured that conditioner alone could not do the job of a shampoo. I understand that there are some shampoos out there that strips the hair of moisture/oils, etc. For that reason, I have at least tried to purchase shampoos that are sulfate-free, such as Carol's Daughter.I read the product info and reviews for this co-wash, then decided to give it a try. First thing I noticed was how smooth it felt on my hair. I could also feel that it was actually cleaning the buildup from my hair and scalp. The best part of this cowash is it doesn't tangle. Combing out my hair with this product is amazing! It makes the process so much easier than other products I've tried.I'm still not totally sold on co-washing and may use shampoo occasionally. But, this Coconut CoWash will be a staple for my natural hair care products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JZ0HZDI8M8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008DFR2UU#wasThisHelpful","R37JZ0HZDI8M8L","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was doing some research on connecting my laptop to my LCD tv. At first, I thought doing it wirelessly would be cool. But I couldn't decide on which device would be the best to purchase. I did google searches on Imation, Netgear, Veedom, etc. However, I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend $60+ at the moment for something I was unsure about. So I watched a CNET review on connecting via HDMI. Seemed simple enough, only draw back would be the cord stretching across the room.I looked on local store websites to see where I could go to get one today (because I'm impatient...lol). So, I drove to a tech store and the sales clerk was showing me higher prices ($19.99+ for 6ft & up) that I did not see on the store site (less than $10.00). I looked around on my own and found only 1 Xtreme HDMI 12ft package just laying on the bottom of a rack. The packaging is different than what you see on Amazon but its the same brand. Since there was no price tag, I assumed it was going to be costly. I took my chances and asked the cashier for a price check. She said it was $3.97!!! I couldn't believe it. I immediately said, I'LL TAKE IT!Got home, plugged it into my laptop, then tv and voila...it instantly connected. I'm able to extend my screens to have 2 different things up at the same time (Internet, Office, or Videos). Plus, the picture quality is good and the sound works.

I do agree with other reviews I've seen about the output tray retracting. However, I'm assuming the printer would need a sensor to know when the printed docs are removed in order to retract. Otherwise, where would the printed docs go...I'll leave it up to Epson to implement that on the next model.Overall, it's a great product! I hope this was my last trip to the return counter...LOL.

I made sure to try this over the weekend just in case I needed quick access to a bathroom.  And I'm glad I did.  The next morning, let's just say I went with ease a few times.  I found this on sale at a local store and bought 2 boxes.  I gave it 4 stars only because I did have some painful cramping throughout the day before/during the multiple trips to the bathroom. But overall, it seems to do what it claims.  So if you're looking for a short lasting, easy to take laxative; give this tea a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NMZY0FG81LG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TRUDHK#wasThisHelpful","R2NMZY0FG81LG5","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before purchasing this CD, I read some of the reviews and was a bit puzzled by the song remix comments.  In my head I was trying to figure out what remixes???  I skimmed through the playlist online but I never played the clips.  So I'm thinking there are no remixes to those songs.  Anywho, I decided to go ahead and purchase it anyway to start a Whitney collection.  Got the CD in the mail a couple of days ago but didn't listen to it until today.  Played disc 1 & was happily singing with Whitney, all the while wondering where were the remixes that people commented about.  Then I popped in disc 2 & to my dismay, I did not recognize the beats behind the hits!!!!!  I was totally shocked & disappointed!!  I was so sure that the reviewers were mistaken or received the wrong CD, but that was not the case.  I hate the way they remixed those songs.  The originals were hits & definitely didn't need to be remade with this foolishness.  Now, I have to literally find/pay for the original version of those 18 songs to remake disc 2!! What a waste!","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMYTOFI43G3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004R84V#wasThisHelpful","RHMYTOFI43G3I","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really hoping this would be a good deep conditioning treatment, especially for protein purposes.  But, no such luck.  Used it after my wash and sat under a dryer for about 20 mins.  After rinsing, it wasn't all that good of a detangler.  My hair wasn't very difficult to comb while wet, but there was some snagging.  After roller setting & drying, my hair was VERY HEAVY.  There was no bounce in my hair, it's absolutely flat & blah.  Wrapping my hair took more effort than it should.  Since it's so weighed down, my hair doesn't even keep the shape.  To the touch, it almost feels like I heavily greased my hair with vaseline.  With that said, I'm still on the hunt for a good protein deep conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down or feel greasy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R248NPUWFVAS2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000TYO6Y8#wasThisHelpful","R248NPUWFVAS2U","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Several weeks ago, I tried the unsweetened version to this instant ginger tea & loved it.  I was in a local food market looking to purchase more of the unsweetened tea when I found this.  I tried it for the first time a couple days ago and it works just the same! Only difference is I don't need to add any sugar.  This sweetened ginger tea has the perfect amount of sugar needed.  It's not too sweet nor too bland, it's just right!  Also, the strength of this tea is great just like the unsweetened version.  The strong flavor/taste of ginger definitely comes through.  My only wish is that Caribbean Dreams would put more sachets in the box!  I love to drink big cups of tea and 10 just isn't enough when I like to use 2 at a time.  I will continue to repurchase this or the unsweetened version, whichever I can find locally.  I prefer this much more than the ginger tea bags, so I'm willing to overlook the amount sold in the boxes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R254R0I1V2QQVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00375C2R4#wasThisHelpful","R254R0I1V2QQVD","AFPZLMFCIH4G4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AFPZLMFCIH4G4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

So I searched Olay.com looking for other moisturizing body washes and found this.  I liked the idea of the Body Butter Ribbons and decided to give it a try.  I LOVE IT!  It's very thick and lathers really well.  The scent is strong but not overpowering.  Plus, it makes my skin feel clean & moisturized.

"This in shower lotion is a dream come true!  I've always hated applying lotion on my skin after a shower.  Partly because I was just lazy to do it.  But my skin has suffered from that neglect by being dry and itchy...especially during the winter months.  I've been using Olay Body Wash for years now & was looking on Olay.com for another scent/more moisturizing wash when I saw this lotion. I had no idea this in shower lotion existed.  So I purchased it from a local department store (cheaper than online) and have been using it for a couple weeks.  I am definitely hooked!!!  I will be a repeat buyer of this product.  It's sooooo much easier using this in the shower vs using regular lotion after the shower.  The scent is nice & stays on your skin.  This lotion also keeps your skin so soft & moisturized that you don't even need to apply any lotion after your shower.

"Ginger Tea is my favorite to drink, especially when I have an upset stomach.  Usually I would cut up the ginger root and boil in hot water.  Then I tried the tea bags.

"This is an excellent water Kefir starter kit. I did a lot of water Kefir research prior to purchasing these so that I would know what I'm getting myself into and have everything ready for when these arrived. My batches all go through 2 fermentation cycles and my grains are quite happy. They have doubled over the course of 3 batches! If you want fizzies, make sure you get some fresh ginger and place a good tablespoon or two of thin sliced ginger or shredded ginger in your water Kefir's first fermentation cycle. Make sure you put the ginger in a muselin bag so that you don't have to pick out the bits later.

"This thermometer is great in the fridge and to monitor the temp of the room where my Kefir ferments. However, it is not very accurate in the freezer.

"I scoured Amazon and even non-Amazon sites for memory foam body pillows. I have knee pain from a baker's cyst and foot pain from a compressed nerve. I've been uncomfortable for months with my old, flat body pillow. I had an extra memory foam head pillow, but it wasn't long enough to separate my knees and my feet. I knew I needed a memory foam body pillow but wasn't sure they even exist. I looked at so many sites and found that there are really appx. 3 different memory foam body pillows out there (many different companies sell the same ""brand""). I read every review on all of them. When I found this one, I already knew that when it arrives at my house it will be vacuum sealed to make it smaller for transport, and would require ""fluffing"".When it arrived I didn't just lay it out, I personally fluffed every inch, pinching and pulling the pieces apart. Memory foam can be forced down to a small size and made compact, so I wanted to make sure I affected every little foam piece and got them separated from each other. Since it was bent in the middle for shipping, I also actively redistributed the memory foam and slightly bulked up the center where I need the most support.. Once fluffed, it actually turned out to be a very large fluffy pillow. It's slightly heavy, but true memory foam pillows will be. I swap sides all night and have no trouble flopping this pillow from one side to the other as I roll with it between my legs. The bamboo cover really helps keep it cool. I was concerned the heaviness and size of the pillow would make me hot, but the bamboo prevents that. I also ordered a very large zippered body pillow cover that fits perfectly.The first night was the true test. I'm so used to waking up every hour or so in pain and tossing and turning, but I didn't! It was so wonderful. I got a real, full nights rest, no pain. Even better, I wasn't in pain in the morning. My knee and my foot didn't hurt. I am so glad they make this pillow, thank you for the wonderful sleep!For the pillowcase, I ordered the ""Allersoft Cotton Body Dust Mite and Allergy Control Pillow Protector, 21 by 60-Inch"". The open ended pillowcase that Amazon recommends with this product doesn't zip closed, so I decided to go with one that zips.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HDQ5ZDSEFCX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKY8BOY#wasThisHelpful","R3HDQ5ZDSEFCX1","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the best Manuka honey out there and I've tried a few! It has an excellent consistency, and a wonderful, smooth flavor. Other Manuka honeys I've had taste more medicinal, though I'd use it because it's great for my stomach ulcer. I have to admit, after just a week of use in the morning (before eating) and at night (before bed), my ulcer reduced to the point where I don't even notice it. Now that I've been using it for nearly a month, I believe it's completely healed. My ulcers have never healed so quickly and though I have no proof, I'm convinced this honey did the trick.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCZX8QUSZ44A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009SQCXDE#wasThisHelpful","R3MCZX8QUSZ44A","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband and I watch a lot of Science and History shows/documentaries. In fact, that's about all we care to watch. Big History was a great source of comedy to us. It reminded me of Idiocracy (the movie) where everything is overdramatized in a BIG way. Like: Big History makes Big connections and brings you BIG BIG BIG things that no one EVER connected before. Sometimes they make some BIG leaps and pass off BIG assumptions as BIG facts. You would swear that they actually discovered Moore's Law based on their BIG BIG final episode with the BIG revelation they make about their BIG connections. In fact, they make so many BIG recaps, you could really just watch the final episode and catch most of it.At least we had some BIG laughs. It was like stand up comedy night for us. In all fairness, they had some interesting facts that I didn't know about previously, but you have to take everything they say with a BIG grain of salt because they pass a lot of conjecture off as factual. This is probably good for 5th graders, but don't expect to keep teens or adults very interested.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J878Y9XRKD77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNR3ZF0#wasThisHelpful","R2J878Y9XRKD77","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this pack of blacklight reactive ""ball point"" pens because I saw all the 5 star ratings. I wish I could give this anything but a 1. I would actually give them a 0 if I could.Here are my issues:- This is NOT ""ball point"" regardless of the name of the product. This is a fine tipped marker. There is no ball and the only point is the tip of the MARKER. :(- Despite the fact that the ""pen"" containers are different colors, they are simply one color. I assumed the yellow would be yellow, blue would be blue, etc. :(- The pink one was completely dry... as a bone. There was no reviving it with water or anything.- The blue and yellow ones had inoperable blacklights. Perhaps they were already dead batteries? I'm not sure and since they were watch batteries I couldn't do anything to change them to test this out.- And finally, the caps didn't stay on the ends of all but one of them! In fact, I was scratching my head wondering how on earth they went through the trouble of making such a product without making sure the caps would fit on the end as you are writing. If you want to use one of these, you have to set the cap down and use the pen.Did I just get unlucky? Or is it because this was made in China? I don't know, but it was frustrating because I really need to find some pens that DO work. Luckily, the seller was very professional and offered a refund. The seller also mentioned that they have never had problems selling thousands in the past and literally has had 2 complaints (mine being 1 of them). They think it was simply a bad batch. If anyone know of any good blacklight reactive pens, please reply with the name or link to the product.

"I would LOVE to give this a 5 stars. If I were rating it just based on how well it cleans silver, it would be a 5. But there are so many problems that I would NOT have purchased this product had I known beforehand.0 STARS for cancerSeriously?! Why isn't this mentioned on the web site that this product contains cancer-causing chemicals?!0 STARS for the containerI would NOT buy this product again, partly due to the container it comes in. When you open it for the first time to remove the plastic cover, USE GLOVES. The plastic does NOT come off without cutting into it. One you have pulled it off you will notice that it still has plastic all around the rim. My husband had to bring out a knife blade to go around the edges. The cancer-causing chemicals were all over my hands, his hands, and the counter. Yuck! To make matters worse, when you store it you need to store it in a plastic bag, because there is no SEAL to keep the lid on properly. Tip it just slightly and you have MORE cancer causing chemicals all over the place! This is ridiculous.5 STARS for silver cleaningTruly, this works wonderfully on very tarnished silver. It comes out looking great! But considering the downsides, this isn't worth it. There are other products out there you can get with better containers that will also do the job.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TGPQW3R3EL97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J3MCVI#wasThisHelpful","R1TGPQW3R3EL97","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh no, where do I start...? My husband and I are seasoned psychonauts though we have never tried ayahuasca. We were looking for an informational-documentary-type video that shows the history of ayahuasca. We were also interested in seeing how it's made, how it's used, the effects, etc. Sadly, this video gave us NONE of that, and I mean none. This video is poorly done with terrible sound quality with no subtitles. It basically takes you on a small tour through the region where some people are still known to make their own ayahuasca, but didn't show anyone making it, consuming it, or even explain the effects or anything. The entire video is done in Spanish (because that's where they are) but with someone constantly translating to English. They really should have had the Spanish in there with English voice overs during editing, or perhaps use subtitles, anything. But had they done that we would have only had a 15 minute movie.On top of all the general disappointment, we hung in there, expecting to see this crew actually doing ayahuasca and document the effects and spiritual journeys. But no, none of that either. They show us the scenery as they go deeper into the jungle to find a spot to do it, but never do it on camera nor talk about it afterwards. To make matters worse, they had someone do their own little soundtrack that consisted of one very annoying (and loud) song over and over and over again. It was like fingernails on a chalk board. It was annoying. But again we endured hoping to see something interesting.About the only interesting tidbit was seeing Pablo Amaringo's art work. And even then they teased us by saying he did some amazing piece for them, but they weren't allowed to show it on camera and they could only look at it once a year themselves. Doh! They didn't show much of his art, so if I were you, I'd Google Pablo Amaringo. You would yield better results.It lacked everything we were interested in. It had 2 awards listed on the front and we later had a good laugh about those. They were insignificant, little known awards in some discreet location. Save yourself some time and money and just YouTube ayahuasca.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XNTZV94934CF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053O01SE#wasThisHelpful","R1XNTZV94934CF","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 12 year old son is obsessed with Yin-Yang, so I decided to get him this necklace. When it arrived, right out of the package the rope strand was dislodged from the closure. Fortunately, I had some crazy glue around so I fixed that without any issues. My son wore it to school and came home and said the clasp wouldn't stay closed and it fell off him, after all, he does run around a lot. Since the necklace is big enough I decided to crazy glue the whole thing shut. Now it is perfect! The necklace is inexpensive, so I wasn't very disappointed or anything. I think the clasp could be better and I'm not sure why it came with the necklace already dislodged from the clasp, but eh, I'm not disappointed. My son loves it and wears it daily. :) It gets 5 stars for coolness and wearability, 3 stars for durability design.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6Q4VCYT8VGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X7NIMI#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6Q4VCYT8VGY","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure what is up with the other guy giving a review, but there weren't many options for purchasing black lights on Amazon, so I decided to take a chance. Despite what he said, it did come in a 6-pack, which is perfect! I needed 4, and the other 2 will be my spares. They are great quality. I wasn't sure what to expect for quality simply because it's incandescent, but they are perfect. We are trying to make our bedroom very cool with neon paintings, lava lamps, etc. and this was the perfect addition.

"I realize there are already many reviews for this, but I felt I should add mine as well. This is an AWESOME hand truck. I love how compact it is. I remember seeing it folded up when it arrived wondering how something so well compacted would expand into a sturdy hand truck. But wow, it easily expanded into its full size and is the perfect size for moving things around. We are in the middle of moving and this is perfect for lugging a couple boxes from one room to another. We have Ozarka water delivered to our home as well and found this is PERFECT for grabbing those water jugs and transporting them inside. When you are done using it, you can simply fold it up and store it. It doesn't feel flimsy, like I expected it to, and I love the foothold, which makes it easier to start your lifting. This was inexpensive. For something this excellent, I would have paid twice as much!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BXPIV2HZ75I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HVVSDU#wasThisHelpful","R2BXPIV2HZ75I7","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this harmonica for my son on his birthday along with other musical instruments. It appears to be a standard harmonica, but I was very surprised at how nice it sounds, especially for the price! It's nice and heavy and durable. I remember having a harmonica when I was a kid and it used to clog up and such, but this is very easy to use and hasn't clogged up yet.

"These sandals are quite comfortable once you get the correct size figured out. The conversion chart didn't work so well for me and I had to return 1 pair and order a larger size. It's just one of those things where the European conversion doesn't always translate well, especially if your feet aren't entirely symmetrical. The sandals are quite comfortable and soft. The only drawback is I feel I should have opted for the sandals without the heel strap. I like to be able to slip in and out of sandals quickly. Although the strap is comfortable and holds the sandals on quite securely, the leather is still hard enough that I have to give quite a tug to release the strap and I spend more time than I would prefer ""slipping in and out"" of these. As a result, I still wear my crocs a lot. It's not just laziness, I had spinal surgery so it's harder for me to bend over like that. :( I think I will order another pair of these, only without the strap.

"I never thought I would be writing a review about a dog brush, seriously. But this thing is awesome! We have a 2 year old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with medium length hair. She tends to get matted hair if not brushed very regularly and has long wavy hair on her ears. We tried a regular bristle brush and were completely disenchanted. This ""Miracle Coat"" dog brush is absolutely perfect though. We are able to cut down on how often she goes to the groomer by brushing her daily. She looks forward to it every day. It removes enough hair that we don't find huge clumps of hair just hanging around the edges of our hardwood floors any more. The hair is also quite easy to remove from the brush itself. You just kind of roll it off the brush. This size was perfect as well. Any bigger would have been too large for her breed. The bristles are strong enough to work out mats, but gentle enough to be used on her ears. I highly recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SU4DK8XB81B7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QFRY76#wasThisHelpful","R1SU4DK8XB81B7","A3TNRFXEFDG80J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TNRFXEFDG80J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am now officially a Whitelines fan! I had no idea something so simple as making the background slightly gray with white lines around the squares would make such a difference. The paper is excellent quality, and since it's a spiral book, it stays open and flat with ease. My husband and I love to freehand geometric drawings on a whim, and this is perfect for that. We keep graph paper everywhere now and the Whitelines brand is our favorite. When you write, your drawing/writing stands out more than the paper itself, which is how it should be!
