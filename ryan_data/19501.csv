"This Melissa & Doug Round The City Rescue Rug is a great gift for children. I know my great nephews loved zooming around on that colorful rug to perform various rescues in the city. The children can use their own vehicles or additional toys on this colorful rug to make up their own adventures. Plus the rug stands up to being used in a not so gentle way, which is very important if kids are going to be running toy vehicles over it.I recommend this Melissa & Doug Round the City Rescue Rug highly for anyone who want to engage a beloved child's imagination. The kids love it  and it is sturdy enough to withstand the wear and tear a much used toy endures.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYHFO3LK1HPXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012508I0Q#wasThisHelpful","RYHFO3LK1HPXC","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Lenox Angel Wishes Holly Bell China Ornament is the perfect gift for the person you know who collects Christmas ornaments. Lenox has been know for making beautiful ornaments for many years and this is one of prettiest ornaments I have seen.It is small and it is delicate, not a suitable ornament for a child because the child could (unintentionally) break the ornament. But for those of us who collect angels or Christmas ornaments, this is a perfect gift. You can start your Lenox ornament collection with this beautiful angel. I recommend this highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OTG0ZNNGWRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFBGW5E#wasThisHelpful","R26OTG0ZNNGWRL","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a pizza stone I have used for a long time. I have never been able to find a satisfactory way to clean it. I clean it but it just doesn't really seem clean to me. I received the Cusinart CCB-399 Pizza Stone Cleaning Brush and finally took it to my pizza stone. It looks as if it should be a grill brush as it has a very long (to me) handle. Maybe this is how this type of tool is designed, I don't know. But what is important is how the brush works on the pizza stone. I was very pleased with the brush after I cleaned my pizza stone. I didn't have to scrub to try and get the icky stuff off. The brush worked its magic on the pizza stone and it was very clean.I am very happy with this pizza brush. I advise anybody with a pizza stone to buy this brush to thoroughly clean their pizza stone. It almost looks brand new (it is over 20 years old). And if you are buying a pizza stone as a gift, I suggest you buy this to accompany the gift. The reciepients will be very happy for your thoughtfulness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWLHZDKXXFJA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N0L5QLO#wasThisHelpful","RWLHZDKXXFJA9","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, this Serta Plush Velour Electric Heated Mattress Pad is so very comforting. You can set it up easing and have your bed all toasty and warm by the time you go to bed,  You could set your thermostat lower because your bed would be warmer. There are 10 different settings so you can get the amount of heat you want. It also automatically turns itself off after being on for 10 hours. And the best part? It is machine washable and dryable. So if you spill something on the mattress pad, no big deal.The top is microplush which is extremely soft. Combine the softness with the warmth and you have a perfect environment to sleep in. It is especially comforting during those unfortunate sneezing, coughing sick days. It cradles you in its warmth.I recommend this product highly for people like me who are always cold and I think it would be a great gift for someone who always feels cold. But don't try the gift mattress pad unless you bought yourself one of these - you will  not want to give it up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PC41KY8WFFE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EHI9NU#wasThisHelpful","R2PC41KY8WFFE5","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My youngest sister had a similar toy when she was a kid and she really enjoyed. What my mother did not enjoy was the mess she could create by playing with this. This art spinner seems a little smaller than the one my sister had.This was for my great niece and she loves it. It's easy for a child to use (age 6 and up). This model has a splash shield, so hopefully my great niece will not be repainting her bedroom walls while creating with this toy. It does need a C battery to be fully functional. There are 20 cards and 5 colors for the child to use. I am going to try to buy more supplies so my great niece will have them on hand when she feels creative.. This toy doesn't make noise or play a  video game, but it is something very different for kids of today. It inspires them to use their imagination. I recommend this toy highly for someone buying a child of 6 or up a creative toy","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LUF687BKSA4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHGG1IK#wasThisHelpful","R1LUF687BKSA4I","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This DII oversized towel set is very pretty. It's eggplant and white print make a nice contrast to my kitchen where I tend towards blues and yellows.The dish towels are oversized which is very handy if you have a lot of dishes to dry. They are made out of 100% cotton.I will warn you that you have to be careful with these towels. You have to wash them separately so the colors do not bleed I washed mine with a cold water and vinegar rinse so the colors will not run. That's a trick my mother taught me and it usually works.I recommend these towels for anybody in the market for off beat kitchen towels. They will add a splash of color to your kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187KBKQOTUEUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5IVLA2#wasThisHelpful","R187KBKQOTUEUX","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another DII kitchen product I can recommend. These towels are plush but of course I think they should be more plush. It's a personal preference and should not affect your enjoyment and use of these towels. They are durable and work well for the varied tasks in the kitchen. I wasn't too thrilled with the green color, but that is also a personal preference.Except for  my color preference, these clothes are a good buy.

"The DII Kitchen Millennium clothes are perfect if you need to scrub a delicate surface without scratching it.  I have used this on my refinished tub and have been pleased with the results. I can't use any harsh abrasives on the tub because it has been refinished so these cleaning clothes have been extremely helpful.

"I usually buy the store brand paper towels because they are cheaper than brand name paper towels and like most people, I am trying to save money. But after using the Georgia-Pacific Perforated Roll Paper Towels  i realize that I made a foolish choice. The Georgia-Pacific paper towels actually save money because they actually perform much better at any task than the store brand paper towels.For instance, need to wipe up a spill? The generic paper towels make take 4 or 5 to clean the spill. The Georgia-Pacific paper towels only require 1 paper towel. So the money I ""saved"" using generic paper towels is non-existent because I have used more paper towels. It doesn't make a lot of sense to actually pay more for a poor quality product when you can buy the much higher quality Georgia-Pacific.I recommend the Georgia-Pacific Perforated Roll Paper towels to anyone and everyone that uses paper towels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NO2JZ8AOPX34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q271IQK#wasThisHelpful","R1NO2JZ8AOPX34","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""Faith and Inspiration"" necklace is quite pretty. The eighteen inch chain is made out of sterling silver. The pendant is two toned, the body of the angel is sterling silver with a cubic zirconia. The heart the angel carries is gold toned. It comes in a small soft bag tucked into a jewelry box.This necklace is quite delicate looking but looks are deceiving. This necklace is beautiful and well made to take everyday wear.

"Daisy McDare is your normal small town interior decorator, if there is such a thing. Daisy is coming off of a breakup with her boyfriend when she lands what seems to be a dream job. Her old friend, Kara, married a  rich painter. And now Kara wants to redecorate the ""parlor"" into a party room. Sounds great, doesn't it? Old friend, great job, a bigger payday than usual.  Daisy does have a little envy of Kara for living the glamorous life.The envy quickly recedes when Daisy meets Luke, Kara's husband and the two obnoxious stepchildren. They are an adult son and daughter, contend to freeload off of Daddy. Then there is the matter of the hunky gardener, who is definitely interested in Kara. And Anna, the maid/cook who makes the cranky Like smile like he doesn't for his wife.Toss in a murder. While Daisy tries to comfort Kara, there is rising suspicion that Kara murdered her husband. Or maybe one of the ""children"" did it? They were cut off from Daddy's will?Daisy takes all of this and more and manages to solve a crime the police are unable to solve.. This seems a tad strange, but the story is well told with relatable characters. That Daisy believes there's nothing that can't be solved with chocolate, there are lots and lots of references to cupcakes, candy and all sorts of sweet stuff.. Oh, and she does eat a few vegetables in the course of the book.I recommend this book to anybody who is looking for a engaging read. The characters are relatable (okay, except for the rich people) and enjoyable. If you need a break from all the horrible news in the  world, this book will give you a delightful respite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNZNUF9LB5D1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6S2CRS#wasThisHelpful","RNZNUF9LB5D1C","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the bright colors of this Dll Oceanique 3 piece bathroom set. It's blue,  green and white and it really brightens my small bathroom.  The three pieces are a chevron patterned shower curtain (72""x72"") in the blue, green and white pattern Very bright and eye opening especially for the morning shower. The second piece is a 16""x24"" blue microfiber rug. that feels very good on the feet. The third part of the set is 12 blue shower hooks to match the shower curtain and the rug. They are easy to use and really compliment the shower curtain.One of the blurbs stated this is perfect for a kid's bathroom. Well, I only have one bathroom and that's where I am using it. I was afraid the colors would be overwhelming in my small blue bathroom, but they worked. Obviously if you purchase it, you can use it anywhere you please.I like this bathroom set, it's so bright and cheerful. If you are in the market for a slightly wilder bathroom set, you should definitely consider this one. I believe you won't be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSPOY8R6XCN6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGVAHSM#wasThisHelpful","RSPOY8R6XCN6V","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not that familiar with PaintShop because I have not used it that much. I was pleased to find this program  as it seems relatively simple to use. I realize some people will get it right away, understand it intuitively but I'm not normally that person. I need to play with it a bit before I actually  feel comfortable with the software.The installation was relatively smooth (Windows 10 OS). The program did not seem to interfere with the other programs I already had and for me, that's good. It has some new features (all of it is pretty new to me) such as being able to wrap the words around whatever shape you choose. This is very convenient for playing with photos. I haven't really made a project with the software yet but I am enjoying playing with it.I recommend this software highly for anyone who wants to organize their photos in one convenient area. I look forward to totally immersing myself in this software and being able to organize my photos.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3ESKSC2S9CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60EW#wasThisHelpful","R2E3ESKSC2S9CU","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At one time in my life, I used to make my own greeting cards with rubber stamps and collage. I tried to make them reflect the event (birthday, wedding) and I was usually satisfied with the way the cards turned out. Though it sounds as if it should be very easy to do, it's not. It takes a lot of material and time to figure out exactly how I could achieve the effect I was trying to obtain. Those card making days have been long behind me.Because of my experience, I was very interested in seeing the Hallmark Signature Collection. I was afraid it would be an imitation handmade card, slap dashed together and not really looking that great. I was quite pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong. The cards, as one card states, are ""fabulous"". There's a beautiful stiletto heel, dressed up in (fake) jewels and glitter. There is a lovely line drawing of a woman with her dress accented in pink flowers floating around the dress. The sentiments expressed in the cards is very simple (one example: ""Happy Birthday, fabulous you!"") so you have space to add your own sentiments. These are great cards for the women in your life._BUT_  having written this review, I want to add a few ""buyer bewares"". If you plan to mail these cards, you will need a padded envelope (this does not come with the cards, you have to supply your own). You will also have to pay extra postage due to the weight of the card. If this sort of restrictions are an issue for you, you will not want to buy these cards. They are beautiful but some people do not want the extra expense of money and time to mail a card. That's fine - you can hand deliver them to your friends. No extra effort than a regular flat card.On the other hand, if you want something truly special for your friends, this collection of cards is right for you. It is impressive and beautiful and will certainly be treasured  by the recipient for years to come. I recommend these cards highly..","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU315GNUU1MPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUSWZNU#wasThisHelpful","RU315GNUU1MPF","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Toners for printers are expensive - very expensive. Sometimes it seems like  a better deal financially to just buy a new printer for the cost of the toner alone - there is not that much difference in price sometimes. And of course the toner runs out at the most inopportune times, leaving me to try and find an expensive replacement at the local office supply store quickly. This method works very poorly and ends up leaving me frustrated and angry.Then I found the EPS Replacement Toner to fit my Samsung printer on Amazon. I was hesitant at first to try it. After all, I have never used this brand before now. I also remember some incredibly cheesy generic toners from worker being absolutely horrible to use. But I checked the prices of toners again and decided that the toner was at least worth one try. f t didn't perform well, I'd know not to buy it again.I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this toner cartridge. It was easy to install and worked well with my printer. The printing is clear and sharp. The cartridge doesn't shed what I call toner dust everywhere. (You know what I am talking about, those tiny black dots that sometimes sprinkle the paper, making it messy to handle). I am impressed and happy.I recommend this EPS Replacement Toner to anyone in need of a toner for a  printer. There are other configurations to fit various printers and you can find a toner that suits your printer. I intend to keep using these for my Samsung and I believe after you have tried this product, you will use this for all your printer needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KDGQ43WHKMFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQSHHVG#wasThisHelpful","R1KDGQ43WHKMFR","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Zaki Designs Hydra Trak Insulated Tumbler is a colorful 20 ounce tumbler. The color is from the colored bands that surround the tumbler. The purpose of these bands is more than ornamental.

This makes it much easier to track how much water you have consumed through out the day.I recommend this tumbler for people like me.

"Unfortunately, I am very disorganized in some areas of my life. For instance, home improvement bills. Where do I file them? What should I do with them? And those weird receipts for postage or some repair to a tool? Well, I have to tell you upfront that I do not organize the way normal people do. For instance, I have my divorce papers (from my first husband) in a file marked ""Medical"". That may seem strange, but if you knew the situation, you'd agree with me.So I am using this neat little file for my home improvement receipts as well as for repair receipts. This handy colorful file has 6 pockets, so I can, if I want add a few more files in there.

"I love these adorable little coasters. They are well made out of silicone in bright colors and look like a giant button. They are easy to clean, I wash these off with a little soap and water. The button coasters are approximately 3 1/2"" across and are suitable for hot drinks as well as cold drinks. They are easy to use and stay in place.But the most endearing quality to me is the cuteness factor of the button coasters. I not only want to use them as coasters, but maybe for a few craft projects. I am considering getting at least 1 more set of button coasters so I can be creative with the coasters.Yes, these button coasters are functional as  well as fun and fashionable.

All those pink products advertised in October making all that money for the companies that produce the stuff. Most of it does not go into prevention or cure, just paying the executives big salaries.If you are wondering why so much money is being spent on ""research"" on breast cancer, read this book. It won't make you happy but it will give you what you need to break away from the pink ribbon culture.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSHQIB41BJ98G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0816648999#wasThisHelpful","RSHQIB41BJ98G","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I guess this little kit is meant for a person 14 years and up. I am over 14 years old (by a few years  ;) ),. It has been gray and raining and snowing here for what seems like forever and we have more snow  in the forecast. My intention was to give this to my great niece and let her create. However, being curious and suffering from cabin fever, I decided to open up the box myself .  I will say my original intention was to check out what  was included in the kit. But looking at the kit's components ,The tools included are a small amount of yarn, 2 pompom makes (different sizes) and a small book of how to make a pompom creature. I thought the little Russian pompom doll was cute, so I thought I would try it out. After all, I could always replace the yarn.The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The project does not require a long time or a lot of skill. There is more than enough yarn to complete more than one of the projects given. I recommend this Make Pompom Fun Shapes kit highly for anybody over 14 years old. I also recommend this kit for an older person that may be interested in playing with pompoms. It's a bright spot in a snowy day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XGOH3WWESCO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1589238648#wasThisHelpful","R2XGOH3WWESCO9","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Melissa and Doug produce many quality art projects for  children, so it is no surprise that the item is terrific. Children can easy complete the mirror and treasure with a minimal supervision. A huge plus is after this is finished, there is not glitter scattered all over the house. Yes, really, a glitter project where you won't be brushing glitter off of you and everybody else in the house for the next 6 months.I know this sounds incredible, but it's true. The glitter is applied using a sticker. You carefully remove the sticker backing and apply it to the correct area and rub the sticker into the right place.

(Some people just don't seem able to make good hot tea.) So this morning I made a huge steaming cup of the kind with the honey. It was great. I was hesitant to try the tea based on the increased caffeine of the tea. I needn't have worried. The tea was a little stronger than I am used to, but of course, that's what I had expected and wanted. The American Breakfast (I tasted the kind with the honey) was strong without being bitter, even after the tea was down to the last drop.

I realize it captures the eye and the mind of possible readers.

(There is, I think, about 40 pages of footnotes).  Dr. Holland writes in a way that is easy for the non-medical people to understand. It is not an easy read, but certainly an interesting one. If you are approaching menopause or going through menopause, you will definitely get a lot of good information from this book.I recommend this book for any woman who wants to understand herself better.

"""Love Never Dies"" by Dr. Jamie Turndorf was a difficult read for me. Not because it wasn't well written, it was. It's the subject matter that I found hard to read and process. I have ost a lot of loved ones in a relatively short time, so grief seems to be my constant companion.  But I thought I'd give this book a try (I'm not familiar with Dr. Turndorf) and see if it would help me suss things out.One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the how to make a connection part. It isn't hocus pocus or some sort of Ouija board type of thing. It seems to be a well thought out plan to allow the survivor to connect with his/her loved one. I have used elements of that to connect to loved ones, so I thought it was helpful.  Some people will not care for the book and that's okay, too. What mattered to me is what _I_got out of it and that was a lot.I recommend this book to anyone  who has lost a loved one, anyone who wants to reconnect with a loved one.

The pasta has a great texture and great mouth feel.But more importantly, this pasta can stand it's own against any sauce. I made my mom's recipe for pasta with whole tomatoes and green peppers. Whole tomatoes and green peppers  can be a big strong and overpower a less flavorful pasta. The elbows can sometimes seem to feel like squishy lumps in tomatoes and peppers.

"Dale Peck writes about the  time between 1987 and 1996,  or as Mr Peck calls it, ""second half of the first half of the AIDS epidemic,. He is extremely outspoken on the subject of AIDS (as his earlier works have shown). He focuses on several activists, some named but some unnamed..I remember the dark old days of the early 1980s, where I would hear about an AIDS diagnosis and within 2 weeks, I'd hear of the same person's death.Now AIDS is a chronic disease that can be managed but not cured (at least as of this writing). People who have been diagnosed AIDS have a much longer expected lifespan. But some of Mr Peck's descriptions frighten me.Mr Peck speaks often of people practicing extremely unsafe sex, including sometimes Mr Peck himself. I want to yell at the people in the book ""please don't do this,  please use protection, be careful"" . It's like watching a slow train crash, where everything is happening so you can see every gear, every shard of metal come flying off the train and you can't do a damned thing to prevent anyone from getting hurt.Mr Peck's work is sexually explicit, so if detailed descriptions of various sexual activities would upset you, do _not_ read this book.I recommend this book highly for anyone interested in that time period of AIDS.

"Believe it or not, cat treats are not always welcome by my 2 cats. And if you have a cat, you know they can be finicky to say the least.

"This book left me cold. Although it has been almost 34 years since my father's death, I was curious to see how other women handled that rite of passage. I have seen some of my friends newly shaken by the loss of their fathers in recent months. I was hoping this book would be some sort of guide to the recently fatherless and I could pass it along.I was totally wrong. My life is (and was) nothing like Clea Simon's life. I'm not saying that my father and I had a perfect relationship, of course we didn't  because we are both humans. But compared to her life and father, I had an absolutely lovely walk in a beautiful sunshiny park.There is much blame laid at the fathers feet in this book about fatherless women. I don't know if it because most (if not all) women are much younger than I am. I don't know if it's because my mother worked since I was a baby, so I didn't have the stay at home mom/working dad  thing going on in my life. Both parents worked, both parents took care of the kids and household chores, (It wasn't in any way a 50/50 divide, but my dad did a lot more than sit in his recliner and smoke his pipe.) From the description M's Simon gives of her childhood, I would say that the Simons had a dysfunctional family.There is no tying together at what age the father dies and the changes occur. If you are 30, you will be going through a different life stage than if you are twenty one. These stages aren't even considered in this book, it's as if everybody exists in a dysfunctional vacuum until the father dies. And then, somehow, you are ""free"" to do what you want. It never occurs to the author that a death in the family makes everybody to think of their own mortality, that some changes may occur based on the knowledge that life is short.I am very disappointed in this book. Maybe if my life more closely matched the author's life, I may have gotten something worthwhile from this book. I will not recommend this book to anyone and I intend to dispose of the book.  Your mileage may vary.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K8G0VB8FD6KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0471228958#wasThisHelpful","R3K8G0VB8FD6KM","A15LK8DSFQZZ52","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15LK8DSFQZZ52?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think what really puts this into the realm of the casual grower is the fact that it uses LEDs. This basically makes the device worry free. The LEDs won't need replacing, they don't generate much heat and they use less electricity than conventional bulbs. Combine that with the pump to circulate water, automatic on/off cycles to 'rest' the plants and a notification of when it's time to add more plant food to the water and it's a dead simple system.I had no problem with the 3 seed pods that came with it. All are growing now and the basil in particular took off, being the first to require me to raise the lamp (the lamp height is adjustable -- you start at the lowest position and raise it as the plants need more space).Now I'm tempted to buy one of the larger models and then attempt peppers or cherry tomatoes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIRTKG9XWQQUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NBJLZU#wasThisHelpful","RIRTKG9XWQQUZ","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The camera itself is great and the whole cloud control works well too -- on Internet Explorer and smartphones, anyway. The plugin doesn't seem to work with Google Chrome and I was never able to figure out how to connect with the provided Windows software but I'm not sure that's necessary anyway. The IE plug appears to give you everything you need, including setting preset camera positions, taking pictures, changing camera settings and so forth.So once you get it setup it's fine. Really my complaint is that the whole software package feels like what you get when you let your engineers design the user interface. It's a bit....obtuse. It's functional but it's not pretty or easy to figure out. Still, the features are here and I see good potential for using these to setup a wireless network of cameras that can be easily monitored from literally anywhere, day and night. The ""Pan/Tilt/Zoom"" is very nice to have, too. The fact that it's ""cloud"" should also make it very easy for TRENDnet to keep updating the software without you having to do some kind of difficult firmware upgrade as with most security packages -- there's no ""central box"" as with other packages.

"This was great on my vacation. Hotels don't often give you access to a surge protector and there's usually too few outlets. You can pack your own surge protector but why not a 2-in-1 surge protector + device recharger? Pack it in your carry-on luggage (technically you must do this anyway -- airlines prohibit putting spare lithium batteries in your checked luggage) and you can use it unplugged to recharge your devices from the internal battery on the plane and then use it as a surge protector when you get to the hotel.Note that the 3-prong sockets are NOT for charging your devices. That's what the USB plug is for. The 3-prong sockets are purely for surge protection when plugged into a wall socket.The device outputs 2 amps which these days is getting to be standard. Be wary of devices that only output 1.5A or less as they may not even charge up a tablet. I ding it one star because it's only a 3000 mAh battery though. For the size of the device, I would think they could have done a lot more than that. There are similar sized devices (charger only, no surge protection) that pack over 10,000 mAh, which means a lot more device recharges without needing to plug in.

"This is a pretty great drone for its size. Best in class? Maybe!It's a palm sized drone which means very limited flying time (approximately 5 minutes) but you'll find that to be typical for drones of this size. There's just not enough lift to put in a large battery. But it's a great ""intro to drones"" that you can safely fly indoors. Being so lightweight and made of a pretty durable, flexible plastic, the drone is hard to destroy and hard to cause damage with. I've banged it into the ceiling, the floor, the walls, the TV, myself, crashed it numerous times rightside up and upside down and it's none the worse for wear.MAKE SURE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! I see a lot of people dinging the product because they clearly didn't read the instructions. You can find the instructions online at the manufacturer's website (which you can read before you buy so you have some idea of what you're getting). This is a toy but it's a sophisticated one.Features:TRIM! Lots of small drones don't have this option but this one does. Trim allows you to make small adjustments to the flight surfaces to correct problems. Drone drifts left nonstop? Give it right trim. Drone spins right nonstop? Give it left spin trim. Your first one or two 5-minute flying sessions should consist of getting your trim set. It will never be perfect but 5 minutes spent on trim will make it a whole lot easier to fly later.""AI"". This activates a sensor on the bottom of the drone that will allow it to automatically maintain a constant height, so that you don't have to fiddle with the throttle. The idea being that now you can work on simply flying the drone around -- left, right, spin -- and the ""AI"" will handle altitude for you. Of course, if you need to get over a sharp obstacle (like the back of a couch) you may need to turn off the AI and do manual throttle control but the AI option is nice for practicing the other controls.The controller takes 4 AAA batteries but the drone has a rechargeable lithium battery built into it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R85276TRHKZ5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9CEVII#wasThisHelpful","R85276TRHKZ5R","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, some credentials: I enjoy online gaming in the same sense that the United States Navy enjoys ships. I use TeamSpeak every day and frequently game for 4+ hour sessions. I need good headphones and I've tried quite a few.Headsets I have used recently:Klipsh KG-200. Okay design, lacks frills, good for gaming but bad overall sound balance for music (too bassy).HyperX Cloud Gaming. Solid build. Good sound. Stereo only with no frills. Confusing mic.Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Gaming Fury. Fantastic on everything except build quality. Plastic broke in the first month.Logitech G35. I really wish Logitech would have better build quality. I love everything about their stuff but their headphones do not last. The 'faux leather' junk they put on the headsets shreds quickly but the frame isn't well made either and eventually breaks.Astro Gaming A40 headset: Really liked these. Great quality but stereo only. They were my favorite until now.I dunno if I'm an expert but I've been through a lot of headsets.These EarForce Stealth 450s are my new favorite. Wireless, rechargeable, you can use them while charging them and the charging connection is just a generic micro-USB so any cord will do. Standard bluetooth range which for me means I can keep them on all the way into my kitchen downstairs and still listen to TeamSpeak while getting a drink. Has volume for input and output on the headset. Mic is detachable but really who does that.Things I wish were featured but which I do not dock points for:* 1 or more mappable buttons similar to the Logitech G35 (""Well you should just buy a G35 then!"" I would if their build quality wasn't so terrible! I love Logitech features but finally gave up on their headphones after the 3rd set.)* A button that controls the equalizer presets. This one isn't so bad because you CAN map that to a keyboard hotkey but your selection of hotkeys is very limited so you'll likely end up unmapping something in your games to make room for this.The design does not seem as rugged as, say, the Astro A40 but so far it's comfortable and I've had no problems. I wear it in 4+ hour long sessions and my chief complaint with previous Turtle Beach headsets was that they hurt my ears. No such problem here.As wireless headphones, though, expect that you may have to wrestle occasionally with Windows, which does not always do well with audio devices disappearing and reappearing. A lot of programs get locked onto one audio device and you may need to restart them if you turn on your headphones after starting the program. This is common to ALL audio devices though and is ultimately a Windows issue, not a problem with these headphones.I will update this review if I experience problems. I expect these will continue to be my daily headphones until something happens to them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SDURHUVQHQ89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZC3S72I#wasThisHelpful","R3SDURHUVQHQ89","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I saw something similar to this in a hotel and thought it was worth a shot: a bent curtain rod that gives you a bit more elbow room in the shower while still keeping the curtain anchored on the ends.This is a pretty good rendition but I wish it was curved more. The curve on this one is very slight. It will only gain you a couple of inches of space.Still, installation is easy. I actually just left the holes in the tile where the old shower curtain attached and put this over top of the holes. Being a tension rod, there was no need to drill new holes and the rubber backing covered the old holes just fine. I put it up myself but it would be easier with another set of hands to help you align it and tighten the tension while holding the rod where you want it.So far no problems in quality and with good tension and a big rubber base on both sides, it hasn't slipped. I put the curtain on the inside rod and use the outside rod to hang towels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHP2QPPIEF3AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92QI3K#wasThisHelpful","RHP2QPPIEF3AB","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to be a huge ViewSonic fan but I've had regular problems with their power supplies going out. I have actually opened them up, found the clearly burned out power supply, ordered a new OEM part, replaced it and had that one burn out 2 years later. Meanwhile, I have yet to experience this with Samsung. This 27-inch curved monitor is my latest upgrade from yet another dead ViewSonic.And it's fantastic. It blows my 5-year old Samsung monitor out of the water, sitting side by side, and that one was slightly better than my ViewSonic. The brightness is incredible. This is the first flat screen monitor I've ever bought where I had to turn the brightness down from 100 because it's just way too bright. The curve isn't noticeable when looking at the screen straight on. It just seems natural. It also makes me want 2 more of the same for a ""super wide screen"" experience.I'm a gamer and don't find the ""game mode"" necessary -- response time is fast enough anyway in normal mode.Probably the only warning is that it doesn't take DVI, which has been a standard monitor plug for years.

"This is a fun little conversation piece. For the price, it's not bad. I kind of wish they'd leave off the ship name, actually, since it's a fairly generic model that they recycle (with minor modifications) for other ships -- what I'm saying is that this is not an accurate representation of the USS Constitution. Not really all that close, even. But that shouldn't necessarily stop you. Accurate models, from what I've found, will require you to build it yourself or else spend $500+ to buy a pre-assembled version. Those look fantastic and if you don't mind the $500, I'd say look into those.But for this price range, it's decent enough, and one of the things you can converse about over it is the differences between this model and the real thing!It arrived fully assembled and other than a little bit of untangling, was ready to go and ship shape (ho ho ho).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FCL2C87O4UNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GA1XIZC#wasThisHelpful","R3FCL2C87O4UNY","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: Make sure you shop around for refills. Currently the ones on Amazon are double the price of the ones on the manufacturer's website.I had much better luck with this thing than I ever have with citronella candles.

Of course, if you only plan to use it for an hour or two every Sunday then the candles are more practical: you can always blow them out and save the rest for another day, whereas these pads will dry out.Still, we used it for an all day barbecue and hangout session and it worked notably better in its area than the candles and tiki torches did in theirs.Also note that the description of ""accent lighting"" is accurate. Some people seemed to expect an actual lantern (like a bright light) but this is really just for accent. It has a blue internal glow, about enough to see where the lantern is and that's it.

"Edit:Upon further use, I find this shaver grows on me. There is a technique to its use, though. Because the rotatory blades are spaced so widely apart, you need to sort of rotate the shaver as you go, to get full coverage. The individual rotors do well with the fine detail and the flexible head helps with the jawline.So I've basically gone from hating it to liking it after thinking about and giving it another shot. Just be aware that if you're used to foils, blades or even other rotatory shavers with closer spacing, this will take some getting used to.The charging/cleaning system is a bit of a gimmick, of course. For a monthly fee, basically, it will clean your shaver for you. You could just wash it yourself, though, and use the charger as just a charger. The head pops off and comes apart fairly easily for cleaning.The variable length beard trimmer it comes with works well too, and pops on and off like the other shaver head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTWGQZ59BJGMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOSDAA#wasThisHelpful","RTWGQZ59BJGMY","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an Android based streaming device with some interesting Nvidia twists meant to appeal to gamers (which I am!). My evaluation of it so far is ""needs some more work"".The #1 problem is the same as the Nexus: I don't know if this is Google trying to cut out Amazon or Amazon failing to work with Google but I don't see any way to view my Amazon digital content (Prime Movies, purchased movies, rented shows, music, etc) on this device. I think it locks you into the Google Play Store and the Amazon app is noticeably missing. That's the kiss of death for any device for me now -- I'm too invested in Amazon for digital content. If Amazon is to blame, tell me so I can send Jeff Bezos a Firmly Worded Letter. They shouldn't be trying to steer people into their Fire hardware as much as they should be trying to sell digital content to all sorts of devices. If Google is to blame then shame on them. Either way, though, as an Amazon Prime customer with lots of purchased Amazon content, this device screws me.The gaming angle of the Shield seems like a cool idea but:* I tried a free app game that somehow caused the Shield to turn off...?? I was playing it and the device just turned off. I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to turn back on.* I was surprised to learn that I could tie it into my desktop to play games from my desktop. Games that support a controller seem to show up automatically, so I got Planetside 2 and Witcher 3 on my list. This is pretty impressive and lets me play with a controller from my TV downstairs instead of sitting at my PC. In theory I think you're supposed to be able to play any game this way (although games without console controller support would be clunky) however I tried Magicka (which does support controllers) and the game crashed immediately. No idea why -- I went back to my desktop and tried it there and it started up just fine.So I see where they're going with it and there's some tempting features here but, even if we disregard the stability problems, Android gaming, while actually coming along nicely, is not up to par with a real console system. Desktop streaming is....I want to say a bit of a gimmick. Most PC games aren't practical for console control play and I don't have a real pressing need to play Planetside 2 from my couch instead of on my desktop.I guess the use-case here is if you want to be an early adopter, you want a streaming Android device, you get your digital content from Google Play exclusively, you want a greater ability to play games from your couch and you don't mind that early adopter pain that will go with it, go for it!Kind of a narrow audience, there.My vote is you wait for the ""Nvidia Shield 2.0"". Or maybe 6 months after this review by which time they may well have more things ironed out with software updates (I've already downloaded three big ones). But the physical problems of desktop vs couch are not going away anytime soon and I just don't see the Shield scratching too many people's itches.If you really want a streaming device for TV and don't care about games, get the Roku.If you want a streaming device that can do Android games (why do you want that?? does anyone??) I would actually go with the Amazon Fire over any of the Google devices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R240XR1XT8ULCB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U33Q940#wasThisHelpful","R240XR1XT8ULCB","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nosir, I don't like it. As a fan of Dresden Files, Iron Druid Chronicles and the Kate Daniels series I feel it's safe to say I like the genre, and I gave this series about 2.5 books before giving up on it, but in the end I just couldn't deal with it any more.The writing style is good and I enjoy the setting, the concept and the characters themselves, but what sent me over the edge was the character interaction: it's annoying and it never gets better. The main character might as well be a parody of abusive relationships and people who don't or can't get out of them because that's what she's in and well into the 3rd book it was still going on. The setup between the characters didn't make much sense and the ""vampires are super dangerous creatures on the verge of going crazy at any moment but it's fine, we can live with them"" concept didn't make sense either. I trudged through on the assumption that the character problems would get resolved at some point but, like I said, well into the 3rd book they were still a mess. It just wasn't enjoyable enough to keep giving it a try when there are so many other books to read.If you want a very similar series with better character interaction, try the Kate Daniels series.Or go ahead and try this book, but if you reach the end and think, ""Man this is pretty good but I hope the character interaction gets better in the next book"", that's what I thought. It doesn't.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G444ZUINZ67H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UAVAE6#wasThisHelpful","R1G444ZUINZ67H","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I vouch for this entire series. Despite the rather ridiculous cover art and uninspired book titles, the content is fantastic -- series vs series, I think this actually beats out Dresden Files, which is high praise coming from me, and I'd put it tied with Iron Druid Chronicles.I like the characters, I like what they do and I like how the series progresses. Kate Daniels starts off powerful and stays that way with the series developing more around character interaction and political intrigue rather than personal power level advancement (""Dragon Ball Z Syndrome""). The writing is solid, if you can excuse the overuse of some terms (Kate Daniels drinking game! Take a shot every time you read the word ""preternatural"", especially around book 4...) Not everyone lives through every adventure, so it's enough to keep you on your toes, but it's no Game of Thrones either.Basically if you're looking for ""modern day / altered reality fantasy with a strong female protagonist and good character interaction, dialog and action"", you're in the right place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L8F6TKKF115D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0441014895#wasThisHelpful","R2L8F6TKKF115D","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know -- ""why pay so much?"" Well, I've gone through so many of the cheaper showerheads. They keep breaking. The worst is when they crack at the base because the entire base -- where you hang the showerhead -- is actually hollow plastic, so that cracks and water sprays out!This one is still a plastic showerhead but usually that's not what causes problems anyway. The big difference is the solid metal piece that attaches to your pipe and is where you attach the hose and hang the showerhead. That's what you're paying for. There's no chance this thing can crack and break like all those cheaper ones I've gone through.And the head itself is nice enough. I wish it had a better ""mist"" setting but I do like the ""pause"" feature. I especially like the way you can set it to be ""halfway paused"" and get an even lighter water flow rate (that's nice when SOMEONE has been using all the hot water and you know you need to stretch what's left).Hose seems solid, no trouble at all with the connections, no leaks.

"Despite my 4 stars, I'd still suggest this is the best streaming box, overall, if only because of the number of apps it supports. There are things you can't get on Amazon Fire and things you can't get on the Google boxes but Roku has it all.It is pretty far from perfect, though. There are tons of ""channels"" (apps, really; one per streaming provider) and no standardization between them. They look different, they operate different, they have different requirements. Some are free, some are subscription, some are pay-per-view, some require you have active cable service and some offer different options and the only way to see which is which is to load them up and try them one by one. It's a hassle!So that's why I don't give 5 stars: the presentation is not great. Lots of room for standardization and improvement. Still, though, when my parents wanted to cut their cable, I got them a Roku. I took the time to sign them up to the good channels and get things organized and they still have to call me sometimes for some ""how do I"" questions but I think they're getting more enjoyment out of the Roku than they would have out of the other streaming box options. My one disclaimer is that I have never tried Apple streaming products, but I never will -- I hate the Apple ecosystem, I especially hate iTunes and I refuse to get drawn into that swamp. Even if the Apple box is superior in every way, I would still not recommend it because I wouldn't wish the Apple ecosystem on anyone. (""It's a trap!"")Roku is still the best game in town in terms of giving you lots to watch and not restricting how you want it.If you're cutting cable, get a Roku and get an HD antenna and you're on your way. (I recommend Netflix as the #1 streaming app by far. Hulu Plus can be worthwhile if you watch a lot of current TV shows. Use Amazon as a fallback -- if I can't find what I want streaming, I will rent or buy digitally from Amazon. These 3 sources account for like 99% of my watching.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VVNDGCXZI6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGGDVOO#wasThisHelpful","R1VVNDGCXZI6H","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(edit: Just wanted to say the more I use these, the more I stand by the 5-star rating. I think a lot of people simply have wrong ideas about what noise canceling does and have no experience with the concept. It does not eliminate all noise -- but it's very good at cutting out steady background noises like office vents and plane sounds. These are my daily use earbuds now at the office and they worked great when I went on vacation and had a 5+ hour flight each way.)I've never had actual noise canceling earbuds before -- most are just ""noise isolating"" which is to say they're kinda like earplugs that physically block out sound but these do that and additionally you get the electronic noise canceling.As someone else said, the real test is to put them in and then just turn on the power and see what difference you notice. Sitting in my old office building with the noisy ventilation system, it completely removes the noise of the vents. With some low volume music going I can't hear my coworkers talking or even understand what they're saying when they come up to me. (Make sure you use the correct size earpiece. It comes with 3 sizes. Too small and you won't get a seal and you'll hear too much noise. Too big and they won't be comfortable.)I compared them to my coworker's $300 Bose over-ear noise canceling headphones and these earbuds are not as good, but they're in the same neighborhood and for the price I think they're quite competitive.Caveats:* No power, no sound. The page right now says batteries are not included and not required but mine came with 1 battery and doesn't work without it.* The cable between the earbuds and the clip is too short. Or I'm too tall, I guess. It's fine when sitting but it's too short to clip to anything but a shirt pocket when standing up.Anyway, ""no power no sound"" is typical for noise canceling headphones and the cable length doesn't seem like enough to dock a star for. I don't honestly know why so many people hate these. I'm enjoying them right now in my office with a little Amazon Prime music going at low volume and can barely hear myself type and all of the usual office sounds are gone entirely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRWAL92Y8G8FP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C19125A#wasThisHelpful","RRWAL92Y8G8FP","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was staying at a hotel recently and the cloth showercurtain got me thinking: surely this is easier than with the ""mold resistant"" plastic type curtains I'd always used. Those are too stiff to take down and wash and you have to keep them clean or they will, in fact, get moldy. I thought a cloth shower curtain that can be washed made a lot of sense.So far so good!

I ordered some new shower hooks (Maytex Mills Metal Double Glide Shower Ring, Oil Rubbed Bronze, 12 Count) to go with them that will make it easier to put the curtain on and off and now it's in use! No problems so far. Pretty much what you'd expect. The ""magnetic weights"" are really just a couple of button magnets on the bottom but I didn't have any problem with the curtain flying around. Stitching all looks good. I see other reviewers are upset that the waffle pattern is not waffly enough but it looks fine to me.I'll update if mold becomes a problem but I expect putting it through the wash periodically will suffice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EP02QZ46GK0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HVGLZ2#wasThisHelpful","R3EP02QZ46GK0F","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those things you didn't know you needed til you had one: tongs with a built in light.Nicely executed design, too. There's a ""gravity lock"", I guess you'd call it, so that when then tongs are pointed down (as if you were grabbing something), they are unlocked and will swing wide open. Point the tongs up (or slide the little metal bit back with your finger) and they will lock closed for storage.Dishwasher safe. Straightforward.

"This is what I'd call a decent first step towards having an actual ""personal assistant"". It's nice to wake up in the morning and ask ""Alexa, what's the weather?"" so I know what to expect, without having to punch up my weather app on my phone.It's nice to be reading a book, see a word I'm unsure of and say ""Alexa, define ____"".Or to say, ""Alexa, play Shovels and Rope"" when I'm in the mood to listen to some Shovels and Rope! Or I can just say, ""Alexa, play music"" and it will pick a random playlist from Prime music based on the music I like. Then I can say ""Alexa, what song is this"" and ""Alexa, buy this song/album"" if I hear something new that I like.With a Wemo wall plug I actually have a heater plugged in and I can say ""Alexa, turn on/off the heater."" I did a heater but you could also imagine using it to turn lights on and off. Wemo plugs aren't cheap right now but you can see which direction the technology is going.The amount of stuff the Echo understands out of the box is fairly impressive. You don't really need to look at a list of commands (although that may help you understand what all it can do) -- just ask it things and you may be surprised.The limitation in this device is mainly that it's just 1 device for just 1 room and, of course, there's no display. In the future I'd like to see a way to tie in a host of cheap microphone+speaker combos that communicate to a central unit so we can easily have ""Alexa"" in every room without having to purchase numerous discrete ""Amazon Echo"" boxes. Still, I think this was something of a test run by Amazon, as evidenced by the limited release and the fact that they wouldn't let us review it for a long time.

"These are fantastic. I've had quite a lot of Mountain House freeze dried food as well as AlpineAire brand and both are great. Mountain House offers these big cans that are suitable for group outings, trailer/RV camping and long term food storage but for backpacking be sure to look for the individual pouches that are also available. The cans are not meant for backpacking and while you could open the can and parcel things out in ziplock bags before the trip, you'd keep your food fresher and safer by just buying the individual serving packets. (Conversely, the individual bags have a shelf-life of around 5 years, versus 25 years for the cans, so for long term storage the cans are the way to go.)So anyway, freeze dried apples. You don't rehydrate these. Just eat them straight out of the can. They're light, crispy and delicious. Just for kicks I tried rehydrating some but found they came out a bit too leathery. It would probably work as a cereal/outmeal mixer if you broke them up before rehyradting them so you end up with small pieces of apple (which, perhaps not coincidentally, is exactly what you get in those bags of Quaker instant cinnamon and apple oatmeal) but as an out-of-the-can snack that doesn't require any preparation this is one of the best choices.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DV4B2YI5NWHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P4CIHFE#wasThisHelpful","R2DV4B2YI5NWHP","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It turned colder after I put the seeds down (though not below freezing), and this probably contributed to the low and slow rate of germination, but 3 weeks later it does seem to be doing well enough and is growing in an area that is normally bare. Regular seed I put down a few years ago didn't take -- the area gets some sun but it's under trees most of the day and tends to be mostly dirt and moss.I actually bought another bag and put that down about a week ago, hoping this will fill in quicker since the weather has been warmer. Some of that is already sprouting. I still feel like the germination rate is low (there are plenty of highly visible blue seeds still laying there) but I'll call it a win if I actually end up with grass in this area.

"If you haven't heard a harp being used outside of classical music, you should really give this EP a shot. Abigail Palmer has a great vocal range to accompany the harp playing in a variety of styles and, well, it's magical. The recording quality is superb -- this is clearly a studio recording. A lot of small groups release CDs that are simply recorded from a live show. I know it's a lot cheaper, but you can't beat studio recording quality and that's what you're buying here.I saw them play live and picked up an advance copy of the EP there. You should definitely catch them live if possible because if you've never gotten to watch a harp being played up close, you're missing out, but the EP delivers a depth, balance and clarity that's hard to get at a live show and you would not be amiss to start off your Abigail Palmer Group fandom with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EU2VQNH9VH3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5XM576#wasThisHelpful","R3EU2VQNH9VH3Q","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I drilled a small hole to make sure I wouldn't hit a stud and to guide the anchor in, then drilled in the SnapSkru anchor and that worked great.

"This is a very well thought out humidifier. The only caution I have with it is the noise. I'm not sure how to quantify the noise level other than it competes with my gaming desktop computer when it's on high. By far the most disturbing thing is that if you put it on auto-fan, it may shift between high, low and off and I personally found it hard to sleep with in my room like that. I'd say go ahead and get this humidifier but just set the fan to ""low"" full time. (Really, even ""high"" full time is fine. It's a bit loud but you get used to it. It's the auto-setting switching between loud and not-loud that makes it hard to sleep through. You're just about to nod off to a quiet wrrrrrrrr and then suddenly it's WRRRRRRR...)All that said, I'm gonna go ahead and give it 5 stars. I have a lot of experience with humidifiers and this is easily my favorite.So humidifiers come in 3 types: ""spritzers"", ""boilers"" and ""evaporators"". I dunno if that's the proper terms, that's just what I call em. Spritzers will spritz a fine mist of water into the air periodically. This evaporates and adds humidity to your house that way. The problem with these is that tap water has minerals in it and these minerals will be left behind after the water evaporates. That's the ""dust"" everyone talks about these things leaving behind. The dust are mineral deposits. You can avoid this by using distilled (not ""spring"" or ""filtered"" -- distilled) water but that's a lot more expensive than just using tap water. Spritzers are my least favorite kind for this reason.Boilers are my previous favorite type. They literally boil water in a chamber inside the unit and waft out steam. The boiling means that you get pure water steam coming out of the unit -- no minerals get scattered around your house. The downside is that the minerals get left behind in the boiling chamber. There are mineral absorption pads but they only do so much. In the end you have to clean the thing of mineral deposits periodically and that's a pain. Some of these units are well designed to make cleaning fairly easy but it's still pretty far from maintenance free. They are also not the best idea for toddlers since they will have boiling water inside the unit and be releasing hot steam out of the top.And then there's what this unit is: evaporative. Inside the unit is basically a big wick that absorbs the water you put into the unit. A fan blows over this and the water evaporates into the air, leaving any mineral deposits behind in the wick. Replace the wick periodically and Bob's your uncle. All things considered I feel like this is the best type of humidifier. The only downside is that they tend to be the loudest. Spritzers are silent most of the time. Boilers make a gentle boiling sound and usually just have a tiny fan to waft out the steam. Evaporators have to move more air so they need more of a fan and in a small unit like this, it's a noticeable noise.The design itself of this unit is well done overall though. The fan is well protected from little fingers. The water in the unit will be room temperature so the worst that can happen is a water spill. The water bottle is easy to fill and I love that a light comes on when the water is low to let you know it needs more. The humidistat on this unit is the best I've seen, actually letting you set a humidity level by percentage (must units just have a largely meaningless dial -- you can turn the dial but there's no indication what you're setting it to). You can also lock the buttons to keep busy fingers from easily changing the settings.Really there's nothing particularly ""childish"" about this humidifier other than it's designed to be toddler-resistant.Note that if you're humidifying a house (and not just a closed room) you'll want to buy more than one of these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKP0BPYJC4GJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6U5E#wasThisHelpful","RKP0BPYJC4GJC","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the quietest air purifier I've ever not-heard. On the lowest setting it still moves a good volume of air but having it in my kitchen leaves it as completely inaudible against other background noises. It has some basic timer functions but since it's so quiet I just leave it running on the lowest setting full time. The highest setting, of course, is quite audible (though not what I'd call ""loud"") and blows quite a lot of air through. I like that in addition to filtering dust, it has a odor absorbing filter. Filters are easy to change -- no tools required.The big thing in favor of this unit is the solid construction. I've had other air purifiers in the past and they tend to vibrate, as in the unit itself vibrates and makes noise regardless of what surface you put it on, I guess because they just don't usually make them to tight specs. This unit seems solid though. Nothing vibrates. Just a smooth air flow. I put it on a metal rack and it's still silent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBYUJRZ6SECR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFEY45A#wasThisHelpful","RPBYUJRZ6SECR","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this as an automatic backup device. I put lots of music, videos and pictures on my phone and am constantly running out of storage space. I have a hard time deciding what to delete. This seems to solve the dilemma: I delete all of my photos and videos after uploading them to the device, because then I can access them easily on the computer OR the phone later, as long as I have the hard drive with me.Getting it up and running using Android and Windows was simple enough. Basically you connect directly to the device (which shows up as a wifi hub) and then you can configure it -- set security, rename it, and configure the device to connect to the internet -- and off you go. It then showed up on my network so that my computer could see it as well, as if it was a shared Windows box (you can disable this part if you are on a public network -- there's a button for that when you go to connect it).The whole process is ""less than intuitive"" but frankly about as easy as you're likely to get, considering what you need to do. The fact that the device can connect to the internet is a nice touch as it means you can connect to the device and still browse the internet while connected (I've seen other devices that don't do this -- when you are connected to it, you don't have internet access). So that's a nice touch.The device itself is lightweight, portable, can be charged through USB and all of your data transfers are done via wifi. It's important that it acts as a wifi hub as this means you don't need some 3rd party wifi (like the one in your hotel room) to communicate with it. You connect directly.All in all I'm pretty happy with it. I'm honestly not sure how hard it is to move individual files around.

"You might have come here to read reviews and ask, ""What should I get? A Nexus Player from Google or the Amazon Fire TV?""The very fact that you are here, on Amazon, suggests the answer is probably ""Amazon Fire TV"".The two devices are essentially identical with the notable exception that the Fire TV does not give you access to the Google Play store and the Nexus does not give you access to the Amazon store or Prime functions. For me, that's a bit of a deal breaker, seeing how literally 100% of my music and movies are already on Amazon. Whatever device I get must support Amazon apps and if you make me choose between Google and Amazon, I'm going to go with Amazon every time.I don't have a Roku so I'm not sure how that compares, but a brief internet search says that might still be the best option, as apparently it supports Amazon content AND Google Play content (plus lots of other stuff). The Nexus and Fire are still very limited in their channel selection in addition to being mutually exclusive.So I still rate this device highly because it is quite functional and works well if what you want is Google Play, Youtube, Netflix and a couple other things but I would still put it under the Amazon Fire for actual Amazon customers and probably put both of them under the Roku in terms of supported content.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q533RVT43JUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8U5A7W#wasThisHelpful","R1Q533RVT43JUH","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: you can search YouTube for most (all?) of these songs and find them, as played directly from the book. I found this helpful later on as the songs got more complex and, without a teacher, I wasn't sure I was doing them correctly. Kind of eliminates the need to get a book with a CD. If anything, the YouTube videos are better than a CD because you can also look at the fingering the player is using. Try searching for [song name] + ""Palmer-Hughes"".Anyway, I'm starting accordion from ground zero (no music knowledge what-so-ever) and have been enjoying this book greatly. I can feel the progress from day to day as each song goes from ""well clearly that's impossible"" to ""I almost got the whole thing perfect that time"". The book is pretty well aimed at, oh, 10 year olds, but as that's roughly my knowledge level when it comes to music, it's fitting enough. Okay, so I found it a little annoying to have to grind through a song that's only slightly different from ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" but each song is making you learn different combinations of beats and finger movements that does help you master the basics before moving on and some of the songs are quite fun.You should also look at the ""1A"" and ""1B"" books. The ""A & B"" books are roughly the same thing, expanded just slightly. There are some songs in 1A and 1B that do not appear in 1 and vice versa so you could conceivably buy 1A, 1B and 1 and get use out of all of them. That's what I did, just to decide which was the better way and I kind of like having all 3. It's nice when you want a little more variety on techniques you already know but don't feel ready to move forward yet.Book 1 only requires a 12 bass button piano accordion but there will be a few extra things you can do if you have a full accordion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8ANE8TONTTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0739012916#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8ANE8TONTTW","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I did a fair amount of research trying to find an accordion I could buy and learn accordion with as an absolute beginner. I settled on this one partially because it fit my criteria and partially because it was on sale (you win again this time, Amazon).I was too chicken to try ebay because as a non-accordion player who doesn't know any accordion players, I was worried that something could be wrong and I wouldn't even know. And I'm a little dubious about the ability of local music shops to have anyone on staff who knows anything about them. So I wanted to buy new and hopefully limit those risks.I wanted something I could grow into, so more than the 12 bass button starter model, but not something that was going to be as heavy or intimidating to learn on as a full 120 bass button model. (I would have settled for 30-60, so this 48-button one being on sale settled that part of the debate.)I wanted a good brand. I was concerned when I read that a lot of Hohner models, including this one, are made in China (the really expensive ones are made in Germany). Further looking eased my worries though. As I read it, Hohner shipped an entire factory to China, so you are getting a product built with German engineering and German specifications, overseen by Germans, but cheaper cost of production and cheaper superficial materials -- the keys of this model are made from plastic whereas some of the German models are made with wooden keys. Since this doesn't impact the sound at all, it's purely aesthetics (and cost). The actual mechanisms for generating sound are, as I understand it, the same quality and materials in both the Chinese made ones and the German made ones. I would be a little more dubious of the even cheaper models that don't quite say ""Hohner"" on them (""Hohnica""?) or have a model number printed on them but I think you're pretty safe with the ones that actually have the Hohner name and model printed on the accordion.So my internet research suggests, anyway.Note that this model is still limited. You can't change the (what's the word?) octave of the keyboard. Some more expensive models have buttons for that. This one has 2 buttons for 2 voices (violin and clarinet) and that is the end of the fancy features. Still, I felt it was a good starting point to see if I could learn to play and if I'd enjoy it and having started with practice I can say I think I'm happy I didn't try to learn on a full one. Intimidation factor aside, accordions are fairly heavy so you might appreciate not trying to learn while also having a 22 pound bellows strapped to your chest.As the other review suggests, compare your prices. The price I paid was way less than other retailers were offering, but immediately after I bought, the price went up. It's still slightly less than I saw other retailers offering but Amazon changes prices regularly so make sure you do some comparison shopping.I would also be dubious of 3rd party sellers. If it says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" then you're in good shape. If there's a problem, the usual Amazon return policy should be in effect -- just save your box and materials and it should be super easy to send back if you need to. If it's sold by a 3rd party, you will be subject to their rules, which are usually not as generous.That said, mine arrived in perfect condition and so far so good on trying to learn to play the accordion!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R192RCP8QE1LV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0H4COY#wasThisHelpful","R192RCP8QE1LV5","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in a townhome and while they don't technically disallow car washing in the parking lot, I can't reach my car with a hose from my house so I usually just resort to those insert-quarter-do-it-yourself washes. I decided to bring this along as a finisher. The quarter operated washes are okay for removing the major dirt but it doesn't do a very good job, either. This, I find, fills the gap. After washing the major dirt off with the power wash, I went back home and used this stuff to go over the car again. This took it from the usual ""meh"" level of clean I get from the powerwash to a real shine.I can't imagine using it to wash my car from a dirty state -- if nothing else you'd need a lot of microfiber towels -- but as a finisher or a touch-up, it's great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGWRXTMBX6BNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSAV5LU#wasThisHelpful","RGWRXTMBX6BNO","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never would have thought that putting a grilling element in a microwave was a thing that makes sense, but it actually does work and lets you cook some things you would have otherwise never tried in a microwave. I followed the directions for frozen hamburger patties and was surprised it actually turned out well. I did frozen hot dogs the same way. And tater tots. And a steak (I'm not saying this is the greatest way to cook a steak but I had to try it. Not bad, actually. You're basically broiling it.) I dunno what the actual cost savings is here but previously if I wanted to make tater tots I had to heat the oven, which I always thought seemed rather inefficient. I had thought about one of those countertop toaster ovens but I think this covers most of what I would have used that for. The directions suggest you grill most things in ""combo"" mode, which uses 30% microwave power in addition to the grill, so the burger went from frozen solid to a nice medium-well (with grilled browning) in like 5 minutes.I will say it's a bit more dangerous, if you're using the grill. Better teach the kids to treat it more like a regular oven. Don't touch the hot plate without oven mitts and since the hot plate is set close to the top of the microwave, you need to take it out to flip things over and then put it back in. The hot plate is not dishwasher safe but it's easy to clean.Otherwise it's just a normal microwave with all the usual features. Nice modern look to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCNB7YGLWKCV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQFSSWS#wasThisHelpful","RCNB7YGLWKCV5","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The biggest advantage to this stuff is just that you can use it while still in the shower. The disadvantage is I feel like it's harder to get right...you apply it, then you rinse, then you dry off.... but how much should you rinse and how much are you taking off with the towel?

"So I think the bluetooth part is gimmicky, but you can also just totally ignore that feature if you want. You don't have to connect to your toothbrush to use it. That said, if you've shopped other electric brushes, you've probably seen some that come with a small, separate display that you can stick on your bathroom wall, which shows you brush times and so forth. The bluetooth feature on this brush just turns your phone into that display. Which is nice. If you want a display.I used the display for a while but then just stopped. The toothbrush itself gives you all the feedback you need -- you're meant to brush your teeth in quarters (top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left), 30 seconds each, and it will buzz and flash green every 30 seconds to let you know you can switch areas, then buzzes twice after 2 minutes to let you know you've hit the suggested 2 minute mark for brushing your teeth. It also flashes red if you're pressing too hard. The bluetooth app will tell you this stuff too and may be useful to people who are new to the electric toothbrush concept.All that out of the way, the brush itself is great. This is a top tier electric brush. If you've never used one before, it can take some getting used to but it's a vast improvement over traditional brushing. Electric brushes work the gums and crevices much better than regular brushing. If you're familiar with brushes and are just shopping for a new one, I think this will be a good one. My previous brush was an Oral-B as well, purchased about 3 years ago and was still going strong. After years of use it didn't look quite as pretty or hold a charge quite as long but it was durable. Despite being dropped multiple times, it never gave me any problems at all. I'm hoping this model will prove to be as good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E34G29MIH3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8ODI5I#wasThisHelpful","R2E34G29MIH3R","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here's what I consider the holy grail of gaming headsets:* Surround sound* Cloth headrest and earmuffs (not that thin weird material some companies like that looks great and shreds after 2 months)* Solid construction* Volume control as part of the headset* Good sound quality* Good mic quality* DOES NOT REST ON MY EARS. Maybe I have big ears but a lot of headsets rest directly on my ears and it's uncomfortable after a while.This is apparently impossible to find. If you know of any, let me know (but then, you probably wouldn't be shopping for these). I've tried a number of gaming headsets and they all fail pretty much 2 or more of the above. This headset only fails the top one: it's straight stereo. Granted things like the Logitech G35 aren't true surround sound in that they use software to simulate it (it's technical) but I think it's a good improvement over stereo. But all of the surround sound headphones I've tried, including the G35, were of inexcusably bad build quality and just fall apart in one way or another all too soon. I don't know why companies spend so much making a great sounding and feeling headset and then screw it up with thin parts that easily break/disintegrate.So, so far I'm happy with this purchase. The cloth liner should last longer than that Logitech G35 junk. The build is a mix of plastic and metal but the stress points seem solid. Mic quality is good and the mic pickup is very good -- had to turn it down whereas most headsets make me maximize the mic volume. The ear piece is large, encompasses my ears and doesn't press on them -- no discomfort after a couple hours having them on nonstop. Sound quality is perfect to my ear.Just note that it's not surround sound and you need functioning mic/audio jacks on your computer (as this is not a USB headset).I'll update this review if I have any build quality issues but it LOOKS solid enough, in a ""but don't sit on them"" sort of way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U0V780IUNYCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBXQ9K2#wasThisHelpful","R2U0V780IUNYCT","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this because I've had so much success with one of the bigger CyberPower towers, which I use for my gaming rig. But what good is maintaining power to my gaming rig when my cable modem and router go out? So I got this smaller one to handle those items after a different brand of UPS gave up the ghost. With this thing working downstairs and the tower working upstairs, my power went out for about 5 seconds the other day and everything worked great. No loss of internet, no loss of power to the PC.I've gone through a number of battery backup systems over the years and while I understand rechargable batteries wear out over time and must be replaced, my experience with other systems has been that they wear out quicker and sometimes the electronics go, too, rendering the whole thing into junk. CyberPower is the first brand I've tried that I've actually been happy with long term. I've had the tower (CP1500) for just over 5 years and it's still going strong with no battery replacements and still has a good charge.

"So, just up front, these things say you can use them with or without the handles (sold separately). Get the handles. They sell them separately because you may want multiple bands (for more resistance or to hook to their other options, like a door frame hook) but you really need the handles to get started on the basic stuff. The handles add a lot of length, so you can actually do the exercises listed on the package, and the straps are pretty uncomfortable to use alone. You only need 1 set of handles for multiple bands.All that said, this is a good basic workout option if you want something simple for home/travel that's inexpensive and doesn't take up much space.

"For veteran Lego builders, I think you'll find the main thing wrong here is that while Lego kits are all about the build, this kit is almost like a puzzle -- you have to find the right pieces! We timed one search and it took us 7 minutes to find the right piece. This happens many times so it adds up. We sped it up a bit by having one of us search while the other builds. Basically it's just not well organized and it's frequently hard to tell the difference between the dark green and the grey blocks that the instructions call for. Reading the line marks between blocks with dark colors is difficult too.That said, once you've completed it it's pretty amazing. It's big, it's fun and it has lots of clever moving parts. There's nice details like the seats, the computer screen and other pipe and tank details. Plus you get lots of cool characters with backpacks and weapons, all interchangeable. It really came together nice in the end.My suggestion is that if you're experienced with Lego kits, you'll find this Mega Bloks kit a lot more time consuming to get through but the end product is pretty fantastic. It's still good for kids, so long as they don't run out of patience with the block search.I hesitate to rate it 5 stars because the build process was so much more tedious than Lego kits but we thought the quality was good and the end product was great. Maybe you LIKE searching for parts? It is a bit like a 1300 piece guided puzzle, I guess!

"I mostly compared this to the X-mini KAI2 Bluetooth Portable Capsule Speaker XAM18-GM, Gun Metal.* Both are small enough to fit into your pocket (this one -- the iSound -- fits easier, though, since it's flatter).* The iSound is a good bit cheaper* The iSound is noticeably louder* The KAI2 sounds a little 'clearer' to my ear. Less of what I would generally call ""small speaker distortion"". I think all small, portable speakers like this have a bit of distortion to their sound and while the iSound and KAI2 are really close, the KAI2 does sound a little better.* The KAI2 has an audio-out function that lets you hook it up to other speakers* The KAI2 has a microphone so you can use it as a speakerphone* Both feature device controls for pause/play and next/previous functions.So, as I see it, the KAI2 is generally better and more feature rich but the iSound has more volume and is cheaper and less conspicuous in your pocket (the KAI2 is like having a golf ball in your pocket).I'll leave it up to you to prioritize those items and decide which speaker is right for you.

"In theory I like smoothies but in practice I don't like cleaning my blender. This system replaces your blender and your food processor and makes the concept of smoothies way easier.The big thing is that you are blending it right in your drinking container.

Saves you a little countertop space too.And of course the ""2-in-1"" portion is that you also get a food processor sized container to bend things in. It uses the same motor to drive it.If you're looking for a blender to make some morning smoothies for the road, this is ideal.

"You'd think ""a speaker is a speaker"" (well, I'd think that) but I guess there's a lot to be said for the acoustics of the speaker body. Or something. Actually I have no explanation for why this sounds as good as it does. It might be witchcraft. I've tried other small speakers and been pretty happy but this one is a couple steps above the rest. Let me count the ways:* Great sound. As is typical for small speakers don't expect a lot of bass but the mids and highs are astounding. The bass is good compared to similar size devices but if you want booms you're just going to have to go big.* Super clever design:** It compresses to fit into your pocket. It's like an accordion.** There's a stereo jack wound into the bottom of the speaker.** There's a rubber lid that protects the top of the device that turns into a rubber base when you're using it.** There are media controls (previous, pause/play, next) on the device for use through bluetooth.I honestly wonder if the people rating it poorly realized you need to take the rubber top off. I mean the instructions show this but maybe they didn't read the instructions? I'm just guessing.The ""buddy speaker"" concept is worth a mention too. Basically this thing has an audio OUT jack, which is an unusual feature. It lets you hook this up to another speaker -- any speaker. I hooked it up to my larger bluetooth speaker and basically had a tweeter and a woofer combo. If I had two of these KAI2 speakers I could hook them together to get double the sound but, again, it's standard audio-out so it will go to any device. (One obvious use might be that you have a really nice non-bluetooth home stereo system. Welp, connect to your Kai2 with bluetooth then use this ""buddy speaker"" to connect the Kai2 to your real speaker system and off you go. Wander around your house using your home stereo as if it was bluetooth via this Kai2 device.)All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKHEPENDTGDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZL86YK#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKHEPENDTGDR","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are nice gaming stereo headphones that really boost the booms and explosions. They sound great when playing the usual FPS/RTS games I play. The built-in equalizer is subtle but the on-ear volume control is nice.

The highs and mids, even on the setting that's meant to emphasize them more, are dull and muted. It sounds ""okay"". I can still watch Netflix shows with them, but it's clearly not as good at full range audio as my previous headsets have been.Still, for gaming they're great and the construction is nice too. I like the cloth lining to the earmuffs and that the earstrap has metal running through it, so hopefully it will prove to be sturdy. If you JUST want a headset for gaming, this will do it for you.

No bulky case, just a monitor that has everything in it.* You don't mind that it has to always be plugged in (this is a desktop, not a laptop or tablet).* You want Dell warranty and Dell support.* You want something very, very basic for like Facebook, maybe Facebook games, simple web pages -- news, weather -- maybe an MP3 player and that's it.If that's you then okay, maybe this IS what you're looking for. Simple, basic, compact, not too fast and not too expensive.But this product makes me grumpy. Read on and I'll tell you why.It's compact, and has a lot of the problems that compact machines come with, namely lack of power. But usually compact machines lack power because they are meant to be portable and run off of a battery -- power is your tradeoff. This machine, however, is a desktop. It needs to be plugged in, which limits its portability anyway, which would be fine IF IT HAD POWER, but it doesn't. It's neither portable nor powerful!The Celeron processor is meant for notebooks. The 2.16 Ghz clock speed with 2 cores and 2 threads is anemic even by laptop standards. The 5400 RPM drive is painfully slow and is a real bottleneck (it particularly dragged out the update process, which took ages).What really grinds my gears, though, is that the machine is barely powerful enough to handle Netflix. Running it on Chrome causes the video to desync after a while and the audio will start to turn to static. I've updated the drivers from the Dell site (except for the BIOS, whose update consistently fails -- haven't figured out that one yet) and Netflix won't work under Chrome. It's like it can't keep up. It does work under Internet Explorer -- presumably IE is doing something just efficiently enough to get it over the hump -- but the bottom line is that I should at least be able to open up my favorite web browser and use all aspects of the web -- including compressed, streaming HD video -- straight out of the box on a machine that has no batteries and must be plugged into the wall to operate for this kind of price tag.I feel like this machine is a bad idea coming out of marketing, or people who didn't understand that these days, even the web needs a fair amount of processing power to handle compressed video streams. The overall sluggishness when doing literally anything in Windows just adds to the pain. Frankly, if you're looking for a desktop machine which must be plugged in, like this one, you could spend $500 on NewEgg, build your own machine using one of their ""Super Combos"" and end up with something that will blow this thing out of the water.I really liked what I assumed was the concept -- the minimalist desktop computer with everything built into a touchscreen monitor -- but they should have put in a better processor (if there's enough wiggle room in that price tag to add in a small SSD for the operating system, that would go a long way to alleviating the pain too).Oh, also, it does not have any USB 3.0 ports and there is no video out (possibly owing to the overall lack of power in this machine) or built in DVD drive. Not problems in themselves (though the lack of any video out was disappointing) but it makes me grumpy on top of the other issues.There's just not enough power in this box to make this machine feel painless.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4J5FC1SQY9JG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KE80STG#wasThisHelpful","R4J5FC1SQY9JG","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great except for the care needed to wash them. After reading the other reviews here, I made sure to follow the directions, namely laying them flat to dry rather than tumble drying. This still causes some wrinkling and they have to be ironed out (particularly the edges). I didn't notice any shrinking or fading but still, this is a hassle.The ribbing design looks and feels great but I think that's the main culprit behind why they're so hard to wash -- that and they're 100% cotton. Which normally I am in favor of but while thin cotton (such as a t-shirt) tumbles well and hangs well without needing an iron, my experience has been that thick cotton will need an iron and this is no exception.So I do like these better than the usual vinyl or bamboo placemats, be prepared to put time into keeping them maintained.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH0T5J93MRZ97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026IBERM#wasThisHelpful","RH0T5J93MRZ97","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice coffee press. There's another 34oz Fancois et Mimi stainless steel press and the only real difference is that this one is shiny while the other one is ""brushed"", giving it more of a flat metal look. Both are quite attractive and do the job well.The parts are basically the standard french press gear: inside is a metal mesh on a rod that you press down after the brewing process. The mesh can be unscrewed and thrown into the dishwasher. The only really tricky thing is that the knob on top also unscrews, so you need to unscrew the mesh by twisting the rod, not the knob.The double wall is nice for keeping your coffee hotter while it brews (versus the standard single-wall glass presses) and it's nice to have a metal press so I don't worry about breaking it.These french presses are perfect for the office where you want your own custom coffee brew without having to use the community coffee maker.(I also use mine to brew loose leaf tea. Same principle as brewing coffee and I think it's a little less hassle than the ""tea balls"" other people use.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OZX6NFEBXQ2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSRSZC0#wasThisHelpful","R3OZX6NFEBXQ2M","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this and the Clarisonic Aria. Which is better? Kind of a tossup.The Clarisonic does a very quick back-and-forth vibration (like your electric toothbruth probably is). It feels more vigorous and is easier to control but I find it hard to use on my nose because the vibration is pretty intense. The brush head is larger so it's a bit easier to make sure you're getting your whole face.The Phillips does a far gentler vibration. Most of the motion is a straight circular motion of the brush head. Is this better? Couldn't tell you at this point. It certainly feels nicer (especially on the nose!) but the question is whether it's doing the job. I believe it is but it's going to be hard to measure.My feeling is that you should try the Clarisonic first and if you just find it's too intense for you, try this Phillips, which has a much easier, gentler feel....but maybe vigor is what you prefer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQAIN0ZHMLJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVGET3C#wasThisHelpful","RQAIN0ZHMLJW","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far so good on this thing. After reading other reviews I'm a little worried about rust... I have a porcelain fire pit that's been outside in all weather for years and still looks great so this one being cast iron makes me nervous. You CAN get high temperature protective coatings for cast iron but so far mine has not shown a spec of rust, so we'll see if that's something I need to try later or not. [update: after being in the rain under the provided cover for many days, there's still no rust. I'm pretty sure it's already got a protective paint on it.]Calling this portable is a bit of a marketing gimmick in my opinion... it's still nearly 40 pounds and has no handles so the fact that you aren't prevented from moving it counts as ""portable"", I guess. It IS more portable than my porcelain firepit so I guess you win THIS time, CobraCo, but yeah, it's not exactly something you'd take camping unless you intend to camp within short distance of your truck.Anyway, assembly was easy, the thing looks and feels sturdy and so far its been a success.

"This is a great bathroom rug. I was mainly worried that being such a thick pile, it would dry slow and either give me wet feet later or worse, mold up. No such problems, though. It dries really fast despite stepping straight onto it out of the shower and leaving it fairly wet. I guess that's modern fiber technology for you. It's machine washable which is nice too.

"I'm a big fan of the Vicks UV 99.999% Germ Free Humidifier but it has one problem: it's a real pain to clean. Boiling water for steam leaves mineral deposits behind (unless you use distilled water, which will cost you) and getting the deposits out of the Vicks is no small task.This boiler seeks to fix that problem by making the whole boiling chamber -- the lower part of the unit -- *dishwasher safe*. You can detach it and throw it right into your dishwasher and the biggest problem is solved.I hesitate to give this humidifier 5 stars (as I gave for the Vicks) mainly for 2 reasons:* No germ-killing UV light. So you'd better take your cleaning more seriously. (I mean, it does boil the water though...)* The humidistat is not very useful.I'll explain that last point more. A humidistat is just like a thermostat but for humidity instead of temperature. Set it to 40% humidity and the unit should run until that level is reached. On the Vicks, you can tell where your current humidify level is (and therefore judge where to set the dial) because it goes ""click"" when you pass the current humidity level. The humidistat on this unit makes no noise so you have no idea how to set it.That said, the steam output on this unit is higher than the Vicks. It's a bit noisier -- mainly, I think, because it's boiling more vigorously. You can set it to ""low"" which will cut the boiling a little and make it a little quieter but then you're getting less steam, too.All in all I think I might go with this unit over the Vicks if only for the fact that it's easier to clean. I wish it had a UV light, I wish the water chamber was not so tinted (hard to see the water level), I wish the humidistat provided some feedback.....but man....so much easier to clean.It's a tossup, really. This one or the Vicks!I personally do not advocate the cold (""spritz"") humidifiers. They are quieter but I think they are not as good for you. Look at what's left in the boiling chamber of a hot humidifier and realize that a cold humidifier is spraying that stuff all through the air.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24NI9TFJZ9GWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008XFOVDG#wasThisHelpful","R24NI9TFJZ9GWZ","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, simple caddy that should fit most showers. The picture shows it going to a wall to the right of the spigot but it will work to the right or left (mine is left).The shelves can be arranged any way you like. If you just want one shelf, you can leave off the other two as well as space them how you like.The suction cups at the bottom are probably unnecessary but they do keep the caddy stable.The whole thing is very easy to clean. The shelves can be lifted out and the bottom of each shelf can also come out by itself to be cleaned. Note that the top of the shelf aligns with the top of the shower spigot so if that's too tall for you to reach, the upper shelves probably will be too. I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews but I didn't seem to have any of those problems. For me it hangs level, took like 30 seconds to install and sits solidly against the wall.

"I'm really digging this stainless steel french press over the glass ones I've been using. I don't fear breaking it, plus it just looks nicer. The double wall sides will help keep your coffee from losing as much heat during the brewing, too.The design is pretty standard. The ""press"" part comes apart if you unscrew the rod from it, just like other presses, for easy cleaning. The only thing I don't like, really, is that the knob on the top also unscrews, which makes it a bit tricky to unscrew the rod from the press for cleaning. Not a big deal, just be aware that the press DOES disassemble for cleaning, but you may have to grip the rod to twist it apart without the top knob coming off.There's another 34 oz Francois et Mimi coffee press and the main difference between them is if you want brushed (this) or polished (the other one).

"I was surprised to see all 5-star ratings. Did I get a bad one? The big problem I ran into was that the screw-hole that's going to let the ball mount screw onto the tripod was not big enough -- the screw doesn't fit!I also felt that this is what you get when you can't use someone else's patented solutions but still want to sell a similar product. I thought the legs of his tripod were a bit too stiff and hard to manipulate versus those of the very similar Joby GorillaPod (although that should allow this one to hold a heavier camera). The Joby GorillaPod also has a simple switch to lock and unlock the tripod's screw mount while this mount uses a big plastic screw that takes a few twists to lock and unlock the mount point.The phone holder itself seems fine and is similar to the ""Joby GripTight Smartphone Mount"" and there's no question that this is cheaper and works well enough but it's not as nice or easy to use as the Joby stuff.I probably would rate it as 3 or 4 stars except for that problem with the screw hole. Judging from other reviews it sounds like I'm the only one who encountered that issue so maybe it was just bad luck. Even ignoring that, though, I'd say pay a little extra and stick with Joby.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HM0C6NYLQN36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I58VB3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2HM0C6NYLQN36","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wasn't expecting anything from an electric brush this cheap, but other than being noisy and using regular batteries, it seems just as good as my Braun rechargeable that cost literally 10x more.The battery life is good too. I thought that would be an easy win for the rechargeables -- that this one made me go through batteries a lot -- but I've used it for 2-3 minutes 2-3 times a day for 3 weeks and I'm still on the battery that it came with.Mechanically it seems about the same as the Braun. Replaceable head, back-and-forth rotation. My Braun has a couple of nice touches (like a battery power display and an indication of how long you've been brushing and if you're pressing too hard) but for the basic act of brushing your teeth, it's hard to say which is better.I still think if you're looking for a main toothbrush you might come out better in the long run with a rechargeable but if you just want something effective to throw in your suitcase, this is definitely a good choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QK4HE0N40P9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J42G2UW#wasThisHelpful","R1QK4HE0N40P9C","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The one big downside to these headphones: they are stereo only. A lot of gaming speakers offer ""software simulated surround sound"" -- basically they register as 5.1 or 7.1 speakers and sounds meant to come ""from behind"" get tweaked a little bit to sound like they should if they were coming through your ear instead of beside your ear. While not as good as real 7.1, I do think it's a good addition for gaming headsets to have......and this doesn't have that.So it's just stereo.Still, it's hard to find fault with that when it does everything else so well. The stereo sound is flawless, the mic works great and best of all, the construction is solid.And that is a big plus.I've gone through a number of ""gaming headsets"" including high end Logitech and Creative Labs headsets that cost more than this and I dunno why they all do this but for whatever reason they love to use really awful quality materials. My last Creative headsets had the thin plastic break one day just putting them on my head. The Logitech earpads easily shred and they also use very flimsy plastic at important connection points. I guess they want them to break so that you will buy new ones occasionally? I dunno, but I'm tired of it and THESE headphones don't have that problem. They are solidly built with metal components that seem like they will last and have been durable so far. They're also just as comfortable as my Logitechs and the padding goes over my ears for a bit of sound isolation from the room.Note that these headsets are not USB so you'll need an actual sound source to plug them into -- I just use my motherboard's built in connections and it works fine there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNIP7L89YZVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJNQG98#wasThisHelpful","R3RNIP7L89YZVE","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the bigger entries in the Ion line. I have 3 different ones (from the pocket sized to this) and they're all fantastic bluetooth speakers. The sound on this is great with great bass and a good battery life. You can also just leave it plugged in to play if you want.The light on the top is SUPER BRIGHT. You can turn it off if you like. Frankly I prefer to put the thing above eye level because it really is too bright to want to look into it but the good news is you don't need a dark room to get the full effect of the light show -- it really is that bright. The one thing that makes me frown, in fact, is that it doesn't come with a mounting bracket, like for a standard 1 3/8th inch speaker stand. I think it's big enough to warrant it. I bought a bracket separately and hope it will screw into the case okay (Magic 8-Ball says ""ask again later"").The handle (luggage-style that lets you wheel it around) feels flimsy but hasn't caused me any problems so far. It has two good grip points on the side but it IS pretty heavy so the handle and wheels get some use.If you want a good, portable bluetooth speaker with the ability to play away from a power source, this is a good way to go.

"I love this thing! It's just like Ion's other speakers only small enough that you could put it in your pocket (in a very ""oh you ARE happy to see me"" sort of way).The sound is not bad. I mean it's a tiny speaker so don't expect it to knock your socks off but the bass and range is surprisingly good and will be a huge improvement over any phone or tablet speaker you may have. The light show is a bit silly but it's bright and does actually pulse to the beat if you turn it up enough that it can catch on (at low volumes it can't seem to find the beat and just sort of does random switches). You can turn the light off if you prefer.It recharges via USB and connects to your device via bluetooth. No problem with pairing and the bluetooth range is about ""the usual"" -- like 50 feet or so and it works fine.Personally I think this sounds better than a lot of slightly larger bluetooth speakers I've heard.

"If you want to try gaming on a Fire, you might as well pick up one of these. And so far I'm kinda surprised -- I wasn't expecting much from Fire TV games since they are, as far as I can tell, Android games, but with the controller they're not much different than X-Box games, at least in terms of how you play. The controller itself is basically identical to an X-Box controller. Not sure how they get away with that, really, but it's what you'd expect -- the two sticks let you do things like first person shooters where one stick aims/turns and the other moves you. Two triggers, two above-trigger buttons, 4 buttons (even labeled the same as the X-Box controller), etc.You can also use it to navigate the regular Fire TV menus and it is a little less clumsy than the default remote. It didn't indicate this anywhere but ""A"" selects and ""B"" goes back on the Fire TV menu, just like in every game (there are also 4 buttons for menu navigation in the middle of the controller but for the most part you can just use the stick and A+B).Pairing was no problem. Follow the directions on the little sheet it comes with (Fire TV instructions were on the back, Fire tablet on the front).Don't get me wrong -- this is no X-Box One. It's not even an X-Box 360. The Fire TV and and Fire Tablet is not, that I can see, much more powerful than your typical phone, but still, it's HD graphics, albeit with lower resolution textures and the gameplay is pretty good considering the games are like $5. I would think this would be an easy choice for people with young kids who would enjoy a little cheap gameplay and probably wouldn't get their money's worth out of $60 full console games anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W20L8VJJOGYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU0ZI8Q#wasThisHelpful","R1W20L8VJJOGYE","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a hard time imagining why you would want this when there are so many rechargeable packs out there. I guess the points that could be in favor of this device are:* It uses a fairly standard CR123A battery. You can buy replacement batteries for about $2 each (in packs of 10).* These batteries are used in a lot of cameras so maybe if you're already using them, this device makes sense.* These types of batteries hold their charge for a long time so you can put them on a shelf and forget about them for years.* It's cheap.* You could have a pack of batteries in your trunk for a lot of ""2 hour power"" charges.But just so we're clear, this is NOT a rechargeable device. It just lets you use a particular type of external battery to charge your phone. And they call it ""2 hour power"" (based on a Samsung Galaxy S2) because one of these batteries is not enough to fully charge a smartphone.I would suggest searching for ""external battery"" in the Cell Phones & Accessories category though, and look at some of these 5000+ mAh / 2.5+ Amp type chargers that will refill your whole phone, are strong enough to charge tablets and are reusable while still being pretty small and lightweight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEHZBXVJEKFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2ZQ6Q2#wasThisHelpful","RLEHZBXVJEKFZ","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 vs Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus vs Adobe Premier Elements: tough call.Well. Out of the three, I would put Adobe Premier Elements as the hands down loser, being the least easy to use, the most clunky and the hardest to find help for online. I think Adobe is more focused on their Pro version, which is to say, the really expensive one you probably don't need.Corel vs Pinnacle is harder to call. I might put Pinnacle on top personally because I find the more advanced features are quicker to get to and the built-in audio editing function of Pinnacle is beast but if you're a beginner looking for something better than the free tools out there while still wanting something that's easy to understand and get started with, Corel might be a better choice.For example, when you want to adjust the brightness and contrast in Corel, you CAN bring up a nice advanced window that lets you tweak the numbers and see a side-by-side preview (which is a nice touch) but there's also a kind of ""easy mode"" that presents you with 8 images of varying brightness/contrast -- presets, basically. Pick the image you like and presto, your video is updated. It does make for very quick, simple to understand editing.All the features you'd expect are there: splitting and merging clips is easy. There are plenty of transitions, text/graphics options and so forth to choose from. Exporting your final project to the format of your choosing is dead simple. The tools are pretty standard and won't take you too long to find and get the hang of.I think if I dock Corel for anything versus Pinnacle, it's that their effort to make things simple can get in the way of some of the more advanced features. Odds are pretty good that this doesn't matter to you and indeed, you may prefer the straightforward simplicity of how Corel presents things. I think personally I'm going back to Pinnacle because I'm a stickler for details and Pinnacle does a good job of serving up details without getting TOO bogged down in complication.Mostly I think it's a flavor choice. In the end, Corel and Pinnacle do pretty much all of the same things. I think Corel aims more for the casual user, someone who wants a simple and easy edit while Pinnacle aims more for the stickler who wants to spend time fidgeting with more details. I find both products to be pretty good and should handle any basic video editing project. Basically if there's something you want to do that Corel VideoStudio can't handle, I doubt you'll find anything under $100 that will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK3G697LMBCSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIL0S8W#wasThisHelpful","RK3G697LMBCSM","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As others have noted, this is not really ""Generation Anything"" night vision, but then, it's also not $3000.It's a pretty sensitive digital camera with a wide aperture, a built-in monitor and a high powered infrared light. If your goal is to see in the dark on the cheap, this is the level of technology you're probably looking for. The infrared beam is invisible to the human eye (though you can see the lens glow red if you look right at it) but the camera can pick it up as a grey scale image. The power of the infrared light is pretty impressive plus the camera itself does a good job of picking up some details in very dim lighting so between the camera and the IR light, you can see perfectly well into underbrush that's pitch black to the naked eye and 50+ meters away.You can also record video and take snapshots if you insert an SD card (not included).Note that it has a mounting rail too, so you can fit something like a rail mounted laser on there if you wanted, which would make it a bit easier to quickly zero in on what you wanted to look at (as the field of view of the device itself it very narrow).It's rubberized to be weather resistant and is a cinch to use once you learn the buttons! It also has a standard tripod mounting bracket so you can get a stable image from zoom.The infrared light can operate in high, low and off and the light sensitivity of the camera itself can be adjusted for a wide range of lighting conditions. Overall I think you'll be impressed with the features and ease of use at this price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MEFGWVY5W1RK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9CDTZO#wasThisHelpful","R3MEFGWVY5W1RK","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So it sounds like there's a new version of the hardware out there that maybe works better, but all I can say is that the one I have does not work all that well.Namely:* It seems to get stuck on ""Connecting"" a lot, even for a device it was connected with just a moment prior. The fix seems to be to pick up the device and hold down the button to get it to reconnect but that rather defeats the purpose.* ""Locate device"" doesn't presently seem to do anything except show me where my phone is. As in the phone that I am looking at in my hand, even though I intentionally left the device at home.The basic functionality is there -- I can pair the TrackR to my phone and use my phone to sound an alarm on the device from at least 50 feet away. It can also be set to ping me if I get too far away (which I suspect is ""whatever range causes Bluetooth to disconnect""), which is cool -- if you walk off without your wallet or something, it will remind you -- so I see the use case for the device but the bugs and reliability need fixing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOK7B2CDIV6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK0ECYA#wasThisHelpful","R2TOK7B2CDIV6B","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edit: Warning! The top of the case is pretty thick and the hole for connecting to the audio jack is too small to accommodate most cables. The headphones that came with my Samsung fit but the generic male-to-male cable I bought for connecting to my car does not fit with this case on. You'll need cables with slender connections (meaning the plastic/rubber around the connector) to fit this case.This is a pretty straightforward case. The main thing I like about it is how thin it is while still feeling like it gives the phone some protection, especially from corner drops. The box claims to protect it from 2m corner drops. I'll hopefully just be able to take their word for it. I like my Otterbox case but it adds so much thickness all around the case that I felt I was giving up too much to gain the drop protection.I also like the sleek black/white look of the design.

"...or a new error, if you're a grag.I agree with other reviewers that this feels a bit like a farewell tour. Technically it's a Moist von Lipwig book (""Going Postal"", ""Making Money"") but it has plenty of familiar faces and feels like more of a playful romp than a lot of Pratchett's older material. That is, the villains are a bit less fleshed out than usual, they are a bit more easily defeated than usual and I felt the book lacked the same grip of Pratchett's older works. It's like an easy ride with old friends.And there's a lot of classic Pratchett to love in this novel. The wit and humor is all there and Moist von Lipwig continues to develop as a character. Without delivering a lot of spoilers, I'll at least say it's been my favorite of the most recent Pratchett books. You should definitely pick it up if you're a Discworld fan.The eternal question for all Discworld books: can you read this without being a Discworld fan. Maybe? I would advise at least reading the other Moist von Lipwig books I listed above although you'd still be missing some relevant backstory (e.g., the Battle of Koom Valley). For non-Discworld fans I typically suggest starting with ""Guards! Guards!"" or ""Equal Rites"" and then look online for the ""Discworld Reading Order Guide"" and go from there. Moist is a fairly close spinoff of the Guard series, I'd say, since it's more centered around Ankh-Morpork.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XB0J8EYT5J8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553826X#wasThisHelpful","R1XB0J8EYT5J8G","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this technology! I have a phone holder that works like this too:So basically it sticks to things with some sort of suction technology but it's not a suction cup. It just looks like a flat surface that feels a bit tacky but put it on a flat surface (I'm using it on bathroom tile) and it easily clings to it.There is no adhesive so they are completely reusable and they leave no residue behind. Just give them a wash and they're ready to be used again.

It shouldn't matter what direction you clamp it to something -- horizontal bar, vertical bar or anything in between -- or where the sun is -- because the umbrella can be tilted and twisted any-which-way.

"Here it is, the next big entry in the MMORPG genre -- also the next big Elder Scrolls game.This almost needs 2 reviews. One for Elder Scrolls and one for an MMORPG...As an Elder Scrolls game, you have to ask yourself one thing: ""Do I want to play an Elder Scrolls game with a bunch of other people?"" If the answer is ""yes, at all costs!"", skip the rest of this review and click ""buy"". If the answer is ""Yes!....wait, what costs?"", then read on.The first cost, of course, is the actual monthly subscription fee. What this gets you is a multiplayer world and (we all hope) regular content updates included as part of the subscription. The other cost is a bit more subtle...how do you have an Elder Scrolls style world where everyone can go everywhere while still customizing all content to YOU? The answer is ""you can't"", or at any rate, they didn't make any new big innovations here. ESO is more linear than other Elder Scroll games, far more like other MMORPGs. When you are level 15 you need to be in an area that's appropriate for level 15. The game isn't totally linear -- it's not Half-Life 2, for example -- but it's no Daggerfall or Skyrim either. You need to move through the world as is appropriate for your level. Consequently this has the same problem as all PvE MMORPGs, which is that if you want to play with your friends, you need to work to stay in synch. If someone runs ahead and plays 8 hours of quests without you, you can't just log in the next day and join them where they are (not unless you want to die a lot because you're in an area too high level for you).So that's what being multiplayer does to Elder Scrolls. If that's acceptable to you, buy away. If you were looking for a single player experience, though, you may be disappointed.For people already familiar with MMORPGs (and may not be familiar with Elder Scrolls) probably the biggest surprise is going to be the combat system, which is, in my opinion, far more immersive and engaging than a lot of games. You are expected to actively swing your sword and actively block and actively dodge. This isn't WOW where you target something and eat nachos while mashing ""Shadowbolt"" over and over. You need to get involved. And it works surprisingly well. The lag seems to be invisible and the game's performance is actually amazing.I really mean that. I dunno who they hired to do their network code and graphics engine but they're not paying them enough. The game handles hundreds of players on screen in crisp, high resolution graphics and it is frankly better and more amazing than any other MMORPG I have ever played, and I've played most of them. From high end machines to low end, all of my friends and guildmates are amazed at how well this game runs and how good it looks.Character design is more akin to Elder Scrolls than regular MMORPG tropes too. Don't look for a ""tank"" or a ""healer"". Decide what role you want to play, decide which class looks like the most fun and then figure out how to build that class into that role. All classes can be any role, in their own way. I'm playing a Nightblade, which on the surface looks like a rogue, but I'm playing him as a tank. One of my friends is playing a Nightblade healer. It basically means we both have some decent abilities for burst damage and escape but I am very tanky and he is very healy and our character builds don't look much alike, despite being the same class. You could be a sorcerer tank or a dragonknight archer, etc. The class/role system is pretty wide open.PvP? Elder Scrolls offers probably the best PvP we've seen since DAOC. It follows the DAOC model, which is somewhat like the GW2 model but with some important differences:Most of the world is PvE but the 3 teams come together in the middle of the map. The middle zone is, we estimate, on the order of 15 times larger than GW2's ""Eternal Battleground"" (search YouTube for the travel time comparison video someone made), and that's the 3-team PvP area. There are keeps to fight over, PvE quest hubs (where enemies can and will gank you, but the XP is great if you can avoid getting murdered), ""Elder Scrolls"" to steal from enemy keeps, small public dungeons (where enemies can and will gank you), LOTS of open space to hunt in and, ""coming soon"", the Imperial City, which is a huge PvEvP area in the middle of the PvP map (not yet implemented, though you can SEE it...)Will this game have legs to go long term? I dunno. At worst, I think it'll be the next Rift -- alive and kicking for a year or two before the new wears off for everyone. I don't think it'll be another SWTOR -- which was closing servers due to lack of players less than a year after launch. Whether it's the new WOW, exploding onto the MMORPG scene and there to stay, remains to be seen. It may depend on how popular the PvP is (which sustained DAOC for years) and how well they can deliver new content.All things said, I'd vote ""go ahead and get it"". The only people I think will be unhappy are those who expected another Skyrim with an open world meant for soloing. This is not that.For me, it's fun. I dunno if it's long term (""Magic 8-ball says: ""Ask Again Later"") but it really has its moments and is not a flash in the pan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30E6AAOOIP3DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081Q58AW#wasThisHelpful","R30E6AAOOIP3DL","A1F92EK0MUNOVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F92EK0MUNOVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I have this thing and a Chromecast. I gotta say, I'm not sure why Google went the direction they did because this thing seems easier to setup and use and it effectively does more.The Chromecast requires apps support it. You have to, for example, launch the Netflix app and then hit the ""Chromecast"" button to hook it up to your TV. And initial setup requires getting the Chromecast connected to your wifi, which can be a hassle.I guess the Chromecast advantage is that probably all phones can support it. Not so with this Miracast -- it worked just awesome with my Galaxy S4 but I could not get it connected to my work phone, which is an HTC One. It SHOULD work and connect but I couldn't get it to see the device.Anyway, I'm still rating it 5 stars because with my Galaxy S4 it was very simple to use -- it's just the ""screen mirroring"" function built into the phone. No connecting to wifi or anything else was needed. I just went to Screen Mirroring (Settings -> Connections tab -> ""Screen Mirroring"" at the bottom), the device came right up and I selected it and that was that.Unlike the Chromecast this requires no app support. It just mirrors whatever is on your screen. Netflix, gallery photos, YouTube, your home screen, the browser, Angry Birds, whatever. The only real catch is ""does your phone support it"".

"This is not a verified review, but we've recently purchased 3 from Amazon for our clients using our business account. These Edsal racks are common at your local Lowes and Home Depot, they may just be branded differently. The $75 to $90 price range is usually more common for the 48x24x72 models with the particle board. Not only are these bigger but they come with the wire racks which are much sturdier than the particle board version and less prone to bowing. When big retailers drop the price to $89, Amazon price matches and it's a super bargain to have it at this price and delivered to your door. Are you kidding me? This thing is huge and heavy, it would cost more than $89 to ship it. I don't understand how Amazon does it. Really, how can small businesses compete? But I digress.. don't even hesitate, buy this, you won't regret it. BTW, it's powdered coated and will come to you with scratches and paint imperfections. No biggie.Okay, HERE ARE SOME TIPS:---------------------------------------------1. TOOLS REQUIRED - A MALLET: You absolutely need this so you don't do this incorrectly, and then come here and write a bad review about how they don't stay connected. You need it to whack the beams so they will interlock tight. You don't want to use a hammer because it will damage or dent the beams. Once you have the whole rack done, you should do a walk around and whack it some more. Because I realize that as I was connecting the beams, the force of the mallet was actually disengaging other beams. So do one last walk around and make sure everything is tight.2. EDSAL VS HUSKY INSTRUCTIONS: For some reason, Amazon's inventory see these brands as interchangeable. They shouldn't because there are differences and the Edsal units are better. If you receive a set with Husky instructions, then you might want to consider returning it. As mentioned above, these things can be found at your local hardware store under different brand-names, so I wasn't surprised when I received one with Husky instructions. Husky is also a Home Depot brand. But because we had ordered 3 sets. I was able to compare and contrast and I found out the subtle differences, and the Edsal units are superior. Maybe I just so happen to receive a bad husky set, but of the 3 sets, 2 were edsal and 1 was husky, and only the husky set had bent poles. The couplings/braces that connect the two pole halves were also different, and the Edsal couplings were far superior. I will discuss the coupling issues below. Also, the Husky poles are slightly shorter than the Edsal poles, so you cannot mix them up because the holes won't line up properly to connect the beams. BTW, this is how the packaging arrived for our 3 units from Amazon. We received two Edsal units with Edsal instructions, but they came in Husky boxes flipped inside out to hide the Husky brand. And we received one Husky unit with Husky instructions that came in a completely unbranded brown box. Are you confused yet? LOL!3. COUPLINGS: The most time you'll spend on assembling this rack is while connecting the upper and lower post with the couplings. The posts are metal thin L shape bars and they have to slide into a coupling whose opening is equally thin. I have attached an image below to show you the difference between a husky coupling and an edsal coupling. The husky coupling maybe looks nicer because it'll cover the seems from the outside, whereas the edsal is built inside/out, so it'll cover the inner seams, but the outer seams will be exposed. But the edsal couplings are superior!A.) EDSAL COUPLING: The edsal coupling is harder to connect, but it's superior because of that, and you will have no issues connecting the top and bottom poles EQUALLY. I'll get back to what I mean by ""equally"" when I discuss the husky coupling below. If you find that you cannot connect the edsal posts no matter how hard you whack with the mallet. You'll need to get a small flat head screw-driver and pry open the coupling end that you're having issues with. I simply use the same mallet to wedge the flat head into the coupling. You don't want to use a big screw driver, the idea is to open it just a little, and not compromise its purpose. If you pry it too big, you will compromise it's ability to hold the top and bottom post together. Because ultimately, you do want it to be a tight fit. Reading this may not make any sense now, but you'll understand when you have it in your hands.B.) HUSKY COUPLING: The husky coupling openings were sightly bigger than the edsal couplings, so it's looser. Just like the edsal assembly, you start by whacking in a coupling onto a pole (bottom), then when it's half way in, you stop. Actually with the edsal, there is some sort of built in road-block right in the middle of the coupling, so no matter how hard you whack, the coupling cannot slide past the half-way point, so when you whack in the top pole, even with all the force, the coupling stays put and does not slide further down the bottom pole, as you keep whacking, the top pole will eventually touch the bottom pole, and you have a perfect assembly. But the issue with the husky coupling is that it does not have the built in road-block that the edsal has. So when you whack the coupling into the bottom pole, you'll need to eyeball the half-way point and stop yourself. The problem begins when you try connecting the top pole. When you start whacking in the top pole down, because of all the force, the coupling will slide further down the bottom pole, it doesn't stay put due to the lack of road-block. And because it doesn't stay put to give you leverage, the top pole isn't even going in. You think you're whacking in the top pole into the coupling, but all you end up doing is hammering in the coupling further down the bottom pole. Once this happens, you will have an absolutely swell time trying to remove the coupling from the bottom pole. Absolutely swell! The time of your life. So if you get a set with the husky instructions and couplings, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY. DON'T EVEN TRY. Be sure to look at my pictures below to see the pictures of the couplings.4. YOU ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO USE THE COUPLINGS (BUT YOU MAY NEED A HELPING HAND): This will work for either brand. That's right, they are not necessary and I'll tell you why. Did you now the older models never came with couplings? I own both old and new models, so I know. The reason is you can simply connect the upper and lower post by installing a shelf right in the middle. The beams will connect the upper and lower posts together. Installing a center shelf was a requirement in the older model. The couplings now simply give you an option so you don't have to put a shelf in the middle, so you can divide the sections any way you want. So if you're planning to put a shelf in the middle anyway, then you can avoid the coupling hassle. But you may need a helping hand to hold the two posts while you connect the beams. But they don't mention this in the instructions, and if you look at the Amazon product picture, you can see they use couplings to connect the halves, and the middle shelf is slightly above the coupling. Did they find some security issues in their old models? So now they decided to add couplings? Or, is it simply to allow this to truly be a one person job? I don't know. But all the older models in my home without the couplings are doing just fine.But I love the couplings! I should say I love the ""edsal"" couplings! Because I store bulkier things, boxes, bins, etc. So with the old models where I'm forced to put a shelf in the middle, once I install the other shelves above and below, my clearance became too small. With this new model, I do not use all 5 sets of shelves and beams. I only use 4 sets to create a three section rack divided equally with no center shelf. The thickness of the beams are approx 2.5 inches. So for my three section rack, which means using 4 sets of beams. 4x2.5 = 10 inches of clearance that you'll lose. Subtract that from the total height, which is 78, and you get 68. Divide that by 3 and spaced evenly, I get 22.6 clearance. If you use all 5 sets of beams to create a 4 section rack just like the product picture, and you space it evenly, your clearance is only 16.375. That was not good for me. So it all depends on the type of items you'll be storing.5. The holes in the posts are very useful if you think creatively. I have two bins hooked up to it. I have included a picture so you can have an idea.Bottom line, at $89 for a 60x24x78 rack that comes with the galvanized wire shelves that do not bow easily, it's a great deal. The smaller version 48x24x78 is currently $99. Some complain the beams are flimsy. Well think about it, they are 60 inches long. I can't believe this is even a complaint by some people. It's physics, individually, yes they can bend, but once assembled and connected properly, it is absolutely ridged. Try bending the the finished product!! If you want heavy rigid metal beams, how much do you think you'll need to pay? So If you have reasonable expectations, this is a lot of bang for your buck. I also did the math on material cost to make these racks out of 2x4s and the savings wasn't worth the hassle. Get it! But remember, if you are shipped a husky brand with husky couplings, you might want to return it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26NFPNZNROBPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZDT5OE#wasThisHelpful","R26NFPNZNROBPE","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started using a trackball in 2011, the Logitech M570, so that is the only experience I have. I just got through mentioning in my LG tv review that I don't believe large companies are dumb enough to have shills writing bad or good reviews, but some of the bad reviews for this mouse has me thinking.. hmm. If you click on my reviews and rummage through it, you'll find me raving about the Logitech M570, so I'm definitely not a Kensington employee or anything. Trackballs will be prone to bad reviews if the reviewer has only used it for one day and decide to piss and moan. You need to understand this word when it comes to trackballs.. KNACK. It takes getting used to, and after awhile you'll develop a knack for it. There is so much false information floating around in the bad reviews. For example, someone says the scrolling pad touches the ball, so when you scroll, you'll be chasing your page all over the place. Wow! For the first time, I'm thinking maybe shill reviewers do exist in these corporate battles. There is a small gap between the ball and the scrolling pad, so no, it does not touch the ball and you won't be chasing your pages. This person is probably just touching the ball with her other fingers.Anyway, here are my pros and cons when examining it from the M570 point of view.PROS:--------1. The ability to move the ball with a combination of your index, middle and ring finger gives this mouse potential for optimal precision. I think you can use all three middle fingers if you want, I personally think the most comfortable and natural is just to use the index and middle finger. The index does the main steering, while the middle can provide further support for more precision. The middle finger or the ring finger can be used for scrolling, you'll have to find your own knack. The pinky is used for right clicking. At first I found this uncomfortable, but I realize it's because I was trying to click with the tip of my pinky. If I relax, and just use the whole length of my pinky to press, it feels much better. I love my M570, but the thumb is not going to give you the type of precision that you can achieve with your fingers. I'm not quite there yet, but I already feel the comfort and I see the potential when I finally develop the ""knack.""Honestly, that's it. That's the main advantage it has over the M570, but it's a big one. Because if you master it, and I plan to, the other short comings will be worth it for me to put up with.CONS:---------1. No back and forward buttons. And it would seem so easy for them to give it to us. The right and left clicks are on the sides of the mouse and they are big. They could make the left click smaller and squeeze in a back and forward button right under it. For now, if you need to go back or forward, you'll need to right click (with your ringfinger or pinky) to bring up the menu. Or, scroll to your browser's buttons. But here is some good news... You can program the back and forward if you want. The left button that serves as the click/selection button can never be re-programmed for obvious reasons. But you can program the right button. Since most of us do copying and pasting, reprogramming this button is not an option. So one last recourse is the double press! You can program it so that when you press both left and right buttons, your browser will go back. So you can't have both back and forward, it's either/or. You need to download their software and play around with it. It's self explanatory.2. Another complaint I see is regarding the touch scrolling wheel. Many say it's hit or miss, or that it requires a few swipes for it to react. It's not as smooth as the M570, but certainly not as bad as some are saying. I would set the scrolling to a tick above the slowest speed. I find that to be the sweet spot where it's not too slow, and I don't get lost. If you set the speed to medium or higher, you will get lost cause the scrolling will jump or skip lines. Here's my theory why so many think it's faulty when in actuality it isn't. You see some web pages will not allow wheel scrolling until the browser has finished loading a certain percentage of the page. I think psychologically, you're less annoyed when a physical wheel isn't responding because it's tactical. When you hear and feel the wheel scrolling, your brain says it's functioning even though the page is not scrolling until the browser is good and ready. Since it doesn't bother you, these instances are not remembered. But when it comes to something that is based on touch, psychologically you get annoyed easily. When something that's based on touch doesn't respond, you think it's not reliable or finicky, when the truth of the matter is that both the physical and touch scrolling wheels has its fair share of unresponsive moments. But if you insist that the scrolling is horrible, then you can program the double press so that it functions as a middle click. So when you press both left and right buttons at the same time, a scrolling cursor will appear and you can use the ball to scroll. I believe some call this ""chording?"" The DOUBLE PRESS is a good way to get another function, but you just have to choose what is most important to you. Since scrolling is fine as is for me, I program the double press to be my BACK button.And honestly, that's it for the cons. You see, most bad reviews have one subject in common, ergonomics. But like I said, these things require developing a knack.  If you wanted something easy to use, then buy a conventional mouse. That's why the majority of the population DO NOT use trackballs. They are by nature, NOT EASY TO USE. If you purchase one, then understand you'll need time to master it. If I can master this mouse, it will replace my M570 because I like the control potential. When I develop the knack, I'll comeback and change the rating to 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86KL9I6G0ZHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050SPZMK#wasThisHelpful","R86KL9I6G0ZHV","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pleasantly surprised by the size of this train. We imagined it would be a smaller, but it's about the size of a football. There are only 3  controls: 1. Forward 2. Reverse 3. Auto. The auto is the center button, push it and it will do a little song and dance on it's own. There isn't any steering left or right, so in order to change direction, you'll have to reverse and figure things out, but that's only an issue when the adults are playing. LOL! When your 2 yr old is playing, he'll just go and move the train physically when it's stuck or hit a wall. I'm imagining the only way to have a left and right, is to have a directional stick and two buttons for forward & backwards. But then as you can imagine, you're entering a different age group. These basic buttons are fine for a toddler's first RC.Now keep this in mind. If the train has been inactive for a while, I think it goes into some sort of sleep mode. You may need to get real close to it, or turn off the controller, and turn it back on again. I think some may be complaining and describing this quirk as ""not working anymore"" or unreliable. But that's all it is, a quirk. We have never failed to get it out of its inactivity state by getting real close to the train, or by turning the controller or/and train off & on again. If you can teach your child to turn off the train and the controller every time he/she is done playing then you will not have this issue. But good luck with that!

"Terrific value! Got mine from another source on Black Friday, so this is not a verified purchase review. There are people claiming many reviews are fake, so you just have to use your head and analyze the reviews yourself. There are a fair share of 5-star reviews from ""verified purchases,"" and a fair share of accusatory reviewers who are not verified purchasers. If LG has shills, then Sony, Samsung, they all have shills and it's a stupid silly game. Personally, I don't think a corporation this big would risk writing fake reviews and damage their rep. I think people who are unhappy with their TV are just paranoid.Anyway, back to the TV. First off, this is a basic TV, and you're paying accordingly. So I understood I had to tempter my expectations. It's not for my main living room, it's for my bedroom and it's more than adequate. It's a beauty too! Less bezel is always better. The bezel is so thin, it's out of sight, out of mind. Out of the box, I did not like the picture quality. You need to calibrate it. I find that the Wizard program built in the TV produced great results. The model I owned previously was a budget Sony Bravia from 2009, it had ghost spots from the beginning. This LG model has none, so that's an improvement already.There was one quirk I didn't quite understand. Every time I changed the channel, the tv would dim for a split second, then brighten up again when the channel gets settled in. You don't need to even be changing channels. If a program is changing segments or going to a commercial, it will normally transition with a black screen. Well this black screen will also cause the TV to dim then brighten back. So I dug through the reviews and I even posed a question asking if this was normal. Turns out this an automatic dimming feature on purpose by LG for reasons I'm too lazy to get into, but to get rid of it, all you need to do is turn off ""dynamic contrast."" It's found in your settings..PICTURE, then scroll down to EXPERT CONTROL.Once I ran it through the wizard for calibration and my xbox one for further calibration recommendations, and turned off dynamic contrast.. everything was dandy! For $500, the picture quality is awesome! My go to movie scene to make sure I like the black levels is Back to the Future, the parking lot scene where Marty meets Doc at Twin Pines Mall in the middle of the night. The night sky is nice and black, the subjects are bright and crisp. Maybe I got a good panel, but for my experience, I believe all the great reviews on Amazon. Those who are accusing LG of fake reviews probably got bad ones, don't know how to calibrate, or are expecting a $3k tv for $500.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDWBDAYKTXX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVLT0E0#wasThisHelpful","RWDWBDAYKTXX2","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tremendous! I got mine during black friday from Sony. So this is not an Amazon verified purchase. Anyway, I'm coming from the Canon 70D, before that, the 60D and lugging a full size dslr around started to feel cumbersome. So I decided to jump into the mirrorless world, and I'm not sure if I will ever turn back. Look I'm not a professional, I think I'll be ""entry level"" my whole life. I don't have a keen eye for picture differences, nor am I that picky. I cannot tell the difference in quality between my 70d shots and my Sony shots, so if you're like me, and you can't tell the difference... then why lug around the bigger camera? Simple logic.I'm either going to sell the 70D, or keep it as a dedicated product photography camera, while the Sony will be my take out camera. One feature I really like is how you don't have to choose between the viewfinder or the screen. As your eye approaches the viewfinder, it automatically senses and switches accordingly. I do wish the Sony had touch screen like the 70D, but I'm sure that's down the line. That's how they milk ya!In terms of aesthetics, after years and years of all black Canon cameras, I wanted a change! So I went with the silver body with the black grip and I think the black and silver contrast looks awesome. I wanted a black lens, but Sony didn't allow to mix and match, but I realize it looks fine since there is a touch of black because the face of the lens is black. I also purchased and highly recommend the Sony lower body case model# LCSEBC/B. It fits nicely.Highly recommend the A6000!

"Terrible instructions... I've installed countless screen protectors, so this is not mindless user error. There are always two layers that you need to peel.. lets say SIDE A for the sticky side that will stick to your screen. Then there is SIDE B, this is the front side with no adhesive. This product's SIDE A has two layers unknowingly to me. Instructions does not warn you of this! As you all know, it is extremely difficult to prep your glass and get it just right with no dust. Every little spec of dust, you find yourself wiping, wiping, wiping to no end. Finally, when the screen is ready, this is the moment you have to GO!! Hurry before another spec of dust arrives. Well, when I removed the SIDE A, I hurried up to apply it, but it won't stick. I'm scratching my head! I realized there is another outer edge layer that I need to peel. How stupid is that?????????? When I removed the first layer, it had already exposed the middle of the glass. So now I have to fiddle with it to remove the outer edge. Well when you have to fiddle with it, dust particles land on the protector since the middle has already been exposed. I can keep an eye on my Sony screen and still keep it clean, but there is no way you can tell whether or not particles have landed on the protector while you're fiddling with removing the second layer. I knew it was going to be bad, but I installed it anyway, and sure enough... dust specs galore! To make matters worse, it was difficult to remove and it leaves a sticky residue. I haven't been able to wipe my glass clean for fear that if I scrub any harder, I may actually scratch the screen. The corners of the protector are not rounded, and does not cover the screen as neatly as the Larmor version. The Larmor version is also nicely rounded on the corners, but you'll pay twice as much.

"Unless you got this at the giveaway price of $19, I would stick with the Amazon Fire tv box. I guess I'm a techie, and we tend to be frivolous with gadgets and buy redundant technology just to check them out. So I either own or have tried them all. I am biased against the stick because it performs poorly with PLEX. Even its competition, the supposed weaker Chromecast, streams flawlessly with Plex. Xbox One, Roku, and the Amazon Fire TV box all perform PLEX perfectly.If you don't know or don't use Plex, then you'll be happy with the Stick. It does everything else well. If you bought this for Plex, you might want to just buy the Fire TV. If you think about it, the stick isn't a bargain compared to the Fire TV. From $99 to $39 retail, at first glance, you may think it's a bargain, but it isn't. You don't get the Voice remote like you do with the Fire TV, that's $30 sold separately. So when there's no black Friday, no cyber Monday, and we're back to retail as usual, that's $70 total for the stick and the voice remote. Might as well pay an extra $30 to get the box where you get double the power, USB port for accessories like a keyboard. If you know what SIDE-LOADING is, you're going to want to use a keyboard when using Android apps that are not made for the Amazon interface. There is also an Ethernet port on the box.If the lesser Chromecast can do Plex nicely, then I'm thinking this isn't a hardware issue, and hopefully a software update can solve the problem. Others who are using it for Plex and are happy are making me per-PLEX-ed. LOL! I wonder if they had experience with any other gadgets to compare the quality to. But there are plenty of reviews similar to mine, with the conclusion that this is bad for Plex.BTW, if these box makers would just give us a HDMI input, they can completely wipe out the Smart TV business. Seem so easy, but only the high end Xbox One has this feature.-----------------------------------------------------Dec 4th, 2014 REVIEW UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------I have now revised my review for this product. Initially I was biased against it because I thought it performed horribly with Plex. I thought I couldn't use 1080p, so I had to set the quality to 720p which gave me so much blocky artifacts. As it turns out, I made a simple rookie mistake in 1080p mode. In my plex setting, when I would set the quality to above 8 mbps for 1080p, but to test out my movie, I would go into the RECENTLY VIEWED section and I would RESUME a movie. Well, the terrible quality and stuttering comes from the fact that I'm starting mid-stream cold, no buffering. I played around with it again today, this time I started all the movies from the beginning and it streamed perfectly and quality is outstanding!I initially rated the stick 2 stars. I still will not give it 5 stars because the value to me is deceptive. The voice remote is sold separately for $30 which brings the grand total to $70. At that point, you might as well get the Box version for $99 for all the reasons I mentioned above. If you got this for the pre-order price of $19, then it is a 5 star all the way!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7MXWWBZ2P4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","RR7MXWWBZ2P4Q","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a $20 babys r us type umbrella stroller that needs upgrading, so we opted for this! After setting it up and testing it out, it works and functions great. This is the same stroller, made by the same company as the Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Cobalt. So be sure to read reviews there too since the bulk of the sales is coming from that listing, but I chose this Kolcraft branded one for the black/red color combo. The main issue I read is that there are no back support. It is padded and there is a piece of cardboard inside, but no cross bars or anything. But if you're like us, upgrading from those $20/$30 babys r us umbrella strollers, then this shouldn't be an issue. If during the ownership of those $20 strollers, you felt you needed back support, then this model is NOT for you, but if back support was never an issue, then you'll be happy with this stroller. Besides, it is still an upgrade after all. There is more padding than those $20 strollers, which actually had zero padding. You also have to have some perspective, this is a $60 stroller so you can't expect the world. We also own the Britax B-Ready which is a $300/$400 system, and so we understand what not to expect from $60 strollers. These strollers are for quick errands, and for my wife when I'm not around since the Britax is too heavy for her.It came down to this model and The First Years Ignite Stroller, Naturalization, which had back support. But once again, back support was never an issue with us. We only started thinking about it due to the reviews. We ultimately decided on the Kolcraft because it just beats out the Ignite and all other similar price range strollers in so many ways. Here is the breakdown of why we chose Kolcraft over the First Years Ignite.BACK SUPPORT: Ignite Wins!--------------------------It has some sort of metal cross-bar for the back, so for those who think their child needs it, probably the heavier ones, they should buy the Ignite model. If you are new to umbrella strollers, you need to know that these strollers have very little to zero back support. it's like a shock to some people and so they leave bad reviews. Some babies are fine, like ours. But some may look uncomfortable, so you need to observe your child.WHEELS: Ignite Wins!--------------------The Ignite back wheels are also double wheels, so you have 8 total wheels versus the Kolcraft which has 6 total wheels. Not sure if the child can feel the difference, so not a big deal to us.BASKET: Kolcraft Wins!----------------------Kolcraft has a bigger basket, not to mention accessible. The Ignite has a basket too, but it's smaller on top of not being accessible. The problem is there is a crossbar in the way. I'm not talking about the back support cross-bar, there is another cross-bar that is part of the overall frame. Now, with your child sitting down, all the reviews say there is no way you can reach this basket. You can poke your hand in and out from the side, but there is no way to comfortably grab a bag, a blanket, etc. with your child already in the seat. You'll need to remove the child first. This is not an issue with the Kolcraft.CANOPY: Kolcraft Wins!----------------------The Ignite Canopy is fixed in one location, and it's not that big. You'll need to buy a shade accessory. The Kolcraft's canopy is quite generous and there is even a second layer that extends. The child will be fully covered even from the side angles.ACCESSORY HOLDERS: Kolcraft Wins!---------------------------------The ignite has a accessory bag at the handle bar for the parent, the Kolcraft has a double cup holder and tray. It's a wash, depending on which you prefer. But the Kolcraft still wins in this department because the child has a snack tray! This tray will also serve as a horizontal bar like you see in higher end models. For children who likes to hold on to something, this is great.RECLINE: BOTH RECLINE---------------------Both will recline, but if this is ""VERY"" important to you, then don't buy either of this model, check out Summer Infant 3D lite Convenience Stroller, BlackSECURITY: BOTH ARE FIVE POINT HARNESS-------------------------------------WEIGHT: Kolcraft Wins!----------------------Kolcraft is approx 12 lbs, the ignite is approx 14 lbs.FOLDING: DEPENDS ON PREFERENCE!-------------------------------This is also a wash depending on your preference. The Ignite folds like a traditional umbrella stroller, it folds exactly the same way as those cheap $20 strollers. But these are more heavier than those $20 strollers, so you'll need to get on the ground. But it'll take up less space in terms of girth, but more in terms of length. Some reviews say it was too long to fit in their trunk/back.The Kolcraft will fold up while you're standing, and it will fold up standing on its own as well. You won't need to ever go to the ground. Watch the video clip of this either here or on youtube. It's great, we love this feature. So it will not fold like an umbrella. It'll take up more space in terms of girth/width, but it'll be shorter than the ignite, which means it should fit in any trunk.At the end of the day, these are all cheap strollers. People will swear by you the quality of one cheap stroller over they other. But at this price range, you're getting a cheap stroller no matter what you choose. So I would focus more on function. I also wanted to get away from models that fold up like an umbrella because I could never use my feet to lift up the bracket or mechanism that controls the folding. I would always have to bend down and pull with my hands and was always conscious whether my fingers would get caught. The Kolcraft one-handed or two-handed fold while you stand sealed the deal.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O6HIWM5IDLJZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQW9MCC#wasThisHelpful","R3O6HIWM5IDLJZ","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"$15 at my local Home Depot. I used this for my wall mount vacmaster. I have to use an adapter coupling to change the 1-1/4 to 1-7/8. I wanted more floor coverage when vacuuming saw dust. Sucks them up effortlessly. When it comes to nozzle reviews, I see so many people blaming the nozzle, when maybe they just don't have a good shop vac. So disregard reviews, you need to trial and error yourself. This one works perfectly for my vacmaster. I love the smooth gliding wheels. You can step on the tab located on top of the left side and release the brushes. Left the tab to retract the brushes.

"We're knocking out two star for the rounds of replacements we have to go through. Otherwise, this could be a five star product. If I get a perfect replacement, I'll add back a star to make this 4-stars. For all the QC issues, it cannot be 5-stars.FIRST KNIFE:The first knife we got, the blade was a little wobbly. Something that we would have accepted since others have mentioned it too. Not so loose that it would fall out, it would cut perfectly fine. But what we couldn't accept was the fact that the blade compartment could not be closed flush. It will come to you from the factory flush. Obviously even though we do not need to exchange blades on a brand new knife, we like to to test out everything, and that means opening up the blade compartment and looking around. Well, we couldn't close it back flush. We had the exact problem that reviewer FS2 mentioned. That review is currently the ""most helpful critical"" review. And he is correct, no matter how strong you are, you will not be able to close it flush. There is one way to fix this, and that is if you have a vise. We put the knife through our vise, and was able to close everything up flush. After applying pressure with the vise, the compartment had more give. Future closing was possible with hand force. But the fact that the blade remain a little loose, we decided to ask for an exchange.SECOND KNIFE:The replacement was ""almost"" perfect. The blade was nice and tight, no wobbling. The blade guard compartment could be opened and closed flush, but you'll still need some hand muscle, which is good because you want the compartment nice and tight. If you use all your might and you can't close it flush, then it's defective, like the first one we got. But if you use reasonable force and it closes flush, then you got a good one!  Now, why did I say ""almost?"" Because I noticed the big round hinge bolt is not installed evenly. Everything is working fine, but we're just concerned whether or not this will have an effect later in time.So we've asked for a THIRD knife. If the hing bolt is fine, but then we have some other issues like the first knife, then we'll just keep the second knife. But we're hoping 3rd time's a charm. Lastly, I want to mention that this EXACT knife has been branded by Sheffield and Craftsman, so don't buy all the Bessey fluff about quality control. These companies are getting these knifes at the same Chinese factories and slapping their brand on it, or packaging it with other accessories. I mean examine these knives carefully, THEY ARE THE SAME KNIVES.1.Craftsman Folding Utility Knife with Holster2.Sheffield Premium Lockback Utility KnifeBTW, if someone knows what tool can unscrew the hinge bolt, can you please comment below?8/27/14 UPDATE--------------Was hoping to get a perfect one and I would bump this review up one star, but unfortunately, I'm going to knock off another star instead. The third knife I got was once again, ALMOST perfect. The blade guard can close flush, the blade sits nice and tight, the hing bolt is installed evenly. Unfortunately, this one did not close when you press the hinge release mechanism. It will, but you need to give a hard shake with your hand. I thought it was something good old WD-40 would fix, but it didn't. Upon closer examination, the lower and the upper body are not aligned, that is the reason why it won't fold easily.So we're just going to keep the 2nd knife with the hinge bolt imperfection... for now. We may just decide to return it too. Good knife with too much QC issues.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQDQGTWSHW4PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000G7TLQ6#wasThisHelpful","RQDQGTWSHW4PX","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a verified purchase. Got mine from BuyDig, but returned it.THREE MAIN THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW!1. FOCUS BREATHINGThis is new to me. I didn't even know such a phenomenon existed, therefore I didn't even know the term. Search ""Breathing"" in the reviews and you'll see that there is probably one other person who has mentioned this. So as a consumer, there is no way you can be warned by reading reviews, most people who own this lens probably aren't the wiser because they don't have another 250mm to compare too. I still don't really understand all the technical explanation of this phenomenon, so I'm not going to pretend. You should search the internet for info. Basically, when you zoom all the way to 250mm on the Sigma, your magnification will be much less than if you were to zoom in at 250mm on the Canon. So if you've never had any lens that was capable of 250mm, then you're not missing out on anything. Like I said, you simply wouldn't be the wiser. But if you do have a lens that can do 250mm, like I did, YOU WILL FEEL CHEATED. And the difference is a lot. The other reviewer who said the Sigma zoom at 250mm is like 40% less than the Canon's is NOT exaggerating.2. VIDEO RECORDING IS LOUD!The motor on this Sigma is loud when focusing and if you shoot video, you'll record all of the sound.3. FOCUSING RING IS SUPER TIGHT!I once dropped a Canon lens, and the result was a tighter focusing ring. So it did not give me a good feeling when the Sigma was so tight. However, unlike in my case, this isn't a defect or damage. Many other reviewers have mentioned the focusing ring being tight. So it's just the way it's built.This lens is good only for pictures and only for people who've never owned a Canon 55-250mm. Like the saying in the Matix movie, ""Ignorance is bliss.""  I think I would have been happy with this lens if I didn't own a 55-250mm and never found out about the focus breathing. For the best walk-around including shooting video, I think nothing beats the Canon 18-135mm with STM.Lastly, never-mind the THUMBS DOWN to my review. That is to be expected by people who own it and don't want to hear anything bad about it. Otherwise, if you don't own it yet, why would you give thumbs down to this information? I'm just informing the public of things that are not obvious in the product advertisement. Search online, or DPREVIEW, search focus breathing and you'll see people posting images of the zoom difference at 250mm between this Sigma and the Canon 55-250mm. http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/54091986","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8D3865A2VVGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008B48AAE#wasThisHelpful","R8D3865A2VVGG","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The top cover was a pain to remove!  Why do I say guitar people will have no issues? It's because they have developed callous in their fingers. That's what you'll need to pry this off  pain-free. If you don't have callous, prepare for a little torture. You have three issues going through your mind while trying to remove the top: 1. It's so tight, you're worried about scratching your mac. 2. It's so tight, you're worried about snapping and breaking the product. 3. Lastly, the pain.I finally got it off and I have returned it. I would recommend the IPEARL versions.

"For the Canon 70D, this is it!!I tried the Larmor brand and wrote a review on it here: LARMOR 0.5mm Self-Adhesive Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector for CANON 70D That one did not work for me, it was frustrating, the bubble would not clear no matter what I did. This Afunta version just took one try. I simply laid it on the glass, and you can see the bubble underneath slowly moved like a wave and eventually vanished. Now, I will say I did something this time that I did not do with the Larmor version, and I'm not sure if that was the difference. This Afunta version came with a little isopropyl alcohol pad, so I wiped the screen with it, then cleared out any dust with the microfiber cloth, also included. I don't know if the isopropyl alcohol was the difference, or if this Afunta version is simply superior. If I had moisten my glass a bit when trying the Larmor version, maybe that would have done the trick? I don't know. I'm thinking this is simply the superior product, because after all, you have to dry the glass, so moisture probably has nothing to do with it. Lastly, the touch screen still works perfectly with this glass on top! It is .3mm thick whereas many on the market, including the Larmor version, is .5mm thick. Logic dictates the thicker, the less touch sensitive, right? This one is just perfect, and .3mm is plenty thick, it feels nice and solid.What you get:1 .3mm thick glass1 microfiber cloth1 dust extraction sticker (if you take your time and make sure there are no dust, then you don't need this)1 isopropyl alcohol padWhat you DON'T get:You do not get the smaller glass to protect the top lcd screen.

"Not what I expected, but it simply works. It has nothing to do with clamps, tension, or even adhesives as you might imagine. I'm not sure if gravity is the right word to describe how this works, but that's what I thought of. It hooks onto your front bezel and that's it! Like a rock climbing hook. The back part is a frame that's held in place by a hinge. You open this hinge as wide as you need to depending on how thick your flat screen is. The kinect will clip onto the seat/plate securely. The seat/plate has buttons on each side that you need to press in order to slide the Kinect in. Likewise, you need to press the side buttons if you want to release the kinect.The whole thing can be easily lifted off your LCD if you lift it straight up, you can even slide it along the TV bezel. There is virtually no tension. Yet it sits nicely and securely due to gravity because it's hooking on your front bezel.

"After reading the poor reviews for the silver version Generic Protective Vinyl Skin Decals Cover for Microsoft Xbox one Console and 2 Xbox one Controller Sticker Skins-Carbon Firber Silver by the same ""GENERIC"" brand and seller, I was hesitant. But I figure, this is fulfilled by Amazon, so there is nothing to worry about. If it does indeed suck, I would have no problem unpeeling everything and sending it back. However, I was pleasantly surprised. These are not cheap paper stickers, they seem to be some sort of vinyl material. The cut-outs are very accurate, and it's very forgiving. What I mean is if you need to unpeel or push out an air bubble, it's easy to do. Just have a credit card with you while you're doing this to help squeegee out things. I didn't have to unplug anything either because there are no skins for the back connections. But I guess you can unplug everything and sit down at a table if you want to be very careful.My simple tip is to line up the logo cut-outs. The parts with no logo cut-out, you should line up from the edge. The parts with logo cut-outs, you should line up from the logo, then everything will fall into place. I'm very perplexed by the bad reviews the silver carbon version got. I would advise you to be suspicious at those reviews, it could be from competing sellers. Or, it could just be from people who are clumsy and simply messed up so badly, that they feel the need to trash the product because they can't accept that it was user installation error.This product is fine, and if you apply it correctly, you'll like it a lot.8/7/2014 UPDATE:---------------Since some complain that the skin will peel off.

"NOT AN AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE. I BOUGHT MINE ON EBAY.I know the debate between Xbox One and PS4 is a heated one, but those are usually from the gamers. I have spent and will spend ZERO minutes on games, and I love my Xbox One!!! In terms of converting your TV into an entertainment center/smart hub, there is nothing on the market like the Xbox One.You name it, I've tinkered with them because I'm a videophile. Roku 3, Fire TV, Apple TV, PS3, Chomecast.. I've played with them all. But the simple fact is, none of them can mimic a smart tv because none of them have a HDMI pass-through for my tivo. If you've seen those Samsung Smart TVs or those LG TVs with WebOS, then you know what I'm talking about. You move in and out of your video sources just like an app, without the need to change your TV's inputs or power up separate boxes. So in a way, this is a cheap way to upgrade your TV if you're not ready to spend over $2k. If you don't care about integrating your tivo or cable boxes, or having a blu-ray player all integrated, then yeah, getting a roku or fire tv would be more economical and they are also way ahead of the game in number of apps. Xbox One has very limited apps right now, but I'm willing to wait because I'm really waiting for nothing. Amazon Prime and Youtube are there and that's all I need. They are working on a Plex app, but until then, all you have to do is download the Xbox Video app and you've got yourself DLNA. I'm a bit confused by some of the reviews complaining about lack of DLNA, maybe those were early adopters and the Xbox video app wasn't available yet? Anyway, with this app installed on your Xbox One, your smartphone will be able to see your Xbox one with video apps like AVIA, BubbleUPNP, Twonky Beam, etc. All these apps can push your video/photos to the Xbox One. My collection of movies is served by Plex in my computer in the garage, I use BubbleUPNP to access my movies and then push it to the Xbox One... everything plays smoothly.Lastly, the one advantage that the Xbox One has over even smart tvs is the integrated Blu-Ray player. So this is truly THE ONE, all your video sources in just one HDMI connection. Once again, If you don't care about having all your sources in one input, then buying a Roku, Apple TV or Fire TV will make more sense. They also have way more apps right now. But for me, paying a premium for having all my entertainment in one input is worth it. For example, I can start an Amazon Prime movie, and all of a sudden, I realize Sportscenter is on, I click on my TV app, and boom there is my TV immediately. Once I'm done with sportscenter or live tv, I click on Amazon Prime and boom my movie resumes instantly. If you have a blu-ray in the player, it works the same way. If you have a movie being pushed via DLNA, it works the same way. When resuming a movie via DLNA, it may buffer a little first. You can jump in and out of apps, and almost everything resumes instantly, just like changing channels. It will never be as fast as changing ""real"" channels, but this is the closest thing ever. Going from a show on live TV to a movie on Netflix or Amazon Prime is almost as snappy as changing channels. And that is the whole point in having everything integrated in one HDMI connection, managed by a ""smart"" operating system. This is only going to get better once they get us more apps such as a dedicated Plex App. BTW, voice commands and the ""Minority Report"" type hand gestures work well too, but I don't really care about those things. All I care about is the console serving as my central media hub. But FYI, the hand gesturing thing is a gimmick. It's something you'll show off to your friends and family, but will not use when you're alone. The voice command is actually more practical, but your remote will still be king. It takes too damn long and too much concentration to make a selection with your hand, and the cursor is very sensitive. It works, it's cool! But what takes you 10 seconds to do with gesturing, takes a split second with a remote. The voice command is very cool and accurate, but you need to be loud and clear. On several occasions I have found it useful when I couldn't find the remote.One last thing, I was on the fence for the longest time because Xbox required their Live subscription to access all the entertainment apps, which was absolutely ridiculous. When they finally dropped that requirement, that's when I jumped in. You'll need it if you want to play games online.Advice to HARMONY USERS: (If you don't own a Harmony remote, don't read this, it'll only confuse you.)------------------------I have the Harmony 900. When you set your activity to WATCH TV, make sure to add both Xbox One and Tivo or whatever cable box you use, and of course your tv. When you have both Xbox and Tivo as part of your devices in your activity, you can then delegate your buttons to each box. Half of my buttons are dedicated to the Tivo, and half is dedicated to the Xbox one. This way, you don't have to change activities to control xbox and tivo, one activity will control both boxes. You'll need to get creative. I have the normal buttons dedicated to tivo, and I program the number buttons dedicated as my Xbox directional buttons, select button, back button, menu, etc. For example, if you take a look at your number buttons, 5 is in the middle so that's the SELECT button, 2 is above 5, so that's the DIRECTIONAL UP, 8 is below 5, so that's the DIRECTIONAL DOWN. 4 is to the left of 5, so that's the DIRECTIONAL LEFT, and etc. You get the picture. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L524AF65NS6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMQTVUA#wasThisHelpful","R3L524AF65NS6G","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Could it be that easy? I was skeptical, and to my surprise, it is that simple! I'm somewhat of a newbie to the DIY world, and I never thought creating threads to accept machine screws could be done at home. I always thought those threads in furniture and objects are manufactured at the factory. Several reviews say this is a must if you do a lot of drilling and tapping. I say even if you don't, this should be in your toolbox for those inspirational moments. In the past year I had some ideas, but like I said, I'm a newbie and I didn't think it was possible to do this at home. I didn't even know the lingo, such as tapping, deburring countersinking, etc. Now I know. :) I don't have a current project, but I was anxious to try this, so I used a large PVC coupling, nice and thick. Clamped it down properly and did my drilling with the 1/4 bit. The hole came out perfect with all the threads. I had some sort of camera adapter plate lying around, it has a 1/4 machine screw. It screwed on the PVC perfectly. I kept unscrewing and screwing just out of sheer amazement. LOL! I'll be ready next time I'm in my garage and I have one of those moments where I'm thinking.. if only I can connect this here or there, or create a thread here, etc. I'll be ready.

"First of all, it should be noted that I'm a wannabe DIY'er, not a working professional. I think I've noticed most of the complaints are from professionals who know what they want. I won't be dragging this thing around, it's going to be stationary. I just needed a drawer system to have quick access. I was tired of stacking and unstacking my bosch L-boxxes, and their drawer system is way overpriced.So for a weekend warrior, I have no complaints. But here are three minor issues I want to discuss:1. For the upper drawer, they gave us a bunch of containers with lids that fill up the whole drawer. To me, this defeats the purpose of having a ""quick access"" drawer. I don't want to open the drawer, then open a lid to a container. I would rather they gave me trays. Then I had an epiphany.. Just remove the lids!! LOL! The lids can be completely separated, and was actually useful in solving my 2nd issue.2. Build quality is questionable. There is a gap between the bottom drawer and frame. It's as if the unit is missing a middle support leg, so the center bottom frame sags. You can solve this easily with those round felt pads that are used under chair legs to balance a wobbling chair. You can think of a million things to solve this, that's why I say it's a minor issue. But what I actually did was take one of the lids from the containers and wedged it. The shorter end of the lid has these spikes/feet that makes it equal height to the actual corner feet of the unit. So if you wedge this lid in, you will eliminate the gap. It's a nice tight fit, the lid won't budge and it does not affect the sliding motion of the bottom drawer. I included pictures to show you what I mean.3. Not a big deal, but it is more comfortable sliding the drawer of the Tstak unit than the Tough unit. With the Tstak, a good portion of your fingers can go under the handle, your fingers then press a latch underneath to slide. With the Tough unit, only the tips of fingers can get underneath the handle, so it's not a good grip. You then press with your thumb to slide. This is a non issue, just an observation because I own both. It should not deter you from buying the Tough system if you need more space. The Tstaks are smaller, hence, the price difference.Here is a link to pictures of all the things I've talked about:http://s100.photobucket.com/user/thisthatandtheotherthing/library/Dewalt%20Tough%20Drawer","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYE5O3OK9LIW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8P17EC#wasThisHelpful","R1XYE5O3OK9LIW","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BTW, I just love prime shipping on a Sunday. :)Well, these boxes function fine, and they look nice. The drawers will never slide out accidentally because you need to press some sort of latch while simultaneously sliding it out. I have a bunch of L Boxes that came with Bosch tools, but needed some drawer units for quick access to things, but it costs an arm and a leg to put together a L-Boxx drawer unit. They are way over priced. So the heck with color coding in my garage, I decided to buy these Dewalt boxes.I'm knocking out a star for quality. I don't want to knock 2 stars because I do like these boxes, and I can live with the imperfections. These tstak boxes, are warped on the bottom front corners. These warped corners do not affect the functioning of the box. I ordered two of these 2-drawer units and they both came warped at the bottom corners. I know that asking for a replacement would just be a waste of time. This is how I know.. First of all, both of my boxes are warped. Secondly, just click on the 2-drawer stock photo on Amazon's listing, you can see the warp their too. Prior to purchasing, you wouldn't know it, but now that I have these in hand, and I re-exam the Amazon stock photo, I can see the warp now. So I'm sure this is just their standard quality. But like I said, it functions properly. The bottom drawers will slide without issue, and the units will stack and latch on without issues. How it will function over time? Will the warp get worse and prevent the bottom drawer from sliding out? I don't know. I'll have to monitor this closely within my return window.I made a photobucket album to show you close up pictures of what I'm talking about, here is the link: [...]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MAY 15, 2015 UPDATEClose to a year already, wow! I have one advice. If your bottom drawer can't close due to the weight of stacking, what you need to do is lift the handle as you close. By lifting the front handle, the back is lowered and then will be able to clear. How hard you have to lift depends on what kind of stuff you have in it. Not so bad really.

"This review is geared towards those thinking about purchasing this for their Amazon Fire TVs. Yes, it works! Just plug in the unifying receiver into your Fire TV and you're off running, no need to do any set-up. This won't be a replacement for your Fire TV remote, it should only be a supplement for when you're using or configuring side-loaded apps. The main interface of the Fire TV was programmed for their remote, so the mouse cursor won't just click on anything just because you hover above it. You'll need to follow the rules of the Fire remote, so going anywhere on the main interface requires using the arrow keys on the keyboard, then hitting ENTER on the keyboard. That would be equivalent to using the directional pad and select button on the Fire remote. And of course there are no speakers or mic on the keyboard, so there is no way to make voice search work. So I don't even bother using this keyboard unless I'm using my side-loaded apps. Play Store apps are designed for smartphones so you can touch, swipe, etc. So they don't work properly on the Fire TV. This keyboard is your answer!One concern I had before buying was how fast or how much ground does the cursor cover with a swipe of the touch pad? Sometimes the cursors are slow, and you can adjust the speed in your PC. But when using it with the Fire TV, you won't have any access to any keyboard settings. But as it turns out, the cursor moves very well and covers a lot of ground. It is effortless to use on my 52 inch tv. The touchpad has both left and right clickers, but I've never been comfortable using the left click on touchpads, and I guess Logitech knows there are people like me, so they added a left click button all the way on the upper left end of the keyboard. This allows you to hold the keyboard with both hands like a gamepad. Your right thumb moves the cursor around, and your left thumb can push the left click button. Brilliant!! Another thing I like about the keyboard is that there is a SLEEP button design to put your PC to sleep. Well, it works for the Fire TV too. Push it and the lights on your Fire TV goes off instantly. For those who own the Fire TV, you know it takes a while for it to go to sleep.

I prefer the more neutral colors with the white boards so that I can slap on my favorite NBA team logo. But anything equivalent to this quality/thickness/model where  the hoop can grow with your child will cost over $70 bucks. So at $40, it's a deal even if the colors are not ideal.2.) DIFFICULTY: Read the reviews, people are not kidding. YOU WILL have a hard time putting this together. You don't have to be Einstein. It's pretty easy, but the parts just don't connect easily, you'll need to use a lot of force. The manufacture knows this, that's why the instructions even advise rubbing the parts with soap and water.3.) BONUS BALL RETURN ACCESSORY: I didn't realize it because it wasn't obvious in the product pictures, but there is a ball return accessory that you attach to the rim. When the ball goes through the hoop, it will return to you. But because of this accessory, they had to design the hoop in a way that I've never seen before. The rim is actually made of 2 rims. A basketball net is looped inside the smaller rim. This smaller rim is then placed inside the bigger main rim, and the two parts are screwed together. 4 screws are provided. Sounds strange, but you'll understand why when you see it. The outer rim is used to attach the ball return accessory.4.) You will also have to weight it down, if you don't, your kids will pull down the system if they grab on the rim.  The base is a container with a cap. You can put sand, rice, etc. My son is 19 months and I fear he will pull it down. It is not stable without weight.5.) Lastly, you may think from the pictures that you can adjust from 3 to 6 ft by sliding the pole up or down. That's only true for 4 to 6 feet. My son is 19 months and currently is on the lowest level, which is 3 ft. The pole comes in 2 pieces. The base has 2 slots. The first slot is for the smaller pole which serves as the 3 ft height. The second slot behind it, allows you to store the bigger pole until you need it. When your child is ready for 4 ft and greater, you then slide the smaller pole inside the bigger pole. Take a closer look at the product pictures, at the lowest level, you'll see another pole behind the hoop. I never noticed this.In terms of price and quality, this is a 5 star.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98WENJLNWXDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GKE2N0#wasThisHelpful","R98WENJLNWXDJ","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is self explanatory, so no need for an extensive review. So I'll just mention a few things that I was pondering about prior to buying.1.) Does the tray swing with a hinge?No, you have to remove it completely, or use it. It basically clips in.2.) Can you adjust the height of the seat while your child is sitting on it?No, the adjustment is made on the underside. You'll have to flip the booster over to play with some latches. Very easy though.3.) Can you remove the back support?Yes.For $25, everything is acceptable. And we should have bought this sooner.

"First of all, I got this at Lowes for less than $14. So get off your butt sometimes, Amazon's not always the lowest price. :) I was about to come here and write a scathing 2-star review. Then I had an idea, and thought I'd share it.I cannot use this cord reel the way I imagined it because the power source plug (male) is hidden inside the core of the wheel. To give it power and to take advantage of the outlets, you need to get to the middle. And in order to get to the middle, you would have to always unreel COMPLETELY. I don't always need to reel out my extension cord completely. When I stood there looking at it at Lowes, I didn't think much about it. I thought surely, they've designed this thing around me because the world revolves around me. LOL! I thought this wheel can stay stationary with a power source always plugged in. And when you need to use your main extension cord, you just reel out the amount of cord you need. It doesn't work that way. You can't be spinning the reel, with the power source cord connected. So it has to be disconnected. You can leave it connected to the core, you just have to disconnect the other end from your wall outlet or whatever you're using. You can then reel both the main extension and power source cord up, but as others have noted, you'll have lots of tangle fun. The best way to use this, as it is currently designed, is to disconnect the power source cord completely when not in use. When you need to use your extension cord, unreel it completely, then you can plug in your power source cord.They should redesign this so that the power source plug is on the outside like one of the 4 outlets. They could make 3 of them outlets, and one of them the male power plug. So with that in mind, and a 1 ft cord laying around, a light bulb went off. Pretty simple idea and I've uploaded images, numbered 1 to 5, to the product page. If you can't see it, just click on my user-name, or this link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ref=pdp_new_c_img_link All we're doing is using the 1 ft cord as the de facto power plug. Plug in the 1 ft cord, and feed the other end out of one of the pre-designed holes. You should loop back in and come out again a second time so it's nice and tight. This cord has to be as short as possible and I think 1 ft cords are the shortest available. The reason is so it does not tangle when you're reeling and unreeling your main extension cord. Your main extension cord will reel on top of this 1 ft cord without any issues. With this set-up, you no longer have to unreel completely. Just unreel the amount of cord you need, then plug in your power source and go to work. When finish, unplug power source and reel your cord back up.Your needs may be different and you may be completely fine with how it works as is because you will always unreel 100% of your cord. But this idea is for those who do not always need to unreel their entire extension cord. Not only that, this set-up allows you to use those outlets without needing to unreel your main extension cord at all. If they had designed this with the power source plug on the outside, then this would be a 5 star product. Because I had to work at it, I'll give it 4 stars. Hope this helps out some of you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PB0QG7FJVIJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RUJFOU#wasThisHelpful","R1PB0QG7FJVIJ6","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My first shop-vac, so I don't have anything to compare it to. It cleans up my working area, so I'm happy. I drill a lot, so I mainly clean around my drill press. There are some very technical and critical reviews about suction power, but if you're not a professional contractor or something, or who does heavy duty work in the garage, then I wouldn't pay too much attention to those reviews. This vacuum should be more than enough. If this is your first, go for it, you'll like it, especially the remote control feature. Some of the reviews says the remote doesn't work properly. You have to return it if that's the case, I don't think there is any gray area. It should work! Not 10% of the time, not 50% of time, but all the time.. 100%. Mine has never failed. On the main unit, you have OFF, ON, and REMOTE. If you switch it to ""Remote,"" then the only way to trigger the vacuum is from the remote. Fairly basic stuff, and I'm happy mine works perfectly. It's just strange to me some are saying it works ""some"" of the time, but they're okay with it. I wouldn't be okay with it. The remote was the main feature why I bought this. I don't want to be going back and forth to the main unit, or dragging it around as I detail my car. Speaking of which, the detail cleaning accessory kit that Amazon recommends is not compatible. This vacuum is based on 1-7/8"" when most shop vacs are based on 2-1/2"" and detail accessories, like the one they recommend, are based on 1-1/4"".

"I had used an optical glass protector for my 60D and loved it because it allowed me to not worry about leaving the LCD screen face up all the time. But when the 70D first came out, there weren't any optical glass screens yet. So I installed a regular screen protector. It was a good screen protector, not glass, but not thin film either. This is why I'm so upset. I removed a perfectly good working screen protector to install this!! My glass was super clean since it's been protected since day one. Not a single speck of dust, but this Larmor screen just wouldn't lay properly. There were sections of air bubbles that just wouldn't seal properly. I've installed many screen protectors in my life and I know when it's user fault. When you can see dust particles in the bubbles, that's user fault, and you can usually remedy that by using some sort of sticker to pull out the dust. But in this case, there was absolutely no dirt, not a single dust particle. It is so clean that i was able to toy with this thing for close to half an hour. I kept re-positioning it, but no matter what I do the giant air pockets just wouldn't go away. Squeegee, rubbing thumbs, you name it.. nothing worked. Finally, near the end of the half hour, I see real dust that crept in. When you are re-positioning for nearly half an hour, I knew that was bound to happen.I really wanted to like this protect. The packaging was very impressive and that's why I'm giving it two stars. It came with a plastic case that houses the screen protector, and it even came with a smaller protector for the top LCD screen. If this was truly made for the 70D, then the only thing I can think of why it did not work for me was because i had previously installed a screen protector? Maybe that somehow altered the properties of the surface of my screen, but I've never heard of such thing. I've replaced worn out screen protectors on electronics before and the new ones would apply properly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHGSUS1MKG9SX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQSYYX0#wasThisHelpful","RHGSUS1MKG9SX","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like it, but I'll tell you why my wife hates it.You cannot simply open and fold like a laptop. It is some sort of transformer contraption that you will either love or hate. She hates it! But the thing that she hates the most is the opening aspect. When it's folded, it is actually clipped into place. This is very hard to articulate, but here goes.. there is a notch cut out on the keyboard, so when you fold it up, the clip fits nicely into this notch and is completely recessed. There was no design into how to easily open it. What do you do when things are shut tight with no designed mechanism to free it? The answer is you pry it open! This wasn't a big deal to me, you just pry one of the corners. Or, you can dig your fingers in the seam to pry it open. Going from the smart cover, my wife really hates this prying thing. She feels like here finger nails will scratch her Ipad inside. So the best way to open it is to use two hands and target one corner to pry it open. But watching my wife open this thing, I can see why people with small hands may hate it. She has to brace the whole thing against her tummy, or her elbows are tucked in with her arms supporting it while her fingers are prying. It's not a pretty site. But I see it as a non issue because most of the time, you'll be opening in bed, or while you're sitting at a desk in which case you can use the desk or bed for support.Now once it's open, you're presented with a contraption that will feel awkward at first, but once you get used to it, you'll think it's cool. At least, I think the guys will think it's cool. Once again, my wife is like what the heck is this ugly thing? Your Ipad is not immediately supported once open. It is protected in the case, it just can't stand on it's own yet. You'll need to slide out a hidden rail. The Ipad can rotate and stand vertically or horizontally. If you look at the product pictures, you'll see the silver circle on the case. That circle is where all the actions at, it allows you to pivot/rotate, and honestly by the looks of it, it will probably break during your ownership.Some people are saying the Bluetooth disconnects when you close it, and it's true. Once the Ipad goes to sleep, it disconnects. But it's not a hassle as some of them make it out to be. You DO NOT need to go back into your settings and pair it again. The keyboard has an on/off switch. So all you need to do is turn it off, then turn it on again and your Ipad will connect automatically. Anyway, you should turn off the keyboard when you close it. I mean you want to conserve its battery after all, right? Why are people closing this thing and not turning off their keyboard?I like it, my wife hates it. That's why I came to the conclusion that you will either love it or hate it.

The sales rep thought I was crazy for wanting 40 GB and said, ""Why do you need that much? You're set for the next 50 years.""

"First thing you need to consider is the thickness of your smartphone's case and whether or not the cut-out for the micro usb port is wide enough to allow the sony drive to clear. My Armor Gear case is very thick, and the opening for the micro usb port was not wide enough. Take a look at the flash drive picture, the base where the Sony logo appears is wider than the cut-out for my port, so it does not fully insert. It makes a connection, but it's dangerous because it's not fully inserted. A little movement and the drive will be unmounted improperly and you could lose data. So in my situation, whenever I need to plug in this drive, I would have to remove the smartphone case. Not so convenient for me. I ended up using it with an OTG cable, which kind of defeats the purpose of buying a flash drive with duo heads. Because the OTG cable serves the same purpose. So I decided to go a different route, and I ended up getting more bang for my buck. You can get a PNY Turbo 128GB flash drive for $48 right now on Amazon. Connect that to an OTG cable and you can accomplish the same task. It won't look as elegant as the Sony Microvault, but you get 4 times the capacity for just $20 more.I still give it 4 stars because it's nice. Not everyone use thick cases. You're paying a premium for the small size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36DRU8VDBGMXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWL9AJC#wasThisHelpful","R36DRU8VDBGMXE","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got mine at Rockler's, so this is not an Amazon verified purchase. Those Macbook screws are tiny, so I didn't think even the smallest extractor was small enough. But to my surprise, it worked! These bits are two sided. One side is to burnish/drill the screw, and the other side is to extract. The smallest extractor was slightly bigger than the Macbook Air screw, but the tip is pointy and small enough to dig in and drill. Once I extracted the defective screw, I was able to finally reach the trackpad and fix it. Not sure if this needs to be mentioned, or if there are even old power drills that can't go in reverse, but your drill must be capable of going reverse to extract. For over 6 months, the trackpad was not clicking, but I couldn't get to it because a stripped screw was in the way. Apple will charge $200 to $300 hundred to fix your trackpad.

"Even though this is highly rated on Amazon, there is still 25 thus far who have given it 1 star, and I truly feel sorry for them. This thing is changing my life! Your home is going to be much more organized, and that aspect alone, is worth the price of this machine. Speaking of price, I had $90 in staples rewards, so I had them match Amazon's $409 price, then applied my rewards. So my cost came out to about $345 tax included. I also sold the acroboat XI for $150 on the popular auction site. So this scanner was not expensive at all, it just takes a little leg work. Do you guys realize that the Adobe Acrobat XI bundled with this machine retails for $299? I didn't! That's probably why the machine is so expensive. Many are flipping the acrobat dvd for about $150. You don't need the acrobat xi to use this, unless you're a big fan of it, or need to have a bigger control of your PDF files, then I would sell it. For most people, home users, all you need is the organizer software that it came with and just downloand the free version of adobe reader, which 99% of you already have. Even without the various ways to reduce the cost of this scanner, would I pay over $400? Heck yeah!If you have a notebook without a DVD drive, then your set-up could take over an hour. You will need to download everything from their site. Initially, I was disappointed because I thought you could only wirelessly scan to your mobile and not your pc. But after a few updates, you'll be able to scan wirelessly to your pc as well. In terms of operation, it is so easy and so smooth. I had crinkled papers and it would never jam. Even thin receipts from years ago would be detected and never jammed. There is a learning curve for all the various ways you can scan. When you throw a batch of paper for it to scan, you can scan to 1 large multipage PDF, or tell it to generate separate pdf pages. You can also tell it to scan single or double sided. Unlike your all in one printers, the paper just goes through once and both sides have already been scanned, it's amazing! It is amazingly fast too! If you set it to the highest quality, it will be slow but still much faster than your all in one printers. But you really don't need the highest quality, you can set it to the second highest quality and it'll be super fast. When you're finish, you just close the lid, it'll automatically shut down. When you want to scan, open the lid, your pc will wireless detect it. Mobile scanning is a breeze too with their provided app which you can download at the play store. I've tried it and it's great, but I like the control of my pc, so I'm very happy that you can wireless scan to pc.You'll need to suck it up and just start organizing all that paper. The initial work will take a lot of effort because I'm sure you have years, if not decades worth of paper in boxes. But once you're caught up, then all future incoming papers can go straight to scanner and shredder. Just do them as they come, don't ever let them pile up again. And with the simplicity, convenience and speed of this scanner, I don't think papers piling up will ever be an issue again. Nobody enjoys using those all in one printers to scan. Mine is in the garage, so there was never any motivation and to think about how slow it would have taken, and the difficulties of duplex scanning.. forget about it!Lastly, a suggestion on how to go about scanning.... The wireless feature, whether to mobile or pc is not practical when you begin. It is only practical when you're all caught up. For example, lets say you're caught up, and you now only have to worry about incoming mail. You get your new auto insurance policy, and your scanner is in the kitchen, but your notebook is upstairs. It's okay, you just scan it and go shred the policy. When you have time, and you're next to your notebook, you can then rename it and put it in the proper folder. When you begin, you can't be running back and forth, your notebook should be right next to the scanner connected via usb for the fastest speed. You can then rename your files as you scan. I do not advise scanning everything to one folder, then going back to rename and organize later because you'll have to click on each pdf file to remind you what it was. That's not good strategy. Rename them as you scan them. I had my notebook connected via usb to the scanner in the middle of my bedroom floor. Files and boxes all around me, hefty trash bags for papers that can be tossed without shredding, and a pile for papers that will need to be shredded. But all the work has paid off, I'm caught up and now and my scanner can be placed anywhere. New papers coming in will be scanned wirelessly and tossed immediately. You will appreciate the extra space in your house, and how awesome it feels to locate a file in your notebook, instead of rummaging through your folders and boxes. This game changer now sits on my nightstand next to my bed. I'm also planning to archive our old photos, and will update this review on how scanning photos worked out (if I have time).Oh yeah, when you go paperless..

For those not so strong, like me, if you don't mind looking like an idiot for a few seconds, then you'll be okay too. Because the faster you can hold the luggage steady (off the ground), the faster it will register. So as you can imagine, strong people will have no issues.

"I was using a PVC trash frame variation, but it didn't hang on the edge of the table. So I was curious of this product. Nice! Glad i bought one. Not much to review, the pictures speak for themselves. Your trash bag will hang against the edge and you just slide you trash into it. We have outdoor parties from time to time using those long folding tables. These were perfect. I got mine at Lowes for less than $10. So look at your local hardware store before paying $19.45 + $9 shipping, that's highway robbery.10/27/2014 UPDATE:------------------I now own THREE of these! Love them. The first one I got was for less than $10 bucks at my Lowes, but I never had any luck finding it again. Whenever they drop on Amazon to about $15 with prime shipping, I would grab one.

"Our Sony Bravia actually has enough inputs, but they are on the side of the TV, so it looks ugly. Not only that, the HDMI input didn't play nicely with our new Tivo Roamio. You know when you select an input source, the screen would flicker and the HDMI input info would display. Well, it kept doing this recently even when we're not changing input. We thought it may have been faulty HDMI ports or cables. This switch box solved the problem! We thought we had to manage an extra remote now, not a big deal, but it turns out that the Kinivo brand is in the Harmony list of supported devices. When you go to add a device in your Harmony software, it is under AMPLIFIER - AUDIO/VIDEO SWITCH - KINIVO, then type in your model, 501BN.We also have a Chromecast connected to this.

"The 3.6v ZipSnip's main competitor is the Skil 2352-01 (3.6 volt) cutter, however, Skil has a newer version out! As of October 19, Lowes is the only place that carries the newer Skil 2352-02 (4.0 volt) version. Since the Rockwell Zipsnip has dropped down to $20, I picked up both for testing. $40 for the newer Skil Cutter and $20 for the Zipsnip. Here are the results...The Skil 4.0 has a no load rotational speed of 240 RPM, If someone can confirm via comments below what the 3.6 version is, that would be great. But I'm sure it will be 240 rpm also. The ZipSnip has a no load rotational speed of 260 RPM. You guys can find this info on the underside of the tool.ADVANTAGE ZIPSNIP (normal thickness): I tested the cutters with normal cardboard boxes that I get from shopping too much online from places like Amazon. Due to the larger rotational speed, the ZipSnip wins when you're cutting normal boxes with the usual thickness. The Skil cuts fine, but the ZipSnip was slightly zippier. I felt this way prior to knowing about the RPM speeds. I started looking for an explanation, so I looked for info on the underside of the tools, and it confirmed my feelings.ADVANTAGE SKIL 4.0 (unusually thick card-boards): So where would you feel the advantage of the extra voltage from Skil? The answer is when you're cutting thicker material. I folded a regular amazon shipping box to 3 layers. The ZipSnip would snag, and I would need to keep re-hitting the trigger to get it going again. With the Skil, it was also a strain, but the blades never ever snag, they keep spinning, and you just have to use your strength to cut through. Get the Skil if you work with thicker materials often.ADVANTAGE ZIPSNIP (GRIP): The grip on the Rockwell ZipSnip feels much better. Because the safety button is at the top where your thumb will naturally press it. Your other 4 fingers then presses the base trigger. You don't need to keep your thumb on the safety once you've pressed it, but like I said, the design is so logical, there is no where else for your thumb to go, so you'll end up not letting go of the safety button, which is okay. Or, your thumb will just slide to the side. The SKIL's layout is a bit strange. The safety switch is available on each side. I think it's design for both left and right handers and the intent is for you to use your index finger to press the button on the outer side, but you'll see, your finger length and the button placement will not be a perfect match, thus, sometimes I had to re-grip after pressing it.ADVANTAGE ZIPSNIP (PRICE): Right now the ZipSnip is only $20 and will stay there for a long time since Lowes shows that it will stay at that price for the rest of the year, so I'm certain Amazon will keep the price at $20 too. The only reason I could think of choosing Skil over Rockwell is because Skil is a Bosch company. Maybe their tools have better longevity? But at $20, you can buy a few ZipSnips and take care of that issue. You can also get replacement blades for the ZipSnip at $10 for 2, but once again at $20, why not just buy a few units. LOL!Lastly, people who give bad reviews for either one are simply expecting TOO MUCH. If you need to cut up cardboard boxes like the shipping boxes you get from shopping online like Amazon, then either cutters are sweet! I make and resize boxes and have been cutting with shears by Fiskars made specifically for cardboard. Those shears were great, but when you do as many as I do, your hands will start to feel it because you still need to add pressure. With these cutters, they go through like butter. People who want to zip through the thickest materials are expecting way too much. If you want that ability, then spend the money and buy the BOSCH PROFESSIONAL GUS 10.8V. You can find that cutter on Amazon United Kingdom. Using 10.8V batteries, that thing has a no load RPM of up to 700.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IB1JHFKTAZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BEAOSK#wasThisHelpful","R20IB1JHFKTAZV","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Works, but you know the instructions actually recommend you use a power drill and a 1/8 bit if you have one, so I didn't even touch the hole puncher. My wife is too busy, so I don't have a set of helping hands, and believe me you'll need them. So I busted out my collection of clamps. I measured and cut the pieces I needed on my workbench holding down the plastic with clamps cause it will want to coil up. I also clamp them into place in the railings. When you have clamps holding down the plastic nice and securely, drilling holes will be much easier. Using the hole punch relegates you to punching holes near the edges, but using a power drill, you can make holes in the middle and add more zip ties for additional security.My most important advice would be to try and cover as much area as you can with one piece. Don't cut up sections just for the sake of cutting up sections. Cut only when you're forced to. The reason is because your baby will be very exploratory and when they can no longer grip the rails, they will soon bang on the plastic and their hands will ultimately find the seams or edge of the sections. These edges can be rough depending on how smooth your cutting skills are. If you have seams, I would tape it down with clear tape, making an ugly thing even more uglier. LOL! But safety of our babies come first! Actually, there is a way to hide the seams of two sections coming together, and that is to let them coil into the rails. The right side coils over, and the left section coils under just like locking your fingers together over and under.  But you will use up a lot of extra plastic by doing this.This is easy to install, but tedious folks! You'll be spending several hours if you care about precision and want the sheets properly stretched tight. Less than an hour if you just want to get it up and don't care about precise cuts or looseness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KG4QS6YL5B8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000E2DIE#wasThisHelpful","R1KG4QS6YL5B8Q","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those products that I've been wavering on for the longest time, because it's a very doable DIY project. You can build one easily. But ultimately, I know it just wouldn't look as nice, and I like nice looking things, so I bought it! Instructions aren't the best in the world, but it doesn't take a genius to figure it out either. To save some of you any aggravation, here's a tip. The arm bar is shape like a U. On one end of the U is a pre-drilled screw hole with a screw already inserted. You will see the ""spool holder"" already attached also, and the screw is preventing it from sliding out. I don't know the proper lingo, so lets just call it spool holder. Anyway, you need to unscrew the screw and let the spool holder slide out. You will then slide this same side, now with the empty screw hole, into the base where it will line up with another screw hole, and it will be secured in place with a screw that has a knob for easy tightening and releasing. The spool holder actually belongs on the side without the screw holes. There is a tightening mechanism on the spool holder that allows it to stay in place.I suspect Proxxon put the spool holder there for transport reasons only because it does not belong on that end. They don't even mention it in their instructions. They could actually avoid confusion by packaging the spool holder separately. Because initially, what you'll do if you didn't read my review, is leave the spool holder alone because after all, it's installed there by the factory. You'll then insert the side with no screw hole into the base and stand there like an early Neanderthal, scratching your head, looking at the instructions, looking back at the base, scratch your head, look at instructions again, make grunting noises, etc. That's what I did. LOL!Anyway, in terms of function, it's great. It heats up very fast. Something strange happened though. It stopped heating. I don't know if it's because I used it for too long a period without resting, or if it's because the tension needed to be adjusted. Because after tinkering with the tension of the wire, it heated up again. I don't want to return this if that's just a common quirk with these things. But I'll be definitely using it like crazy for the next 15 days to see whether or not I need to return my unit for a replacement. The fence is a great accessory for steady straight cuts, as well as miters. The spool can be sled back so the wire is at an angle, this is of course, for angle cuts. The whole thing is so versatile.

"It's all about simplicity. This is a no brainer for those who don't have anything remotely similar. If your tv is ""dumb,"" and you don't own a roku, apple tv, ps3, etc. Then this is a no brainer! Even if you have one of those stand alone products with the netflix and youtube apps, I'll tell you why you should still buy it. Products allowing you to play netflix or youtube on the big screen are not new, but that's not the point of the chromecast. The chromecast is all about the ""HOW.""Because of this dongle, I'm watching more and more netflix and youtube on the big screen. You know why? Because chromecast is the closest thing to feeling like the app is a part of your regular cable line-up. In the past, If I'm browsing and messing around on youtube, I do not bother to fire up the PS3, and if I own a google tv or apple tv, I probably wouldn't bother turning on those boxes either. It's just faster to browse with your keyboard and just watch the clips on your notebook. In the past, watching Netflix on the big screen is something I had to prepare for. I have to browse and search on my smartphone or notebook first, add the movie that I want to watch to my que, then turn on the ps3. Because highlighting letters with your controller pad is stupid and impractical. And the funny thing is my TivoHD has a netflix app too, but highlighting letters on the tivo remote was even more excruciating and worse than the ps3.Hence, this is why the ""HOW"" part of the chromecast is so awesome. You're already browsing and searching with your smartphone or tablet, now just hit play. No need to power up anything else. No need to buy mouses, air-mouses or media center keyboards for your roku or ps3. YOUR SMARTPHONE DOES IT ALL!!!! That's the point folks! No extra mouse, keyboards, or accessories cluttering your coffee table. And you can still use your smartphone to do anything else you want. The chromecast is processing the video from the cloud. Your smartphone is free! That's why I say it's the closest thing to feeling like Netflix and Youtube are a part of my cable line-up. I can get to these apps quickly! No need to power on anything else or fetch keyboards and controller pads. That's why we hardly watch youtube on the big screen. The hassle is not worth it for short videos. With chromecast, we've been watching more youtube. When a few of my family members are sitting around, I always take the opportunity to cast a few funny videos, or share interesting videos I've seen. In the past, would I bother to ask everyone to huddle around my notebook, fire up the PS3, or hdmi out my notebook to the big screen? NOPE. Another cool thing is that anyone with a smartphone can start casting videos too. You can show a funny video, and your friend or family can try and top you with a funnier video from their smartphone. This is something that you cannot experience with any other product out there.Of course, they need to develop this and add more apps. As it is with just Netflix and Youtube, it's already worth the $35. When they develop more apps, especially an app that will allow us to play our own videos and view photos from the cloud, then this dongle will be the bargain of the century. Right now, you can play local videos by loading the video into your pc's chrome browser, then cast the tab. But this uses your computer's processor and if you view in full-screen, then you can't do anything else with your computer. I consider this a ""work-around"" and I hope they give us a dedicated app soon. Also, this ""work-around"" is not possible on your smartphone or tablet. Even if it was possible, it would use your phone's processor and eat up its battery. So those complaining about this, just be patient and wait for a real dedicated app.We are creatures of habit, and this chromecast happens to be very compatible with my habits. I understand my review may not sound appealing to someone else who has different habits. But if you can relate to some of the things I just wrote about, then buy it, you won't regret it. If you don't like using your Smartphone for everything, then don't buy it. But then I would have to ask, why did you buy a ""smart"" phone? I think you would be missing out on it's capabilities. You paid up the wazoo for your smartphone. Use it for something else other than texting! I read a review where the person said they rather have a dedicated remote because they don't always have the smartphone on them. Seriously, think of what you're saying folks! If I called you right now, you wouldn't pick up the phone because it's placed somewhere far away? I don't know anyone who stashes away their cell-phone to the point, they can't hear it or reach it. C'mon, stop resisting! This chromecast is awesome and it simply makes sense! The more you resist, the more you don't make sense. LOL!-------------SET-UP TIPS--------------If phone set-up isn't working, go to notebook. Vice versa, if notebook isn't working, then set-up on phone.-When it fails and says TRY AGAIN, close the app.-Disconnect router, reconnect router. (sometimes, magical things happen when you disconnect. The router just figures itself out.)-Disconnect chromecast power, reconnect chromecast.-Start Set-up App again and try it again.I have two chromecast and my first set-up was one shot and smooth. My second chromecast took some fiddling, but I did those steps above and it connected. I also took it to a friends home and tried it on his network. When it failed, I did those same steps above and it worked again. I highly recommend doing these disconnecting/reconnecting tips before spending hours on the phone with a rep.-----------------------9/11/2013 UPDATE TIPS------------------------In my review I mentioned that your notebooks is rendered useless when you cast full screen to your big tv using the chrome browser. I learned that if you hit the ALT+TAB buttons, you can regain your notebook while the tv is still casting your movie in full screen. Awesome! Keep in mind, this is still a ""work-around."" It's not ideal to watch a movie because the streaming is crappy and your PC is processing. Ideally you want the Google folks to create more apps like Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. Casting from the browser is ideal for photos, presentations, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for movies.-To cast Amazon prime in your chrome browser (from your notebook of course), uninstall microsoft silverlight. Next time you play an Amazon movie, it'll ask if you want to install silverlight or use adobe flash. Choose adobe flash, and enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS0V5WXHXCDUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DR0PDNE#wasThisHelpful","RS0V5WXHXCDUU","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is not an Amazon verified purchase because I got mine at my local Lowes for $8.68. So check out your local store before paying $15.These jaws are just what the doctor ordered! To make sure my objects are not scratched, I used to wrap them with cloth, rubber, etc. This is making my job much easier!! And because the objects I work with are round, it would spin free from my vise and get all scratched up because I used to be afraid of putting too much pressure on them. These jaws solved so many issues for me! I now can apply a lot of pressure without worrying about it marring. And Its rubber traction and cut-outs prevent round objects from spinning. My vise is only 3"" wide, this thing is 6"" so it looks kind of weird if your vise is not exactly 6"". I think you can actually just cut to size. But I'm not going to do that. The different grooves and cut-outs are useful for different tasks and I can slide the jaws and line it up to what I want to use. So the fact that it's magnetic, makes it perfect.

"Like many, I would have given this product a 1 star review too, but something told me not to do it. Something told me this is one of those stupid things where you realize it is you who is the dummy and not the product. The way this organizer works is that there is a flap that you slide under your bed, and the unit is supposed to stay in place. But like many have reported, once you add items and weight to it, the flap starts to slide out. There is not enough friction or pressure from the bed. I figured I could use some sort of large clip against the side of the rail, Velcro, double sided tape, etc. But decided to take a closer look at the product itself. I found out that at the end of the flap hidden inside the fabric is a thin bar. Well I felt this bar before, but never paid much attention to it. I just thought it's there so the flap won't be completely flimsy. I decided that there might be a purpose to it. I had a hunch. So I bent it and sure enough, I was right!! It's bendable wire/bar!! I think the purpose is for you to create traction for your bed. I bent a few V-grooves, you know like the peaks and valleys of a Chinese hand fan. Now when you place it under your bed, you've got traction. I've added weight to the organizer and it stays in place.Now there are no instructions. Makes me wonder if my discovery is an unintentional benefit. If the intention of the ""hidden"" bendable bar is to allow you to create traction, then why were there no instructions? So many people are giving this product 1 star reviews because this feature, intentional or not, is not obvious. In any case, follow my tip and you'll get good use out of this organizer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R115O79K8VQRIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019S3MCU#wasThisHelpful","R115O79K8VQRIG","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Whereas the switching for the Trendnet version is on the unit itself, so if you want to hide all the cabling, you'll need to bend down under your desk every time to switch. The price is approx the same, but I would have paid an extra $10 for this IOGEAR's cabling system alone.Another interesting thing that may be just unique to my situation, but my desktop has two monitor outputs and I have a dual display set-up. I use this switch to share my notebook with one of the monitors, so at any given time, I could have 3 screens going, the two from the desktop and the notebook screen. Well, when I used the Trendnet TK-209K, the monitor that was not connected to the KVM did not know how to shut-off when it was time to power off. I would have to manually turn it off. When using this IOGEAR, everything shuts off as it should.Here's a tip... The unit only has 2 available USB ports. It's meant for you to plug in your mouse and keyboard usb. If you have a Logitech unifying receiver that controls both keyboard and mouse with just 1 usb, then that will free up a port. And even better yet, it works with hubs! And that's what I used. This way, you can share many more peripherals besides just keyboard and mouse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8SK1N2FVL73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002K0TU2C#wasThisHelpful","R2O8SK1N2FVL73","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SOCKET REDUCER are the two key words folks!""Medium to Candelabra"" can be confusing. If you're looking from the SOCKET point of view, which you should, then it means what it says, which is reducing the medium socket to candelabra size.Some people are looking at it from the BULB point of view, thinking that they are reducing the medium base to candelabra size, so that the can then thread it into a candelabra socket.I will buy more!

"My Desktop has a video card that has two monitor outputs, one is VGA out and the other is DVI-I out. They are each hooked up to a monitor. I wanted to hook up this KVM switch in order to share the keyboard, mouse and one of the Monitors with my notebook. So I used the Desktop's VGA port. The switch works as it should. The notebook was able to share the VGA monitor. The notebook monitor and vga monitor can be on at the same time, it can duplicate or extend as expected.I also have a Macbook Air that I tried to test out. But as you know, it doesn't have a VGA port. I had a thunderbolt to VGA cable, but the VGA end was male. You need a female end because the Trendnet VGA cable is also male. So you would need something like this: Patuoxun Thunderbolt Mini Display-port to VGA Cable Adapter For Apple MacBook Pro Air iMAC with Cable TieOne last thing. No matter what you're hooking up, you need an available USB port because the Trendnet VGA cable is a 2 in 1 cable. It also has a USB that you need to connect to your computer. Because this KVM switch is USB powered. There is no power adapter.UPDATE 5/7/2013---------------I'm knocking a star off because I didn't know about the IOGEAR GCS72U. I wrote a review on that as well. It has made me realized that the Trendnet design is inferior. The cable management by the IOGEAR is far superior due to the remote feature which allows you hide all the ugly cables away. Both cost approx the same, that's why I have to knock off a star for the Trendnet. I'm keeping both though because I have another set-up in the garage. So I'll be back to update both reviews regarding each version's longevity.

"My video card has a VGA out and a DVI-I out. I've been only using the VGA output. Found an extra VGA monitor laying around and wanted a dual monitor set-up, so I needed a DVI-I to VGA. This worked perfectly. When it comes to computing, disregard people who make definitive statements like DON'T BUY THIS, or THIS DOES NOT WORK. If you know anything about computers, then you know there are so many variables as to why things don't work such as old hardware, firmware, drivers, etc. You need to trial and error yourself and don't take other people's word for it. Especially when you buy from Amazon, if it doesn't work out, you can return it.Just make sure you know the difference between DVI-I and DVI-D. This cable is for DVI-I. Do what I did, if you're not sure. Go to yahoo search engine and search DVI-I vs DVI-D. Then click on images. The very first image explains it all. Then go to you computer and take a look at your connection and see which one you have. This is probably one of the reasons why people say the cable doesn't work.

"Cuts like butter! I'm new with jigsaws so cutting curves is still tough. The minor imperfections has to do with the top light button and the back speed dial. I saw a youtube review of this jigsaw by toolselecttv, you should check it out, it's very informative. Anyway, the user said the light button doesn't feel good when he presses it. I thought it could be just an isolated imperfection on his unit. But now that I own this, I know what he means. When you press the button, there is no click, you'll only know it's working when the light turns on. Sometimes I have to dig my nails into the button to turn it on. Another minor imperfection is the speed dial, you scroll to select your speed. Well, the scroll doesn't give a solid click either. It's a very subtle quiet click. But I'm lucky that I do not have the metal shoe issue. Mine slides in and out with no problem. I'm also lucky in that I got this from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $203. It was labeled as ""LIKE NEW."" When I got it, it looked like it was never even used. There is one right now in Amazon Warehouse for $264, same ""LIKE NEW"" label. For me, it was $203 so I guess I got lucky getting it on a very low price fluctuation day. Or, did they make a mistake and priced it as if it had no L Boxx?

"This is not a verified purchase review since I bought mine elsewhere. But just wanted to say this is exactly what you want. There seems to be confusion among people. Some are not happy because they think they should be getting the blue label 950mah version. Well, that version is faulty and many users, including me, have experienced the swelling/bloating issue. You'll need to pry out your battery. Here's a tip to pry out your battery... Remove the battery cover. Cut an expired credit card in half lengthwise and slide it under the battery that's still stuck. Using the credit card and some jiggling, try and slide the battery out as much as possible. Then use an A clamp to grip the entire remote. Make sure the point of pressure is resting on the exposed part of the battery. Cut a cardboard paper or get some cloth to layer the side with the buttons so your clamp doesn't scratch your remote. Once you have the A clamp on properly, just slide out your remote. The clamp will be holding firmly onto the battery while the entire remote will be sliding out. It won't slide out entirely, but just enough so you can undo the A clamp and remove the battery manually.If you contact Logitech, they will most likely send you a white label 930mah version since this one does not have the swelling issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DVJRMGFDY4W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TX2N14#wasThisHelpful","R3DVJRMGFDY4W4","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is geared towards 7 1/4 Circular Saw owners who want to add a laser guide.I love my DWE575SB circular saw, and wanted to add this laser to make it the perfect saw. Why are lasers only featured in budget circular saws for like less than $70? The more expensive ones do not have a laser guide, strange. Anyway, this did not fit my saw. It all boils down to how your lower blade guard is designed, and whether or not it's close to the outer center washer where you mount the blade. This laser guide is basically a washer. You remove your manufacture one and the laser guide serves as your new outer washer. The problem for me is that the design of my lower blade guard is a bit fancy schmancy. A part of it protrudes out like a wave. It serves no purpose, other than for aesthetics. This protrusion is close to the center, so it gets in the way of the laser guide. It does not get in the way of the original manufacture washer because that's much smaller than the laser guide. I can make room for the laser guide if I break off or saw off that protrusion. At this point, I'm not willing to do that yet because I don't know how well the laser guide works. This laser is going back.I have uploaded a picture explaining this. I believe I'm the 6th picture. http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo1FKM3OYDDQ18V/B000CRE7Q4/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SAUPGKNMFHU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CRE7Q4#wasThisHelpful","R1SAUPGKNMFHU9","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first so I have no experience and nothing to compare it to. However, I can't imagine why anyone would choose one without the electric brake. Currently, the DWE575SB is only $10 more than the DWE575 and absolutely worth it. Power tools, especially saws, are dangerous and the sooner you can have the blade stop, the better. Finished my first project today, just a basic stand, and the cutting was smooth. I ordered a Diablo 60t blade, but they're backorderd, so I got a Dewalt 60t. Your saw will come with a 18t blade. If you need fine smooth cuts, buy a blade with more teeth, 60t was fine for me. Once again, I just love how once I'm done cutting, the blades will stop spinning almost immediately. I watch a lot of youtube videos and I see people waiting for the blade to stop. The SB edition is totally worth it! I use this saw in conjunction with the Kreg KMA2600 Square-Cut, a tool that is invaluable. Lastly, I chose this saw because of the weight. It's considered the lightest in the market. Still feels heavy to me, so if you're a person of smaller stature like me, you should definitely get this saw. It will still feel heavy to you, so imagine what other saws will feel like.Make sure you clamp your workpiece. I use a Rockwell Jawhorse. I'm a newbie I did so much reading and preparation. My advice to beginners is read the circular saw manual, watch youtube videos about kickbacks, buy all the necessary accessories like sawhorses, goggles, earplugs, clamps, etc. and just be prepared. Search youtube for circular saw accident videos as well, they will sober you up. It will scare the crap out of you, which is a good thing because then you're not going to rush through things. Being scared will force you to do everything right. Will force you to read the manual and understand and be aware of all the dangers. Once you're educated and get through your first project, the circular saw won't be so intimidating. You'll be searching for more projects!Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised that a nice Dewalt carrying bag was included. A reviewer for the DWE575 said there was no carrying case in his list of cons. The word ""case"" and ""bag"" are often used interchangeably, so I'm not sure if he got a bag and wanted a hard case, or if he got nothing. I'm thinking the DWE575 doesn't come with anything otherwise, he would have mentioned the carrying ""bag."" Point is for $10 more, you're getting the carrying bag and the electric brake feature. It's a no brainer!This is not a verified purchase review because I got mine at Lowes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LIHUTEXLON9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QUZ16A#wasThisHelpful","R21LIHUTEXLON9","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have not shopped for monitors for about a decade. The last time I bought a monitor, LCDs and CRTs were still pretty mixed in the market. My 19"" Sony LCD cost about $600. I cannot believe prices of LCD/LED monitors now. WOW! I got this baby for $109 during this past weekends Black Friday lightning deals. You should have no problems hooking this up because I'm running an old school Dell Insprion 9100 with Windows XP and this monitor booted up without issues. It will prompt you to install the latest drivers, which is included in the CD. The picture is awesome, but I have to admit, I'm not a videophile. I'm not picky and for less than $150, how can you be picky? This thing has all the connections you need including HDMI. I did my research this past weekend and so many sub $200 monitors do not have HDMI. There is no VESA mount, so DO NOT buy this if you need to mount. I bought this for my garage, so it did not need to be the highest quality and for $109 it was a no brainer. If you simply want a nice picture, more screen real estate, HDMI, and you do not care to mount, you can't go wrong.

"If you ""KNOW"" how to use a pvc cutter then please disregard the 1 star review by the other poster (JR VALDES). He says it may be best for 1/2 inch pipes? He's obviously using it incorrectly. It is designed for up to 2 inch pipes and that's what I cut with EASE. Based on his review, you can tell he's a rookie with this tool. His comment about how you need to use a lot of force and how it doesn't cut all the way, so he has to twist it off at the end is classic newbie mistake. He's probably making the mistake of using it like a scissor. If you use this tool like a scissor or garden snipper, then it won't work. This is a PVC cutter. You open it up as wide as possible and line up the pipe inside its jaw. Now you slowly close the handles making sure the blade is lining up where you want to cut. At this point, newbies will force it all the way thinking it's a scissor. You cannot do that, you need to pull the handle apart again, and the mechanism winds up, you'll hear a click. That means it's ready for you to close the handle again, after you close the handle as much as you can, you pull the handle apart to rewind, always wait till you hear the click, then close it again, pull apart, close again, pull apart, close again. As much as you need to, get the picture? It's hard to describe in words, but it is the opposite effect of a scissor. If you pull the handles of a scissor apart, then obviously there is nothing left to grip your object, it falls out. With a ratcheting jaw, each time you pull apart the handle, the object is still held in place, and each time you close, the jaw just keeps biting in further and further, and it doesn't take a lot of strength, especially if you're using the floor for support. By using the floor to brace one side of the handle, I'm free to grip the upper handle with both hands, and simply push down. Then pull apart, push down, pull apart, push down, etc. It gets easier with each crank. It takes me two or three quick cranks and the 2 inch pipe is sliced perfectly, just like butter. It is awesome, I just finished building a stand for a workbench. I can not imagine getting through my project without this cutter.I got mine at Home Depot for $30.

"I was surprised that it came with a case, and it's a nice case too! The flashlight itself is of very high quality, and has a nice weight to it. Take a look at the COAST logo, not sure if you can tell in the picture, but you should know that the logo is printed on a flat surface. They indented that section and flattened it. Why does this matter? Because on the other side is the same flat indentation, only it is left blank. So if you choose to, you can have someone's name engraved on a plate and stick it on there. Just make sure the plate has the same measurement. Or, have the name printed in white directly on the surface just like the Coast logo.

"All tablets do the same thing, so why not get one that's also an advanced universal remote? Not only that, there are facets of playstation integrated in this tablet. You can connect your wireless dual-shock controller and play play-station games. Way cool! Like I said, all tablets virtually do the same thing, so I'm going to focus on what makes this Tablet special, the Universal Remote feature! My review my also help you decide if you want to spend the extra money to buy the new Xperia version for the macro functionality of the remote. In case you don't know what that means, all it means is that it has the ability to turn on a set of commands with one button. Like the really expensive Harmony remotes by Logitech. With one push of a button, it will turn on your tv, audio system, your blu-ray player and even change your tv to the correct input, your audio system to the correct input, etc. Having used the Sony S Tablet's remote and having owned the $250 Harmony 900 by Logitech, I now realize the macro feature is an overkill luxury if I keep both gadgets. Here's why...You don't have to register a bunch of remotes! For example, before owning the tablet S, I thought I had to register my Samsung's remote to power on and off the tv, the tivo remote to control the tivo and the Sony audio system's remote to control volume. So I imagine when I'm using the Tablet, I would have to switch between three different remote apps. But luckily, I'm happy to report that's not the case!! You can program a bunch of remotes into just one remote lay-out. So in my case, I simply register one remote, the TIVO. So then it shows me the tivo lay-out. The power on the tivo lay-out does not turn on my Samsung, it's useless because you never want to turn off the tivo either. But here's the cool thing.. You can specifically re-program each button to make it learn a new command or learn a new command from a different remote. So I program the volume functions and the power functions with my Samsung remote. If you've ever own a tivo, you know that you have to program the remote to control your tv. So we're basically doing the same thing here. We're teaching the Tivo remote on the Sony S Tablet to learn some of the Samsung commands like power, input, volume, muting, etc. So with just one remote lay-out on my Sony S Tablet, I can control my Samsung TV and my Tivo. Lets take it a step further, my Sony Audio system has to be turned on and has to be at a certain input. With the same Tivo lay-out, you can even create new buttons, you can name your new buttons too. So I can simply create whatever buttons I need from my Sony audio System's remote. I only need three commands, the power button, the input selector and the volume control. Actually, what I did was even better, to keep the lay-out clutter free, Instead of creating new buttons, I re-programed and rename some of the tivo buttons that I don't use. So now those buttons control my Sony Audio system. You want to be as clutter free as possible because if the lay-out doesn't have enough room, then it'll automatically generate a 2nd page for your remote. So then you'll have to swipe the screen to get to page 2 of your remote. I like to keep all buttons on one page, and with a 9.4"" screen, you'll have plenty of real estate. So with just one Tivo layout and with just one page, I control my Samsung LCD, my TIVO, and my Sony Audio system. How hard is it to tap a few power and input buttons? I have sold my Harmony 900.You can also create a remote from scratch, but my advice is to at least register one remote for each activity (Activity is harmony remote lingo). Which ever remote that is most important, in my case, it's the tivo. Why? Because then I don't have to learn every single button like the numbers 1 to 9. It would be tedious! Register your most important remote, then customize it and add other remotes to the same lay-out for that activity. If you have another activity that uses three entirely different remote, then do the same thing. Register the most important one, then customize around it. For example, you might want to take your tablet upstairs to your bedroom. In that case, it's a whole new set of remotes. So you create another lay-out for your Bedroom activity. That's essentially what those high end Harmony remotes do, they program different activities. But with macro, for each activity, they have the ability to press one button to power up multiple machines. With Sony Tablet S, for each activity, you'll need to tap a few power buttons. No biggie. Unless your activity involves powering up 15 machines and changing 10 inputs. LOL! Then I can see the benefit of macro functionality, otherwise, I've come to realize it's an overkill luxury.At the current price of $350 on Amazon, I would just fork over the extra money and get the Xperia and tegra 3 processor. But another thing to keep in mind is that the Xperia is not playstation certified. So $350 may be a good deal especially if the certification means a lot to you, but if you can get the Sony S Tablet on a sale elsewhere for under $300, then it's especially worth it. Which is what I did, that's why this review is not a verified purchase review.Enjoy!--------------------------------------9/30/2012 updateMy whole review is about how you don't need macros because the new Xperia comes with macros and originally, the Sony Tablet S did not. But today, there was a software updated that added Macros functionality to the Sony Tablet S. So if you love this Tablet, it just got better! Macros means with one button, you can power up multiple devices. So there you go! The only thing you need to decide now is whether or not the extra money is worth it for the new processor of the Xperia.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G47OKSOL5HQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FXYJZY#wasThisHelpful","R2G47OKSOL5HQG","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simplicity!!! A screwdriver is all you need. We had our eye on the John Louis system which listed a SAW as a part of the list of tools we need, a pencil & leveler, and by reading the reviews, lots of screws and anchors cause there will be a lot of drilling into the wall. We said forget about it!!! The Seville Classic is a quality heavy steel set that is free-standing, no need to drill into walls. You'll only need a screw driver to tighten the hanging rods on the system. This system is not elegant wood, but it's not $100 more either. You save money, your wall, and lots of labor hours.To save yourself from a little anxiety, you should know that when you open up the box, there will be these black plastic end caps falling out all over the place. I was worried because the first thing I like to do when assembling is to make sure all the pieces in the box are complete. I was immediately worried when these plastic caps were all over the place, not only that, some of them were warped and broken. I thought, ""Dang, I'm going to have to call Seville for some replacement parts."" It turns out that these end caps have nothing to do with the system. They were fitted on the shelves to minimize the clanking of the metal during transit. There will be a bag with plastic caps that you will be using, but these are neatly inside a sealed bag, so you'll know the difference. The loose ones, don't worry about them. When you open up your package and these caps start falling out.. Don't fret, you won't be using them.As for the closet system itself, it works! They even come with earthquake safety straps, but for us, this system is going inside a closet behind sliding glass doors. There is no need for us to use it. The plastic liners for each shelf was a nice finishing touch. It is pretty sturdy, and it feels like quality because it's made of steel and it's heavy. My closet depth is 24 inches, so I wish the shelves were bigger, at least 18 inches square would have been ideal. This system is barely 14 inches, you need to round up to call it 14 inches. The John Louis system that I mentioned above is 12 inches deep. So I guess the puny depth is normal for these types of products? Anyway, take a close look at the pictures, the stock picture showing the empty rack makes it look like the top shelf is one long piece, but it's not. Take a look at the picture with clothes, when the rods are expanded, you have a hole in the middle. This is important because if you're fitting this system into a closet like us, and it's expanded and fills the whole closet from end to end, then you'll find that passing/stacking storage boxes to the very top shelf is impossible, you'll need to use the hole/space in the middle. Credit the Seville team for thinking ahead!! Which brings me back to the depth issue. I think they made these shelves 14 inches to help our maneuverability in the closet. But even at 14 inches, I still had to use the middle space to stack boxes to the top. So whether it's 14, 18, or 20 inches, it wouldn't have mattered, you'll still need to use the middle space to stack boxes to the top, so why not make the shelves bigger? I think 18"" would have been perfect. And for those who are using it free-standing outside of a closet, then bigger would definitely be ideal.Anyway, I still love this system and giving it a 5 stars! Like I said, I could use more depth, but it's especially acceptable in our situation because it's installed in the nursery room. How big are baby clothes anyway? :) Lastly, you don't need to follow the instructions to a T. You can adjust these shelves to any height you want. You can adjust the rods anywhere you want. Some people complain their clothes are touching the floor, well don't follow the instructions to a T! Move your rod up a few notches! However, you'll need to plan it out first. Adjustments are difficult and it'll take some strength and jiggling to remove the shelves once you slide them in. So plan out exactly how you want the shelves to look in terms of distance from each other and at what level you want the rods. We changed our minds several times, and it was hard work lifting the shelves back out. So I cannot stress this enough, think and plan ahead first!! Because when you start, you'll be tempted to breeze along because it's so easy to assemble, but once you change your mind, dissembling is the hard part.One last thing! Read the review by DUMBASTHEYCOME, I believe it's currently voted as the most helpful review. I don't know if I would have made the same mistake as that reviewer, but that was a good heads up and because I read it beforehand, I didn't have to think twice as to how the shelves should slide in. So thank you dumbastheycome!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33L4VDWTN7W2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001339YQO#wasThisHelpful","R33L4VDWTN7W2U","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like a previous reviewer mentioned, your screw hole may be too large for the screw. The size of the screw hole does not seem to be universal. Even though these sockets can fit up to 1 inch diameter rods, we used 5/8 rods. The hole in our 5/8 rods were incompatible. So we thought 5/8 did not work and started searching for 1"" inch rods. All the while, I kept thinking why does the ad say UP TO ONE INCH? That would entail that smaller rods would work. Sure enough my suspicions were correct, it had nothing to do with rod diameter. It had all to do with the diameter of the hole of the rod. We found another set of 5/8 rods, and this time the socket did fit and screw tightly.So my best advice is this.. Do what we did! Take the socket with you when you shop for rods, and test them out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EAMGH5Y6E63K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FU6OBC#wasThisHelpful","R3EAMGH5Y6E63K","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first, I wasn't impressed with the power. I put my hand in front of it and thought, what's the big deal? But if you move the air up your wrist and along your arms, you'll see your skin move, it's pretty gross. To confirm the power and make sure a regular blow dryer doesn't have this effect, I quickly ran upstairs and tried the blow dryer on my arms. My skin didn't move. Power of data vac confirmed! LOL.I cleaned my DELL XPS5 which was bought in 2005. 7 years of casual wiping, never serious cleaning, so it had quite a build up. It is absolutely clean now. I love this thing!Some are saying that the more expensive listing on Amazon is newer and has a push button and holes in the adapter to allow them to click into place. Well, I bought from this $50 listing and I got the newer model. So there is no need to pay for the extra money, what you get is retail art box vs OEM plain box packaging, that's the only difference.I would like someone to confirm something via the comment below. Did your Air Flare and Blower Nozzle have pre-drilled holes? The only thing that came with a pre-drilled hole for me is the tool kit adapter. The blower nozzle and the air flare had outlines or indentation of a hole. As if they were marked for drilling, but they simple forgot to drill it. If you have a rotary tool/dremal, you should be able to drill it yourself. Please comment below if yours came the same as mine.About the heat! This thing does not get hot, it gets reasonably warm. I just don't see how anyone would turn it on long enough for it to get burning hot. Because the nature of cleaning a PC doesn't warrant leaving it on for such a long stretch. You're blowing one part of the case, you'll be turning it off as you move around to the other side, you turn it back on, you turn it back off as you detach the optical drives, you turn it back on, you turn it back off as you reattach drives, you turn it back on, you turn it back off to attach a different micro tool to get smaller crevices, etc. You get what I'm saying? Unless you're blowing leaves in your back-yard, which this is not intended for, there shouldn't be a project that requires this thing to be on for so long that it burns up.Highly recommended!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UHUWQ0UTVREG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001J4ZOAW#wasThisHelpful","R1UHUWQ0UTVREG","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently installed Windows 7 via Bootcamp to my Macbook Air which only had 128gb to begin with. I partitioned 50gb for Bootcamp, and when it was all said and done, I had 47gb to use. Once windows 7 and some programs were installed, I had about 25gb left. LOL. I had a 300gb 2.5"" HD laying around pulled from a PS3. I wanted a case that was USB 3.0 and also be able to match my Macbook. So I was a little disappointed in the color of the case. The description says Milky White, the pictures even looks white. But more accurately, the description should say, CLEAR FROSTED PLASTIC CASE. That's what they mean folks, when they say MILKY WHITE. My hard drive can be seen through the case clearly. Not enough frosting. For all all intents and purposes, it's basically a clear case.Having said that, I love the function of this. Think of those plastic VHS tapes in the 80's. That's what it basically is. You put the hard drive inside along with the usb 3.0 module/sata connector. Then you shut the case. It snaps in place, no screws. Underneath the case is an opening for the usb cable. Extremely versatile if you have multiple bare 2.5"" drives laying around the house like I do. It does the job. USB powered too, no need for power adapters or cables. As for longevity, who knows.Previous review says you can probably connect a 3.5 hard drive since you don't really have to use the case. I was very doubtful because it takes a lot of power for those 3.5 drives and there were no power adapters or cables supplied. But for the curious cats, I tested it out, and the answer is NO. You cannot use 3.5 drives. It did not recognize the hard drive. I double checked by connecting the 3.5 again via my Apricorn Drivewire Universal HDD Adapter USB To 2.5IN & 3.5IN Sata & Pata which has the proper power adapters and my macbook recognized it fine. I don't know if it doesn't work due to the hardware itself or simply a power issue. If it's a power issue, you cannot simply add a power connecter either because once the Ineo module is connected to your 3.5 drive, it blocks/covers the power slot of the drive.So there you go. There is no killing two birds with one stone. This is only for your 2.5"" drives. Despite the color disappointment, I'm still giving it a 5 stars because it works and it's versatile.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UN41E0MLDZNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q6TH5I#wasThisHelpful","R1UN41E0MLDZNZ","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought it for the Oxygenics Body Spa Handheld Shower Kit, White. That set came with a holder, but it was only usable if you're using the handheld as your main shower-head attached to the arm. I use it as a secondary attached to a diverter, so I needed a separate holder. Lots of reviews about how loose the ball joint is. You need to keep turning the socket to tighten it up against the plate. The ball is tight for me after I do this, and I have to use strength to even budge it. The Oxygenics Body Spa Handheld is white, so once this white mount was in stock, I ordered it. You have two choices on how to install, using screws or adhesives. A nice aesthetic touch is that if you use the adhesive option, it comes with a little round plastic button sticker that you can use to cover the bottom screw hole. The instructions didn't mention anything about caulking the edges, but I suppose that's an extra step that you can take if you're using adhesives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OGXXPW6RAUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002AKJ9KU#wasThisHelpful","R18OGXXPW6RAUC","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Needed a handheld that can provide a nice blast on a diverter. Got a shower head I already love, but wanted a handheld. Tried a waterpik with 7 kinds of water flow and it just sucked even with the flow restrictor removed. Realize those types of shower head will lose pressure on a diverter. This Oxygenics body spa is perfect! No fancy dialing of the head to get different flows, it just blast water out at a high pressure. It has what it calls a comfort control valve so you can adjust how much water or strength you need.However, here are my tips.1. If you want good high pressure.. You should do what I did and remove the flow restrictor at the bottom of the handle. It was easy to remove, just pull with your fingers, no need tools.2. I'm not using the comfort control valve. I don't know why you would ever need to adjust the flow down to a trickle... unless you're buying this to give baths to your baby or your pets? Secondly, I think it's dangerous. Because the comfort controller allows you to adjust flow all the way to nothing. If you have kids or guest, you'll need to constantly remind people that adjusting the flow to nothing is not the same as turning off the water. You still need to turn off the water as you normally do. If someone forgets.. uh oh!!! So I just don't use it at all. You should adjust the flow using your normal bath handles. If you decide to use it, you just connect it to the bottom of the handheld then you connect the hose. If you don't use it, you can just connect the hose directly to the bottom of the handheld.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZG9YE35QTBUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005G4EO66#wasThisHelpful","RZG9YE35QTBUL","A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1R3A8F7OSP3ZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted to rate this higher, because the peacock pearls are amazing! I love seeing the green tones and the pearls are a good size although I prefer them to be just a little bit larger. My reason for knocking a star is the clasp is not good, it comes open very easily and I knocked off a second star because the knotting on the string is not as tight as it should be. I have a pearl necklace that cost ten times as much as this one, and I've had it for 15 years. It's in better shape than this one that's only been worn a few months.

"This was much nicer than expected. I love it! The cross is somewhat whiter than shown, which is a good thing because it glows. The garnet is very noticeable and a nice size. The chain is also thicker and sturdier than Amazon Collection chains I've received in the past. I didn't feel the need to use a different chain.

"I own a limo service and we have a couple dozen car seats. This is now the best and biggest one we have, as well as the most versatile (with some adjustment). I like that everything is soft and washable. It's very heavy and sits well in all of our vehicles. I would buy this for my own baby. The car seat is very protective and works well as a rear facing infant seat and forward facing toddler seat. I love the dark color as well to mask wear and tear. If you plan to keep your car seat a long time, this is a great color to get as well because small scuffs and minor stains will not wash out on lighter colors, but will be masked well with this dark color. Overall we love this car seat and bring it for our pickiest guests.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GOW5J99MFXH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU9CKTG#wasThisHelpful","R3GOW5J99MFXH8","AEWYUPCNDV7HY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEWYUPCNDV7HY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I keep this in my camera almost permanently since nearly every shot is outdoors with sunlight.I'm getting ready for a Pacific coast highway trip, and plan to capture every sunrise and sunset at is golden hour, so I'm very excited to put this lens to use.The lens is very high quality, one of the best I've seen.

"I really love this appliance, it's such a great device to cook so many different things. I've made brownies, french fries, naan bread pizza, sweet potato fries, spinach dip, and several more things. The way it circulates the heat and heats evenly from the bottom as well produces a nice result, plus it's easy to clean up. It is noisy though, which I don't mind because my husband has tinnitus and we regularly keep bathroom fans and air filters on for him. The noise on this is a good thing for us! Although we have a small kitchen, we were able to find a place on a kitchen cart to store this when not in use. It's nice to be able to have people over and take advantage of this as a extra cooking device and leave the oven, microwave, and stove top free. This is quickly becoming our go to device for not just fried foods. Also, considering it uses so little oil I think if you cook a lot of fries/fish this could easily pay for itself because you are buying 90% less oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKET11YQOCWZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6OU4#wasThisHelpful","RKET11YQOCWZM","AEWYUPCNDV7HY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEWYUPCNDV7HY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These earrings are gorgeous. The color of the stones was exactly as shown and they were larger than most stud earrings I wear, although not too large. I have double pierced ears, so I wear them on the second hole, and worn that way they perfectly sit on my ear lobe. I already got many compliments on these when I wore my hair up. They are different and athough the colors are shades of blue, I chose to wear them with black and white so they stood out very well. I don't think I would be interested in the coordinating necklace but I would consider a bracelet with the same stones. I LOVE these earrings and so does my husband. They are now one of my favorite pairs of studs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318F8H3TSS62T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JC0BFZI#wasThisHelpful","R318F8H3TSS62T","AEWYUPCNDV7HY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AEWYUPCNDV7HY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is  a really beautiful, substantial bracelet. It's much bigger than I am accustomed to wearing, but looks great with nearly everthing. I like the two tone so I can easily mix and match this with silver and yellow gold jewelry. My main reason for knocking a star is that a clasp closure would have been better, and also I never spend money on yellow gold plated items because in time the plating will wear off and then what do you do?

"Tell Pop Secret to Stop Killing Bees!Its no secret we love popcorn, In fact, Americans consume more than 16 billion quarts of popcorn each year. But were getting more than we bargained for in all those bowls of popcorn: bee-toxic pesticides.Bees are dying at alarming rates, and scientists have identified a group of insecticides called neonicotinoids (neonics) as a prime culprit in these drastic population losses. The largest single use of neonicotinoids is as a seed coating for field crops. In fact, researchers estimate that 95-99% of all field corn grown in the U.S. comes from seed coated with bee-toxic neonic chemicals.Unfortunately, the popcorn industry uses bee-killing chemicals on their seeds, too. Thats why were calling on Pop Secret, one of the biggest brands in the industry, to urge them to source their popcorn from seeds that are NOT coated in these harmful chemicals. Thanks to your pressure, Pop Weaver has already agreed to phase out its use of neonics.1Neonics are the most widely used insecticides in the world, and are a class of systemic chemicals, meaning they are dispersed throughout the treated plant, rendering the whole plant toxic. Just as alarming, neonics can last in the environment for years and they can harm species that the chemical was not designed to kill - like bees, butterflies, birds, and entire food chains.As one of the largest popcorn brands in the U.S., Pop Secret can make a big difference for bees by joining Pop Weaver in phasing out their use of neonic-coated seeds.Sign the Petition to Tell Pop Secret to Stop Killing Bees!","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R340WCYU5LRLFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O92NBQU#wasThisHelpful","R340WCYU5LRLFG","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this item at no cost to evaluate and review.Nicely compact FM transmitter While I have an auxiliary port in my car stereo, being wireless seemed like a wonderful idea, no clutter.  This turns out to be an ideal solution.  The Kollea Mini FM transmitter is small and feather light.  Function keys are straightforward, so you can get the FM Transmitter up and running in a flash. I spent just a couple minutes to get things going.  You'll need to tune along the FM frequency, to find a dead spot that gives you clearest, loudest sound.  LEDs are bright, and switching frequency is easy with left/right numbers up & down, couldn't be easier, really. No need to move the device around for connectivity, the signal is strong and clear. I've heard other wireless FM transmitters, this one works and sounds ten times better than the others. Really impressed me.NOTE: No power button: Instead, you simply press the LEFT button, and doing so, the unit will shut down in under a minute if it remains unused. Plugging back in turns the unit back on. Easy!Transmission seems excellent. I can be 15+ feet from my car, and get a strong, crackle-free sound. That suggests quality. I used my Samsung Note 3, and got GREAT sound. Samsung S4 and works great and transmit clear sound from my Mp3 player to my car stereo and works best if you find an unused radio frequency. I can tell this has good transmitter on it since I have no trouble transmitting even if I am away from my car about 10-20 ft using unused station no scratchy and I get clear sound transmission.ROS:Built-in rechargeable battery.  No need to worry about replacing batteries or running out of power. Batteries can be expensive so savings is a plus!Fits in palm of hand, a feather-weight.CONS:Can't find a facet that's problematic or fussy.I ordered this at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8IB2YZVNLHJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144DBGO2#wasThisHelpful","R8IB2YZVNLHJI","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DANGER PLEASE NOTE:Recalls and WarningsWeight and Energy Supplement Contains Synthetic ""Amphetamine"" (Date Posted: 9/30/2015)On September 21, 2015, the FDA issued a warning letter to TruVision Health LLC. because the company's supplement ***tru Weight & Energy*** lists a synthetic, amphetamine-like compound, AMP (also called 1,3-dimethylbutylamine or DMBA) on product labels.DMBA is an analogue of the pharmaceutical stimulant, 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA), which is banned by the FDA. DMBA may also be listed on labels as 1,3-Dimethylbutylamine, 2-amino-4-methylpentane, AMP citrate, AMP, or 4-methyl-2-pentanamine .In addition, the FDA noted that tru Weight & Energy contains high levels of synephrine, a stimulant from bitter orange extract which may cause hypertension, increased heart rate and cardiovascular toxicity. The product contains a bitter orange extract (synephrine 30%) while the agency noted that the content of p-synephrine in concentrated extracts or commercial products are standardized to 4-6%.See ConsumerLab.com's Reviews of Weight Loss Supplements , B Vitamin Supplements and Energy Drinks and Muscle Enhancers for more about other synthetic stimulants and steroids found in these types of supplements, and tests of popular products.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U9G98AFQNP8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PECSYU#wasThisHelpful","R3U9G98AFQNP8K","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recalls and WarningsGNC Accused of Selling Supplements with Unlawful Ingredients RECENT RECALLS AND WARNINGS Weight Supplements RecalledOn October 22, 2015, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum filed a lawsuit against supplement retailer ***GNC***, alleging that the company ***sold products that were adulterated with BMPEA and picamilon, which are not lawful dietary supplement ingredients.*** The lawsuit states that GNC ""knew or should have known"" the products contained these unlawful ingredients.BMPEA (beta- methylphenylethylamine) is a synthetic, amphetamine-like compound found in some weight loss and workout supplements. It is often found in supplements labeled as containing acacia rigidula, although it does not appear to be a component of this plant. It is not a legal dietary supplement ingredient. The Attorney General's lawsuit contends GNC should have known as early as 2013 that BMPEA was not a lawful dietary ingredient but continued selling products containing BMPEA until April 2015, when the FDA formally announced it did not meet the definition of a dietary ingredient and issued warning letters to a number of supplement manufacturers.  Products containing BMPEA sold by GNC include Fastin and Fastin DMAA Free (Hi Tech Pharmaceuticals), Meltdown (VPX Sports) and Isolean 2 (Advanced Nutrition Systems).Picamilon is a synthetic compound of GABA and niacin found in some supplements promoted for physical performance or cognitive enhancement. According to the lawsuit, GNC was aware as early as May of 2007 that it was not a lawful dietary supplement ingredient, but sold products containing the compound, such as Charge Extreme Energy Booster (Labrada Bodybuilding Nutrition), Turbo Shred (Swole Sports Nutrition) and Mr. Hyde - Fruit Punch (Prosupps USA LLC) until September of 2015.GNC has filed a motion to remove the lawsuit. A statement issued by the company noted,"" There is no basis for the Oregon Attorney General's assertion that GNC or any other retailer ""knew or should have known"" that these ingredients were not legal for use in dietary supplements. As a matter of law, this critical legal issue remains undetermined as neither FDA nor any court has issued a legally binding determination of the status of these ingredients. GNC stopped selling products with BMPEA and picamilon, immediately upon learning indirectly, rather than from notice directed at GNC, that FDA did not view BMPEA and picamilon as legal dietary ingredients.""See Related Warnings:FDA Identifies More Products Listing Synthetic AmphetamineDoes Your Weight Loss or Sports Supplement Contain Synthetic Amphetamine?Study Finds Some Vinpocetine Supplements Contain No VinpocetineTo read the complaint filed against GNC, which includes a list of products containing BMPEA and picamilon which were sold by the company, use the red link below.http://www.doj.state.or.us/releases/pdf/general_nutrition_corporation_complaint.pdf","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16D8B27ENUBUX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0079Y17D4#wasThisHelpful","R16D8B27ENUBUX","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be Aware: Recalls and Warnings: Consuming a Single Energy Drink May Increase Cardiovascular Risk!(Date Posted: 11/11/2015)A recently published study found that consumption of a single caffeinated energy drink significantly increased blood pressure and noradrenaline levels in healthy young adults.

The study was published on November 8, 2015 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).In the study, 25 healthy adults consumed a 16 oz. energy drink ***(Rockstar, Rockstar Inc.)*** containing 240 mg of caffeine, 2000 mg of taurine, and extracts of guarana seed, ginseng root, and milk thistle. On a separate day, the same adults consumed a placebo beverage that was similar in color and taste but did not contain caffeine or other stimulants. Measurements taken 30 minutes after the drinks were consumed found that, following ingestion of the energy drink, blood pressure increased an average of 6.4% (about 5 mm Hg), compared to a 1% increase (about 1 mm Hg) following ingestion of the placebo drink. Blood levels of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) increased by 73.6% following ingestion of the energy drink, compared to 30.9% after placebo. Compared to placebo, there was no significant difference in heart rate increase.The researchers warned that the increases in blood pressure and noradrenaline following ingestion of the energy drink could pose an increased cardiovascular risk, but stated the larger studies are needed.See ConsumerLab.com's Review of B Vitamin Supplements and Energy Drinks for more information about the safety of energy drinks and tests of related products.To access the complete study, use the red link below.http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=2469194","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L3WF04CGU8U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NGNEKY#wasThisHelpful","R2L3WF04CGU8U6","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's very easy, as an Amazon reviewer, to post nice videos, and sing praises of a product to ensure you receive more free stuff. I am an Amazon reviewer, and I received these earbuds at to cost to evaluate and review.My first impression was these buds were a real tangle to deal with. Being smooth, round, rubber coated basic cording, these will tangle, be certain of that.  The magnetic ""bud"", which separates easily, yet does not fall apart, goes behind your neck, leaving the very ""well-fitting"" ear buds (best for large ears, will be problem for women or smaller ears) and the small rectangular volume switch hangs rather high, just below your throat, about clavicle height. The magnetic bud worn at neck in back, cleverly has the charging port in one side of the magnets closure.My two issues with these buds are 1. the sound is clear...but there is insufficient volume for me to really enjoy my music. Listening to music at lower volume, or audio books might not be an issue. But the volume is a major issue for me. Depending on how you listen to music, let the volume concern help you decide. 2. Because of the clever, but ""tentacle-like"" nature of these buds, for me they're like sorting rubber bands, each time I use them, and regardless of how I store them.Hope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25EDYCXYOAX3Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R1S6LC#wasThisHelpful","R25EDYCXYOAX3Z","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was asked to evaluate/review this product, and received a sample at no cost.While the product is Silicon, and likely without toxic PBAs, which is nice, the amount of actual ""vibration"" the device is capable of putting out, is well BELOW what is typically acceptable/effective for ""usable stimulation"".There are much better products out there, and Lelo is one.  Issue with Lelo is their products tend to be staggeringly overpriced, because they are well made.  Amazon's selection isn't very expansive. If this is for your personal/private use/or a couple here's an old favorite which will ""buzz"" enough to absolutely do the trick. Being corded, it can be slipped into the vaginal canal, and the remote can be used to turn on, and modify strength and measure of pulsing, felt deep inside.

"A sports ball, is a sports ball. There are many manufacturers and levels of quality.  What matters to me as much as using the ball, is how easy it is to get ready for use.  There are NO instructions provided, so figuring out inflation - you're on your own, which should be easy, right?  After reading reviews (not knowing if store had shotgunned Amazon reviewers, like myself with free balls for review), many said inflating ball was a cinch with accordion pump provided. My experience was dead confusion as to which tube went where. NO INSTRUCTIONS.  The ""pump"" is the absolute cheapest/useless device I've ever seen for this application.  Cord kept being blown out of ball (losing just pumped-in air), again, and again.A friend has a ball she showed my wife (who picked this up for me here on Amazon), different supplier, ball, and pump.  The pump shown to my wife was stiff and deeper pump, with metal bands around each tier of accordion, so it could be re-used if ball needed to deflated and inflated again. The difference between the two I cannot find words for. The other a usable, impressive pump. This ""device"", not even fit for a toy really.Had the ball inflated at my gym.  This ball retains a noticeable ""PVC"" or vinyl (shower curtain odor) still, about a wekk later. It's used as a seat for my office in our home, and whole office still has strong PVC odor.In nutshell, ball went to Goodwill, and I picked one up at sporting good store...with usable, strong pump.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUL9Q68Q9F7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108EEYKY#wasThisHelpful","RIUL9Q68Q9F7I","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UNU supplied me with this product to evaluate & review here.  Like many review readers, I watch for freely offered merchandise, expecting an outstanding analysis because the reviewer wants more stuff.Anyway, the UNU SUPERAK portable battery is exceptionally nice.  It's 5000kmAh (milliamps - iPhone 6 carries 1,810mAh battery, by contrast the Samsung 6 Edge a 2600mAh, & the Samsung Note 4 a more substantive 3200mAh) capacity, at full charge, can theoretically ""recharge"" any of the phones mentioned above, some twice.  Chargers like this, whether Anker, a fine maker of portable batteries, or this UNO PORTAPAK, hold a charge a long time, weeks in fact without being topped off.  I like the small charger size, it slips into my back jeans pocket, but with a bulge in that it's 3,75"" long...but about an inch wide.  It's more an issue for jeans pockets than a suit coat or purse. Great size in cold weather, multi-zippered coats.  I've already charged from near empty...my Samsung Note 3, and of four LEDs on chargers side (to suggests available charge), 3 of the 4 lamps were out.  That's not bad for the heavy 3200mAh Note 3 battery to filled.Here's the pice de rsistance. The charging cord which comes with the battery has a standard USB male plug on one side, and a WONDERFUL ""piggy-back"" arrangement of MICRO USB (Android, etc.) with an attached LIGHTENING interface for someones iPhone. The two tips are attached by a small piece of plastic and always there in whatever flavour you require in the moment.  This feature alone is worth the savings in aggravation of 'whose got a micro cable??? NO...that's for my iPhone!!!.This is especially handy and offsets my uncertainty about charger shape. There is both a MICRO and STANDARD outlet on the end to allow powering and charging options of every sort/device.  This accompanying cord would have been wonderful were in somehow attached to the charger...eliminating the need to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ALQVNQGGYAFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012YJ32LS#wasThisHelpful","R1ALQVNQGGYAFQ","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received these cables to evaluate and review on Amazon.The cables performed flawlessly. I'm an Android User, with a wife, daughter, and son with iPhones. I asked them all to try the Baxia cords for a couple days and give me any and all feedback, plus or minus.Bottom line, they performed like OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer - Apple in this case) equipment. My son seemed to experience a faster charge than OEM. He's very tech oriented, so I'll include his observation. Everyone found the contacts a STURDY FIT, the lightening male connector fitting tightly/securely into phones, and charging time seemed NO DIFFERENT than OEM. Both daughter and wife reported the Baxia cables felt ""more substantial - solid"", than OEM.  That's a distinctly positive bit of feedback, and makes owning Baxia cables even more desirable than Apple product replacements.The price point is very good, and there seemed no issue using the Baxia cables with Apple AC power source. This is a short review in that I've nothing in the ""con"" category to report.I'm hoping Baxia will eventually offer cables for Android brand as well.

"I received this product to evaluate and review. This is a fantastic replacement for my Anker portable charger. Less expensive, and all the stuff I need. Size is excellent for 10,200mAh charging power, and it fits in my back pocket nicely. Yes, I sit on it, it's with me all day long should the need for power arise, and it's admirably STURDY.  I received mine charged to illuminate 3 of the packs 4 beautiful Blue LED indicator lamps.  It took about an hour and a half to top off, so plan on enough time to recharge MoJuice when it's low!Really nice is ""sedentary drain"" is not an issue.  I just tested my MoJuice charger by pressing power button, and all four LEDs lit, full charge, with last charge to unit being almost two weeks ago.  It's there when you need it.  Equally FANTASTIC, the micro USB charging strip is incorporated into the MoJuice's smooth design. Just pull the strip cord from the side of the unit and no NEED TO CARRY ADDITIONAL CORDS!

"I was provided with Diffuser to evaluate and review.PROS:Well crafted, solid, unit, with very easy/intuitive directions for use. The plastic dome turns once, and lifts off exposing the water cavity. Iused filters water from refrigerator door to fill the basin. I happen to have a bottle of Clary-Sage oil I use for after shave, so I used 5-6 dropsto add to water. The wood body feel substantial, and the AC cord plugs right into back of unit. There are two ""soft"" buttons, easily accessedTo Turn On, Pause (nice feature), and select from an amazing offering of colors. You can also allow the colors to slowly blend into oneanother if that's a soothing look for you. Along with Pause, you can set the unit be on for three minutes, off for three. This conserves water/oil mixture, and regulates strength of scent.The scent is immediately apparent and can be very strong, so adjusting drops of oil is by experimentation. You can ACTUALLY see the stream of vapor whirling from opening some 6-8 inches into the air, a very ""soft"", soothing physical dynamic. Overall the unit seems to fit a guy's environment, as well as a female's. The wood provides a very Scandinavian look. Vapor last a good while, about 2 hours and change before refill, and depending upon FULL ON or INTERMITTENT modes.  Three thick rubber legs keep the diffuser on the surface it's placed. Won't skid around on you.CON:Not a big deal at all...however, the Red and Green LED lights, which tell you which modes are in effect, are mounted in the front of the diffuser (the power cord comes in the other side, or back). I have no problem with this. The LEDs are not intrusive on a long piece of furniture in our dining room, where the scent moves around the area nicely. If in a bedroom, in the dark, the LEDs would be rather bright. Just a heads-up. Curious design. For me the front LEDs aren't a deal-breaker, at all! Diffuser can be angled to face the LEDs off to the side of course.Recommended!With great looks and adding a scented oil to bathe room in preferred fragrance, this unit is wonderful at a great price here on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXP2T00PLT0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF6YTNM#wasThisHelpful","R3UXP2T00PLT0C","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was supplied with Mastermind for evaluation, and this review. The product arrived nicely boxed with a Zahler baseball cap, and my hopes were not high for Mastermind.  Working with the helping profession, I'm keenly aware of products addressing mental health in general, anxiety (GAD) and depressive disorders in particular.  As a child I had a profound anxiety disorder. It was hell. Proper meds wisely combined w/ talk therapy helped amazingly over years.  Thank god for meds.  Where would the suffering be without them? But side-effects are a bitch.A terribly close friend of mine (""Jane"", thirty-two), has suffered a ""profound"" depressive disorder (genetically predisposed) all her life. It ebbs/flows, as depression will (often exacerbated by environment/situations/stress. She has most recently been on Prozac (SSRI) and  Diazepam (Valium), which have offered minimal benefits, and she'd begun tapering off those for lack of benefit vs. side effects.  She has undergone TMS (trans-cranial magnetic stimulation), the effect of which was really hard to determine.When approached by Zahler, I asked Jane if she were up for another option.  Key is the profundity of her depression. She is very bright, reviewed the materials (the fact this product is NATURAL - made of things found in nature, as opposed to pharmaceutical chemicals), and jumped inIt's a 30 day regiment, 4 caps a day, two morning, two night. After 3 days she identified a ""noticeable"" difference. I was very skeptical. We spoke daily. She claimed she felt, a bit ""lighter"". The month passed with reports she was feeling better as she went along. She took two capsules mid-day with lunch, two before bed. NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL were experienced!After the 30 days, she reported Mastermind has had a ""significant"" effect on her profound depression! More so than Prozac, and finds her needing Valium, less often as needed. This is terribly, terribly impressive & important. She estimates (and it's hard to put numbers to...), Mastermind increased her mood by ""about"", 20%, more so than Prozac, and any ""cocktail"" she's been on. Stunning.What's critical: depression is so difficult on mind/body/stress, depressed people say, 'it's a physical pain as well as emotionally immobilizing. It simply ""blunts"" all emotion. SO...a 20% decrease in torment, is CONSIDERABLE, worth it's weight in years of life. I don't mean to sound overly dramatic, but my dear friend suffers 20% LESS, because of this trial with Mastermind. Before reviewing, I waited to check her mood AFTER  Mastermind. Two weeks after use, she reports feeling less ""light"", less motivated and happy in general. Remarkable. There's a con.CON: This is NOT an inexpensive product! Retailing at $99. ($78 here on Amazon - for how long?), and as a postal worker, not in good financial shape, another $100. monthly, top of car payments, insurance, rent, etc., she's in a really tough spot  Hopefully money will not stop those who need this stuff. Bottom line: I'm TERRIBLY impressed with Mastermind.  I highly recommend those who suffer depression give it a full 30 day try, see what it might do for your body's chemical make-up. I intend to try it myself.Ron Kolman","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRRHSEFETBKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFD1BFS#wasThisHelpful","RXRRHSEFETBKZ","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was provided with this product for evaluation and review. This is an entirely new company to me. To determine ""Quality"", I'd first check ingredients.A preferred company for most of my supplements is Carlson. I trust them for many reasons, so let's check Carlson D3, against PCNL D3.PRO: You get a lot of product (360 TINY gel caps), of 5k International Units (IU) D3, for a very good price (about $16.) with PCNL Platinum.CON: Quantity isn't always quality. For example: PCNL uses Soybean Oil in its D3. Generally speaking Soybean oil, in food, isn't good for you.  It suppresses the thyroid, and could contribute significantly to obesity ion our culture. Carlson uses Sunflower oil, lighter, and assists in  controlling cholesterol and blood pressure.  Sunflower oil costs a company more to use (PCNL is inexpensive, yes).CON: PCNL uses Vegetable Glycerin which breaks down to add triglycerides (unhealthy) to the body. However in the small amounts you'd be  getting in PCNL D3, relatively benign!  Carlson, uses a more expensive approach: Glycerin: classified as a sugar alcohol, but  more similar to sugars: readily absorbed and is probably converted into glucose.  One can say it's not critical in the long run: I think it  speaks to the company's mind set, and quality goals. I don't need more triglycerides in my blood.CON: There is an extra ""Vegetable Oil"" listed in PCNL's ingredients. Might be for shelf life. But WHAT KIND of vegetable oil? Something healthy  like Canola, or something cheap and less attractive like Palm Kernel, or Coconut Oil (cheaper).Both companies use ""gelatin"" made from animal source (cow hooves and bone), rather than a more desirable Vegetable Cellulose. In PCNL's case, I might chalk it up to expense, but Carlson uses the same...so I'm at a loss here. I DO wish Carlson would begin using Vegetable cellulose instead.Bottom line...Too many extras in PCNL, cheaper product. Will it work? Likely just fine, given the above. You certainly have more value in PCNL quantity:price. Now quality is another story.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAQEEIBTKE7LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV8AS86#wasThisHelpful","RAQEEIBTKE7LU","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was asked to evaluate this product for an honest review. I've had a beard since twenty-three, and have one today decades later.There are lots of ""beard products"" out there. Here's my honest evaluation:PROS: very pleasant fragrance. subtle, but tones of tobacco and smoke (Bergamont) which I really like.  not at all greasy, rather a thick-ish balm which emulsifies nicely, and makes for easy application. I use fingertips and just apply as I  would a conditioner.  packages smartly. clear container is pleasant (avoided bright colours for guys (smart), and dispenses lotion easily, just right amount.  I use Just For Men to keep my beard colour enough colour, enough grey. the constant use of colouring dries a beard out. using Mr.  Rugger/Bold seems to have softened my beard, and perhaps...helped the ends, frayed from Just For Men use.*In all I recommend you try it!CON:  like men's colognes (I like a citrus blend, crisp clean), fragrance applied to skin dissipates rather ""quickly"". applied to fabric (sweater,  shirt), the scent can go all day and into evening. heavier, natural oil-based fragrances dissolve on warm skin, and will last much longer  sans alcohol. I'd hoped the manufacturer, who seems very erudite where scents are concerned, beards, and VERY consumer aware,  would have concocted  scent heavier in longer lasting oils, with a chance of staying with you beard - all day? scents like Royal Spice &  Royal Rum (Google them), do last a very long time which is a real pleasure.*Bottom line, I'd truly recommend this product.

For the price, music sounds excellent. I'm looking for volume - w/o distortion, clear and crisp highs, and bass that's rich and deep There's plenty of volume, bass thankfully deep and has some ""thump"". The SoundPeats deliver all of the sound spectrum, and I believe will not disappoint at this price.PROS: The SoundPeats do use a handy standard micro USB charger, have fantastically placed and designed buttons for volume (UP volume has raised edge for easy identification. Forward and reverse buttons are notched as well and easily locatable. There is a smartly placed PLAY/PAUSE button at bottom of left ear piece, and POWER/PAIR button on right pad. Pairing is a breeze.

"Reason for purchase: Was offered sample product for evaluation, fair/honest review. I'm common consumer as you likely, and avid camper enjoying strenuous hiking. My evaluation is based solely on quality, durability, and ""value"".Pros:1. STURDY: early Spring camping and hiking trails in Minnesota showed these crampons ""tough. On 45 degree slopes, teeth bit into  ground, clashing with rocks, without any damage to cleats.2. WEBBING: strong, continuously abraded by stone without cuts or breakage. Impressive. I've crampons designed for repelling costing about  $100, and CampLeaders performed as well. Given price, compared to quality = HIGH in VALUE!3. STRAP ON: I'm a size 11 shoe (wide), and these Large crampons slip on like butter. On both feet in under three minutes.4.  FIT: with correct fit (I mention my sizing in point 3), these crampons NEVER slipped off. A fine set of crampons should never slip from  shoe/boot.5.  PRICE: as fine a product as my Angled HillSound Pros (about $80 on Amazon). Same quality & performance costing $15 - $26, right here on  Amazon.Cons:1. Absence of anti-balling pad is disappointment, but AB pad typically found on crampons 3-5 times the price, and for singularly serious  climbing.You can use CampLeader crampons to hike steep hills w/o concern, easily traverse snowy/icy Winter conditions, SIGNIFICANTLY reducing chance of falling!  If doing yard work - planting grass seeds - wearing crampons will aerate your lawn with every step. Clever idea.Additional Thoughts: I enjoyed using these crampons and have suggested friends look into these. I'd likely never have tried a pair at this low coast, if not for this opportunity. I learned quite a bit about price assumptions and value.Company that provided me the product: CampLeader/crampons - fifth editionCompany that shipped the product: CampLeader/crampons - fifth editionShipping time: Item was shipped out promptly and boxed smartly and securely.Would I buy this product; YES, unquestionably and recommend.I take pride in these evaluations/reviews. I check consumer feedback on Amazon, whenever possible, and am glad to give back honest feedback for your consideration prior to purchase.

"I was offered this product at no cost to evaluate and review.My first impression, in handling the recorder, was it felt rather light, had a ""cheap"" feel, but cheap isn't a factor of weight. They packed a lot into this device and it's feature rich. 1) Ear buds, 2) USB data sync charging cable, 3) Phone recording jack (connects phone and wall line to voice recorder for call recording - GREAT feature!), AND 4) Clip on microphone (for use with interviews or hands free self-recording - also a fantastic gadget!), and 5) Li-ion battery.QUALITY of RECORDING: I would not use this device to record music, that's a shame. But for voice, the iGearPro does a nice job.  Results are clear, but not as loud as I would prefer, mic just isn't the very best.  The recorder's 8GB storage should offer about upside of 80 hours of recording, which should be sufficient for most meetings, interviews, thoughts-to-self.  You can transfer higher quality files to it from your computer if you want to use it for music playback. Actually any files.  You can use this just like a flash drive for documents, or JPG files for transfer to another computer also.You'll find BUTTONS CLEARLY LABELED and simple RECORD & PLAY. No problem using the Lapel Mic quickly. These are important selling points; reasons why I would purchase. All buttons/functions are clearly marked, spaced nicely, and made for quick finger access and comfort. Instructions are not easy to read, not easily understood, but the very basic functionality of a hand-held recorder should allow most to intuitively get going.So you can, if you choose, transfer your music files for listening, Mac OS X v10.6 and newer will recognize this recorder because it's formatted FAT 32. For voice recording it works really well, good price here on Amazon and easy as pie to use.With ease of use, solidly ""GOOD"" recording, thoughtful & handy features, lapel mic (very cool), and great price point,  I use the one I received to evaluate, and have had no issues with it thus far.

"I love these. Prior to these full-length pants, the 3/4 length were ideal for the gym/working out. These are as well. Same quality/substantial feel to material (94% Cotton, 6% Spandex), the right weight, with the perfect amount of ""give"". Stitching is tight and has an expensive feel, much like a pair of LuLu Lemon yoga pants my wife picked up for me. Quite a bit less obviously - fore essentially the very same thing.The Length is perfect, falling right at the arch of my foot (just a bit higher than where the pants fall in the pair pictured). In work-out shoes, the fall in perfect. (I'm 6'0""/185 and I ordered a LARGE. In jeans I'm a 34W/32L.) Running down the outside of each leg is a woven strip which allows for better air circulation. The feel against the skin is soft and smooth, no cling even when sweating, and allows for maximum range of motion. I really like the way the pants conform to my body and sit right at the hips, with an elastic top band, to hold the pants where you want them, and long cloth ties knotting the way ""scrubs"" tie-off.  I've picked up another pair, and can see these will be a favourite casual ""slack"" in nice weather. Light, flattering a man's body, with comfortable/handy side slash pockets AND a back pocket for wallet phone, etc.Reviewing for YogaAddict is a treat. Being introduced to perhaps the most comfortable pants I've owned was a real find. Highly recommended for the gym, yoga, kickboxing, and lounging around the house, going out to a movie (you've got pockets!), just about anywhere you'd wear jeans or slacks. Looking forward to many years of comfortable wear in these!

"I was asked to review this product. I had a simple (costly of course being an Apple product) clear case on my iPhone 6. When I began to evaluate the case...I noticed my phone settled sweetly into the HUSKK plastic carrier, snapped in solidly, settled and ready to go. No jiggle, everything ""perfectly"" aligned, and a solid feel for such a minimalistic carrier. Corners nicely bolstered, and extension of corner ""bumpers"" is a fraction longer than edge of case, to provide a buffer for screen in event of a fall. The case is cleverly cut-away, so camera is available without case interference, even if you elect to add an iPhone camera attachment, that's rare!.The rest in fine leather, beautifully stitched, and layered with an eye for contour and precision, so you've a ""neat"" and clean look to the entire affair. The front pocket holds cards perfectly, The taller leather backing provides a ""pouch"" between the taller flap and the case. Here is where I keep my paper money, and a security key for my Audi. I love leather (sorry), and buffed-up the already expensive looking pockets with Cadillac (none better, try it) leather cream, and it softened, has more luster, and is better protected. My cards which needn't be with me at all times, are locked in a file cabinet at home. This goes everywhere with me, including the gym. At the office, and slipping out of my suit pocket, the HUSSK phone case/wallet has gotten it's share of comments in a very short time.Whole wallet/case, with cards,key, and enough folding money fits in my jeans without creating anymore bulge (I hate that) in front pocket, than the phone itself (under 10mm loaded). This is my case from this point on. My son twenty, and daughter twenty-three, have both made plans to order one of these for themselves ('Nooo, you can NOT have mine...').  All at a terribly fair (and less than expected) price of less than $50, right here on Amazon.I've seen all sorts of cases online, and mallet ideas for iPhone 6 being offered for backing on Kickstarter.  This is the best I've found. I do hope HUSKK with offer-up case-wallets for my wife's Note 3, and other Samsung/iPhone models as they're slammed at us.Highly recommended byRon Kolman","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5VMJ6X8Z2BA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROPMLY2#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5VMJ6X8Z2BA","A1O09K4R0YVN3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1O09K4R0YVN3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not going to list the specs are all the features and capabilities of this compact system because they are easily available from the product description. That said, I'm going to concentrate on those aspects of the system that either most please me or that I find most usable.First off, I love the ""look"" of the system. It so closely resembles the face and appearance of a Panasonic system that I had way back in the late seventies or early eighties that I had to look closely at it to make sure it was capable of everything claimed for it. I love the throwback look.Straight out of the box and up and running in a matter of minutes is easily accomplished with this system. I had it all set up and connected to my homework in almost no time - with no problems or setbacks encountered along the way.I have been using the system for several days now and find that I'm most often using it via the very effective bluetooth connection option. I play my music by connecting to my iPhone 6 or to an iPad or Kindle Fire.  So far, the connection has been flawless and between whatever device I've connected and the very complete remote control included with the system, I've found it very easy to navigate through the music I've stored in the Cloud or on the devices themselves.I've also dragged out a good portion of my CD collection and I'm enjoying that bit of ""old school"" music-playing, too. The built-in CD player does the job just fine but I'm a little surprised, I admit, that more detailed information does not display than does when listening to a CD directly played from the unit.Next up, I connected a turntable to the system and went really old school, playing LPs that I have never gotten around to digitizing and enjoying the different ""sound"" produced by vinyl as opposed to that from CDs and MP3s.The speakers are capable of all the volume I want and I haven't really found a level yet that distorts the music being played. But I'm pretty cautious when it comes to blowing out speakers, so I can't say for sure that distortion will not be a problem at certain volumes combined with particularly loud music.Over all...great little system that I use for an hour or two just about every day. Im looking forward to having it around for a long, long time, in fact since it offers every option available at the moment. I recommend the system especially for those folks for whom space might be a problem. This one is compact, but it packs a punch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFWOQXCYGCPFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9IPRK0#wasThisHelpful","RFWOQXCYGCPFC","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the presentations I most looked forward to at the 2015 Texas Book Festival was the one featuring Ray Benson of Asleep at the Wheel.  Even though Ray and his co-author David Menconi were allotted the very last time slot on the second day of the festival and I still had a three-hour drive ahead of me, I was determined to make that session.  Good decision.Ive been a fan of Rays music since the early eighties and especially appreciate his efforts to keep Western Swing music alive.  Not only has Asleep at the Wheel recorded Western Swing albums of its own, Ray has produced three very fine Bob Wills tribute albums, and recorded a successful swing-oriented album, Willie and the Wheel with the one and only Willie Nelson.  But thats the public Ray Benson everyone knows.  And I wondered if he would be anything like that public persona when seated on a small stage to discuss his new autobiography, Comin Right at Ya?  Well as it turns out, I had nothing to worry about.Comin Right at Ya is the life story of Ray Benson Seifert, one of four children born into a Jewish Philadelphia family, a guy whose inventor father founded the Seifert Machinery Company and whose schoolteacher mother earned a masters degree from the University of Pennsylvania.  Ray Seifert grew up and became a self-described Jewish Yankee Hippie  and then his love of roots music led him to invent the character that the world now knows as Ray Benson, Texas country music star.It took a while for Ray to make his way to Austin, Texas but thanks largely to Willie Nelsons invitation he finally got here.  And he brought Asleep at the Wheel with him.  And the rest is history.  The Jewish Yankee hippie is now one of the states favorite sons, even to having been named Texan of the Year in 2011 by the Texas legislature.A whole lot happened to Ray and the band before he achieved that lofty status, of course, and Ray tells it all - well, most of it because he admits that his publisher lightly censored some of his stories.  But even with the publisher looking over his shoulder, Ray shares stories about Willie, Dolly, Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, George Strait, Lyle Lovett, a lot of other friends hes made in the business, and a few folks he doesnt think too highly of.  Ray is as bluntly honest about his business and personal failures as he is about his successes, and his is a career which has seen many of both, including the nine Grammies Ray and the band have earned along the way.Comin Right at Ya is for the fans, especially those who appreciate the heck out of Rays music but are only vaguely aware of his roots and how he has so successfully reinvented himself.  Hes Texass number one Jewish Yankee Hippie now, and the state is proud to claim him as one of its own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZQJ08UADK2DI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0143O67WI#wasThisHelpful","R1ZQJ08UADK2DI","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published in 1936, John Steinbecks In Dubious Battle reads like a snapshot from the period in American history during which workers were perhaps at their lowest point ever.  They were suffering greatly because of low wages, an overabundance of unemployed workers willing to work for next-to-nothing wages, and employers who were only too happy to take advantage of the tragic economic situation of the day.  But by actively recruiting workers, union organizers were placing their own lives and those of the workers in jeopardy.  The battle was on, dubious though it may have been.And along came John Steinbeck to tell the world about it because as he said in his 1962 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech: The ancient commission of the writer has not changed.  He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.And, perhaps more in this novel than in anything Steinbeck had written previously, In Dubious Battle does precisely that.To his credit, Steinbeck exposes both sides for what they are.  On the one hand, employers (fruit growers in this case) are shown as exploiters of the working poor, commonly hiring desperate workers and then callously tossing them away in favor of cheaper labor as soon as the opportunity presents itself to do so.  On the other, union organizers are exposed as the Communist tools they are, men even willing to get workers killed or maimed if that will somehow advance the Cause.  In fact, the organizers hope to provoke deadly violence directed at workers in order to fire up the men enough to keep them walking the picket lines.The books two main characters are Mac and Jim.  When Mac, a veteran union organizer, senses something special in new recruit Jim, he decides to bring him to the apple orchards where fruit pickers are facing an devastating cut in their daily wages.  Jim is a true apostle of the cause and, as Mac teaches him the organizing techniques that work best, Jim aches to be more directly in the cause - and constantly implores Mac to use him.  At one point, after suffering an injury that leaves him somewhat out of his head, Jim somehow manages to take over the strike, a change that makes Mac very nervous: Jim said softly, I wanted you to use me.  You wouldnt because you got to like me to well.  He stood up and walked to a box and sat down on it.  That was wrong.  Then I got hurt.  And sitting here waiting, I got to know my power. Im stronger than you, Mac.  Im stronger than anything in the world, because Im going in a straight line.  You and all the rest have to think of women and tobacco and liquor and keeping warm and fed.  His eyes were as cold as wet river stones.  I wanted to be used.  Now Ill use you, Mac.  Ill use myself and you.  I tell you, I feel theres strength in me.In Dubious Battle may not be one of John Steinbecks most popular or highly acclaimed novels, but it is a powerful one, one that deserves to be read today because it offers such a clear look into Americas not too distant past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EO8BRI7W7XYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I1XRZ4#wasThisHelpful","R1EO8BRI7W7XYC","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I may have no intention of ever writing a memoir, I am a huge fan of the genre and have read at least two hundred of them over the past few years.  So although I believe that Mary Karrs The Art of Memoir would be helpful to would-be memoirists, I picked it up mainly just to continue my one-way conversation with one of my favorite practitioners of the craft.  And just I had hoped, Karr by devoting a substantial portion of the book to her own memories and experiences, has written much more than just another how to write book.The preface of The Art of Memoir speaks directly to those considering an effort in chronicling the experiences that shaped them into the people they are today but it is filled with as many words of warning as with words of encouragement.  As she puts it:Unless youre a doubter and a worrier, a nail-biter, an apologizer, a rethinker, then memoir may not be your playpen.  Thats the quality Ive found most consistently in those life-story writers Ive met.  Truth is not their enemy.  Its the bannister they grab for when feeling around on the dark cellar stairs.  Its the solution.Karr has, of course, been writing and re-writing memoirs for a long time.  She has studied her favorite memoir writers (past and present) and has figuratively disassembled their best work to see what makes it tick.  For some three decades, she has taught the format and, along the way, has accumulated several thousand index cards filled with notes that she uses in the classroom.  For that reason, those looking to the book for specific writing tips and techniques will not be disappointed.  In truth, it seems that Karr may very well have had two specific audiences in mind when writing The Art of Memoir.  If so, both audiences will be satisfied.Parts of the book are aimed at both audiences  and, I suppose, at the third potential audience that might have one foot in each of the other two audiences.  Im thinking specifically of chapters like the one titled Dealing with Beloveds (On and Off the Page) in which Karr grapples with the issue of revealing personal details that have the potential to embarrass or enrage those one loves the most.  The chapter does end with an eleven-point list of the authors rules for dealing with others, but it also shares stories about her mothers immediate acceptance and encouragement of Karrs previous books and her sisters more reluctantly granted positive reaction to them.But it is the books Appendix, a listing of Required Reading, that I expect to return to often in order to root through the two hundred or so memoirs it lists for future reading choices of my own.  In fact, because I have only read about ten percent of the books on the list, those six pages particularly excite me.  There is something for everyone in this very fine addition to Mary Karrs body of work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I7OYK5QE3JJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062223062#wasThisHelpful","R3I7OYK5QE3JJJ","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My house is just large enough that I have a problem receiving a strong or consistent Wifi signal from my router (located in a front corner of the house) on my mobile devices when I try to use those devices in the rooms located on the opposite side of the house. The signal when I receive it is generally strong enough to do the job, but it tends to drop out completely every so often so that I can't depend on the devices working like I need them to work.In the past I have tried three or four other extenders with a couple of different routers provided by ATT uVerse but have, up to now, been unable to get the router and the extenders to work together.  For a while, I thought the same thing was about to happen because my attempt to set-up this extender via the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) failed three separate times. I now believe that AT&T has probably disabled the WPS button on the router itself and that's what causes the big problem.  But, as it turns out, the Browser-based setup procedure worked like a charm, and I had things configured the way I want them within just a few minutes.I am definitely getting a signal boost in the back rooms now, but I'm a little disappointed that the boost is not greater than it is (since this is the first extender I've used, maybe I expected...or hoped...for too much).  On average, the devices seem to be getting a signal one-bar higher than previously, but that's enough to satisfy me because the bigger problem of signal dropout has not been an issue since I connected the devices to the extended network.I'm happy with this product because it worked on an AT&T router...heck, I'm thrilled with that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJ196OB3N1OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Z3OCY6#wasThisHelpful","R2DJ196OB3N1OF","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first became aware of British flash fiction master Nik Perring with the publication of Not So Perfect, his collection of short short stories published in 2010.  That particular book was, in fact, also my introduction to the whole concept of flash fiction.  As I mentioned at the time, I was fascinated by a book from which I could read an entire story while sitting at one of the many traffic lights I encounter every day.  Then Perrings beautifully illustrated Freaks, a collection of stories featuring some of the most unique freaks and superheroes imaginable, came along  and I was hooked for sure.And now there is Beautiful Trees, the second book in a trilogy that will ultimately include Beautiful Words, Beautiful Trees, and Beautiful Shapes.  As in the past, the authors words are supplemented by illustrations that help bring the stories to life.  This is a picture book for adults, the story of Lily and Alexander, two people who love each other very much and often mark the milestones of their relationship through their shared love of trees.In one of the more poignant scenes of the book, for instance, Alexander brings a dwarf cherry tree to Lilys sickbed because of how another cherry tree played such a significant role in the couples first meeting. In fear of spoiling Beautiful Trees for others, Im going to stop here.  Lets just say that Nik Perring packs a lot of emotion and understanding of relationships into the relatively few pages he allows himself to tell his story.  And that is why I call Nik Perring one of the masters of flash fiction.Nik is a young man with an old soul  and I love his work for that very reason.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32M5NJAA614CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906894132#wasThisHelpful","R32M5NJAA614CW","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ted Koppels Lights Out is one of the scariest books you are going to read this year, or even anytime in the next five years - if what the book predicts hasnt already happened by then.  And you dont have to take my word for it, because a look at the books subtitle says it all: A Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath.It is the third part of that subtitle that I find particularly terrifying.  I have survived the aftermath of a major hurricane or two.  The last one knocked out my electricity for exactly 14 days, but during that extended downtime most of the rest of the city had regained power, so the social structure around me did not break down.  While living without power even for two weeks is no picnic, food, water, and cool air were available only a short drive away.Now imagine that your state and all of those surrounding yours are without power and that no one can tell you how long it will be before power is restored.  Communication has, in fact, broken down to the extent that no one can even tell you why the grid is down.  How long do you think it will be before for food and water shortages develop in the regions major cities?  How long before the smell of raw sewage forces everyone from their homes?  How long before armed thugs decide it is the perfect time to simply take what they want and to hell with everyone else?  According to Koppel, you have maybe a week if you are lucky.  Simply put, it very soon becomes an every man for himself and his family situation.Lights Out is divided into the three sections indicated by the books subtitle.  Cyberattack sets the stage by describing exactly how malicious hackers have already penetrated the computer systems that control the distribution of electricity throughout the United States.  Koppel, and the experts he interviewed, believe that software Trojan horses have already been left behind by the governments of Russia and China, and he fears that Islamist terrorists representing groups such as ISIS are close to having the capability of doing the same thing.  Bad as this is, the unleashing of the contents of those Trojan horses already in place is not extremely likely because the Russian and Chinese governments understand that the U.S. has placed similar malware inside key computer systems of their own governments.  This is the nuclear determent theory of the Cold War replayed.No, what scares Koppel and his experts is the possibility that terrorist-related hackers might do the same thing  and they have nothing to lose by triggering the collapse of the electricity grid of the U.S.  The main goal of groups like ISIS is to bring the world to its end, so those groups would welcome both the complete collapse of the U.S. social structure and any attempt at retaliation on our governments part.  But how do you even begin to retaliate against a group with no government and nothing to lose?  And identifying the source of such attacks is not easy, making it likely that the U.S. would retaliate against the wrong country or group anyway.  The terrorists are holding all the best cards in any such confrontation.The second section of Lights Out makes very clear just how unprepared this country is if and when such an attack occurs.  Not only are there no emergency plans in place to handle such a catastrophe, experts do not even agree that it can happen.  That means that nothingnothingis being done to prepare the country for what could be a war to forever end the United States as we know it today.I found the books third section, Surviving the Aftermath, to be a little disappointing.  I came away from this section without picking up any ideas that I, as an individual concerned about surviving the certain chaos that will quickly develop following the kind of massive and extended power outage that Koppel predicts, could actually use.  Rather than offer the kind of advice I hoped for, the author more often points out the futility and ultimate foolishness of most of what individual survivalists and more structured groups (such as the Mormon Church) are already doing.So where are we?  Most people are not even aware of the potential threat, much less trying to do anything to keep themselves and their families safe if the threat materializes.  Most politicians dont even want to talk about this.  Industry experts cannot agree on the likelihood of such an attack on the U.S. or what to do if it does happen.  Almost no one with any authority is talking about making the changes that would safeguard the collapse of this countrys electrical grid.  And the time bomb already inside that grid continues to tick.Yes, Lights Out will make readers very, very nervous, but we have to hope that the right people read this book and take it seriously.  Read it yourself.  Talk about it and pass it on to others who will read it and talk about it.  Do your best to help Lights Out get the attention it deserves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIWEXIPSAFJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UQERM4C#wasThisHelpful","RXIWEXIPSAFJG","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frankly, I do not know what to think about John Steinbecks Tortilla Flat.  On the one hand, this 1935 novel is an entertaining look at life through the eyes of a bunch of men whose biggest concern in life is where their next bottle of wine is coming from; on the other, the novel tends to leave the impression that everyone living in the Tortilla Flat section of Monterey, California, is shiftless and lazy.  And that impression, considering that all the characters in Tortilla Flat are (or would be called in todays terms) Hispanics, is not one that leaves the reader very comfortable.Danny and his friends are actually paisanos.  As Steinbeck puts it, a paisano is a mixture of Spanish, Indian, Mexican and assorted Caucasian bloods.  His ancestors have lived in California for a hundred or two yearswhen questioned concerning his race, he indignantly claims pure Spanish blood and rolls up his sleeve to show that the soft inside of his arm is nearly white.Dannys crew has more in common than the love of drink.  He and several of his friends, in a moment of drunken patriotism, joined the military at the outbreak of World War I, and now they have returned one-by-one to Tortilla Flat to resume the lives they temporarily abandoned.  The boys had varying degrees of success during the war.  Danny himself never left the States, others of them saw the fighting, and at least one of them spent most of the war in the brig.  But now they are home and they have resumed a shiftless lifestyle that sees them working only long enough to earn the next bottle or two of wine.Then Danny receives something of a mixed blessing when he inherits the two Tortilla Flat houses owned by his elderly grandfather.  His neighborhood prestige and status are immediately enhanced, but Danny is quick to feel the burdens of property ownership - and, rather than being excited by his windfall, Danny is troubled and unhappy.  It is only when his friends begin to move into his houses with him that Danny is finally able to settle into his new lifestyle, but even then he misses the carefree (and often violent) lifestyle that he lived before the war.  Danny simply misses his old life: When Danny thought of the old lost time, he could taste again how good the stolen food was, and he longed for that old time again.  Since his inheritance had lifted him, he had not fought often.  He had been drunk, but not adventurously so.  Always the weight of the house was upon him; always the responsibility to his friends.Danny and his friends may be living lives filled with personal tragedy, but they live and love exactly as they wish.  They are their own men and, although most of us would condemn their habits and their lifestyles, they are happy.  But looking at the novle through todays eyes, I still dont know what to think of Tortilla Flat.  Is it insensitive and unfair, or is it simply a well-written product of its times?  Each of us, I suppose, will have to decide that for ourselves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VEDEASQJC74F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS74WD4#wasThisHelpful","R1VEDEASQJC74F","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im not going to pretend that I have read every word that Jack London wrote during his brilliant career.  Has anyone actually done that, I wonder?  But I can certainly say that even before picking up Bybliotechs e-book version of The Complete Jack London, I was familiar with many of the authors novels and short stories, plus fragments from some of his biographical memoirs.  I suppose that is why I was so intrigued when I first saw the complete Jack London in one huge e-book volume.Now that Ive spent some time reading from The Complete Jack London, I think that publishing the complete works of classic authors in single volumes is a brilliant idea  especially when those collections are made available at as reasonable a price as the London book is being sold at.  Think about it for a second: 22 novels, 214 short stories, 43 poems, 6 plays, plus all of Londons letters, memoirs, and other non-fiction.  All right there just waiting to be read at your leisure.Best of all, though, think about how massive a printed version of this collection would be, how many volumes that would entail and what it would have to cost just to cover the expense of producing it.  Now picture it sitting on your e-reader, all properly indexed so that all you have to do is click on any of the links from the Table of Contents in order to instantly have access to your chosen title.  Huge, huge difference, and while I usually choose printed books over e-books, this is one time that I have to concede that e-books win hands down.The only problem I have with something that markets itself as complete is that I have to take the publishers word for whether anything is missing or left out for whatever reasons.  Im no Jack London scholar, and I dont have the time or the inclination to do a lot of research to figure this out.  All I can say is that if the collection is not complete, it contains more than enough reading to keep me Jack- London- satisfied for the rest of my life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADCG2ZI3P8C4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HE0ZEXM#wasThisHelpful","R3ADCG2ZI3P8C4","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elena Ferrante is one of the publishing worlds biggest mysteries of the moment.  Despite her great sales and critical success, no one seems to know who the woman (if she really is a woman) is.  There is even speculation that her four-book Neapolitan series is more of a memoir than a novel serialization.  And there is little doubt that all of the mystery surrounding Ferrante and her books has increased the attention they are getting.  All that said, if the first book in the Neapolitan series, 2012s My Brilliant Friend, is any indication, the series is indeed a strong one, and the books are capable of standing on their own.My Brilliant Friend introduces two little girls who first meet in the early 1950s in a poor neighborhood just outside Naples.  Elena (the books first person narrator) and Lila are two of the brightest students in their neighborhood school and, being top candidates for the schools highest honors, their relationship soon becomes more a friendly rivalry than a friendship.  Elena, though, is a bit intimidated by the ease with which Lila seems to acquire and display her knowledge.  After a while, Elena is content to be number two to Lilas number one and that is the only achievement she really strives for.The novel actually opens in the present, with both women now in their sixties and still friends of a sort.  It seems that Lila has disappeared without a trace and that her son, after waiting two full weeks, has decided finally to call Elena to see if she knows where Lila could be.  Ferrante uses this opening segment to segue neatly into how the women first met and how their decades-long relationship slowly evolved over time.  My Brilliant Friend is, in fact, a coming-of-age narrative for both our narrator and for her supposed closest friend, Lila.Elena and Lila live in a very self-contained little neighborhood in which everyone knows and tracks the intimacies of everyone else.  Certain families, it seems, made their fortunes during and just following World War II, a period that left Italy in the kind of chaos in which huge profits could be made from a thriving black-market.  Those families are still the most powerful ones in the neighborhood  and they are not to be crossed.  As the girls make their way through childhood and adolescence, they experience the usual emotions and pains of those phases of life.  Sometimes they are intimate friends, but at other times they barely speak for weeks, or even months.  They and their friends have good times, but life is easy for none of them.Ferrante has created a wide cast of well developed characters in My Brilliant Friend that will serve her well for the next three books in the series.  Speculation as to whether or not the books are based on Ferrantes own life and memories offers a little twist to reading her, but that doesnt really matter.  What counts most is that she is one heck of a storyteller.  This is literary fiction near its best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LO9ZJDZVSRHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008H7KGFC#wasThisHelpful","R1LO9ZJDZVSRHO","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Glenn Beck is making a point in It IS About Islam that is so obvious that only willful deniers are likely to disagree with it: radical Islam is at the root of the terrorism, barbarism, and genocide that plagues the world today.  For political reasons, many of the world leaders do not want to admit this very real truth, perhaps fearing that aggressive language on their part will bring them exactly the unwanted attention from Islamist terrorists that they want so badly to avoid.  But it is time to face the fact that in the absence of this particular religious doctrine from the eighth century, the world would be a better and safer place for all of us, including todays Muslims.As Beck points out, this is not a new problem.  It IS About Islam begins with a brief history of President Thomas Jeffersons study of the Quran and his battle to control the Barbary (North African) States that were kidnapping and enslaving American sailors because they believed that the Quran gave them exactly that right  and duty.  Muslim negotiators of the period, in fact, justified their actions by using the same passages from the Quran that are used by todays terrorists to justify their own murderous intents.It IS About Islam is divided into three parts: Islam 101 (a relatively detailed explanation of what is in the Quran and of the religions history); Thirteen Deadly Lies ( a rebuttal of the myths about Islam that Islamist apologists and too many our own politicians would have us believe); and What Can Be Done (a short discussion of several changes to our approach that would increase our chances of defeating those who want to destroy us and our world).As Beck puts it in the books introduction: The lies include the oft-heard claims that Islam is a religion of peace, that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism, that Islam respects the rights of women and Christians, and that sharia law is a myth made up by Islamophobes.And as he damningly and clearly states on page 204 of the book: Jihads cost to civilization is incalculable.  Over the centuries, Muslim armies have burned libraries, razed cities, and conquered large swaths of the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Europe.  The have enslaved, starved, and massacred millions of men, women, and children  all in the name of Islam.the jihadists are not distorting their religion.  They believe theyre acting in accordance with their faith and they can cite chapter and verse to justify every beheading, crucifixion, act of vandalism, and degradation of the infidels who happen to get in their way.Almost all of the worlds major religions have evolved over the centuries to the point where they reject the barbarism preached every Friday in so many of the worlds mosques.  Only one religion is allowing itself to remain stuck in the Dark Ages, and it is long past time that the governments of the world admit the extent of the threat that all non-Muslim governments (and even some Muslim ones) are facing from Islamism.  I do not agree with everything that Beck says in this book (for example, making the fight one of directly pitting the rest of the worlds religions against Islam), but his message needs to be heard.And Beck and his people made the decision to publish It IS About Islam only in paperback so that more people can afford to get their hands on it and share it with others.  Please read this book before you condemn it because you dislike its author.It, and you, are better than that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSRKGH7XFZN03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRBQODC#wasThisHelpful","RSRKGH7XFZN03","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read Travels with Charley in the mid-seventies, long before I heard any rumblings about how John Steinbeck fabricated many of the incidents and conversations included in this memoir about his solitary travels across the country.  I found that first reading to be so fascinating that I remember praising the book and recommending it to friends for weeks after I had finished it.  So I was both curious and a little afraid to see how I would feel about the book after reading it again some four decades later.  Well, I am happy to report that I still love the book, even knowing what I know now about some of it being fiction rather than Steinbecks actual travel experiences.Steinbeck began his journey in September 1960 from his Sag Harbor, New York, home and stayed on the road for the next eleven weeks (with the exception of one brief interlude to meet his wife in Chicago, during which, from the sound of it, he stayed in a rather posh hotel).  During those weeks he made his way through some 33 states (although a few seem to have been really rushed) where he spoke with as many people as possible about the social upheavals and politics of the day.  Steinbeck left Sag Harbor and drove to Maine before turning west toward Seattle.  From Seattle, the author turned southward to visit his old haunts in California, traveled across the American Southwest, and sped through much of Texas before driving through most of the Deep South, turning northward again in South Carolina for his return trip to New York.America was experiencing turbulent and dangerous times in late 1960, an ugly period vividly portrayed in that portion of Travels with Charley in which Steinbeck recounts what he observed in New Orleans when that city was trying to integrate its public schools.  This is likely to be the most memorable and disturbing part of the entire book for most readers because of how clearly it reminds us that our not too distant past can never truthfully be dubbed the good old days.  It was not even close.  The incident was so ugly, in fact, that it effectively ended Steinbecks journey even though he was still a long way from home.I admit to being a little disappointed that Steinbeck misrepresented the origin of some of what he claims happened in Travels with Charley mainly because it makes me wonder if he simply set out with a specific agenda in mind and made sure that he got the answers that supported his own views about the social condition of the country.  Even in my first reading of the book, I found some of the conversations between the author and those he happened upon to be a little stilted and unrealistic.  At the time, I wrote that off as simply Steinbecks failure to remember the exact words used (he did not use a recorder) in those conversations.  But even now that much has been exposed about the authors methods, I can say that I both enjoyed the memoir and recommend it to others.  I do, however, rate it a full star lower now than I did the first time around.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38E8DP4RWBM6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008U45WIS#wasThisHelpful","R38E8DP4RWBM6Q","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a fan of Paul Theroux's travel writing for a long time, particularly enjoying the way his work allows the reader to become so totally immersed in worlds that would otherwise forever remain a mystery.  Via his books, I have traveled by train, boats, and automobile to places I am unlikely ever to see with my own eyes.  And along the way, I've learned a lot about people, places, and myself.But this time around, Theroux has written about a region of the U.S. that I know quite well, the section of the country that has come to be called the ""Deep South.""  I was born in East Texas (a part of Texas that is far more Deep South than it is Southwestern United States), have extensive family roots in Louisiana, and have taken close, leisurely looks at the states the author travels through in Deep South.  As a result, I wish that I could have a long, personal conversation with Theroux because, while I do not think that his assessment of the South is all that far off, I find myself wondering about some of his conclusions and wanting to tell him what he may have missed.Theroux is largely sympathetic to the plight of the Deep South, its generational poverty and hopelessness disturbs him - and it should.  He rightly lambasts charities like the one run by the Clintons for sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Africa when the same problems they are focusing on in that continent exist in their own back yards.  He is particularly hard on the Clinton foundation because of the way that it ignores the problems so common in Bill Clinton's own home state of Arkansas.  As he points out, most agencies working on domestic poverty and education issues have budgets in the hundreds of thousands, not in the hundreds of millions.But at the heart of Deep South, as it should be, is the issue of race relations, and I think that Theroux nailed it here.  From my own observation and interaction (as a white man not much younger than the author) in little towns in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and South Carolina, I came to similar conclusions about the white-black relationship in those places.  On the surface, based solely on the behavior that outsiders are allowed to see (and what Southerners want to believe about themselves) the relationship between the two races is better today than it ever has been.  Scratch that surface a bit though, and there is still much hidden suspicion and animosity on both sides.  Prejudice towards, and fear of, each other is very common to both whites and blacks in the region, something that will not be entirely overcome for decades to come, if ever.  Such is the nature of human beings.Where I think Theroux is a bit off in his observations is in his impression that the American South is home to few books and readers.  This is a point that the author returns to several times, and it is one that, in my estimation, he over-simplifies.  While I am not surprised that he found few readers and even fewer filled bookshelves in the homes of the Southerners he came to know, Theroux seems to have forgotten that he was most often spending his time with people who have little discretionary income to spend on luxuries like books - and that they have little ready access to books whether they want them or not.  Books, after all, are seldom a high priority item for people living below or near poverty level.  In only slightly larger cities than the ones Theroux spent most of his time in, I have managed to have casual, ""bookish"" conversations with the people I randomly met along the way.  I have seen people dining alone and reading a book to kill the the boredom; I have visited tiny libraries and talked books with librarians and patrons; and I have visited many literary landmarks in the region.This is a rather small quibble with Theroux's overall impression of the Deep South.  But, as I say, I would love to sit down with him some day over a beer or two so that I could perhaps tell him some of the things that his Southern friends did not tell him during his four seasons of travel among them, things that I think would temper some of the conclusions he has come to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JQ7O9BZENKW5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPHKR0K#wasThisHelpful","R3JQ7O9BZENKW5","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started reading Mark Twain when I was about twelve years old, and over the decades I have come to read a substantial portion of his novels, essays, and other writing, including even his very long autobiography.  Too, I have read collections of his letters, biographies, and books about his books, so I was already pretty much aware that Mark Twains personality often bore little resemblance to that of Samuel Clemens.  But still, I was unaware of the scandal involving Clemens and Isabel Lyon until I read last years nonfiction account of it in Laura Trombleys Mark Twains Other Woman (one of the many books used in Lynn Cullens research for Twains End).  So when I heard about Cullens new novel about Twains dedicated effort to ruin the reputation of his longtime secretary, I was eager to get my hands on it.Twains End can certainly be read straight through like an ordinary novel, but it might be more meaningful if one starts with the authors presentation of her impressive research sources and techniques.  Best of all, Cullen shrewdly uses excerpts from Isabel Lyons actual diary as the basic, chronological structure of her novel.  Then, with the basic facts established, it is up to Cullen to speculate about the motives, hidden agendas, personalities, newspaper sensationalism, and half-truths that inevitably shadow a scandal of this nature.  And what Cullen reveals about Mark Twain, Clara Clemens, Jean Clemens, Olivia Clemens, Helen Keller, Anne Sullivan Macy, and John Macy is not often pretty.Sam Clemens originally hired Isabel Lyon as the personal secretary of his ailing wife, but in reality, even from the beginning, she served more as secretary and manager of the day-to-day affairs of the entire Clemens family.  The Clemens family was not a happy one when Lyon entered the picture, and it was certainly not a happy family when she left it.  One daughter, Suzy, was dead; another, Jean, was in and out of asylums; and Clara had a volatile relationship with her overprotective father.  And sadly enough, Olivia Clemens strongly suspected that her husband was physically attracted to his secretary.Twains End is the story of the slowly evolving relationship between Sam Clemens, Isabel Lyon, and Clara Clemens.  As presented by Lynn Cullen, the relationship may have been slow to develop, but it was an inevitable one that finally ran its course because Isabel Lyon was patient enough to bide her time.  In the end, however, Lyons dreams were frustrated and denied her.  And when she finally gave them up and married a younger suitor, Clemens cut her off, accused her of embezzlement of his personal funds, and made a concerted effort to ruin her reputation and life.  No one, not a single person, in this sordid story exactly covers himself with glory.Twains End will be of interest to Mark Twain fans yearning to know more about what made the man tick.  I enjoyed much of the story, but found that it left me wishing that more time had been spent on the embezzlement aspect of the relationship and a good bit less on the romance itself.  My biggest surprise was the side plot involving Helen Keller, Anne Sullivan Macy, and Sullivans cad of a husband, John Macy.  Thats a story (and a side of Keller) that I want to explore more in my reading, so heres hoping that Lynn Cullen writes a novel about that trio next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDQSZZXPMZ4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNJ44#wasThisHelpful","R3KDQSZZXPMZ4H","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fateful Lightning is the fourth and final book in Jeff Shaaras story of the Civil War as it was fought in the American west.  The book, a detailed account regarding Shermans March to the Sea, follows three previous novels dedicated to the battles of Shiloh, Vicksburg, and Chattanooga.  As in each of the books preceding this one, Shaara tells his story by allowing the reader to walk in the boots of several key real-life characters from both sides of the tragic struggle.As it should be, the books primary focus is on Union general William Tecumseh Sherman, the chief engineer behind the slash and burn ride that hastened the end of the war.  In addition to seeing the march from Shermans point of view, Shaara has his readers do the same from the points of view of two of Shermans adversaries: General William Joseph Hardee and Captain James Seeley, a Confederate cavalryman.  And, interestingly, the books fourth main character is a slave known throughout the book only as Franklin because he has never even considered the possibility of having a first name of his own.  (When first questioned by the Union officer who befriends him, Franklin is not even sure whether Franklin is a first or a last name  all he knows is that it is his only name.)The Fateful Lightning begins on November 16, 1864 as Sherman begins to move his army out of Atlanta, a city that has been largely destroyed as a result of his army having taken it.  It ends on April 25, 1865 (seventeen days after Lees surrender of his army to Grant) in Raleigh, North Carolina, when Sherman receives the letter that will finally allow him to relax:  Confederate general Johnstons surrender of the largest segment of the Confederate army still in the field.  From that moment, the American Civil War is effectively over.Sherman was a complicated man, one I have had mixed emotions about for a very long time.  With time, I have come to be an admirer of his military skills and his willingness to fight a total war on the South in order to end the fighting as quickly as possible.  But as a born and bred Southerner, I have long wished that Southern civilians had not had to suffer so greatly at his hands.  For that reason, I think that the real beauty of Jeff Shaaras historical fiction is the way it humanizes historical figures to a degree that makes them  be they sympathetic ones or more questionable ones  the real people they were, with all the weaknesses and doubts that the rest of us have.I have read a lot of Civil War history in the last few decades, much of it associated with Shermans march.  But I can honestly say that after reading The Fateful Lightning, I have a better understanding of that famous (which is still more infamous than famous to most Southerners) campaign than I had coming in to it.  At well over 600 pages in length, this one takes a while, but it is time well spent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H4HG7KUA1EQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NDTQQQC#wasThisHelpful","R2H4HG7KUA1EQF","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To a God Unknown, John Steinbecks second novel, uses a theme that often appears in his work, one that Ive come to call the broken dreams theme.  The short novel also examines closely the deep attachment that farmers and ranchers have to their land and how the same religious superstitions that can so easily comfort some will cause great stress and pain to others.Young Joseph Wayne is the third of his fathers four sons, and he is not at all satisfied with his status as third son.  Joseph yearns for a place of his own where he can create a homestead capable of comfortably supporting him and his offspring for generations to come.  He has a clear vision and he is determined to make it a reality, so with his fathers reluctant blessing, Joseph leaves Vermont in favor of starting a new life in California.  With no firm location in mind, Joseph wanders until he reaches central Californias long valley known as Nuestra Seora.  And in Nuestra Seora, with the help of a proud Castilian sidekick, Joseph begins to build his dream home.Things go so well for Joseph that upon his fathers death, he easily convinces his brothers to bring their families to California to join him on the land that he believes will forever be home to the Wayne family.  But, as Joseph and his three brothers will learn the hard way, not all dreams come true, and Josephs does not even come close to becoming reality.To a God Unknown is a novel filled with mysticism, paganism, and the deeply felt Christian beliefs of a simpler people living in simpler, more isolated times.  At times it takes a combination of all three belief systems to bring Joseph any comfort, but in the end, nothing is strong enough to save him and his family from the despair and destruction toward which they are inevitably headed.  It is life itself that finally breaks Joseph Wayne, once and forever.To a God Unknown is filled with characters: the many members of Josephs immediate family, their spouses and children, and numerous locals of Anglo, Mexican and Spanish descent.  Unfortunately, almost none of the characters have much of a ring of authenticity about them, and the tragic plot of the novel loses much of its impact because this.  This is not one of Steinbecks finest efforts, but it was another good step for him toward becoming the excellent writer that he would ultimately be.  Even if for that reason alone, Steinbeck fans will want to give this one a look.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYPYHG37668P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QIGZ6S#wasThisHelpful","R1DYPYHG37668P","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tim Hallinans Poke Rafferty series hit the ground running in 2007 with A Nail Through the Heart and it has never slowed down.  And with the October 2015 release of The Hot Countries, the seventh book in the series, Poke Rafferty fans again have reason to celebrate.Longtime fans will already know this, but for the uninitiated, Ill give a little basic background about Poke Rafferty and those closest to him.  Poke is a semi-successful travel writer whose travel guides are a bit offbeat in the way that they sometimes focus on the seedier sides of the cities he is exploring  and thats exactly what he was looking to do when he came to Bangkok.  But along the way, life happened.  Poke is now married to Rose, a former bar girl, and they are living happily together with Miaow, their adopted daughter.  (Miaow, who was living on the streets when Poke spotted her, is probably my favorite character in the whole series.)But Poke is more, much more, than just a travel guide writer.  The man is a born fixer, and he does not mind getting his hands dirty.  When he sees someone suffering at the hands of others, he wants to fix it  and with the help of some friends he usually does just that.  Pokes most important helper is Arthit, a high-ranking Thai policeman, who also just happens to be Pokes best friend.  The relationship between these two strong men has, in fact, been a beautiful thing to watch as it has developed and deepened over the seven books.But now, in The Hot Countries, everyone closest to Poke is being threatened by a mysterious stranger who wants two things from Poke and will gladly kill any number of innocent people if it forces Poke to give him what he wants.  But there are two problems: Poke does not even have one of the things being demanded of him, and he will be damned if he will give up the other one.  And so it begins.But as the bodies begin to fall and he ever so slowly closes in on the man responsible, Poke will get some help from the unlikeliest group of heroes imaginable: a bunch of seedy old men who came to Bangkok decades ago strictly to enjoy the citys wide open sex trade.  Now, whats left of these men spend their days and nights hanging out at the Expat Bar, where they do their best to pretend that they are still the young, virile men who first sat on one of those barstools so many long years ago.  And who knows?  Maybe they do still have a little gas left in the tank after all.Hallinan, in one paragraph, captures the sad essence of these men.  Here is part of that paragraph: One night on Patpong around 3 a.m., exhausted, half drunk, and unwilling to return to the home he hand turned into a shrine to her (the Thai woman he was still in love with) he walked into a tiny place called the Expat Bar.  And he stayed for forty-three years.Getting old.The ending of The Hot Countries achieved something that rarely happens to me when I am reading: it left me with a tear in my eye.  I am a fan of series writing because of the way the good ones so fully develop not only the main character, but also several supporting characters.  I have read in and out of many crime fiction series since the eighties, and a few of them are so remarkable that they have become longtime favorite books of mine.  The Poke Rafferty series has earned its place among this select group.  I look forward (and hope) to be reading more Poke Rafferty stories for a long, long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CLEINT0AX7FG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V28NXC6#wasThisHelpful","R3CLEINT0AX7FG","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I picked up Mike Bonds Killing Maine all I really knew about the novel was that it is the second book in the authors Pono Hawkins crime thriller series.  But because I had read and enjoyed Saving Paradise (the first book in the series) so much back in 2013, I thought I knew pretty much what to expect.  As it turns out, my assumptions were not even close because Killing Maine is a whole lot more than I figured on.Killing Maine is an angry novel and Mike Bond is an angry author.  Bond is not happy about a segment of the energy industry that declares itself to be environmentally friendly, but in reality destroys the environment, slaughters wildlife, and drives people from their homes wherever it leaves its dirty footprints.  Lets call it Big Wind, because those profiting from the construction of wind turbines to be used for the generation of electrical power are certainly full of exactly that according to Mike Bond and Pono Hawkins, the chief protagonist of Killing Maine.Pono Hawkins is a well-known surfer, not only in Hawaii where he lives, but all over the world.  As Killing Maine begins though, he is in Maine, a long way from the Hawaiian beaches he loves so dearly  and he is freezing his butt off.  But Pono is a Special Forces vet, and when any other Special Forces vet needs his help, Pono is going to answer that call.  And thats why someone is shooting at him today in a remote Maine forest where he is almost as likely to freeze to death as to die from the shooters aim.Like something out of The War of the Worlds, Maine has been invaded and conquered by the hundreds of gigantic wind turbines that are lined up in rows that make them appear to be marching across the clear-cut countryside.  They are, in reality, spreading so fast that no homeowner in the area is free from their threat  and the turbines are so environmentally unfriendly that no human being, and very few animals, can live comfortably anywhere around them because of the irritating sound tones they almost constantly produce.  Now a man who once saved Ponos life in combat is in prison, charged with the murder of a Big Wind promoter.  Pono knows that Bucky has to be innocent, so even though he really cant stand the guy, when Buckys wife (a one-time lover of Ponos) explains the situation to him, he knows he has to help.  His personal honor code leaves him no choice.Thus begins the second round of Ponos battle to expose Big Wind for what it is.  But even though he survived his first round with them in Saving Paradise, Pono is going to find it very difficult to repeat that success.  And even if he does survive, chances are good that he will spend most of the rest of his life in prison because Maines corrupt cops and politicians are trying to hang every new felony in the state on him while he is there working to free Bucky.Like the first book in this series, Killing Maine is quite a ride for those who love good crime thrillers.  But, too, like its predecessor, it is much more than just another rousing crime thriller.  This is another of Mike Bonds environmental eye-openers that will leave readers a lot wiser about alternative energy plans, state and federal politics, and the huge profits that are being stolen from the pockets of American taxpayers by the scam artists who often surround an industry like this one.  I cant recommend this one strongly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1UXSZG5920R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0139SUXQU#wasThisHelpful","RB1UXSZG5920R","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chicago Noir: The Classics is my ninth experience with the wonderful Akashic Books series of noir short stories since I discovered them a while back.  In addition to this Chicago collection, I have enjoyed the books set in Manila, Belfast, Long Island, Boston, Mexico City, the Lone Star state of Texas, Providence, and one set entirely inside prisons.  I was particularly interested in getting my hands on Chicago Noir because that citys reputation for political corruptness is the first thing that many people think when they hear the word Chicago.  Even the books editor, Joe Meno, stressed that reputation in his introductory comments: Only in Chicago do instituted color lines offer generation after generation of poverty and violence, only in Chicago do the majority of recent governors do prison time, only in Chicago do the dead actually vote twice.  With its public record of bribery, cronyism, and fraud, this is a metropolis so deeply divided  by race, ethnicity, and class  that sociologists had to develop a new term to describe this unfortunate bifurcation.  As Nelson Algren best put it, Chicago is and has always been a city on the make.But all that said, the stories in Chicago Noir seem to stretch the definition of noir to a greater degree than any of the other collections Im familiar with.  Granted, these stories are labeled as The Classics, and some of them are decades old, but I found myself wondering several times whether they really fit in this particular collection.There is, for instance, a wonderful story from 1945 by Richard Wright called The Man Who Went to Chicago.  While this is one of my two favorite stories from the entire collection, I struggle to fit it within the confines of my personal definition of the term noir.  It takes place entirely within a Chicago Medical District research lab, and the only crimes committed are an aborted knife fight that causes damage to the lab and the workers decision to cover up the fact that the resulting damage ruined the research studies being conducted there.  It is dark only in the sense that it exposes the horrible racial discrimination so common to those times.Now, my other favorite story from Chicago Noir: The Classics leaves no room to doubt that it belongs in any collection of noir fiction.  This one is called Ill Cut Your Throat Again, Kathleen, and it was written by Fredric Brown way back in 1948.  The story is brutal, has a couple of unforgettably duplicitous characters in it, and the most shocking ending of any story in the entire collection.  It is only the second time I have read Fredric Brown and it is enough to make me search for more of his work.As in most short story collections, the stories in Chicago Noir: The Classics are a bit uneven.  Perhaps that is purposeful and done in hopes that there is something in the collection that will appeal to everyone who picks it up.  If so, that might be a legitimate reason for packaging them together.  But a couple of stories were so formulaic that I wished I had not bothered with them at all.  Its as if they were written to spec even though they were from 1995 and 2009.  But overall, this is a worthy addition to the Akashic Books noir series, and I am happy to add it to my collection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDB0YMNZXG8TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011H510OG#wasThisHelpful","RDB0YMNZXG8TO","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am impressed with these Skullcandy Grind Headphones for a couple of reasons: sound quality and comfort.I do a lot of yard work that involves light tree trimming and the like, something that becomes crashingly boring after about 30 minutes, so I like to listen to music while doing the work.  I am located just outside Houston, Texas, and for large parts of the year we are burdened by very high humidity levels.  That means that comfort while outdoors is very important.  To stay as comfortable as possible when working outdoors, I've taken to listening to music through headphones attached to a mobile phone carried in a pocket.  That works particularly well, I've found, with the Skullcandy headphones because they are so lightweight and the earpieces so soft and light that I am able to wear the headphones for two or more hours at a time without them ever starting to ""pinch"" my ears.  I've tired at least half a dozen other brands of headphones, some much more expensive than these, and have never been able to wear them comfortably for so long.  So BIG PLUS for that.As for sound quality, you have to remember that a mobile phone is most often my source.  Despite that, the sound quality is way more than acceptable and I never find myself wishing for a ""better"" pair of headphones when I'm using these.My only complaint is that the controls on the left earpiece are placed in such a spot that I inadvertently turn them off every time I reach back to adjust them to my ears...something I tend to do every ten minutes or so when sweating outdoors.  For a while, I thought I was causing the phone receiver to shut off because I had dislodged the connection between the speakers and the phone.  When I finally figured out what I was doing, it became a simple matter of pressing the control another couple of times to resume programming.  No big deal, really, but do wish the control bar had been placed a little higher up on the ear piece so that I would not unintentionally press it so often.That's the only reason I rate these a four-star product rather than a five-star one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZBUR4UY89CBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TS1AZJ8#wasThisHelpful","RZBUR4UY89CBP","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without a doubt, Kim Philby is one of the most despicable human beings who have ever existed.  The damage he did to his country (Great Britain) and its allies before, during, and after World War II was so great that it still cannot be completely and accurately measured.  It is not an exaggeration, however, to say that Philbys actions cost thousands of allied lives and even prolonged the course of the Cold War.  The real question about a man like Kim Philby is how they become the despicable creatures they are.  It is easy to say that such people do it for the money, that greed is the motivator in cases like Philbys, but as Ben MacIntyre shows in his remarkable Philby biography, A Spy Among Friends, it is not always that simple.What made Kim Philby so good at spying for the Russians was that you just could not help but like the guy.  He paid attention to everyone he met (that is, everyone who could help him supply state secrets to his Russian handlers) and, to a man, everyone who received his friendship felt that it was sincerely offered, that Philby truly treasured the friendship.  Even Nicholas Elliott, a fellow member of Britains intelligence services, was so taken by Philby that he considered Kim Philby to be the best friend he ever had  and their friendship lasted a whole lifetime during which Philby used Elliotts inside knowledge to pass on countless pieces of damaging information to the Russians who owned his soul.Philby was a charmer.  As MacIntyre puts it, Philby could inspire and convey affection with such ease that few ever noticed they were being charmed.  Male and female, old and young, rich and poor, Kim enveloped them all.  Did he ever.  It all started when Philby was a student at Cambridge.  And it would not end until decades later when Russian defectors, some of whom knew enough about the well-placed Philby to point fingers in his direction, started looking for a safe haven for themselves outside the crumbling Soviet Union.  By then, of course, Philby had done so much damage that his exposure was an embarrassment to the British government.MacIntyre, in fact, makes a strong case in A Spy Among Friends that Kim Philby was allowed to escape to Russia (rather than being subjected to what would have been an embarrassing investigation and trial) in 1963 where he would live a rather pitiful life until his death in 1988.  Nicholas Elliott, Philbys supposed best friend, was allowed to be the intelligence officer finally to confront Philby with his disgrace.  Elliott, however, made no effort to have Philby placed into immediate custody or even to have him followed.  The man was simply allowed to slip away  so he did.In the end, Elliott despised Philby as much as any man alive can despise another.  He was betrayed by someone he considered to be something of a soul mate, and that betrayal almost killed him.  But Elliott mourned the loss of his friend to his own dying day.  That is the kind of charm that made Kim Philby such a dangerous man, and one of the most effective spies of the twentieth century.

"Its not that I havent read a lot of British fiction.  Like many Americans (especially those of us of a certain age), I grew up on books by British writers.  I have read hundreds of them over the years, books covering just about every period of British history right up to contemporary life in the U.K.  And I lived in London for much of the nineties.  But the England Neil Grimmett describes in The Hoard is such a surrealistically haunting place that I find myself still thinking about it some two weeks after I turned the last page of Grimmetts dark thriller.The Hoard is based upon a real-life explosion that occurred at Bridgewaters Royal Ordinance Factory in 1951, a horrendous, never explained, explosion that killed an entire production crew.  Starting with that incident, Grimmett builds a scenario in which the factorys higher-ups are involved in a complicated plot through which they are hoarding unaccounted for high-explosives to be smuggled out of the factory later as they are sold to the highest bidder.  Now, almost thirty years later, it is time to cash in.  The culprits are all old men looking to feather their nests before calling it a day  time is running out.But there is one problem, a big one, and his name is Byron.Byrons father, you see, was killed in the original explosion, and Byron has come to suspect that his fathers death was murder  not an accident.  More importantly, he has gotten a job inside the ordinance factory and he is determined to find out what really happened on the day his father died.  But whom can he trust?  And what will happen to him and anyone helping him if he is exposed for what he is: a man on a mission to bring down some of the most powerful and influential men in all of Bridgewater?The Hoard is a rather complicated, first-rate, thriller but I will remember it primarily for its distinct setting and atmosphere.  The Bridgewater of Grimmetts novel can be described as a one-company town gone terribly bad.  Everything one can imagine to be wrong about a town completely dominated by a single employer whose every resident depends entirely upon the company for his livelihood is here in spades.  The corrupt managers of the Royal Ordinance Factory demand complete loyalty and silence from employees.  What they see and do inside the factory is never to be spoken of outside the factory gates.  Workers who dare get a little too curious are dealt with harshly  that is, if they even live long enough to regret their curiosity.The Hoard is quite a ride even for experienced thriller fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUME22K7ASSX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGLPNF8#wasThisHelpful","R1EUME22K7ASSX","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simply put, I love this little guy.1.  The speaker folds up rather compactly when it is not being used.2.  Connecting my various devices to the speaker via bluetooth was both quick and painless.  It is all very intuitively done.3.  The sound varies with the device, of course, but it is of a generally acceptable quality no matter which device I use it with.  Worst sound comes when the speaker is connected to my old phone (but it is much better thru my iPhone 6).  Best sound comes from iPad connection.4.  The controls are simple and they are clearly marked.  It's pretty much on-off, DC in, Audio in, bluetooth, and pairing.  That's it.  That's all it does and it does it well.My only quibble is the pretty awful turquoise color that my speaker is.  If I were 12 years old, I would probably love the color, but I'm not and much prefer the blacks and grays when it comes to speaker color (and, yes, I see that this speaker does come in blackish gray of some sort).Overall, very nice...","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35FUPYE8GG7OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3B9MQI#wasThisHelpful","R35FUPYE8GG7OP","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zadie Smiths 2012 novel, NW, makes for an unusual reading experience, one that is sometimes as frustrating as it is gratifying.  The NW of her title refers to northwest London, a section of the city Smith is intimately familiar with as a result of having grown up there herself.  The good news is that this familiarity allows Smith to create a core group of memorable characters for NW, some of whom have known each other well for a lifetime, and others who know each other only to the degree that they recognize everyone in the neighborhood from having seen the same old faces on the streets day after day.  The bad news is that Smith decided to use a different writing style for each section of the novel.  That makes it difficult for the reader ever to settle into a comfortable enough reading rhythm for the story to take over and flow on its own.  Getting the most from NW begins as a chore  and it ends that way  making it likely that some readers will abandon the book long before they make it through its first section.The book revolves around the relationship between its two main characters, Leah Hanwell, a white woman of Irish descent, and Keisha Blake, a black woman.  The two have been best friends since they were little girls, and they slip into and out of that relationship with ease throughout the entire book.  Leah is married to a striking Algerian francophone with such good looks that her black co-workers are starting to resent the fact that a white woman, and not one of them, is married to him.  Keisha, in the meantime, has re-invented herself as Natalie Blake, a successful London barrister, and irritatingly to Leah, a mother.The other two main characters of NW are not well known to Leah or Natalie.  Nathan, now hopelessly addicted to drugs and living on the streets, is the boy both women were in love with as girls but never worked up the nerve to speak to at school.  Felix is just a face on the streets they have seen enough that they feel as if they know him.  Of the two, Felix is much the more sympathetic character and the section of the novel devoted primarily to him is perhaps the best part of NW.NW is a realistic novel.  It is sometimes optimistic, sometimes angry, as it offers its rather bleak look at urban life.  It is a novel long on ethnic influences and expectations and intimately explores the fine line between remaining true to ones roots and being limited by them.  It is not a novel I will soon forget, but it is one in which the authors experimentation with various style types hurt as much as it helped.  NW is, I think, one of those novels destined to have a whole lot of readers give up on it long before they should.  And that is a shame, because its characters and plot deserve more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CCVT1Z0UCQ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007T8YTHG#wasThisHelpful","R1CCVT1Z0UCQ0F","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Joy Luck Club, Amy Tans 1989 debut novel, got such a good critical reception that it firmly established her literary reputation.  Tan has now written six additional novels, one novella, one work of nonfiction, and some childrens books, but none has received the level of acclaim earned by The Joy Luck Club.The novel centers itself on the mahjong club started by four Chinese women who came to the United States after fleeing the Japanese invasion of their homeland during World War II.  After becoming friends as part of San Franciscos Chinese community, the women started the club as a way to socialize and enjoy each others cooking.  (Their husbands come for the food.)  By the beginning of the novel, however, one of the women has died and been replaced in the club by her American daughter.Tan structured the novel into four sections of four interlocking stories each in which she explores the relationships between the elderly women and their daughters.  The stories emphasize how little the daughters know (or care) about their mothers pasts and how manipulative and competitive their mothers are.  These are stories about mothers who often hurt their daughters and, in turn, about daughters who even more often hurt their mothers.  But in the end, it is a story of what happens when mothers and daughters finally learn to forgive each other  as difficult a chore as that usually is.The first section, Feathers from a Thousand Miles Away, is introduced by Jing-Mei, whose deceased mother is credited with the founding of the Joy Luck Club.  Jing-Meis introduction is followed by three stories in which each of the surviving elders tells a story about her childhood in China.  Section two, Twenty-Six Malignant Gates, in turn, allows each of the American daughters to recall a key incident or influence from her own childhood in San Francisco.It is in the books third section, American Translation, that the reader learns just how difficult it has been for each of the older women to raise a daughter in the U.S.  It becomes apparent from the stories told in this section by the daughters that their mothers efforts to turn them into highly successful, competitive women have not been entirely successful.  The younger women, having now survived all the trials of first generation Americans, still resent the degree of intrusion into their lives that their mothers insist upon.Finally, in the fourth section of the book, Queen Mother of the Western Skies, the mothers recall stories of their own young adulthood, that period during which they were most active in trying to form the personalities of their daughters.  With this section, the influences upon both generations of women are exposed for what they are, and the circle is closed.  Now it is up to them to find ways to forgive, understand, and love each other.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32J3OIUPSKQPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IYISSK#wasThisHelpful","R32J3OIUPSKQPQ","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Twain had a mouth on him, no doubt about it  and that is why it is still so much fun to read the mans writing today.  But even Twain knew that the world was not quite ready for the unexpurgated version of his thoughts that comprises the first two volumes (a third volume is yet to follow) of his autobiography, so he stipulated that the complete biography was not to be published until 100 years after his death  which occurred on April 21, 1910.  For those of us lucky enough to be around for the unveiling of the uncensored version of the manuscripts, it was well worth the wait.Close to half of the material contained in the autobiography has never been published before, and readers have the Mark Twain Project (of the University of California, Berkeley) to thank for making it available now.  The previously published material has been published several times in the past, but always in an abridged form guaranteed not to offend.  But even the unrestricted version of Twains manuscripts is not what readers have come to expect from an autobiography.Rather than tell the story of his life in chronological order, Twain decided early on that he would dictate his thoughts to a stenographer as they occurred to him  regardless of where they might fit into the story of his life.  And, because he wanted them published in the order that he dictated them, reading the two books is more like having a conversation with Twain than anything else.  It is as if the man were sitting across the room and telling random stories from his life as they cross his mind.And what stories they are!  They range all the way from his thoughts on rather trivial newspaper stories that may have caught his eye over breakfast to wonderful remembrances of things that happened in the first decade or two of his life.  We learn of the villains in Twains world, some of whom personally crippled him with huge financial losses and scams, and others who were simply the villains of their times, men like Jay Gould and Belgiums King Leopold II.  We learn much about his brother, a man full of dreams but without the ability to make any of them come true.  And most touchingly, Twain shares his deep love for Susy, the daughter who was snatched from the family so suddenly, by quoting liberally from the biography she wrote about her father.  (My own favorite sections of the book deal with Twains relationship with the U.S. Grant family and publication of the former presidents memoirs.)Twain, though, never passes up the opportunity for a little personal vengeance.  As he often reminds his readers, he is speaking from the grave now, so what does he care about offending anyone?  He just wants to set the record straight  at least as he sees that record.  So rather unfortunately, the reader will have to wade through what seems like countless pages about the copyright laws of the day and biting commentary about an Italian landlady who drove Twain nuts for several months.Intimidating as the two books may first appear, the authors charm and rascality make reading them a pleasure that Twain fans will not want to miss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNEPAS5WKE6PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCCQEBW#wasThisHelpful","RNEPAS5WKE6PY","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dr. Atul Gawandes Being Mortal tackles many of the elder care issues my wife and I have been dealing with for close to a decade.  Each of us has been the primary caretaker of our elderly parents (only our fathers survive at this point) for that long now, and just when we think we have seen it all, something new catches us by surprise.  I only wish that we had come across a book like Being Mortal ten years ago rather than having to learn the hard way much of what the Gawande has to say in it about aging and death.Life is all about the choices we make.  And the choices we make as we approach the end of our lives  or the choices we help loved ones make as they approach the end of their lives  are every bit as important as any we have ever made.  Faced with the choice between prolonging our lives for a few months at the cost of losing the quality of our remaining time or living more comfortably and autonomously for what time we otherwise have left, what do we do?  The right choice is never as obvious as one might hope it would be.  Gawande suggests that quality over a slightly extended length of time is the wiser choice, difficult as that choice may be to make when the time comes.So why do we face such a dilemma in the first place?  Gawande blames much of the problem on the medical profession.  Most doctors, he says, are so reluctant ever to give up on a patient that, despite the additional agony involved in further treatment, they will try one hopeless procedure or drug after another until that patient finally dies.  They effectively destroy the remaining lives of their patients by failing to disclose the inevitable result to them: they are going to die soon and it cannot be avoided.  Gawande argues that, rather than something for the doctor to decide, this ultimate choice must be placed in the hands of the patient.  Medical problems that cannot be fixed even at great physical and mental cost to the patient must be managed rather than fixed.  And it is up to the doctor to recognize when that point has been reached so that he can help his patient make the right choice.My personal experience and observation, as verified by Dr. Gawande in Being Mortal, tells me that dying in the U.S. has become a big business.  For the most part, our elderly no longer die at home; they more often die in some hospital or nursing home with a nurse or two around to record the event.  It is all very impersonal and routine these days.  But Gawande is not ready to give up on his profession.  The growing trend toward the use of home hospice services and the efforts of some medical schools to train their students more fully gives him hope.  His greatest fear is that so few medical students are choosing to specialize in geriatric medicine that the elderly will suffer unnecessarily for a long time to come.Being Mortal is an excellent resource for anyone faced with lifes inevitable choices  the hardest choices any of us are ever likely to have to make.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H862RD7ZBJWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JCW0BCY#wasThisHelpful","R3H862RD7ZBJWD","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the size and simplicity of this portable speaker.  It's a little too large too carry around in a pocket, but still smaller than the average paperback book, so it is not at all difficult to cart around with you as you travel or settle in someplace that portability is an advantage.There are only four buttons on this thing, and they are marked so clearly that it is impossible to make a mistake when changing settings: two volume buttons, a power button, and a bluetooth connect button.  And that's it.I've paired the Monster with a variety of devices from phone to iPads and all of them paired up quickly, even on the first attempts.Now, as to the most important function of the speaker: sound quality.  There is a huge difference in sound quality between what I get from the speaker when hooked up to my phone as compared to when it is hooked up to an iPad or similar device.  Keep that in mind when judging the speaker...sound quality originates at its source.But I'm happy enough with every other aspect of the speaker, including charge-up time required (about an hour after the initial, out-of-the-box charge is behind it) and playback time...several hours, in my experience.  Too, the speaker seems to retain a substantial percentage of its charge even when set aside for several days.(when putting the title to this review, I was reminded that my phone gave me the option to connect the phone audio OR the media audio to the speaker.  I don't know if all phones work that way or not...just a thought.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTC2MAJXG9VB5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4DUVR6#wasThisHelpful","RTC2MAJXG9VB5","A1F3DFRPGVEUI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1F3DFRPGVEUI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Writing mechanics were good in these stories, but I didn't enjoy the content. I grew up on a farm in a small rural community, so I was familiar with the settings and could relate on that level. Some of the family dynamics were similar to mine, so again, I could relate. However, I found the stories to be extremely slow, boring and flat. None of the characters really came to life for me and the stories did not hold my interest. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something lacking in the execution. For example, to paraphrase one author, she says that they had to walk through an area covered in cow patties to get to and from the watermelon patch. She goes on to tell the reader what her grandfather called the cow patties and how they had to spend a lot of time cleaning their shoes if they stepped in the manure. I know this book is a memoir/anecdotal style work, but the ""I did this and I did that, and this person said this or that person said that, or they did this or they did that, and that is what happened next"" method of writing the stories did not work for me. The authors told us what they saw or did, but they put nothing of themselves in the stories.Others will quite likely disagree with my assessment, and I am not trying to be mean-spirited with my review; believe it or not, I am trying to be constructive. Bottom line is that I really did not like this book and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PNJCKICR269S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MNMRG2#wasThisHelpful","R1PNJCKICR269S","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well written romantic suspense book that was fairly entertaining. I had no trouble putting it down to do something else, but I did enjoy it.The hero, Michael, has been hired to find the heroine, Elisabeth/Lily, by her psychopath husband. This is a romance book, so of course Michael and Lily fall in love with each other and get their HEA. Both were likeable characters, but as they were written, Michael carrried the angst to extremes and both Lily and Michael has moments of less than stellar intelligence. For example, they know the husband and his goons are looking for them, but do they hunker down and use room service until it is time to escape? You guessed it! No, they opted for wandering around out in the open and going to restaurants. Hello, has anyone heard of pizza delivery? There were other instances like this, where the reader had those ""you must be kidding me"" moments. Despite this, their characterization was executed well enough that they remained appealing characters. It was just that with a bit of tweaking, they could have been so much more than they were.The husband was a well written, slightly over-the-top villain, who almost stole the show. Definitely evil personified. The young son was a cute, appealing character, and other secondary characters were brought to life by the author's descriptive writing.  Although the restaurant employees, the costumer, Lily's grandmother's friend and one of the minions were minor characters, they were fleshed out with enough detail and personality, that they were not cardboard or one-dimensional characters.The plot about Lily trying to save her son and to escape from the psychotic husband was a good one, and it held my interest. The author presented multiple points of view, which was an effective technique. The reader could share the thoughts of the heroine, hero, and villain, as well as those of one of the minions. In addition, the author alternated scenes between the central characters, so the reader had a sense of the events happening in conjunction with each other and this made it feel more realistic. The plot could have used a little tweaking also, but overall, it held together and engaged me.This was a very good book for curling up with to pass the time, and it was enjoyable. The author writes well, but this book was a little disappointing. Although it was a good book, it wouldn't have taken much to be even better. The framework was there, and most of it was filled in, but there were a few skimpily covered areas that made it feel patchy.Despite some flaws, I do recommend this book to anyone who wants a light, entertaining read. The Mira imprint's romantic suspense books are usually not as heavy and dark as mainstream suspense or thriller books, and this book follows that pattern; it entertains without a lot of highly graphic violence. There are some mildly graphic sex scenes, a couple accompanied with some violence by the husband, but these didn't go into much detail. It was more of a PG rated read than an R rated one.There was one annoying formatting problem. When the story moved between scenes, there was no marking of the division. For example, the reader would be in a scene with the hero and heroine, then the husband would be talking to his minions and the reader would have a few seconds of disconnect until the transition was made. Once the pattern was understood, it wasn't really a problem, but it still should be corrected.Recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EXSUU192ULRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N79SZZI#wasThisHelpful","R2EXSUU192ULRV","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved some of the author's other work, but I didn't really care for this book. It was well written with no problems in editing. The plot had an interesting premise but the execution didn't hold my interest. Overall, I liked the characters, some more than others. There were a few times when the heroine was more disagreeable and whiney than I like my heroines to be; I understood that the author was writing the character that way, in order to convey how much the heroine was devestated by all of the events and revelations she experienced. It was a contrast with the heroine's normally caring personality and the heroine was usually a presented in a positive light. I couldn't seem to warm up to her, though.I had trouble sticking with this book. I finished the book, but it was easy to put down and reading it felt like a chore. There really wasn't anything overtly bad about the book. It felt a bit slow and flat to me, because the execution was uneven. There were periods of sparkling dialogue, followed by, what were to me, dry boring conversations and internal thoughts.I admit that straightforward contemporary romance is not my favourite genre and I am very picky about it. There are a number of very popular, famous award-winning authors with large followings, whose contemporary romances I dislike. So my review should be viewed in that light, and anyone who is uncertain, can check some of my other reviews to see if our tastes are alike or not. Readers who love contemporary romances may really like this book. On a personal level, I would rate this book one or two stars, but I realize that would be unfair to the author, so I compromised with three stars.For those who care, the book has some mild sex scenes. It is definitely not erotica, but the porn patrol might want to give it a miss.I recommend this book with reservations. It is one of those books that will definitely have an appreciative audience, but it will also have readers who would be bored to tears with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBB7IUVOCRC0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N79T00M#wasThisHelpful","RBB7IUVOCRC0M","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally, I am not fond of straightforward contemporary romances, but there are a few authors on my 'automatic buy' list. Sharon Sala is on that short list and she always delivers. This book is no exception to her high quality work; it is well written, entertaining, kept me engaged and left me with a 'feel good' reaction at its conclusion.I'm not repeating the synopsis, as others have covered that in their reviews. This is a stand alone book in a series centred around the small town of Blessings, Georgia and Ruby's 'Curl Up and Dye hair salon, where all the gossip eventually finds its way. Some characters have recurring roles but the plots focus on new characters who are introduced in each volume. Since I started this series at the beginning, I can't say if subsequent volumes leave new readers confused by the number of characters. Obviously some reviewers thought this was a problem, but I tried to view this book objectively, and I honestly don't think I would have been lost if I started with it. This is an element that may or may not be an issue for some readers, then. I felt the number of characters was necessary in order to create the setting and character of the town. We see the pharmacist, doctor, police officers, bartenders waitresses, cooks, day care operator, teachers, lawyers, minister, neighbours, friends, local characters, good ole boys, and of course, the women working in or patronizing beauty salon. Sala paints the town so vividly, that one can visualize the main street and its shops, the townspeople, various neighbourhoods and the rural areas surrounding the town.  To me, Sala brought the town to life and made it pivotal to the series, as much a lead character as any human character. I loved it and found myself wishing I could visit it.Some reviewers felt that the book did seem like a stand alone book to them. One reason was that characters and events that were in previous books were referred to, which left them a bit lost. The other was the teaser chapter at the end. In any series, there are going to be allusions to previous characters and events. That is the nature of a series and why most readers like well done ones, and think this is a well done series. Sala gives enough information to give backstory without boring readers who follow the series. Other writers, such as J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts employ this same technique. If readers picks up a book in the middle of a series, they are not going to get every nuance of the backstory, but should have enough information to follow the particular volume they are reading. I think Sala accomplishes that.As for the teaser chapter, that is also common practice and is not cheating by the author. I loathe cliffhangers, but a teaser chapter is not at all the same. This story line ended and the book was completed with no loose threads. I actually enjoy teaser chapters because they give me a hint about where the author plans to take the next book. However, those who hate books with a teaser chapter will be unhappy that this book has one.There is profanity in this book and readers who don't read books with profanity should avoid it. They will be missing out on a great book, but that is their choice. To me, a woman in her mid-sixties, it wasn't anything I haven't been hearing or reading for years. I don't agree with those who think it means the writer is lazy for not finding other ways to convey the emotions or habits of characters. The language was not gratuitous, but was suitable to the characters and their situations. I regularly see elementary kids using the ""f"" bomb. It has lost any shock value it ever had, and it would be ludicrous to not expect characters in contemporary non-Christian fiction to use it.There is one fairly innocuous graphic sex scene on the hero's and heroine's wedding night. It won't make either the 'no sex' or the 'hot sex' camp happy. The rest of us will likely enjoy it.This was a 'feel good' book that focuses on the underdogs and their trials before the happily ever after. Sala doesn't write Christian fiction, but there are often references to God, church attendance, prayers, belief and faith, but she is never 'preachy'. This book contains those references, but she points out that church attendance does not make one a Christian or a good person. Some characters who attend regularly are hypocrites who don't act out their purported beliefs, and do harm to others by their inaction and their overt actions of hurtful gossiping, snide comments, and 'holier than thou' attitudes. She balances this with characters who do act out their faith and give help and encouragement.Sala also addresses the subject of bullying and how some schools turn a blind eye to it. As well she points out that the class divisions between the haves and have nots, often influence how authority figures treat people. As with religion, Sala balances criticism with examples of authority figures who are not influenced by anything except a person's character and actions. Sala often make a point to show examples of injustice, but she is never heavy handed. With Sala's books, I always feel entertained by a good story but am also left with food for thought.Was the plot totally realistic? Not really, but there is realism in it. This book reads and ends the way readers of romance books want in their books. We want the underdog to succeed, we want the villains punished and we want a happily ever after. Many readers don't experience that in real life, but they want the hope and the fantasy when they pick up a romance book. Sala delivers that in this book. It is an easy, light read that is still compelling; it pulls the reader in and keeps the pages turning, long after the lights should have been turned off. I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I7ZGEURLNV2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG8TG3U#wasThisHelpful","R1I7ZGEURLNV2X","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this book in paperback and liked it a lot. I was glad to see that it was available on Kindle and happily replaced my paperback. This is a well written rainy day or beach type of read. It wouldn't go in my desert island pile, but it is a solid, enjoyable book.As the synopsis says, the heroine is a psychic and the hero is a homicide detective. They are likeable characters, but as another reviewer said, the book was light on the romance. There was no real passion, and by that, I don't mean sex. I felt as if the love was a bit lukewarm. The author actually voiced the problem. In one scene, the hero's mother is contemplating his relationship with the heroine, and she was concerned that the heroine was so self-contained that the passion needed for a relationship was missing. Then she saw the passion in the heroine's photography, and was relieved. The problem for the reader is that we need to see it expressed between the hero and the heroine, and not in the heroine's work. So the romance was a bit flat, but it was pleasant.The writer almost seemed to be setting the scene for sequels. Instead of putting more focus on the romance between the heroine and hero, she hinted at the possibility of a romance between the hero's brother and a family friend. She actually did include a side romance between the hero's sister and a family friend. They were all nice characters and their inclusion added to the reader's understanding of the hero and heroine. I liked having them present, but they diluted the central romance.The mystery/suspense part of the book was stronger than the romance. As one reviewer said, this was not a thrilling story, but it was still entertaining and it engaged me. I easily guessed who the villainess was, but that didn't matter. The entire journey from start to finish was what was important. I reread books I have enjoyed, because it doesn't matter if I know the ending, as long as the writer offers a worthwhile story that takes me on a journey to another place. I never understand readers who feel a book is spoiled if they know who the villain is or know the ending. Descriptive prose, well written characterizations, dialogue, setting and plot are what attracts me to a book. This book was well written and held my interest, even beyond my first reading of it.I recommend this book to anyone wanting a pleasant, simple, entertaining story with a bit of romance and a bit of suspense. It has some mild sex scenes, but they are a minor part of the book. Anyone wanting a one hundred percent clean read will want to avoid it. Anyone wanting a lot of hot sex and a fast paced, breathtaking thriller would probably be disappointed in this book.  It is simply an undemanding book that is perfect for when ones to relax and curl up with a good book. I definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACSC2B9BU3ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N79T0GG#wasThisHelpful","R3ACSC2B9BU3ZT","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My old copy of this book came up missing years ago, so I was happy to see it available as a Kindle book. I wondered how it would have aged, but I thoroughly enjoyed rereading it, after almost fifty years.This book was written in a simpler time, when books in this genre were not so graphic when it came to sex and violence. Consequently, this book might seem ""tame"" to anyone expecting a modern thriller. This is a fairly slow paced book that has a lot of philosophizing about the political situation of the immediate pre-WWII era, mixed in with a light spy story. This book was written not long after WWII ended, when events were fresh in everyone's mind. As a result, it gives a sense of how some, British, Germans and Americans viewed this era, which is as interesting as the story itself.MacInnes hits upon some key features. She depicts the previously close relationship between some German and British intellectuals, as a result of intermingling at universities. She shows how hard line political stances undermine this previous camaraderie and makes enemies of former friends. As well, she illustrates popular attitudes about Appeasement and the consequences of it, and attitudes about the influence of capitalists on this political policy. We see the general air of fear and uncertainty about the possibility of war, in both Britain and Europe; we see the British contempt for all aspects of Nazism and for those who blindly succumb to its lure; we see British frustration that the American public doesn't understand what is actually happening in Europe; we see German and other Europeans who hate what is happening and are fearful; we see allusions to how Jews, Slavs, trade unionists, communists and critics of the Third Reich are being rounded up. All of these are incorporated into the setting and plot, in a superficial but still enlightening way.This book isn't ""War and Peace"" but it is a nice little spy story that is reflective of an era with different gender roles, slow communications, totalitarian politics, and people raised in a world vastly different from that of today. If a reader expects a pulse-pounding thriller with non-stop action, sex and graphic violence, this is not the book to choose. For those willing to accept a slower pace in order to get a feel for the times, while receiving a nice yarn, this would be a good choice.  Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25XWCOPDOZ49F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008QNE716#wasThisHelpful","R25XWCOPDOZ49F","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is an excellent addition to the ""In Death"" series. Several books back, I was beginning to get bored with the repetitious backstory, and then Roberts started making the backstory much briefer. This book continues that trend, with a succinct backstory that informs newbie readers without boring the rest of us. That was definitely a plus for me.As the cast of characters grew, Roberts initially tried to include everyone in each story. It became unwieldy after a while and interfered with the flow of the plots. Eventually, the inclusion of supporting characters sometimes seemed added just for the sake of adding them, rather than because they were essential to the story. It was wonderful seeing Roberts create a circle of friends and family for Eve and Roarke and I love these supporting characters; however, it is counterproductive to have all of them included in every book. Roberts began to focus more on the core law enforcement group, as she did in this book. There were allusions to the missing characters and Roberts was skillful at catching us up with them without having them stop the momentum of the story. This was another plus for me.The relationship between Eve and Roarke continues to evolve in this book. Roberts maintains Eve's ""kick ass"" attitude, sarcasm, bewilderment with idioms, and aversion to all things rural and cute. She is still very much the Eve we love, but she has become softer and more confident in her relationship with Roarke. In this book, the balance is just right; Eve still has her hard edge when it comes to law enforcement, but the interaction with Roarke has more give and take as she learns to be part of a couple. As well, the sex scenes seem more like lovemaking than the aggressive battle they often were in previous books. I used to skip the sex scenes because I wasn't fond of Roberts' approach, but in this book and in the last few, I actually read and enjoyed those bits.The supporting characters were very well written, and it was a pleasure to see Eve's law enforcement colleagues in action. Roberts continues to develop these characters and to bring them to life. Peabody is more self-confident in her job and relationship with Eve, although she still has the occasional lapse into self-doubt. Trueheart is coming along nicely and is ready to become a detective. He is still a bit nave but very competent. We see more of Baxter and learn more about his personality. He has been mentoring Trueheart and is more anxious about Trueheart taking the detectives' exam than Trueheart is. We knew Baxter was cocky and brash, but now we see another side of him. The rest of the gang were treated similarly, and we see them in more depth. I like that Roberts included fewer characters in this book but developed them more than she could if she were throwing in every single friend and colleague of Eve's and Roarke's.The plot of this book was superb. Roberts did something a bit different in this book and borrowed from authors like R. Austin Freeman and from shows like Columbo. We know who committed the murders and we are given full access to the murderers. We know their background, what they look like, their motivation, their modus operandi, their thoughts, and we see them committing some of their crimes. It is up to Eve, Roarke and the team to figure out ""who dunnit"", ""how they dunnit"", and where they are. Some reviewers disliked this pattern, but it made for a refreshing change. Like a lot of readers, I want a certain predictability from my favourite authors, but not so much that the writing becomes stale. Roberts hit it just right with this one.One reviewer said this book was too much like a police procedural, as if that is a new and bad thing, and further said that the character development and familiar characters were missing. I've already commented on the character development and inclusion of characters, so I will address the reviewer's comment about the police procedural. I think these books have always been police procedurals, accompanied by strong characterizations. The previous books took us from a murder to the hunt for the killer, to the capture of the killer. This book had a different starting point, but it still involved the search for a killer. The uniformed officers on the ground, the detectives, the medical and forensics people, the electronics division, the psychological profiling, the police hierarchy and the d.a. all played a role in this book, as they have in the others. The presence or absence of Mavis and Bella do not determine whether or not these books are police procedurals. It was refreshing to have a greater focus on fewer characters, which strengthened the plot of this particular addition to the series.A few reviewers thought this book was especially violent. I didn't think it was any more violent than some of the other ""In Death"" books. Roberts was very effective in creating great sympathy for the victims and their families in this book. It was masterful writing in the sense that she made these people real and made the reader connect with them. When I finished the book, the victims continued to resonate with me and I still felt for them. Similarly, Roberts created truly despicable villains and brought the reader face to face with pure evil. This book was very affecting and suspenseful, but it didn't give me nightmares. People react differently to situations, though, and this book might be too violent for some readers. I found it made me think about crime, criminals and the victims of crime. As well, it made me think about the police officers who deal with the worst situations imaginable. The book was funny, suspenseful, violent, tender and thought-provoking, all at once.My husband and I both read this book from the library, in one sitting and couldn't put it down until we finished it. We have all of the other J.D. Robb books and have reread them more than once. We both loved this one and think it is easily among her best. As soon as the Kindle price reaches paperback price, we will be buying it. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Y3RLFY93885/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI0B74M#wasThisHelpful","R16Y3RLFY93885","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a bit of a departure from the author's other work. She usually has few to no sex scenes in her books, although some have strong sexual tension. This book had a lot of sexual tension and a lot of sexual content. I almost gave the book four stars because it had more sexual content than I like, but the book was so good that I had to give it five stars. The opening battle scene grabbed my attention and I couldn't stop reading the book; I was hooked. The world building on both the research station and the rebels' planet was well done, so graphically depicted that it was easy to visualize the setting and to feel drawn into the action taking place. The writing is deceptive; it looks like a simple straightforward narrative, and then you realize how carefully the words are usually chosen and placed, so as to have the most impact. The reader sees, hears, smells and feels everything taking place, which is not an easy thing to create. As well, the book was very fast paced but didn't feel rushed.Tamryn is a strong heroine and Makk is an adorable alpha hero. One reviewer commented that it was difficult to see Makk as a hero because of what he did in battle. I think part of the problem is the author's choice in calling the attackers ""terrorists"". That word has negative connotations, and as another reviewer pointed out, Makk's crew could be considered rebels. Using the word ""rebels"" puts the attack in a different light and gives their cause legitimacy. Regardless, Makk has morals and acts with honour, especially considering that he is fighting for the lives of his people, people who have been all but annihilated by the ancestors of those they are attacking. There is a lot of sexual tension between Tamryn and Makk, as they fight each other and the attraction they feel, since they are enemies.What makes Makk endearing is his humility and his inner dialogue. He is instantly smitten by Tamryn, as in figuratively pole axed and swept off his feet. He doesn't know what hit him. His amusing inner thoughts about his reactions to both Tamryn and his unruly, uncooperative penis, as well as his goofy smiles whenever she tries to best him or kill him, and his little-boy-look hurt feelings, all combine to make him an engaging hero. Tamryn is his worthy match as a heroine. She is not his equal physically, but she holds her own against him, sometimes bests him, and never stops trying to outwit him, even as she falls in love with him.I loved the way the sex scenes were written, erotic but not erotica. However, I felt there was too much space devoted to them. A little bit less would have been perfect.I loved this book and couldn't put it down. It held my interest from beginning to end. The author has tackled a variety of genres, from clean reads to sensuous ones, fantasy, science fiction, steampunk, futuristic romance and contemporary fiction. She hasn't let me down, and continues to put out first-rate work. Highly recommend this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XVXNBW0YK1QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LRV75O#wasThisHelpful","R2XVXNBW0YK1QN","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a paper copy of this book, purchased elsewhere. If this book were in another category, I would say it was well written, but too depressing to read, and I love depressing 19th century Russian literature. Frankly, this book made me sick, stomach-churning sick.***********************************SPOILERS****************************Early in the book, we have the graphic gang rape of the hero. The heroine rescues him afterwards, and we learn about his bleeding rectal area, with semen dripping down, and about his weeks of anal pain as the heroine tends to him. The heroine has been raped by the same people and there are descriptions of her continuing angst about it. The hero is suicidal and ashamed, the heroine is also suffering emotionally, and this is still very early in the book. It doesn't get any better.This was the bleakest, darkest book I have ever read; I can't believe it won romance awards. There are arguments that the author depicted the era realistically and that it is wonderful that she broke out of the box to do so. Excuse me! Wonderful in an historical romance is not having anachronisms; it is trying to give the flavour of the times while creating a feel-good romance. ROMANCE. Not all of the horrible, realism of the times. If I want realism, I wouldn't be choosing a romance book.I don't care how many experts and literary critics call this book a romance; just because everyone admires the emperor's new clothes does not mean he is actually wearing anything. This is not a romance book and any unsuspecting readers who pick it up expecting a traditional romance will be sorely disappointed.If readers want graphic realism, complete with gang rapes and unimaginable suffering, then they might like this book. For anyone else who just wants a well written, pleasant romance book, prepare to be shocked if you pick this book up.Not recommended.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IZVX83TP535Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENJW0PC#wasThisHelpful","R1IZVX83TP535Z","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wasn't one of the better books by Ms. Thompson. I picked it up and put it down several times, read something else in-between, and finally forced myself to finish it. Writing mechanics were good, but I did notice the same formatting that others described, where there were no spaces between shifts. It didn't bother me once I got used to it.I found the book to be flat, dull and slow. There was a lot of action, as other reviewers stated, so the book should have been fast paced and exciting, except it wasn't. Even the dialogue felt dull, forced and stiff. Ruby and Sam were nice, but flatly drawn and not memorable. Ruby's sister, Misty, was portrayed as so smart and level headed, but in the book, she did some truly brainless things. The author intends the town and some characters to be part of a series; to provide the groundwork, she devotes a lot of time to Justine, the sheriff, and her autistic son. I felt these really dragged the central action to a slow crawl. The story never engaged me and held my interest, and I didn't warm to any of the characters, except for Sam. Even the children did not endear themselves to me.I didn't hate the book, and I can see why others loved it. I am in the minority, but I didn't like this book.  I wouldn't recommend it, so I suggest readers try a sample or get it from the library first. You may disagree with me and love it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ODDED95THT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003LN2B7S#wasThisHelpful","R11ODDED95THT0","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an exceptionally good, outstanding compilation. I was only familiar with a few of the authors, but this was a good introduction to the others; I will definitely be checking out more works by them.As it says in the description, this compilation has of a variety of romance sub genres. Some of these are contemporary, historical, futuristic, fantasy, and paranormal with ghosts. I like all of these sub genres, so I was happy to have a bit of each. Surprisingly, given the diversity of sub genres, they all fit well together and I never had the sense of being jarred when moving from one to the next.Each author had a very strong entry. Plots, setting, characterization, and dialogue were very well done. In very little space, the authors created worlds and well developed characters that were easy to visualize. The heroes and heroines were very likeable, with strong heroes who are physically or emotionally wounded. Some heroines have also experienced trauma, but each couple finds strength and healing through the love and support of their partner.A couple of the stories ended a bit abruptly, but with conclusions that suggested there was a happily ever after. I would have liked a little epilogue for these stories, but it wasn't really necessary. None of the stories had cliffhangers and any that were part of a series were easy to follow and never made me feel lost or as if I was missing something from the story.  ******SPOILER ALERT / CONTENT WARNING ******I normally like Rebecca York's books but I didn't enjoy her story as much as the others. I had reservations about it because of the heroine's rape by four soldiers. It was done 'off screen', but the hero was moved to tears when she told him about all they had done to her. It wasn't graphic and the reader isn't given any of the details, but it was still darker than I like for a romance book.The sex scenes ranged from none to infrequent mild encounters. When there was a sex scene, it fit into the flow of the story and didn't seem intrusive or too long. There was also some mild cussing. To me, the stories were almost clean, even with the sex and swearing. These stories were character driven and not simply vehicles for hot sex scenes.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes these sub genres or who wants to try out stories by some unfamiliar authors. With some compilations, the reader is lucky to have a few good stories, but these are all first rate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BZPQUQ4BK4GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00502AH6K#wasThisHelpful","R1BZPQUQ4BK4GO","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm in the minority right now, but I hated this book. I have almost all of Alexandra Ivy's and Rebecca Zanetti's books, so I expected to love their stories. I wasn't familiar with Duvall's or Jayne's work, but I thought that since the book had two familiar authors' stories, it was worth trying. Unfortunately, it was not a happy purchase.  ********POSSIBLE SPOILERS********Ivy's story involved a Sentinal, Mika, and a healer, Bailey. They had been engaged, but Bailey got cold feet and bailed out. (I know, that was a cheap shot.) To continue, though, it is several years after the separation and they reconnect when Mika is on a case, tracking someone down. I hated Bailey. She walked out on Mika without a word, just packed up and moved home, because she wanted to see if he loved her enough to come after her. Talk about cruel and immature. Her excuses and apology were too little, too late in my opinion. However, this is a romance book, so Mika forgives her.Bailey's immaturity continued to grate throughout the story. She hated routine and authority to the point where stubbornness overrode common sense. She reminded me of a small child sticking her tongue out at the adults frantically yelling at her to come away from the road as she continues to blithely back into traffic. Mentally, I had her saying things like ""I don't have to, you can't make me, I'm not going to so there, I can do it myself"", as she thrashes around on the floor having a temper tantrum. Did I mention that I hated her? Why do authors create heroines who are not only self-centred, but too stupid live? Anyway, the story line itself and the rest of the characterization were excellent. I would read more from this series, as long as it doesn't contain more Baileyesque heroines.Zanetti's story had immediate closure, but an overarching story line that continues the series; at least I think it continues. The ending reminded me a bit of a Twilight Zone episode, where it is implied that more continues off-screen; it didn't feel complete, but it was an acceptable ending. The problem I had with this story was the huge amount of sex scenes---too long and too many.  I found myself skimming through a lot of pages in order to return to the story. The story suffered for this, because there wasn't enough room left in the novella length to develop the story and characterization. What there was of the plot and characterization was great and I would have liked more details. I might try more books in this series, but I wouldn't purchase any more until I had a chance to read one for free to see if I liked it. (As an aside, I read Zanetti's other series free from Kindle Unlimited and loved the books. I bought all of them so I could have them to reread. They had borderline too much sex, but the stories were so well written that I decided that I could live with having to skip those scenes.)Duvall's story also devoted too much space to sex and not enough to plot and characterization. Like Zanetti's story, it had a great concept but the balance between sex and story was uneven. The hero and heroine were very likeable and the concept was great. I liked what I saw of the Immortals and would like to see more of them. This story had immediate closure with an overarching story line, that engaged me and left me wanting more. I just wish there had been more story and less sex. In a longer work, the author can get away with a bit too much sex, but in a novella, there isn't room to have a lot of sex and still develop the story as well as it could be.Jayne's story didn't seem to fit into the anthology. It was more lighthearted and was a clean read. If it were a mystery, I think it would be in the sub genre of cosy. I didn't mind that it wasn't a perfect fit, but I did mind that the romance was almost nonexistent. Nina, the vampire heroine, and Pike, the bird shapeshifter hero, were likeable but there was very little chemistry and no declaration of love until near the conclusion. As well, I wasn't entirely happy with the world building. Maybe this was because the novella length made it difficult for the author to depict her world, but for whatever reason, I couldn't see enough of it to form an opinion. Everything skimmed along the surface and didn't go deeply enough to let the reader in. I wouldn't go out of my way to read more of this series because it didn't engage me and I was a bit bored with it. The author writes well, and for those who like this style, it might be worth trying.Conclusion: One story had an acceptable amount of sex, two had too much sex, and one was clean. One had an obnoxious heroine, three had likeable heroines and all four had likeable heros. None of the stories was as well developed as I would have liked, but none of them had cliffhangers. The stories had good writing mechanics, and other than my complaints above, were very well written.I'm giving the book three stars, although it was a one star book for me. I just didn't enjoy it, but I can see its positive points. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has reading tastes very similar to mine. Readers who are more into paranormal romances with a lot of sensuous sex scenes might like the first three stories. It's not erotica although it is explicit, which I like, but in smaller quantities. Anyone  who only likes clean books will hate it, even though one story is clean.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FRO3UCD97VDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z3DZ2CA#wasThisHelpful","R1FRO3UCD97VDR","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read this book in the late 1960s, and I thought it was hilarious. The movie reinforced my view of this book as a humorous work. Upon rereading it today, I found that it was satirical, had a few chuckles, but was not what I would consider to be humorous.Others have given the synopsis, so I see no need to rehash it. The premise of a small country declaring war on the US in order to receive rehabilitation, as in post-war Germany, was amusing. Ultimately, though, the bits of humour were wrapped around the serious subject of the superpowers, nuclear capabilities, weapons of mass destruction and disarmament. Sure, there were smiles, but the author was trying to make a point about his views on the Cold War and the 1950s diplomatic, political and military establishments, on both the left and right political spectrum. He uses the satire in the story to make the point that ordinary people are forgotten by both political sides of the Cold War, and indeed, in any situation where the elites and power brokers are determining policies.There were a couple of places where the book seemed dated, but overall, it still seemed relevant and timely. However, it also evoked feelings of sadness. We are presented with Mr. Wibberley's wishful vision of how to ensure that there is a balance of power that gets rid of weapons of mass destruction and ensures peace. He wants, and presents to the reader, a world where ordinary citizens can live their lives without the fear of destruction being unleashed by politicians who have lost their moral compass and common sense. One of the drawbacks of aging, though, is that one has ""been there, done that "". Since reading this book the first time, I have seen wars in the near, far, and Middle East, as well as other places, too numerous to mention. There have been countless terrorist attacks. There is nuclear proliferation with nuclear weapons in both democratic and totalitarian regimes, and enough unbalanced rulers who aren't afraid to use them if or when they feel it is warranted. Germ and chemical warfare are still in use in some places. The Cold War is supposed to be over, but Russia is edging into former Soviet satellite countries. The old ""duck and cover"" is a quaint concept of the past, because we know how useless it is. Polarization is replacing co-operation, and there are those who would tear down a society, regardless of the consequences, rather than reach a win-win compromise. We are inured to most of what's going on and don't even get anxious about most of the issues anymore. In some ways, then, this book was a depressing reminder of how little politics and diplomacy have changed for the better, and of how precarious are the lives of ordinary citizens, as political parties and countries vie for one-upmanship and ordinary people are their pawns.This was a very well written book and the satire was brilliantly done. It captures a moment in time, in the 1950s, giving a glimpse of the post-WWII/Cold War era. A number of reviewers found this book to be hilarious, so maybe it can be read as a humorous book; I couldn't read it that way. Once I adjusted my expectations, I saw humorous elements, but I read it as a political and social satire.I highly recommend this book, with the caveat that some people will not find it all that funny. Accept it for what it is, with no preconceptions about its humour, and it should be a very satisfying read, that gives some laughs, but also forces one to think. The humour is used to make the author's message palatable, but he demands that the reader dig beneath the surface to discover and reflect upon his underlying message.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0B1ABWVOKHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GC71BI#wasThisHelpful","RY0B1ABWVOKHG","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had a number of positives, but ultimately, it was an unsatisfying read. I liked the plot, but the pacing was too slow. The story bogged down in places and there was a lot of repetition that didn't further the plot. For example, the heroine, Lily, had slow scenes where she vacillated about whether or not the hero, Tierney, was the killer. These scenes should have built tension and quickened the pace, but instead, they seemed oddly slow and flat. Scenes with Lily and Tierney, that took place at the cabin, were also slow and dull. Too often the narrative concentrated on how cold it was, what Lily and Tierney needed to do to keep warm and hydrated, the frequent forays necessary to get wood and medication, and Lily's asthma symptoms. It focused on the mundane rather than building on characterization. Yes, Lily talked about her daughter and her marriage to Dutch, but she felt remote when talking about it and Tierney never did communicate in the cabin scenes. Consequently, it was difficult to establish any rapport with the hero and heroine, until the end. As well, Dutch's and Wes' scenes, where they expressed anxiousness to get up the mountain and those scenes of their efforts to do so, were repetitious and ineffective at creating urgency and tension.I don't like too much sex in my romance books, so I was surprised when other reviewers felt the book had an excessive amount of sex, because I didn't think it did. Because this was a romantic suspense book, I found the supporting characters' sex scenes between teachers and students over eighteen to be acceptable for that genre. In a straightforward romance, it wouldn't fit, but this genre is usually a bit grittier. I found the depiction of the student/teacher sex scenes to be well written. The author managed to convey that it does harm, even though it is technically legal, and she was able to portray the ambivalence that a lot of people have about it. In addition, I don't like 'forced seduction' scenarios in romance books, and there weren't any; the rape fantasy is apparently popular, though, so I was not bothered by its inclusion. The book was certainly not pornograhic, in my opinion. I don't think the sex scenes were hot enough for readers who want erotica, but they will probably offend those who want a clean read.I was ambivalent about this book. I liked it enough to replace my paperback with a Kindle edition when it was on sale. I liked how the author brought the supporting characters to life; they were well written and I actually felt more of a connection with these secondary characters. I liked some aspects of the hero and heroine, but disliked others, and ultimately could not really connect with them. I liked the idea of the plot a lot but wasn't entirely happy with the execution. I was disappointed with this book, but Sandra Brown writes very well, so even though it was disappointing, I still enjoyed it.I would not recommend this book as the place to start for readers who aren't familiar with Sandra Brown's writing. I would recommend it to her fans, especially for those times when a reader is looking for an easy read and understands that it isn't her best work but is still a good way to pass the time. I would have given this book two and a half stars, but rounded it up to three.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIMTHWTH6M16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKBPM#wasThisHelpful","R2SIMTHWTH6M16","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that this book has major plot holes, but I loved it anyway. It is a book where the reader definitely has to suspend disbelief, but for readers who can do that, it was a great read.As is usual in a book by Sandra Brown, the quality of the writing was excellent. In addition to good writing mechanics, she brings her settings and characters vividly to life. I noticed that some reviewers complained that she used words that were 'too big'. Ms. Brown's writing is definitely not 'high-brow' or academic, but neither does it contribute to the dumbing down of the English language. Ms. Brown is writing popular fiction for adults and she uses words that are in common usage among average, ordinary adults. If any writer uses an unfamiliar word, one can easily find the meaning in a dictionary, thereby improving one's own command of the English language. Kindle books even have a built-in dictionary that is simple to use. My own mother and father were functionally illiterate and my brother has dyslexia, so I know some people genuinely struggle to read anything. For those of us who have no learning disability, laziness is the only reason Ms. Brown's writing might seem too pretentious and difficult to understand.**********Possible Spoilers**********Other reviewers have mentioned some of the holes in the plot, and they are glaring. Gillian goes home after her date with Chief, her sister is sleeping in her bed, so she drives to her sister's house to sleep. Gillian has a guest room with a made-up bed, so why is her sister sleeping in her bed? Why does Gillian drive to her sister's house to sleep, when her own house has a perfectly good guest bed and a sofa to sleep on?  As well, the original deception about identity makes sense; someone killed 'Gillian', so why admit to being 'Gillian'? However, there was no good reason to continue deceiving Chief because she knew he was not the killer and he was helping her to find the killer. These two scenarios were central to the main plot, but they didn't make sense. I rolled my eyes, but I suspended disbelief and continued reading, because I was hooked from the beginning. I simply ignored those plot holes and loved the rest of the story.This book has an 'instant attraction and love' romance, which I liked very much. The hero and heroine were so attracted to each other that they even made love on their first date. Readers who dislike that scenario will likely find it objectionable, but I found it to be very romantic.This is a romantic suspense book, so I don't expect it to be a thriller, like a straightforward mystery or suspense book. Still, the murder plot and conspiracy were suspenseful enough for the genre and held my interest.All of the principal characters were well drawn. The hero and heroine were shown to be flawed, but still very likeable. The central villains were fleshed out and easy to visualize; the main antagonist was depicted as someone truly amoral, villainous and easy to hate. The central police officers were also fleshed out enough to be interesting and more than one-dimensional characters.I enjoyed this book, warts and all. It was an easy, engaging read, that held my interest. I liked it enough that I have read it more than once, and I replaced my paperback with the Kindle version. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a pleasurable read and isn't bothered by plot holes, so long as the rest of the book is entertaining. Not everyone will like it; it wasn't Sandra Brown's best book, but it still kept me entertained.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34KLYHDCQJM7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEK6ZSG#wasThisHelpful","R34KLYHDCQJM7L","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Review by Ann's husband, Dirk; Canadian Forces vet, '69-77)  The author's writing is detailed, interesting and so readable I could not wait for a chance to get back into the book.  The author puts you right there: in meetings of opposing factions, behind the scenes, and in the dust and chaos of thee house to house fights with the individuals in the fight for Fallujah.  The author describes the personalities and motivations of the key participants, and makes the religious and cultural issues clear and interesting.  This is the book to which all others about the Iraqi war will be compared.  In my opinion, this will be the seminal work about the battle and background to the events in Iraq concerning Fallugjah.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31R6JO5NGXCBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FCKEHC#wasThisHelpful","R31R6JO5NGXCBI","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am replacing my paperback Agatha Christie books with Kindle versions, so when I see that one is on sale, I snag it. When I saw this one, my finger was all set to hit the one-click button, when I noticed the name 'Sophie Hannah' in very small print at the bottom of the cover. The name 'Agatha Christie' was prominently displayed at the top of the cover, in extremely large letters that mimicked the font and style of actual Christie book covers, so it is no wonder I was misled. Was this a deliberate marketing ploy? Mais, oui. Yes, methinks it was VERY deliberate.Regardless of what I think about second rate hacks exploiting dead good writers like Agatha Christie and Rex Stout, I can live and let live. I may think it is an abomination, but hey, I don't have to read them. When the cover and advertising blurb are deliberately designed to present the deceased author as the author of the volume, however, then the gloves are off. That goes beyond stealing someone else's intellectual property and becomes an attempt to defraud the reader.I will undoubtably be criticized for rating a book I haven't read, but frankly, I don't view that as any worse than putting someone else's name prominently displayed as the author of a work they didn't write or authorize themselves. The cover of a book is a significant part of the book. In some cases, it can have a huge impact on sales of the book, so if information on it is misleading, then it is fair to review the cover as part of the contents. The publishers definitely share most of the blame on this issue but regardless of who authorized this cover, it is still cheating and a cheap ploy to sell a book.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WVJ629G80KCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYNGP8A#wasThisHelpful","R1WVJ629G80KCV","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an entertaining read. The small town, one major employer setting was described well; there's the one powerful family that almost everyone is afraid to cross, there's the right side of the tracks residents and the white-trash wrong side of the tracks residents, there's the established southern Texan residents who know each other's entire family histories and the northern Yankee interloper who is treated with suspicion and shunned, and there's a charismatic good ol' boy hero and the appealing  Yankee heroine. The author fleshes all of that out and brings the town and its residents to life.Some of the characters were mean and nasty, some were slutty and some were average people just getting on with their lives. Their interactions with each other and with the heroine were what drove the plot and created the conflicts. I didn't feel that anything was overdone or over the top. Everything played out naturally and at a good, even pace.The reason I am giving this book four stars instead of five was because I didn't enjoy the plot line where the heroine and hero go out of the country to find her daughter's body. It didn't spoil the story and most people probably think it was a crucial element in the story. To me, it felt a bit awkward and briefly slowed the Texas part of the story; I thought the author could have found a different  way to introduce another central character.There was language and graphic sex scenes in the book, as well as teenage heavy petting. It was all pretty mild, but those who don't like those elements should avoid this book.This was a nice story to relax with and pass the time. It engaged me and I liked several of the characters. Those I disliked were necessary to the plot and made enjoyable protagonists who livened up the story. The author's descriptions and dialogue brought the characters to life, making for a very entertaining read. I recommend this book to those who like romantic suspense books, with the emphasis on the romance. This wasn't Sandra Brown's best book, but it ranked up there as a very good one. I liked it enough that I bought the Kindle version to replace my paperback.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KTJP3U9A09C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEK746S#wasThisHelpful","R20KTJP3U9A09C","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book as an eBook from my local library, and as soon as the price goes down to paperback price, I intend to buy it. It was an excellent, well written romantic suspense book.Characterization was extremely well done. Holly and Crawford were a wonderful hero and heroine. Both were well developed characters, likeable and easy to visualize. Crawford came across as very human, flawed but with his character strengths outweighing any minor flaws. Holly initially seemed very rigid but gradually became more understanding and flexible as the story progressed.The major antagonists were also well developed characters. Crawford's father-in-law, his fellow police officer nemesis, his snitch, and the central villain were easy to visualize. The villain was suitably evil, for a villain in a romantic suspense book. There was some violence, but nothing too graphic.I loved the story; I'm not sure how true-to-life some of the judicial and police actions were, but I had no problems suspending disbelief. A purist might find errors, but the story kept me engaged and turning virtual pages well into the night. The plot may have had minor holes, but if so, they weren't egregious and I didn't notice them. There was some suspense and tension, some warm and tender moments, and a heartwarming romance. These elements combined to create an appealing and entertaining read.There were a few short sex scenes that were not overly graphic and did not interrupt the flow of the story. This book had a situation where the hero and heroine initially disliked each other, but became attracted to each other rather quickly, and acted upon it early in the story. It didn't seem like ""instant love"" with no basis. The rapid attraction and falling in love took place during an unusual period of intense emotions in life-and- death situations. The hero and heroine were operating in an intense situation where each quickly learned the other's character, personality, flaws and strengths. In this instance, the early romance was integral to the plot and helped to further it.I highly recommend this book. Ms. Brown's fans are sure enjoy this, her most recent offering. Those unfamiliar with her writing shouldn't be afraid to start with this book; it is a good example of the high quality of her work and well worth reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TPKCEPJ15E5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US1STWW#wasThisHelpful","R1TPKCEPJ15E5T","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this book through Kindle Unlimited. This book had a great premise, I enjoyed the final twist and the writing mechanics were fairly good. Those were the positives. Unfortunately, they were outweighed by the negatives.The writing and dialogue felt stilted and awkward, in both the author's narrative and the characters' voices. Sentences weren't smooth, didn't flow, and felt short and choppy. It almost read like a book aimed at younger readers, except for the subject matter. As well, the actions, dialogue and inner thoughts of characters came across as odd. For example, the two female protagonists met in a parking lot when the lawyer initiates a bizarre conversation about her future client's watch. The future client's response is equally strange. If a stranger approached me in a parking lot when I was putting groceries in my car, commented on my watch, asked me where I got it, said her mother was buried with one just like it, that she didn't want her mother buried with it but her brother insisted because he bought it, I wouldn't be answering her questions, exchanging names and acting like best buds. Then the same day, the potential client shows up at the lawyer's home uninvited, says she looked up the address, and instead of being wary and wondering if this was a potential stalker, the lawyer invites her in for dinner. This all took place early in the book and it went downhill from there. It was impossible to suspend disbelief when characters thought and acted outside the bounds of normal fictional behaviour. I don't expect realism in fiction, but I expect something to make sense within the context of the story and characters.This book received a number of positive reviews, so I am in the minority, but I didn't enjoy this book. It was an acceptable first draft, but it needed further work to make it read like something aimed at an adult audience. The potential was there, and I admit that I couldn't write a book half as well as this author, but this book wasn't what it could have been.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X5BZP8BQCI03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G7SWQQU#wasThisHelpful","R2X5BZP8BQCI03","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a thoroughly enjoyable romantic suspense book. It was weighted more towards the suspense, but the romance was a strong component. The hero and heroine were very sympathetic and likeable, as were the supporting characters. The villains were easy to hate. One was overtly evil and made no pretence of being anything but evil. The other was more despicable because he contributed to great suffering through both his actions and inaction, while still believing he was a good person.The plot held together well and the story was generally fast paced. As the synopsis indicates, the plot deals with what happened years earlier to three teenage foster children and one infant and the effects that resulted from it. In addition to dealing with the personal toll that experience had on their lives, the protagonists are faced with current threats from enemies from the past. One protagonist remains a mystery, but the author contrasts the effects the abuse had on the heroine with that of her foster sister. While no rapes are depicted, there are discussions about rapes that happened to characters and there are threats of rape.Despite the dark subject matter, the overall tone is hopeful and optimistic. This is a romance, so we know there will be a happily ever after for the hero and heroine. Beyond the happy conclusion to the romance, however, there is a sense of redemption and of second chances. There is the sense that while life is not always perfect and we don't always have a happy outcome in every aspect of our lives, there is still love and happiness to be found.There were a couple of brief, mild sex scenes, so those who want hot and those who want clean are warned.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes well written romantic suspense books. This one was highly entertaining and kept me engaged and turning virtual pages, well into the wee hours of the night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W3MPIRD3TKRP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLJPM9G#wasThisHelpful","R1W3MPIRD3TKRP","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've found Nora Roberts to be a reliable writer, with most of her books earning four or five stars from me. Sometimes she writes a book that I absolutely hate, 'Black Hills' and 'The Search' being amongst that small number. Consequently, when I read some negative reviews of this series, I was wary, and almost didn't buy it. However, I am glad that I decided to try it, because I enjoyed it greatly.Each book in the series is a standalone, but they are closely linked with one another. The three heroines are best friends and the three heroes are brothers. There is a ghost that is a central character, but this didn't feel like a true paranormal series to me. That may not make sense, but to me, the series felt more like straightforward contemporary romances that just happened to include a ghost.Straightforward contemporary romances are not my favourite romance sub-genre, so I tend to be a demanding reader. This series engaged me and held my interest; I preferred the first book in the series, but I liked the other two. There was a great deal of tension and conflict in the first book, which made it more interesting. The second and third books concentrated on the unfolding romances and the investigation of the ghost's history, which made for pleasant reading, but did not have the same level of excitement as the first book.Prior to beginning this series, I read how Ms. Roberts based the setting's businesses on her real-life properties, and how she referenced her other books in the stories. Some reviewers were critical of this, while others thought it was cool. I subscribe to the cool factor camp and thought it added a personal touch. The use of real businesses and the references to Eve and Roarke were the sort of in-jokes that add a touch of humour.The pace was leisurely, with the descriptions of the characters' everyday activities slowly unfolding and painting a picture of the lives of the central characters. A few times, the pace slowed a bit too much in the last two books, but each time, it quickly picked up again. Although the books were not fast paced, neither were they too slow or boring. These books are not romantic suspense books, where one expects a fast pace, so readers expecting fast paced excitement will be disappointed. The stories focus on the characters; who are they, what are they like, what is their background, how did they become the people they are, what do they think and feel about things, what are their hopes and dreams, what are their daily lives like, how do they interact with each other and do their jobs, how are their romances progressing, and will everyone get their happily ever after? These books read more like Roberts' well-crafted vintage Silhouette series romances than her later paranormal or suspense books, or her edgier J.D. Robb works.There are a few mild sex scenes in each book, as well as profanity. The books are not clean reads, but neither are they erotica. Readers who are easily offended, however, will probably do well to skip these books.I highly recommend these books to readers who like a traditional, leisurely paced, contemporary romance. They are in the Silhouette style, but with more depth and characterization than usually found in those books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZMHX9NMBAG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEDDRFI#wasThisHelpful","RDZMHX9NMBAG8","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this Miele Microset when we bought our Miele vacuum cleaner at an appliance store. My husband love gadgets and wanted this kit, which I didn't think was necessary. I suppose it isn't strictly necessary, but it has proven its worth, several times over.We have several oil paintings, most with intricately decorated frames. As well, we have tapestries, various types of framed and hanging textile art decorations, and the usual electronic devices found in a home.  We use this kit to lightly and safely vacuum the oil paintings and textile art. It also cleans tiny, intricate items and delicate, hard to reach places.

"We bought this Miele vacuum cleaner at an appliance store after doing a lot of online research. My husband and I have physical limitations and my husband has asthma and copd; we wanted a vacuum that would be very lightweight, powerful and allergy-friendly. As well, we planned on staying in our apartment that had all tile and flat, low level carpeting, and we had no pets, so we did not need the electronic beater bar.This was the best vacuum we ever had in over forty years, even better than our electroluxes. The suction is beyond powerful, it was easy to manoeuvre in small, tight spaces, it was so lightweight that it didn't affect bad backs, knees or shoulders, it didn't kick up dust that would aggravate allergies and it was so quiet that we barely noticed it was running. We bought the more expensive hepa filters, although the ones included with the machine worked extremely well. We were concerned about having to replace vacuum bags frequently, but surprisingly, they last far longer than any larger bags we used on other machines. The machine's performance exceeded our expectations and we loved it. Then we moved to a house with hard floors, but bought a couple of high pile area rugs, and got two cats. Disaster? Absolutely not.This vacuum still performed as advertised and continued to exceed expectations. It easily handled soil and grass carried in from outdoors, small amounts of sawdust, messes left from sanding drywall, cat hair, and it did an admirable job on the area rugs, so we didn't feel we needed a different vacuum cleaner. Then we inherited a new canister vacuum cleaner with an electronic beater bar. It was much larger than the Miele, was very heavy and didn't manoeuvre as well as the Miele, the suction didn't seem as powerful when cleaning bare floors, but it did clean the rugs better, although it created a bit of airborne dust. Our rugs looked clean when we used the Miele, and it certainly removed superficial debris; however, we could actually notice a difference in the cleanliness when we used a beater bar. Now we use the Miele for regular cleaning and haul out the other vacuum when we want to give the rugs a deeper cleaning.This Miele still rates five stars because it performed exactly as advertised. We saw the Miele model with the electronic beater bar in use, and it cleaned high pile carpets amazingly well. We were idiots, however, and went with the cheaper model since we didn't need the beater bar at that time. My advice is, if buying a Miele, buy the model with the beater bar.The Miele came with accessories for regular cleaning, but we purchased an extra kit that was for the fine cleaning of items like keyboards, electronics, and intricate or delicate items. It wasn't necessary but it satisfied my husband's need for gadgets and it is actually useful.I highly recommend a Miele. Considering its size, it outperforms larger vacuums and is a blessing to anyone who has physical limitations, lives in a small home or in one crowded with furniture. It handles a larger house as easily as it does a small apartment, and deals with pet hair, routine and extraordinary clean ups with efficiency and ease. As another reviewer said, the Miele really sucks, which is fantastic in a vacuum cleaner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EASJKOD34ZOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGRC#wasThisHelpful","R2EASJKOD34ZOO","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had mixed feelings about this book. Sandra Brown's writing mechanics were excellent and deserved five stars. Her descriptive prose was masterful, and brought scenes and characters to life.Some reviewers criticized some aspects of the plot, the amnesia device in particular, as being a clich. If authors only used new and unique storylines, no new books would have been written since ancient times. It is the way in which an author personalizes a story that brings freshness to a familiar story or plot device. Ms. Brown created an engaging story using the amnesia device and I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.The romance had less prominence than the suspense, but there was enough romance to lighten the darker suspense portion. The suspense was well done, with a gradual buildup towards the revelation that opened the heroine's eyes. The author took time to let the reader become familiar with the story's setting and characters, and gradually peeled back layers, so the reader could see beneath the surface. Overall, the story had a leisurely pace, but did not drag.There were some well done, graphic sex scenes, but they were fairly mild and there wasn't too much space devoted to them. They were a minor part of the book and were by no means erotica. There was also some profanity, so those who dislike sex and profanity might want to skip this book.There were a few violent scenes, but about what one would expect for the genre. It wasn't a 'gore fest' book by any means.**********************SPOILERS*********************I definitely enjoyed this book but one plot point lowered my rating from outstanding to acceptable. The false identity seemed totally unnecessary to me and stopped me from suspending disbelief. The author tried to explain it, but it didn't work. There was no plausible motivation for the heroine using a false identity. The heroine was a lawyer and she would eventually have got a job she wanted. All she had to do was keep sending out rsums and wait, like any normal person would. It was illogical and stupid to assume someone else's identity. She risked all kinds of legal penalties fo no good reason.As well, there is no way the heroine could have hoped to sustain a false identity when her grandmother and best friend were known to residents in her new town. Besides, she would have had to have all false documents, such as driver's license and social security. She couldn't just waltz in with a rsum and no supporting identification. How did she get licensed to practice law in a new state? She also got married using a false identity, but how did she get a marriage license with no birth certificate or other identification? If her marriage had lasted and she remained in that town, was she going to live her whole life with a false identity? She was committing major felonies on a whim, simply because she wanted to be a public defender and didn't feel like waiting for her own job offer? Even when dealing with the federal authorities over her testimony on a serious matter, she kept the false identity to the bitter end. I really hated that plot device.*********End of Spoilers *********I liked this book and I recommend it, despite what I whined about in the spoiler. The prose, the story, the characterization and the pacing made for a satisfying read. My three star rating may seem harsh, given that everything else merited five stars. However, the flaw was too egregious to ignore.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36SZJQWX0VGJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEK6ZWM#wasThisHelpful","R36SZJQWX0VGJT","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I read this book, I loved the first part but had mixed feelings about the second part. The first part was riveting. I think it gave me expectations of an action-oriented/thriller plot, and that wasn't what the story ultimately was like. I decided to reread the book, this time more carefully and without pre-conceived ideas. This second reading gave me an entirely new perspective on the second part.Some reviewers likened Elizabeth/Abigail to a robotic Data. I found her to be very human and more like the character Bones, rather than an unfeeling robot. She was socially inept, took things literally, and tried to remain logical and detached. Underneath, she wanted to connect, to form relationships, to love and be loved, and to be 'normal'. She was an extremely likeable character, as was the hero, Brooks.The 'love at first sight' scenario also generated criticism by some reviewers. Nora Roberts' books are not contemporary novels or non-fiction; Nora Roberts writes romance and romantic suspense books. By their nature, they are fictional works, fantasies, fairy tales, idealized depictions of love, romance and 'happily ever after'; most readers read these types of books for that very reason. It seems ingenious to read a type of book one dislikes and then to give one star and to criticize the book for being what it was intended to be.This was a book where the journey in the second part focused on personal growth, relationships, and personalities. Elizabeth/Abigail chose to live in this town and hoped to be able to settle permanently in it. Therefore, the personality of the town and some of its inhabitants were important to the story. Readers got to see the town and some of its characters through various eyes and perspectives, including those of Abigail, Brooks and the secondary characters. Part of this included some of the day-to-day interactions of Brooks as a police chief, colleague, friend, son and sibling, as well as Abigail's lover. Readers saw Abigail progress from an aloof person who had no interactions with the town, other than brief shopping forays, to someone who learned about her neighbours and formed connections through Brooks. The wife-beating drunk and the young punk with his wealthy, bullying father, are not superfluous to the story. The relationships between them, other residents of the town and Brooks, provide depth and richness to the story. As well, these connections were what helped strengthen Abigail's resolve to face her past and to stop running. Once the reader understands that these relationships and Abigail's character development are the story, it all falls into place.Abigail's character development began with her relationship with John and Terry, where she had her first exposure to normality. It stopped with their deaths; she knew she was stunted, but didn't know how to achieve more than a lonely survival mode. She was an outsider, looking in, wanting to fit in, not knowing how to, being afraid to try, thinking she was doomed to always being alone and apart. Therefore, the connections she forged in this town, through Brooks, and her increasing involvement with the people and happenings of the community, as well as the loving relationship between her and Brooks, are actually more significant than the trial that eventually wrapped up the book's first part.I liked this book, with reservations, when I first read it. Upon reading it again, I enjoyed it even more and really loved the pacing, characterizations and plot. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romances and romantic suspense books. It is superb.A warning to those unfamiliar with Nora Roberts' writing, this book has explicit sex scenes and swearing. They don't comprise a large percentage of the book, but they are there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C00XVUO7P93M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074VTHBQ#wasThisHelpful","R1C00XVUO7P93M","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I read a book, I read it for what it is, and adjust my expectations accordingly. It was fairly obvious that this was a Silhouette reprint. Even if that detail had been absent, it is easy to find out whether or not a book is a reprint. In addition, the clearly stated size of two hundred and twenty pages indicates that this is not one of Nora Roberts' longer, well developed works. It seems a bit harsh for people to give the book low ratings because they didn't pay attention. More and more authors are having their blacklists digitized because readers have indicated that they want them, so neither the author nor the publisher is trying to cheat potential readers.This is one of Roberts' older series romances and it is an excellent one that has aged very well. The technology is old because of when the book was written, <eye rolling>, so I don't see why some reviewers criticized the book because of it. I don't expect cell phones in a work by Dickens or in any book written prior to their widespread use. The hero, Cliff, is not perfect but he is still a well written hero. He was written as a bit of a jerk in the very beginning because he stereotyped the heroine, Maggie. As part of the journey from their initial meeting to Cliff's proposal, Maggie's actions and personality changed Cliff's mind about her. He admitted he was wrong and his behaviour changed. I felt this was an important element in the story, as it showed the hero's growth as a person.Maggie has a lot of backbone. She was quietly assertive and stood up for herself. She was very clear about not owing others explanations about her life and her decisions, if it was none of their business. Cliff did pressure her for sex but he wasn't abusive about it and Maggie was assertive enough to refuse until she was ready.I don't expect the same type of mystery in a series romance as I do in a much longer book. There simply isn't room to develop it properly. The mystery component of this book was light and I easily guessed who committed the murder, but I still enjoyed it immensely. I don't think the murder was significant as a major element of suspense; it worked more as a vehicle to reflect the qualities of the hero and heroine, to let them learn more about each other and to further the romance.This was an extremely good series romance that contained elements of a mystery, some conflict, and good characterization. It is the kind of book one picks up for a quick read and to escape into a fantasy life for a few hours. I highly recommend it to readers who like series romances and good writing skills.It puzzles me as to why anyone would buy a series romance and then complain because it is a series romance. So for those who dislike ""cheesy romances"", old technology and reprints of a good book, stay away from this one. Leave it for those of us who appreciate the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LOVNEQJTLDF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L7NTY5Q#wasThisHelpful","R3LOVNEQJTLDF7","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just replaced my paper copy of this book with the Kindle version and reread it. It had been quite a while since I originally read it, so I wasn't sure if I would still like it. I'm happy to say that it was a thoroughly enjoyable book. I read some of the negative reviews, and while some criticisms may be valid, I didn't find anything in the book that detracted from my enjoyment.I've visited Savannah several times, but am not very familiar with its geography and police department. I suppose mistakes made in the book would irritate someone who is familiar with those areas, but they didn't bother me. I have been irritated by authors who place ports in landlocked cities and commit other major faux-pas, but I can live with minor glitches. As for Savannah not having full time hostage negotiators, I allow literary license in fiction, as long as it isn't too egregious. In this case, it added to the story and I could easily suspend disbelief.I liked Phoebe, Duncan and their friends and family. Sometimes when reading fiction, I just want to relax and escape from real life. Maybe the characters were not realistic, but it was nice to imagine that such loveable characters exist. Who wouldn't want to meet a man like Duncan, or have such loving and supportive family and friends? Romance readers love heroes who are vampires, shape shifters, demons, ghosts, time-travellers, super heroes, royalty, and a myriad of other types of heroes, so why not a multi-millionaire with a heart of gold? Also most people who read romances expect a bit of fantasy like love at first sight and I love that particular scenario. I know it isn't realistic, but I don't read romances for realism. Since this book is romantic suspense and not a straightforward romance, I expect some violence and language. I didn't feel either was over done and I enjoyed the element of suspense. There was a good amount of tension but not so much as in a thriller. I enjoyed the chapters that presented the villain's point of view and motivation, which added depth to the story. Those chapters managed to reval a lot about the villain without revealing his or her identity.There were flaws that I considered to be minor and which did not detract from the story. I absolutely hated 'Black Hills', so I am not a non-judgmental reader of Nora Roberts' books. Was this book a classic literary masterpiece? No, and it didn't pretend to be. It was a nice romantic suspense book that allowed the reader to escape for a few hours and to immerse himself or herself in a world where there is love at first sight, multi-millionaires with a heart of gold who are perfect heroes, close-knit loving family and friends, a place where good triumphs and where there is a happily ever after. I read books by authors like Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky when I want realism and expect a tragedy, or I read the news. This book was excellent for its purpose of entertaining a reader and allowing the reader to escape from reality for a few hours.I recommend this book for readers who like romantic suspense and Nora Roberts. It may not be her very best book, but it is definitely one of her better ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DAIB8YNV0CFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000T9BRTA#wasThisHelpful","R1DAIB8YNV0CFE","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had these books in paperback and replaced them with Kindle books before the boxed set was available. These are short, very well written traditional regencies and I enjoyed them immensely. They were originally written under the name 'Claudette Williams', so some readers may remember having read them when the author used that name.These were clean, sweet romances and while longer than novella length, were fast reads. They are perfect for when the reader simply wants to be entertained for a few hours. I don't think any reader who appreciates this genre will be disappointed. However, readers who want their regencies to be thinly disguised contemporary romances, with anachronisms and lots of hot sex, will be very disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25NAM4X1JB1TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MNQGHAQ#wasThisHelpful","R25NAM4X1JB1TL","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very disappointed in 'The Hunt"" by Hannah Howell. I normally love her books and have replaced almost every one of my paper editions with Kindle. I like the McNachton storyline, but this particular story felt like all sex loosely held together by a bit of story. I don't mind explicit sex in stories, but I want a good story. I became angry at the number of story-interruptuses there were and felt like screaming at the characters to get over it, already. The characters were good, the hero and heroine were likeable and the plot was great. Unfortunately, especially given the novella length, the characterizations and plot suffered because of all the sex. There was a lot of unfulfilled potential in this story. I don't know if the author chose to focus on the sex or if it was done at the urging of the publisher, but I hated it. I would rate this story one star and only recommend it to readers who want to complete the McNaughton storyline.'The Rescue', by Lynsay Sands, was very well written. The characters were wonderful, the plot was engaging, the dialogue both sparkled with humour and tugged at the heart strings, not an easy feat. The opening scene alone, with the hero's reaction to the heroine's singing, had me laughing out loud. As someone who cannot sing a note, I had no trouble visualizing the action. As well, the heroine's efforts to help the hero usually ended up in pure farce, further reducing me to tears of laughter.The hero was a sweetheart. He was honourable, brave and noble, and he showed great tenderness, sensitivity and compassion when interacting with the heroine's dying father. For such a strong alpha hero, he was like putty in the heroine's hands; he definitely didn't know what hit him when he met her.There was sex in this story, but it was a minor part of it. The story was the focus in this novella and it was Ms. Sands at her finest. I would rate it five stars, ten if I could, and I highly recommend it.As a compromise, given the uneven quality of the stories, I am rating this book three stars and recommend it for the story by Lynsay Sands.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19B33I8V4LG9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAHS2LW#wasThisHelpful","R19B33I8V4LG9Y","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Rainshadow series is fantastic and this book is a very strong entry. Each Rainshadow book is a stand alone work, so no fear of cliffhangers or needing to have read previous books in order to understand what's going on.I loved everything about this book and think it was perfect. The opening scene was brilliant and a memorable way to introduce the heroine. The hero and heroine, Rafe and Ella, were very likeable and strong characters. The romance and suspense components of this book were well balanced, and Rafe's and Ella's characterizations worked perfectly in both aspects.The dialogue was wonderful, with amusing banter, mild sarcasm, and pithy comments. The story was fast paced and flowed very well. It was extremely engaging and I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It just pulled me along and I couldn't turn the pages, well, the electronic ones, fast enough; I was very eager to see how the romance and the mystery unfolded. I know, I know; readers know there will be a happily ever after and that the bad guys will lose, but the journey to that conclusion was enthralling.Each book in the series has a dust bunny companion, and this one had a lot of personality. Lorelei almost stole the show. Her love for her bridal veil and powdered doughnuts were sweet, and her initial meeting with Rafe was a very funny scene. It was obvious that she was checking him out as a potential mate for Ella.There were a few well written sex scenes that weren't overly graphic but were sensual and romantic. I liked that the book focused on the story and not the sex, although the sex scenes were crucial in advancing the romance and paranormal connection between the hero and heroine.One scene was poignant, when a predator died. The heroine's reflections on its death were thoughtful, acknowledging the necessity but at the same time seeing the tragedy. This scene added some depth and weight to an otherwise light romance, without dragging the story down and slowing the momentum; it was very skillfully written.Any fans of Jayne Ann Krentz's books will likely fall in love with this one. She truly outdid herself. For anyone approaching her work for the first time, don't hesitate to try this book. It is usually always better to read a series in order, but someone who wants to start with this book shouldn't feel lost.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes Ms. Krentz's writing, as well as to anyone who likes or wants to try futuristic paranormal romances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10MC25FUQB0AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH8324K#wasThisHelpful","R10MC25FUQB0AX","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I saw the trailer for this movie as a child at a Saturday matinee. I was dying to see it but it was rated for a higher age group. I was ecstatic when I saw it was available on DVD and immediately ordered it. Unfortunately, times have changed and the movie probably doesn't have the same impact it did when it was released for the box office.I love many 'B' British movies, so that was not the problem. The main problem is that the movie wasn't scary. It would have terrified me years ago, but it was extremely tame by today's standards.Other factors were also related to the era when it was produced. The music was cheesy and annoying; it definitely had that late 1959s/early 1960s 'B' movie music flavour. As well, scenes that were meant to titilate were very tame by today's standards. For example, a woman dressed in what was a provocative dress at the time and did a shimmy-like solo dance for a group of men in a pub. Then she went home, undressed to her corset, went out of sight, and came back wearing a nighty that was probably considered to be sexy. The dance was painfully embarrassing and there was nothing that sexy or risqu by today's standards. I'm sure that the young men watching it in theatres were salivating back then, but today's youth would likely find those scenes to be boring.The main character has a distractingly bad hair piece. I don't know if it was real hair or a wig, but it looked ridiculous. Looked almost as bad as Donald Trump's toupee. Instead of being a scary character, the actor's scenes were stolen by his hair, and it undermined his credibility as a villain.The acting itself was good 'B' movie acting. The henchman was very stiff and the tart over-emoted, but everyone else definitely gave decent portrayals of their characters. Some of the dialogue was stiff and cheesy, which detracted from performances, but the actors did well with what they had to work with.Unless you are like I was, and simply HAVE to see this movie, I wouldn't recommend it. It was boring and not up to the standards of the great British 'B' movies.The quality of the DVD was excellent, with crisp and clear picture and sound. The pressing seemed good, with no imperfections. There were no liner inserts but the dust jacket on the case was very informative and included photos and artwork. There are a number of sellers for this DVD, so there may be some differences depending upon the seller, but mine provided a first-class product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R261909YQ9M5J9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000087F3A#wasThisHelpful","R261909YQ9M5J9","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product was as described. I don't like the fact that the user can't manually control the off button; it shuts off automatically after five minutes. I don't know if I missed that in the description or if it wasn't mentioned, but I prefer to shut it off as soon as I'm done using it.I edited this review and lowered my rating, because after using the thermometer a few times, I became very disappointed in it. I already had a digital thermometer but it didn't say it was an instant one. When I use it, I have to wait several seconds as it climbs up to the temperature of the food. I kept hearing about instant thermometers and bought this one because it was described as instant. The first time I used it, it gave a reading fairly quickly. However, on subsequent uses, it took several seconds to climb, just like my older thermometer. I experimented by using both thermometers at the same time. To my chagrin, my older thermometer reached the temperature reading faster than this one.The digital screen on my older thermometer is larger and much easier to read. If this thermometer was faster than my older one, I could live with it; but it isn't faster, so this is just one more area in which it fails.Other reviewers have praised this thermometer, so it obviously works for them. I am disappointed with it, though, and do not recommend it.

"I have several of this author's books in paper, bought years ago. This book is a well written traditional regency romance, with a hint of mystery. I loved some aspects of the story and it came so close to being a five-star book, but the heroine spoiled it.The heroine was incredibly annoying and 'too stupid to live'. As part of her characterization, she is written as a stubborn person, well known for doing the opposite of what someone tells her. As a result, she puts herself in danger, even when she knows someone is trying to kill her. The hero tries to protect her and to make her aware of precautions she needs to take, but she either reacts out of anger or brattiness, and thwarts his efforts. She simply refuses to believe that certain characters could be involved in a plot against her, no matter how the hero tries to warn her.Every time I would get lost in my enjoyment of the story, the heroine would say or do something stupid and contrary, pulling me out of the moment. I would get back into the story, and then it would happen again. It was very frustrating.This was a great traditional regency, apart from the heroine's moments of stupidity. The author stayed fairly close to the social norms, there were no glaring anachronisms, no bad language and no sex scenes. This was a very clean read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre and can get past the heroine's characterization. I like it well enough that I have kept it, despite my criticisms of the heroine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19B9LZ46KW4KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LZ8QNRA#wasThisHelpful","R19B9LZ46KW4KD","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like some of the other reviewers, I was familiar with a few of the authors, but most were new to me. I'm glad I took a chance on the set because it was of very high quality with excellent writing.I confess that I did not read the story by Felicity Heaton. I scanned a few pages to determine if the writing was of similar quality to the other stories, and it was. I'm usually very open-minded; I will read erotica, romances with explicit sex, gay couples, heroes or heroines who are demons, shape-shifters, vampires, witches, former bad guys or bad girls, and so on. My Baptist upbringing came into play on this one though and I was unable to read a story with Satan as the hero. This is a personal quirk and no reflection upon the author, but it stopped me cold. It may be unfair or hypocritical, but there you have it, I'm a satan bigot. I will try other works by this author and I did not deduct points for what is my phobia, and not the author's fault.The other stories were all good reads in their own way. The stories by Caris and London had darker settings, with future earth worlds that were semi-apocalyptic, with disorder, crime and corruption. The protagonists were likeable and the plots were entertaining. These seemed to be stand alone works that were part of series. I liked the world building and characterization enough that I will try other books by these authors.The other stories had contemporary settings. The story by Vanak was good, but a bit weaker than the others. There was a bit too much repetition and the hero drove me crazy because he gave orders with no explanations and he didn't give the heroine basic information about his werewolf community. For example, the heroine encouraged a werewolf to drink something that almost killed him, because no one told her it was deadly to betas. However, the hero definitely redeemed himself in a very unselfish and heroic manner. Maybe the author had the correct idea in writing him as she did, because the reader could see how he was transformed by falling in love with the heroine, and this strengthened the plot.Ashley, Kellison and Gleason had strong entries with likeable protagonists, entertaining plots and even pacing. I'm not familiar with Kellison's work so I don't know if her story is part of a series. I hope so, because the characterization and world building were very good. Ashley's and Gleason's books were part of their series, and I especially love Ashley's shifter community. Their books were stand alone works with the support of regular characters, and both were excellent additions to their respective series.I saved Quinn's book for last. This story was outstanding and I fell in love with it. The Reaper was a swoon-worthy, to-die-for hero. (Sorry, I couldn't resist the pun. My bad.) He was protective, sweet, loveable and totally adorable. The heroine was a perfect match for him, a loving, compassionate woman with a good heart. The unfolding of their romance and the way they communicated with each other was heart-warming. The children were very well written and significant to the plot; they were not simply one-dimensional props. The plot was suspenseful, with just the right amount of 'scary' for a romance book. I will definitely be looking for more books from this author.All of these books have well written, explicit sex scenes, some longer and more explicit than others. None of these books could be considered erotica, but they are not clean reads.I often buy these inexpensive boxed sets; some have been duds while others have been very good buys. This set is outstanding and I don't think anyone who likes paranormal romances would be disappointed with it. Individual tastes differ, so some readers might not like all of the stories, but they all (except for Satan), appealed to me and held my interest. Sometimes, in these boxed sets, there may be one or two strong works anchoring the set, but these books are evenly matched and all are strong entries. I highly recommend it, and recommend buying it while it is still an incredible bargain at $0.99","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP7PODHD6PFDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZM538FM#wasThisHelpful","RP7PODHD6PFDO","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had my paperback copy of this book for years and often reread it. In many ways it is a typical Harlequin Romance of the time of its publication; you know fairly well what to expect when you pick one up. I mean that as a compliment, because Harlequin had some very good writers and published some exceptionally good series romance books.This book is very well written, with likeable protagonists and a very good plot, which definitely kept me engaged. Readers know a romance book will have a happily ever after, but even knowing that, Cresswell created enough suspense about the impersonation and tension from the growing attraction between the hero and heroine, that that I couldn't put this book down. Once I had read it the first time, the quality of the writing and the characterization kept me returning to it whenever I wanted a 'feel good' book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre. I think Cresswell has been underated as an author; although she branched out into mainstream romantic suspense books and historical romance books, this book is a good representation of the quality writing she did for Harlequin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NE4ON0ANP9T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373470533#wasThisHelpful","R1NE4ON0ANP9T9","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book in paperback years ago and it has remained a 'keeper'. I'm surprised it hasn't been offered in Kindle yet. It was a very well written paranormal, historical romance, with very engaging protagonists and a storyline that held my interest.The main story revolves around the nave, unprepared heroine who inherits a brothel in the American west, complete with the ghost of the hero, and their romance. However, the author does an excellent job with the characterization of the prostitutes, depicting them as individuals with histories, strengths, weaknesses, talents, hopes and dreams. They are supporting characters but are more than just stock, cardboard tropes.There was mild sex and sexual innuendo in the book, but it played a small part in the story. Those who want a perfectly clean romance will probably want to avoid this book, which is a shame. This is such a nice, traditional historical romance, albeit with a ghost for a hero.I highly recommend this book and hope it eventually makes it to Kindle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VG16I5BWDO00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0821771957#wasThisHelpful","R3VG16I5BWDO00","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the Kindle version of this book to replace my old paperback edition. I loved this book and the other time-travel romances the author wrote, back when I was first introduced to the genre. Having reread them, I feel they stood the test of time.This book was well written and entertaining, with a likeable hero and heroine. It was an interesting concept to include Louis Riel and the Mtis Rebellion in the story, as it seems more common to include Native Americans from the American west. The author illustrated the adjustments the heroine had to make to living in the past and the various prejudices she encountered, as well as the plight of the Indigenous peoples, Mtis, soldiers and settlers that made up the society in which she found herself.The romance evolved slowly and realistically. The overall pace of the book was even, both the highs and lows of life in that time were depicted, and the balance between the romance and the plot was fairly even. There was explicit sex in the book, but it was quite mild and not a large component of the book. This was by no means a hot erotic work. Anyone expecting either a very clean or a very erotic work will likely be hugely disappointed. This book has stood the test of time but it has a traditional feel to it.I recommend this book to anyone who likes traditional time-travel romances that are well written, with attention to characterization and setting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BD9U7FU6X50L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N4DDQQK#wasThisHelpful","R1BD9U7FU6X50L","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got a few of this author's books when they were free and discovered they weren't really to my taste. Having said that, they were very well written and should appeal to those who like this genre.This was a sweet romance with a likeable hero and heroine. There was explicit vanilla-style sex with a fairly even balance between sex scenes and the rest of the story, and there definitely was a story; this book wasn't all sex and no story. Given the short length of the book, the story was suitably developed, but not as well as in a larger work, which is understandable.This is a good book for when a reader wants something quick, sweetly romantic and slightly erotic. It would have worked well as a longer piece, where the author could have developed it better, but it was still an enjoyable, well written short story. Although it was not my type of story, I can appreciate it for what it is. I recommend it to readers who like this genre, and the quality should please those for whom writing mechanics are important. The author has done a good job.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PJZGO49EWPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X1G4B1Y#wasThisHelpful","R34PJZGO49EWPA","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author was new to me but the book was free, so I decided to try it. It turned out that it was not to my taste, but it was a good book for its genre.The hero was sweet and both he and the heroine were likeable. The erotic sex scenes were a significant portion of the book, but there was a nice, simple story framing the sex. The sex scenes were explicit, well written, mainly of the vanilla variety, and love was the impetus-----yes, there was lust, but it was based on falling in love. The falling in love was fast, but having a shifter's mate involved accounts for that. As well, this was a short story, so the reader should expect a fast pace for both the love and the sex.The author did a good job combining a sweet love story with an erotic one. This was a short read, perfect for when one wants a quick, sensuous read. As I said, it was not my style, but I could appreciate it for what it was. I recommend it to readers who like this genre.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDYSW1JV5BZ33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VMQUPJW#wasThisHelpful","RDYSW1JV5BZ33","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have this short story in the paperback anthology in which it was first published, as well as the stand alone paperback. Contrary to some reviews, it is not an abridged book and it has a conclusion. There was nothing deceptive about its republication as a short stand alone book or as an eBook, because this is a common practice and because the blurb made it clear that this was an older work.Like some other reviewers, I wish this were a novel instead of a short story, simply because I enjoyed it so much and wanted more. I loved this little story and it is perfect for when you want a Jayne Ann Krentz fix but don't have much time. It is a typical Krentz/Castle work, which means wonderful protagonists, dialogue, world building and plot. For a short work, it delivers a high quality story.Currently the Kindle price is $2.99, which is more than I am willing to pay for a short story. The publishers set prices, and while the quality of this story is excellent, I have my paper copies to enjoy, so I will wait in hopes of a price drop. Otherwise, I would probably cave in and buy it, because it is a nice addition to the Harmony series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P0050NHY4NVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMCPR92#wasThisHelpful","R2P0050NHY4NVC","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Enjoyed the good balance of high level strategy, unit combat, and a leavening of individual experiences.  Until reading this book I had no concept of how poorly trained and sadly equipped the troops defending Singapore were, or how commanders influenced the campaign through incompetence or by heroism.  The poor showing of some of the Indian & Australian forces vis-a-vis the heroism of most is dealt with in a fair and balanced way.  Finally,  the history of the colony and the complicated relations between the various cultures is examined.  The book is very readable; flows well, and appears well researched.  I wish the editors had provided a few basic maps through the book to give a broad view of the peninsula and the island, to show just how near & surrounded the island is to the mainland.  I recommend this book highly as the comprehensive history of the development of, & the fall of, Malaysia & Singapore.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SWB742O3GM1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFJFXNC#wasThisHelpful","R30SWB742O3GM1","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book through the Kindle Unlimited programme, so I won't show as a verified purchaser.I have almost all of this author's books and both my husband and I love them. This book was very different from her other work, but every bit as good in its own way. As I started reading it, I was taken aback at first. I was expecting a book in the style of EE or her Ruby Lionsdrake space series, but once I saw where it was going, I relaxed and went along for the adventure.The world building, characterization, and dialogue were excellent, as per the author's usual standards. The plot was very entertaining and the time travel, facilitated by a time machine, was a nice nod to H.G. Wells and early science fiction. The hero and heroine were very likeable and made a great team, while supporting characters were also well fleshed out.This story was definitely grittier than Buroker's/Lionsdrake's other works and the sex was more explicit. I'm quite catholic in my reading tastes. I like books with no sex, profanity or violence and I like them with a moderate amount of explicit sex, situationally appropriate profanity and moderate violence. With this book, Buroker told an engaging story with the right amount of sex and violence appropriate to the plot.I enjoyed this book as much as Buroker's/Lionsdrake's other books. It was very well written, held my interest and left me wanting more. While the quality of the writing and storytelling was of the same caliber as Buroker's other works, this book was very different. Readers who want another EE will be disappointed. Those who like to explore other genres and sub-genres, and can adjust to an author writing in more than one style, might really enjoy this departure from Buroker's norm.I highly recommend this book. Fans, read it for what it is, on its own merits, and not for what you expect or want it to be, and you will discover how versatile a writer Buroker is. Those new to Buroker/Lionsdrake, this is a departure from her normal style, but it is also an excellent read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2IQE85J9BJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UK8EGP2#wasThisHelpful","R3I2IQE85J9BJI","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Contemporary romance is my least favourite in romance sub-genres, although I do like to read it for a change from the other sub-genres. Since it is not my favourite one, however, I tend to be more critical when reading it. I had reservations when getting this set because most of the authors were unfamiliar to me, but there were two whose works I like, so I decided to try the set. I thought that if the rest were duds, for the low price I would at least have two books that I liked. To my surprise, I liked all of the novels and novellas. Since this is a set, I am reviewing it as a set, rather than as individual books.I know for certain that at least some of these authors write or wrote for Harlequin Romance and these works reflect that series style. I like the Harlequin/Silhouette style because the books are usually well written and perfect for light reading, which these works are. The works in this set are entertaining and engaging, just right for relaxing and unwinding.I looked at some of the one star reviews and was puzzled at seeing some books in the set characterized as porn, with all sex and no story. If anyone has read some of my other reviews, it is clear that I am fine with some amount of explicit, fairly vanilla sex scenes, but that I hate books that have too much sex, more sex than story, and the darker type of sex scenes. So I guess it depends upon one's definition of porn and what one considers to be more sex than story, but I found that there were not long, frequent sex scenes. While there were some explicit as well as non-explicit sex scenes, even the explicit ones were rather mild. I didn't view them as super hot and frankly, I think any readers who want a lot of very hot sex scenes would be bored with this set. I found them to be just right, a good balance of both slightly explicit and clean romances, perfect for this grandmother who finds that long, frequent sex scenes interrupt the storyline and get to be very boring.There were also complaints about profanity. There was profanity in some of the stories, and yes, the 'F' bomb was used. I don't understand why some people consider one bit of profanity to be worse than others, but obviously, some people do. So if profanity in general and the 'F' bomb in particular, bothers potential readers, they would be advised to avoid this set. Considering how ubiquitous profanity is on even the schoolyards today, however, I think it has lost its shock value. Nevertheless, none of these books was particularly profanity-riddled. It was used judiciously in some of the books and was not used gratuitously.Others have given a synopsis of each book so I am not going to repeat their work. I do think the works in this set were fairly even in terms of quality. A few had minor editing errors, some were clean reads and some were not, some used literary license in their depictions, some required more suspension of disbelief than others, all had good characterization, some protagonists were more likeable than others but none were unlikeable, all books were evenly paced, none dragged and all were enjoyable. One's reaction to books is very subjective. This set worked for me. I really didn't expect to enjoy any of it, other than the two books by authors whose work I like. Considering my negative feelings when starting to read these books, I think it speaks well for the set that I ended up enjoying it. Judging the individual books for exactly what they are, light series-style contemporary romances, they more than fulfill their purpose to entertain and to leave readers with the warm feeling given by a 'happily ever after '. Collectively, the set is even better than the sum of its parts. I certainly plan to check out other works by these authors.I definitely recommend this set to others. Those familiar with the authors will probably like it very much. For those unfamiliar with the authors, take a chance, especially if you like this genre. I am giving it five stars, not because every individual book met my definition of a five star book, but because as a set, it did measure up to five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JHK33F9EI35/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O3NFR2Q#wasThisHelpful","R3JHK33F9EI35","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Overall, I mostly enjoyed the series, so I had mixed feelings about my review of this final book. If I were reviewing the series in its entirety, I would probably average it out to a three star rating, but this conclusion to the series had some issues, as well as a fatal flaw.The virus plot point got strung out too long and it dragged down the pace, seemed to go nowhere fast, and became boring. I think that having it drawn out the way it was, with the males deteriorating to the point of death, was supposed to quicken the pace and add tension as the clock was ticking down. It didn't do that for me, and as I said, it actually created the opposite effect.In the beginning of the series, as the world and plot were being set up, there were a lot of battle and fight scenes. That was alright for the first book, but it continued through every book. By the time I read this volume, I was sick of all the space devoted to battles and fights. They became very boring and I wanted more substance, character development, and plot expansion.That leads me to my next issue. If these people weren't fighting or dealing with a virus, they were having sex. Frequent sex. Pages of sex. It seemed like every other chapter sex. Prepare for a mission, have sex, leave for mission, fight, return from mission, have sex, get bad news, have sex, plot out strategy, have sex, prepare for mission, have sex, rinse and repeat. Every bloody book. By the time I read this one, I had had it with all of the sex. I have no problem with sex scenes, but for heaven's sake, how about more plot and character development.The real deal breaker, though, was the abusiveness of the hero. This hero was wonderful throughout the series. Yes, he was alpha and a hardened warrior, but he was sweet, honourable, protective and loving towards the heroine. Then in this book, the author wrote him as way too Neanderthal and abusive. He was angry with the heroine for not obeying, spanked her hard as punishment for not obeying, made her sob for a long time while he held her and told her it was for her own good and that she needed a good cry to help with her emotions, and the idiot heroine agreed with him and thought he was wonderful. That did it. A great hero was turned into a macho, abusive jerk. In all of the books, the heroes were very alpha, sometimes almost stepping over a line. The heroines usually asserted themselves and the males were loving , but ultimately the males were too aggressive. This book just showed the aggressiveness carried to the extreme.The author can write well and this series had a lot of potential. I think that most readers liked it, and that I am in the minority. However, I thought books two and three improved upon book one, but each of the others became too repetitive.This series is good for readers who like a lot of sex scenes in their romances and who like ber alpha males. If a reader swoons when a hero goes all caveman, threatens to spank a heroine, does spank a heroine, and uses sex to show his power over the heroine, then this book is perfect. I'm not trying to be snarky, and I know that a lot of readers do like this book.  We all have different tastes and this book just hit the wrong spot for me.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQT0TU2MKVGUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KVN35R6#wasThisHelpful","RQT0TU2MKVGUI","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this book immediately after I read the first two. The second book was better than the first, and this one is slightly better than the second. So far I am really enjoying the series. Others have given a detailed synopsis of this book, so I am just going to give my opinion of it.For starters, it is well written. Writing mechanics are good and the world building and story line remain consistent with the earlier books. There are some typos, not enough to affect the reader's enjoyment, but I expected better from a traditionally published book.Characterization for both the protagonists and the antagonists is good. They are fleshed out, with enough back story, inner dialogue and dialogue to get a sense of who they are and what their motivations are. Because of the overarching storyline, the central and some supporting characters appear in every book. Each book has the emphasis on a different hero and heroine, however, and ones in this book are very likeable. Con, the hero, is alpha but less domineering with his mate than his brothers are with theirs. He was depicted as a man who loved his mate enough to sacrifice his own desires by releasing her to fulfill her potential and destiny. As well, he was depicted as a man who studied her craft, not only for his own political agenda, but to become an understanding and supportive part of her life. He was confident enough in himself that he took pride in his mates' abilities, even when she bested him. Moira, the heroine, was very young and inexperienced when mated and is conflicted as a result. She is very strong, confident and decisive when it comes to her craft and her duties as a witch. However, when it comes to personal relationships, especially with her mate, she is extremely insecure, indecisive and she constantly second-guesses herself. The author portrayed them perfectly for the situation in which she placed them, and it made for a strong and satisfying romantic component of the the book.The pace was fairly brisk and even. The author created enough suspense and tension, that the suspense component balanced the romance. The story line was strong and very engaging. I couldn't put the book down and stayed up until the wee hours to finish it.My only complaint is the amount of sex. I think this book had less of a ratio of sex to story than the others, but it was still too much for my tastes. The book was definitely not erotica and the sex scenes were well done. Most readers of paranormal romances would likely be very happy with this aspect of the book. My personal preference is for less sex and more story in my romance books. No matter how well written sex scenes are, I find that if there are too many or they are too long, they slow down the story and, frankly, they get boring fast.I recommend this book and the series. I've read the next two books since I finished this one, and the quality remains consistent and good. I've read several paranormal romance series, and well there are some I liked more than this one, it ranks highly on my scale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R270T0C2VDPR5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006YBRF3O#wasThisHelpful","R270T0C2VDPR5T","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This author was new to me and I just read the first book in this series yesterday. I enjoyed it, so I read this one today. Both books had good writing mechanics with only a few typos that did not detract from the stories. This book continued seamlessly from the first and was a bit better because the hero and heroine were more likeable than those in the first book.The world building was excellent and I can seem a pattern emerging in how the males in this world interact with their mates. Readers will probably either love it or hate it. Mates are part of a fated couple and both the heroes and heroines are unable to resist the sexual attraction and mating urge for any length of time. Even when the human heroines initially resist, the heroes refuse to let their mates walk away. I've noticed that some reviewers view the males negatively because of this, but I don't see them as macho jerks who won't take no for an answer. Neither part of a couple has a choice when they are a fated mate, and the males grow up knowing that, while the human females have no idea what is happening and they think they have a choice. Given the danger the fated females face from the evil villains, the heroes have no choice but to forego a lengthy courtship in order to protect the heroines. Since this conflict is an integral part of the author's world building, how readers respond to it will be a factor in whether or not they like the books.Some reviewers hated the way the heroes in both books used sex to manipulate or control their mates. Again, the strong sexual attraction between mates is a main component in the author's world. I did feel that the hero in the first book bordered on using emotional abuse, but he didn't actually cross my personal line. The hero in this book tried to give his mate more space and control, so I found him to be more likeable. A reader's personal response to this type of hero and plot device will likely influence whether or not he or she likes the book. I REALLY don't like my heroes to abuse and rape women in my romance books, and I did not feel these heroes crossed that line. At least one reviewer felt that the hero raped the heroine, so obviously this is an area that is very subjective. I felt that the heroine was always willing but didn't always want to feel such a strong sexual attraction that she couldn't resist.The only thing that I disliked about this book was that there was too much space devoted to sex for my tastes. The sex scenes were well written and they didn't overshadow the story. This was definitely not a thinly veiled erotica book pretending to be a paranormal romance. The amount of hot sex is probably about what most readers of paranormal romances want, so that is definitely a plus for those readers. I just skimmed over them and enjoyed the rest of the story.The story was very well written and engaging. The pace was fairly even and neither too slow nor too fast. Supporting characters were well fleshed out and likeable. The villains were suitably evil and cunning, but the mood was definitely not dark and gritty, like urban paranormal romances. These were simply very nice paranormal romantic suspense books that should have broad appeal.There is an overarching storyline to the series but the books are standalone with a firm conclusion; No cliffhangers here.So if you like your paranormal romances to have highly alpha males and a fair bit of hot sex, I recommend this book, and if the series continues like the first two books, I recommend the series. I'm looking forward to the next volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AQJISDO8OKMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CRY8NQ#wasThisHelpful","R3AQJISDO8OKMO","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't familiar with this author but the synopsis of this book sounded good, so I decided to try it. I bought the entire series on faith since the books were on sale at a good price, but this is the only one I've read thus far. I have mixed feelings about it and am rounding my three and a half rating up to a four.I loved the world building and it was easy to get totally immersed in it. The author did a fantastic job with the types of characters, their abilities, their limitations and the conflict between them. I was definitely engaged.Characterization was also a strong feature of the book. For the most part, the protagonists were very likeable, especially the little girl, Janie. However, there were some weaknesses that lowered my rating. I didn't have a problem with the instant overwhelming sexual attraction between the hero, Talen, and the heroine, Cara. It is common in paranormal romances and the author gave a good explanation for it, as part of the world building. Therefore, there was an acceptable reason why the heroine couldn't resist the hero. What did bother me was that the hero was borderline abusive. He was portrayed as a wonderful, loving, gentle male who had diplomatic skills as well as his abilities as a warrior. On some occasions, he didn't explain things to the heroine until after the fact. He ordered her about, but didn't sit down and discuss issues. Not very diplomatic.As well, Talen threatened Cara  with punishment a few times and I was afraid there was going to be a spanking scene. Spanking doesn't do it for me as part of a sex scene, but to each his or her own. However, used as punishment is a real deal breaker for me. The books would have been returned immediately. Talen's good characteristics balanced what I considered to be the bad, though, so I still liked the book.Cara annoyed me at times. Most of the time she was likeable, but in some circumstances she came across as a stubborn brat. Again, this wasn't enough to spoil the story, which was enjoyable, despite her less than perfect characterization.The author created good, believable villains. They were suitably evil and contributed to an exciting storyline.The storyline itself was great. The good versus evil conflict, the 'fated mates' romance, and the concept of children who were psychics and destined to save the world, made for a very enjoyable read.  It definitely engaged me and I read the book in one sitting.What I really hated about the book, besides the hero's emotional abusiveness, was the interminable sex scenes. This is very subjective and I know a lot of readers view numerous sex scenes as a plus; I don't. These sex scenes were well written but there were too many and they were too long. The book was definitely not a sex book with a thin plot, but I prefer a higher ratio of plot to sex scenes, than what the author wrote. In all honesty, I think the balance the author provided would be just right for a lot of paranormal romance readers, just not for me. I ended up skimming over those pages.In the final analysis, I did like the book very much. If I hadn't already purchased the rest, I would have done so after reading this one. The author wrote well and there were just a few typos, but the writing mechanics were good. One reviewer commented that some of the wording sounded like English used by a non-native speaker, but I didn't see that. However, I'm Canadian lol, and my speech patterns don't always match American ones.I recommend this book. The hero wasn't the most well written one I've seen, but he was acceptable and the story was strong enough to outweigh his flaws. Those who prefer less sex in their romances shouldn't have a problem skimming over the sex scenes, and again, the story mitigated any annoyance resulting from it. I think it is a fact of life that paranormal romances will be a bit heavy on the sex now, so as long as the reader has made peace with that, it is possible to still enjoy a well written one like this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131H5WTBI1VSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IWR36U#wasThisHelpful","R131H5WTBI1VSK","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book is highly detailed in many of the individual dogfights, tactics, during this roughly 24 hour period.  The events occurring to individual civilians on the ground as a result of falling bombs, pieces of aircraft, & airmen parachuting out of aircraft flesh out the overall strategies perfectly.  The prose is at a level that would be suitable from adolescents to the retired.  The book never falters nor bogs down due to too much detail or too much strategic discussion.  It is a great balance that kept me spellbound and entertained.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3704A0QZPWUEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WZDAG0E#wasThisHelpful","R3704A0QZPWUEM","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"******SPOILER ALERT ******'A Distant Echo' is another one of Ms. Hutchinson's enjoyable backlist books that is being released on Kindle. I have been waiting to replace my old paperback with the Kindle version, so I was happy to see it available.This is a well written time travel romance that has two romantic couples, although one couple features more prominently. I really liked this book, but in all honesty, it did have some flaws, which I will address first.One of the heroines, Zelda, was likeable but she verged on being a disagreeable character. The author wanted to show how she was ahead of her time regarding the rights of women, so she was written as a strong character. This translated into a person who was at times excessively stubborn. Her father worked ten hour shifts in a coal mine, but he had to take his turn with cooking and dishwashing. She refused to listen to what her brother wanted, and tried to force him into a career path that he didn't want. She had good intentions, but almost alienated him. In addition, she knew that her lover, Tom, wanted to return to the future, where he was wealthy. Living in the past, he was penniless and would have to labour at difficult jobs in order to make a living. Since her brother wanted to go to the future also, it would have been ideal. However, when her dying father refused to go, she refused to go and got angry when Tom said he was going, even without her, because he only had one chance to leave. She refused to see his point of view and wanted him to make all of the sacrifices. This part of the plot was a bit weak. Throughout the book, Zelda was shown to be able to manage her father and he listened to her. It was apparent that he only had weeks to live and given Zelda's forceful personality, she could easily have pressured her father into going, but she didn't even try. It was as if she was using her father's refusal as an excuse to stay in the past. These were the issues that made the book less than perfect.Now for the positives. Almost every character was likeable, even Zelda, despite her flaws. The supporting characters were fleshed out and memorable. There were some poignant scenes, one in particular that touched on the terrible price coal miners pay in both health and safety. Despite this, the story was not depressing; it just made one pause and think for a moment.The plot with two friends, Tom and Jackson, traveling back in time together and having to adapt, held my interest. The story was evenly paced and engaging. It was nice to see Canada used as a setting, and our Royal Canadian Mounted Police being featured, even if they were portrayed as doofuses.There were some fairly mild sex scenes and a small amount of profanity that fit with the circumstances in which it was used. However, the 'F' bomb, which seems to freak out some people, was used once. Considering that that word is as ubiquitous today as McDonalds, I would think it had lost its shock value, but apparently not. In all other respects, this was a very traditional romance book, not hot, not fast paced and not full of graphic violence, just a nice, pleasant story. This is one I wouldn't hesitate to let my granddaughter read.I do recommend it to readers who like this genre. It is an enjoyable read and perfect for curling up on the sofa to relax.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OGYIY3KM2OPD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00USSD0VU#wasThisHelpful","R2OGYIY3KM2OPD","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was glad to see this book released on Kindle because I loved the story and wanted to replace my paperback. This edition had some minor changes, such as updating the year the story began, but it is basically the same as the original.This was a well written time travel romance, with likeable protagonists. The author described the 1865 setting very well, with some realism regarding outhouses, wood stoves, the dust, dirt, lack of air conditioning, law and order, medical care, mortality rates and women's rights.The author took time to show how the heroine, her mother and her mother's friend adjusted to going back in time. This was unusual as most time travel romances I've read focused on one character doing the time travel. It was interesting to see how this closely connected trio integrated into their new society. As well, it was nice to see how the women grew and how their attitudes changed. Daisy gained self-confidence, began to take an interest in life, and blossomed. Elvira realized she did love her husband, that she hadn't shown him love, that she had been too critical of him, and she missed him. In addition, Hannah came to know her mother better and to realize that love was based on more than economic security. As well, Hannah herself had an impact on the hero, Logan, and he came to realize love was more important than revenge.This book was evenly paced, taking a leisurely path to the conclusion. The author took the time to let the women adjust and to let the hero and heroine court and fall in love, but the pace was not too slow. The romance itself and the sex scenes were low key and not explicit. I view this as a romance in the traditional mode. This was not a hot, fast paced romance, but it was a very good read for anyone wanting a more traditional romance book. ****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ******I think some reviewers misunderstood the ending of the story. Readers were not left hanging. The hero found his way to the future and to the heroine. She offered to go back to the past with him but he chose to stay in the future with her. This was a very brief scene and it did seem abrupt. An epilogue would have been perfect, but even without one, the story did conclude with a clear 'happily ever after'.I definitely recommend this book to readers who like time travel romances and traditional romances. This was a very nice story, and I would have no hesitation in letting my teenaged granddaughter read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7CRREB4NMGD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPZ3NX6#wasThisHelpful","R3T7CRREB4NMGD","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brilliantly written story describing the day by day actions of the American's drive to move through the almost impenetrable  Huertgen forest in the drive to the Rohr.  I enjoyed the author's style, his ""just right"" amount of detail, and the flow of the narrative.  The tragic events caused at times by over optimism, or excess caution, or unwillingness send higher authorities the grim truth of casualties, and the piecemeal replacement of one division after another into the forest against a well entrenched German force led to a war of attrition causing tens of thousands of needless casualties.  This long battle has been mentioned - but in a passing way, in many books I have read about the Battle of the Bulge, war in Europe et al, but this book puts this drawn out fight on center stage where it belongs!  I recommend it highly to anyone interested in the WW II battles as the American Armies were crossing the border into Germany at Aachen and southwards.  It is a military history more at the unit & higher levels, describing the decisions made, and also contains enough of the infantryman's feelings to make it a living book.  If you put it down - good luck, for it is a book that takes you into the action played out in a dark, cold & rainy hell that never seemed to end for those who were there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MKPSC0GQNERK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LUYVQQ2#wasThisHelpful","R2MKPSC0GQNERK","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not enjoy this book. I could not connect with the characters and I did not find them to be likeable. Between the characters and the odd plot, it almost felt as if the author had channeled Kafka into a suspense book. The sex scenes felt cold and clinical, not at all sensuous. There were a number of typos, but not enough to be distracting. Overall, the writing mechanics were good. Although I finished the book, it did not engage me.I think the author's intent was to have unsympathetic protagonists and the plot reflected that. It was almost like a black comedy. In that sense, the author did succeed, it is just that I don't like that genre. Readers who like this type of book will likely find it to be well written. I may be in the minority, but I really disliked it, well written or not.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C9T2UHLO5WIE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHFQZ28#wasThisHelpful","R2C9T2UHLO5WIE","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Butterfly' is another of Sala's well written romantic suspense books. It is a light, entertaining book, perfect as a rainy day read. I thoroughly enjoyed it but I can understand why some readers did not.The hero and heroine, Ben and China, are very likeable characters, and I was easily able to suspend disbelief for Ben's ' love at first sight' reaction to China. This is a plot device that readers either like or hate; while I do like it, I know that many readers are put off by it. So one's reaction to this book will depend very much upon whether or not one can accept a 'love at first sight' plot.Sala's casting of the villain was well done and kept me guessing. There was suspense, but not a lot of tension or graphic violence, which is why I view the book as a light, pleasant read. Some reviewers felt the book leaned more toward romance than suspense, and I agree. This was not a negative for me, however, and I liked the emphasis on the character development of China, as she transformed from an insecure victim to a woman secure in the love of Ben. This was not a fast paced book but neither was it slow and boring. Anyone happy with a leisurely paced book should enjoy how the story unfolds.There were a few mild, non-graphic sex scenes and I view this book as a clean read, although purists will probably disagree.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fairly clean romance that has some suspense, but is focused more on the romance and character development.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AGL17M364K5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAVQ1LU#wasThisHelpful","R3AGL17M364K5P","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book didn't have quite the same depth as some of Ms. Sala's books, but it was still an excellent read. It was very well written, which is pretty much a given with any of her books. It engaged me and kept me figuratively turning pages on my Kindle app. I've read this book at least twice in paperback, so the story definitely held its appeal.The heroine and hero are very likeable, as is the hero's brother. The kindness and loving relationships shown by them gave the story a feeling of warmth. Characterization for the secondary characters was well done and brought them to life. The villain's characterization was very good, as he was shown slowly descending into madness. It was easy to visualize his struggle to function and to hold on to his sanity well enough to hide his condition from others.The book was suspenseful and the mystery about the stalker's identity kept the reader guessing. The plot moved along at an even pace and never dragged. The scenes often alternated between the protagonists and the villain, which worked to increase tension.The romance was the area that I felt did not have enough depth. The hero and heroine were great characters and there were emotional moments and lots of warmth in the story, but for some reason I didn't feel the same emotional response or sense of connection that I get with most of Ms. Sala's characters. I felt that perhaps more attention was given to the angst of the hero and heroine and not enough to the actual romance. Don't get me wrong, it was still a nice romance, but not the best Ms. Sala has written.There were some very mild sex scenes, enough to upset readers who want a perfectly clean romance and not enough to please those who want a really hot romance. I feel sorry for the poor authors who have to navigate those waters.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a pleasant, well written romantic suspense story, with likeable characters, mild violence and mild sex scenes. It is a good beach read and a good book with which to pass the time on a lazy, rainy day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD8R034FPZ4EK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAKIKR4#wasThisHelpful","RD8R034FPZ4EK","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have almost every paperback book by Sala/McCall and I have replaced almost fifty in Kindle, thus far, so I am obviously a fan of her writing. Being a fan does not mean I can't be objective, however; I have no hesitation in giving a favourite writer a bad review if I hate one of his or her books. I read 'Legend' when it first came out and loved it, so I wondered if it would stand the test of time. To me, it does.The hero and heroine are extremely likeable. Joseph is pretty much a perfect human being. He made mistakes when he was younger but has matured into a sensitive, selfless, loving person. Raine seems a bit more flawed because she isn't entirely honest with Joseph, at first, but she has had a difficult life and is coping the best way that she can. Raine's depiction is realistic because she has the same immediate reactions to her situation as most of Sala's readers would. She is angry, at times bitter, she rails against the burdens God has given her, she feels abandoned and unloved, and she has lost hope. Then she rises above those feelings and determines to live the rest of her life with acceptance, love, peace and joy.  Sala has written her hero and heroine as ordinary people who face the problems they have been given and become better people for it. Although there is a supernatural element that is part of Joseph's heritage, it is just another facet of his humanity and decency; he is a good, grounded person, with or without that element in the story.Sala's depiction of Joseph's brother, Benny, is another one of her superb characterizations. Just as the reader starts to hate Benny, he shows a decent streak. This happens more than once, and the reader sees the struggle Benny has in trying to overcome his weaknesses, and they are weaknesses. Benny isn't evil, he knows when he is wrong, he vacillates between doing the right thing and becoming the person he wants to be, or taking the easy way out for material gain. He wants respect but is still learning that it has nothing to do with how much he has, but how he acts and lives his life. Sala does a brilliant job of garnering sympathy for Benny, while still revealing his many character flaws.On the other hand, Sala's characterization of the villain demonstrates the evil inherent in those whom wealth and power have corrupted. We can't pity this villain because he has no morals, has no boundaries, thinks he is entitled to whatever he wants and is so selfish, that nothing and no one matters except his own desires. It isn't that he is evil because he has wealth and power, but that they have corrupted him.Some of Sala's books are pure escapist romantic suspense, while others, like this one, have a deeper message. There are moments when this book has tearjerker scenes, such as the burial of Raine's and Joseph's baby, but the overall theme is one of hope, love and redemption. Sala manages to depict the reality of life, such as death, grief and loneliness, but she offers hope and optimism at the same time; her characters always have their 'happily ever after', despite what they may have gone through.This is not a clean read. I wouldn't hesitate to let my granddaughter read it, but those offended by language and sex scenes won't be happy with it. It isn't a particularly hot read, either, so those readers who only want a lot of very hot sex scenes would be disappointed. I think the story has universal appeal but it isn't for everyone. I definitely recommended it, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UCF15B8NMBEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PDZG4M#wasThisHelpful","R3UCF15B8NMBEH","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise sounded great, but the story did not engage me. The protagonists were likeable enough, but they seemed very immature for their ages. I found it difficult to believe that these were young adults on the verge of starting their own families; they seemed more like high school teenagers. For example, early in the book, four of the protagonists went to the pickup for beers and to drive around, which seemed irresponsible. As well, the giggling and over-the-top dialogue seemed more suitable to teenagers, and I could not relate to the characters. That surprised me because I do read young adult fantasy and science fiction with young protagonists, and have no problems relating to the characters.Another serious problem for me was the lack of resolution. The story concluded with two heros and two heroines entertaining into relationships but with no idea where they would go from there. They just hooked up but they live in different states, so what happens? We aren't given any insight into the resolution. I hate cliffhangers, and calling a book part one of a series does not mean the author gets a free pass on providing an ending.I found the different points of view and flashbacks distracting. Some readers like them, but I didn't like the switching back and forth.On the plus side, the writing mechanics were good with only a few minor typos.This book might appeal to a younger audience, but I don't believe it is one with universal appeal. It is not one I would recommend, but I can see that others would like it. Thus far, mine is the only negative review, so I am obviously in the minority on this one. My opinion is just that, my personal opinion about the book. I deleted it, which normally would be a one star book, but I raised it to a two because of the writing mechanics.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJHJ2GCF7WNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SK2AQWW#wasThisHelpful","R1OJHJ2GCF7WNF","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to love books by Heather Graham, but the last several Krewe books felt as if they were the same boring book with some new characters added. For example, this book had way, way, way, way too much repetition and it acted as just so much filler. The filler-like repetition seems to have become the norm in Ms. Graham's more recent offerings. It slows the action down to a moribund level and kills the storyline.Part of the repetition is simply repeating the same information about characters and plot points several times. I guess it could be called standard repetition. Then there is the dreaded LECTURE repetition, which is even worse. Good authors can incorporate factual information without seeming to digress into lecture mode; unfortunately, in her last several books, including this one, the author seems to be quoting from the most deadly dull tourist brochure imaginable. This hectoring, lecturing digression gets repeated in various ways. If it didn't put you to sleep the first time, keep trying until it works!The LECTURE repetition has a variation called the DEFENSIVE LECTURE. Let's see how many ways we can defend Wicca, how many ways we can say we are all-inclusive when it comes to religion, why our friends could not be the murderer, and so on, which brings up the next point.  ******SPOILER ALERT******Could we please, for once, have the murderer be a stranger? What's wrong with a plain old garden variety serial killer? Why must it always be part of the heroine's and hero's clique? What are the odds of that happening? The first few times it might be fresh, but it gets old, fast.Ms. Graham can and has written excellent five star books. The Krewe series presents a rich field for new and exciting books. Unfortunately, it seems as if the author has developed a template, to which she adheres religiously. This book was slow, slower, slowest, monotonous and boring. Likeable characters alone will not save a book like this one.If I am overly harsh, it is because Ms. Graham is an experienced author with a traditional publishing house supporting her. There is no excuse for this kind of laziness or sloppiness. Where were the editors? This book was an insult to loyal readers.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RMNA9RJ2D33/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWU47YK#wasThisHelpful","R16RMNA9RJ2D33","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read some of the reviews that stated this was not a set and that one part ended on a cliffhanger with no continuation. My set was an actual set and the cliffhanger was immediately followed by the next volume. If there had been a problem, it seems to have been resolved. I wanted to try a new author and the synopsis of this set attracted me. I read all eight books and they were not at all to my taste. They were well written with a few typos but the writing mechanics were good. They were written in the first person with the main protagonist narrating his story. The tone was conversational and the narrator came across as a very likeable young man. The overarching plot was a classic good versus evil scenario and most of the protagonists were likeable.The reason I didn't care for the books is because the books were all wrong for me. I am a mid-sixties female and most of the protagonists were early twenty-somethings, or else older vampires who had been turned at young ages. Add in the mixed martial arts and the young male perspective, and it's a recipe for a disastrous matching of demographics and genres.The books were good for the right audience. I think they would appeal to both genders, from early teens and up to thirty-somethings, although I think they would appeal more to males than females. I could be wrong, but that is what I thought as I was reading them. The books are light reading and there is very little graphic gore. These are not dark, heavy vampire and werewolf stories. There is some romance, some young adult soul-searching and angst, and some young male coming of age, bonding, teasing and trash-talking. I think they would definitely appeal to my teenaged and twenty-something grandsons. If I were a lot younger, I would have liked the books.I do recommend these books to the right audience. I tried to judge them for what they were and did not measure them against what genres interest me. It would be unfair to the author to penalize him because I was hoping for hot paranormal romances. ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QLYYL8PFSXDK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6KCFU2#wasThisHelpful","R2QLYYL8PFSXDK","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"******SPOILER ALERT******I love some of Stephanie Bond's books, but this is not one of them. I almost gave this book two stars because the writing mechanics were excellent. However, I really did hate this book, which is why I gave it one star.This book is labelled as a humorous romantic mystery book, but I found nothing humorous in it. I know that many other reviewers found it to be very humorous, but I didn't. I think the nasty arguing and fist fighting the sisters engaged in were supposed to be funny, but I thought it was appalling. Grown women fighting and rolling around in their driveway did not amuse me. As for the bedroom fight scene with two of the sisters and the boyfriend/fianc, it was simply sad that women would demean themselves like they did, and I did not see any humour in it.I disliked the boyfriend/fianc, because he was a sleaze. That was good, because readers were supposed to dislike him. He was one of the villains, after all. The problem was that I detested two of the sisters and disliked the third, but I was supposed to like them; they were the heroines. Unfortunately, they did not act like heroines. Two of them were selfish, self-centred, bitter, vindictive, amoral and thoroughly unlikeable. Sleeping with one's sister's fianc for over three years and then running off with him the morning of the wedding does not endear a character to me. Nor does having revenge sex with various married men over a twelve year period. Yes, they made up at the end and reformed, but by then it didn't matter to me. Admittedly, the third sister seemed angelic in comparison with the other two, but she came across as weak. She was the one with the conscience, but she gave in to her selfish sisters' arguments and withheld information about a murder all three witnessed. It could be argued that she was only fourteen at the time, but as she grew older, she was supposedly bothered about not coming forward, but she had 'promised' her sisters that she wouldn't tell. A man was sentenced to prison for life, twenty years later he was still proclaiming his innocence, but hey, a promise is a promise. So what if a potentially innocent man stays in prison when your evidence might help him. I felt like slapping some sense into her.There were three very likeable, possible heroes/new love interests for the sisters, but two of them got almost no page time and the third got very little. It seemed as if the narration/inner musings by the sisters, just droned on and on about themselves, the fianc issue, the vengeful wife issue, the parent's marital and financial issues and the missing father issue. A lot of the action was the interaction between the sisters as they argued, fought, pouted, had temper tantrums and proved just how dysfunctional they were. The romances were hinted at but were never really developed.I forced myself to finish this book, but neither the characters nor the story engaged me. I don't recommend this book to anyone who expects a humorous romance. If readers are interested in a chick-lit style novel about a dysfunctional family, they might like it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ER5673TGB3LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060ET31M#wasThisHelpful","R2ER5673TGB3LA","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As other reviewers have noted, this book consists of four short story/novella length reissues from older anthologies. I am a bit puzzled about the complaints regarding that, because I am pleased to see older works available for Kindle. I am also happy to have the stories available in one place, rather than having to buy four separate anthologies with works of uneven quality, simply to get the stories by Hannah Howell. The original anthologies may have had themes, but I find that these stories stand alone and work very well in a dedicated Hannah Howell edition. It is a matter of personal taste, and critics are entitled to their opinions, but I am very happy that these stories have been reprinted in a single volume.As for the stories themselves, they are very well written vintage Hannah Howell works. Given the constraints of the short format, the author has written engaging stories with likeable protagonists and believable antagonists.Are these stories as well developed as the author's longer works? No, but I have found that shorter stories never are. I usually prefer novel length works for the added depth, but there are times when I just want a short read. However, I still want my shorter reads to be well written and engaging, with good characterization and entertaining dialogue and plots. These stories meet those expectations and are perfect for those times when one wants something short to read.The stories have mild but graphic sex scenes, so they won't appeal to those who want a perfectly clean read. For everyone else, the stories have broad appeal and are suitable for late teens up to seniors. I recommend this book to those who like short stories and who want to acquire Ms. Howell's older works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HWF9FJSUSEO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L82WOY#wasThisHelpful","R1HWF9FJSUSEO7","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have almost every one of Hannah Howell's books in paper and in Kindle, so I obviously love her writing. However, this book was not one of her better ones.As usual, in Ms. Howell's books, the writing mechanics in this one were very good. The beginning of this book was extremely well written and engaging, with very likeable characters. I was certain that I would love the rest of the book and was eager to delve into it. Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.As others have noted, the hero was an ass. The book was written quite a while ago and some of his behaviours were popular with readers, so I don't fault him for some of his actions, such as the 'forced seduction'. I remember that I used to find it romantic, so he doesn't lose points for that. His overall treatment of the heroine is deplorable, however, especially regarding his former mistress.Some of the scenes, such as the hero's brother trying to seduce the heroine, were a little too graphic for comfort. I'm fine with graphic sex scenes and I'm fine with a nasty villain attempting to ravish a heroine; I'm not fine with a heroine getting turned on when a man other than the hero is fondling her and she admits he could make her enjoy it. Ugh! That is not why I read romance books.This book had so much potential and I could easily have loved it. Some of the characters were incredibly well written and engaging. Some of the dialogue was outstanding and the witty repartee was very amusing. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue was simply embarrassing. I really wish the author would do a rewrite on this book, as some romance authors have done with their books that didn't withstand the test of time. It certainly wouldn't take much to turn it into a five star book, and this is a book that is begging for a chance to shine.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYK2QQ9NK86S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006YBREUS#wasThisHelpful","RHYK2QQ9NK86S","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I freely admit to being a philistine; this journal would appeal to my fine arts friends but I pretty much hated it. I loved the stories by Vincent Zandri and Robert Mayette, but nothing else appealed to me. I prefer prose to poetry, but love the maligned WWI poetry, so needless to say, the poetry included here did nothing for me. The illustrations are well done, but too avante-gard for my tastes.Although the journal is well written and illustrated, I think it will only appeal to a specialized audience. I'm giving it 4 stars, even though I hated most of it, because it is not the authors' and artists' fault that I have plebeian tastes. Readers who like this genre will likely love it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUZF2KVOD5HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003N7OUMQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUZF2KVOD5HD","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very professional magazine, with well written and edited stories and articles. Although the stories proved to be outside my area of interest, I did enjoy the earlier stories and they held my interest. Given the limitations of the short format, the authors were still able to imbue their works with elements that brought the characters, settings, dialogue and narration to life. These stories would be excellent for when one wants a quick but professionally written read.The last few stories were as well written as the earlier ones, but the content was not my cup of tea. There was nothing objectionable about them; they just didn't hold my interest.I got this magazine when it was free and the only reason I would not pay for it is because the stories were not in my areas of interest, even though they were good. For anyone who likes this genre, it is probably worth the $0.99 price. I do highly recommend giving this magazine a chance.

"The quality was consistent in each of the stories in this anthology and the stories were well matched. Writing mechanics were very good and the stories were well written. I enjoyed the Australian idioms and the flavour they gave to some of the stories. However, the book did not appeal to me or capture my interest.I'm not sure why the stories did not work for me. I think it was partly because they were technically excellent, but did not have enough soul for my reading tastes. The stories were certainly well developed, given the restrictions of the short story format. Various emotions were conveyed well, and the reader could easily see what the characters were feeling. Descriptions brought the settings, characters and actions to life. Still, the stories failed to grab me.Although this book did not work for me, I gave it a higher rating based on the technical quality of the work. These stories could definitely work for the right audience. There was some very mild sex in a couple of the stories, but I would still rate the book as suitable for young adults and older. The book is currently free, so it is well worth trying. Not everyone has the same tastes, so there are readers out there who will probably love it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TP3NJD02P3MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVA0LG2#wasThisHelpful","R1TP3NJD02P3MH","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story is as well written as the first two books.  The likeable characters and the interactions & dialog are further developed, and have realistic spontaneity.  There is a perfect balance of action, dialog, introspection & humor and the plot continues without a hitch.

"I had mixed feelings about this book. I wanted to like it, but there were problems that prevented that.Several people mentioned the editing problems, and there were a lot of them. Spell Check might have been the problem for the frequent use of wrong words. When I see feint instead of faint, heel for heal, and starred for stared, as well as many other examples, my first thought is Spell Check.  There were other editorial issues such as the mix up with the type of cars and clothes, which made the book feel like a first draft. This was not a major issue for me, but it does indicate that the author needs some good beta readers, because the editorial problems will be a killer for many readers.My main problem with the book was that it seemed flat. It was a good story and it almost succeeded in being a great story, but it missed the mark. Part of the problem was the characters.The heroine had potential, as she was fairly likeable, but she veered close to being 'too stupid to live' a couple of times. To the author's credit, she avoided this pitfall, but it was too close and made the character seem weak, rather than noble and vulnerable, which I think was the objective. As well, the heroine's character seemed slightly subdued or flat, even when expressing emotion. For example, she accepted werewolves and her own change too easily and she seemed blas about many things that happened. It felt as if she was on Valium sometimes.The characterization for the hero and his brothers, the villain Enrique, and the minor supporting characters was well done and they were fleshed out and consistent. However, the villain Luc, was problematic. The author tried to show that he had redeeming qualities, but the way in which he lost his temper and tried to exercise total control over the heroine demonstrated his vicious qualities. I could see what the author was aiming for, but it didn't quite work as written.The narrative was another area that bothered me. It also felt a bit dull in places and slowed down the story. For example, I really liked the links to the park sites, but I thought there was too much information about the parks in the narrative, which slowed the main story. I believe that the author did not plagiarize this information, but it was unnecessary in furthering the plot. As well, I didn't enjoy all of the details about the coyotes and the plight of those crossing the border with their 'help'. I'm all in favour of authors incorporating educational information into a book, but in this case, there was too much space given to it and it slowed the story and was depressing, which is not the best emotion to evoke in a romance.Overall, the book was well written and the author has good writing mechanics, despite the Spell Check fiasco. As the book is written, I think many readers would like it and would view it as worth four or five stars. I hate to be harsh, but I think it would benefit by a rewrite with better editing and some minor tweaks to bring some vibrancy to the story. I realize the author is an established writer and I am not, but I am a voracious reader. This book is close to what I look for in a paranormal romance, but it doesn't quite make it.For those who care, there are a couple of mild sex scenes, so those who want a perfectly clean romance or a super hot one would likely be unhappy with this book.Despite my criticisms, I recommend this book to those who enjoy a traditional style series-type paranormal romance book. It reminded me of some of my 'Silhouette' or 'Harlequin' paranormal or suspense romances., which I quite enjoy when I am in the mood for a light, entertaining read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQCB7WN345Q1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D67DWCW#wasThisHelpful","R2MQCB7WN345Q1","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liked the flow of the writing, the smooth development of characters, the well balanced plot, and the very skilful writing.  The first few chapters mostly featuring the heroine were a bit of a stumble out of the chocks, with me thinking ""she's too dumb to live,"" at times, but her character develops into a more well rounded person after that.  I honestly believe the author is a writer who will hold you enthralled, with just the right amount of humor fitting in seamlessly. Any reader from teen to retired (me) should find this book very entertaining.  The end is well done, hinting at the next books in the series, but can stand alone. i.e. - no cliff hanger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO88EM1BAVX56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0036FTF4S#wasThisHelpful","RO88EM1BAVX56","A3E5Z87YBD11NE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E5Z87YBD11NE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The players:Quinlin Westin. Coltons sister.  College student and girl who is tired of falling for the bad boy and having her heart broken.Hawkin Play. Lead singer of Bent. Bad boy rock star and a guy with a heart that survived all the damage.A choice made based on a promise, land Hawkin on a college campus playing rock star turned professor when the TA with a back bone catches his eye.  Quinlin might get a little weak in the knees when she stands too close, but she sure isnt going to let him know just how much hes getting to her.  Ready to keep her distance, Hawkins plays on her attraction and wears her down.  Wanting one thing from her but getting so much more than he bargained for.  After all, a man like Hawkin does not do love, he cant.  But damn if this little spitfire isnt making him chase when he normally would be running. Kristy is back with the sixth book in the Driven series, and yes ladies  Colton does make an appearance  all alpha, overbearing brother  and all.  So let me just say what I loved about this book.  The feels.  The way some just snuck up on you.  Sure there are so many parts of this story were emotions were high and the story really had the ability to crack your resolve, but then there were these little sneaky moments.  The ones I love the most, because they come out of nowhere and they hit you head on.  There is no preparing for them, you just have to let them happen.  Oh, and boy did they happen.  Hawkin won my heart and it broke for him.  Over and over again.  He was this perfect mix of bad boy and broken.  The real tragic kind.  The kind that make you want to buy all the glue in the world so you can put them back together again.But lets not forget our Quinlin.  She might end up being the strongest heroine that Kristy has written to date (although Rylee grew some strength as the Driven trilogy progressed, she was not this sturdy at the start).  I loved that although she was sure that giving into Hawkin had nothing but bad idea written all over it, she still wasnt ready to live with the regrets of saying no.Much like the books prior in this series, the twists took me by surprise.  This could have been just simple romance, it was all there  but nope.  Kristy turned it up a notch and delivered so much more with her story than just two people falling in love.  The characters and their backgrounds offered enough for this to be a solid story on its own  but the story that Kristy gave us took this to the next level.I was a little worried after reading Hads book if Im being honest.  I was worried that the voice of this author would always be shadowed by Coltons story.  That worry is gone.  I think with Sweet Ache, she really came into her own and although this is still part of the Driven Series, it really stands on its own and in a way was able to combine all of the feels that she delivered with the three books for Colton and Rylee into one story for these two, and without making it seemed rushed.  I cant wait for the next release!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R254KPHCO10QR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQS4HHY#wasThisHelpful","R254KPHCO10QR4","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elizabeth didnt always want to be a trophy wife, but a hard lesson was learned as a child and finding a man that could provide her with money became far more important than finding one that could provide her with love.Married to Senator Cal Fitzgerald, rising Presidential hopeful should sound like a dream, but it quickly becomes a living nightmare.  Enter Alex Matthews.  Ex-Military. Sex on Legs. Hired Security. And her live in babysitter.Sparks fly as the stranger gets through her walls and sees the woman living behind the shell of the woman she shows the world.  But leaving her husband is not an option, not when he holds all the cards.This was a suspenseful romantic read that was okay  not great  but not bad either.  The one thing that really bothered me the most was the mix up of the use of the term Congressman while dealing with a Senator.  An easy slip, but something that definitely should have been caught along the writing/editing/early reading process.  I am not a stickler for grammar s***, but slips like this typically catch my attention and is a bit of pet peeve... so I sucked it up and pushed forward, wanting to know just how this twisted tangle was going to end.I was a bit surprised by the ending and the plot twist, so very well done on that front.  I had some thoughts as to where this was going and although I was close, I was far enough off that it still gave me a bit of a jolt of surprise when I hit the ending.This was my first read by this author and I can say the ending sure left me wanting to know exactly what was going to happen next.  And although I did not love this story, I did enjoy it.  Mixing in politics into romance is a hard sale for most.

"Im going to go in to detail with this, since I DNFd at 26% but I do want to explain what it was that held me back. The story itself felt a tad choppy and although I was still getting through it, what did it in was word choice.UmbilicusWe have Lake Freeman, ex-military, now private security who doesnt necessarily act on the right side of the law, especially since he is the kidnapper/hero of this story. So when he sees her and reflects on her body... I need his words. I need the characters voice to match the character. Now, I am guessing even if you havent heard the word used, you can figure it out. It is a bellybutton or navel... That is what caused me to stop. I really could have chugged along even if the story hadnt kept me glued to the pages, I really liked the theme of this and this particular genre is a favorite; but I was not able to gain any connection to who the characters were because although they behaved one way and were described another... they didnt stay constant.It might be overly picky  and maybe I should have pressed forward, but this was the second time when Lake used a term that just did not fit who he had been built as.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MBIP3LFPNJ8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1FYWVW#wasThisHelpful","R2MBIP3LFPNJ8P","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the emotional conclusion of the His Series, Finding Me brings this story full circle. Weve watched Ace and Max fall in love and fall apart. We saw the events as they played out through both sets of eyes and as the reader, we were absolutely gutted right alongside these two.Ace ran. Escaped. Her whole world was destroyed with one phone call. Now on the East Coast, Ace is finally trying to get a grip a girl named Harper. But returning home for her sisters wedding is going to place her right back in the middle of all her fears.When I picked up Becoming His in February of this year, I had no idea that I was about to discover a gripping romance that was going to take such a hold on my heart. I fell in love with all of the characters, but my heart was stolen by Max. A slightly damaged man who had found the love that he had been searching for in the arms of Ace. Their relationship was a joy to watch unfold and was heartbreaking to watch fall apart.I went into Finding Me with hope. I knew that Ace had to find some way of reconciling her past and that Max had to find some way to forgive her for running. But I had not expected the level of angst that had me in knots throughout this entire read.There was not a single moment where I could predict where this story was going. I loved it (although I may have screamed out some choice words at certain times). This story held my attention, it filled in all the pieces I needed to accept Max and Aces actions and it ultimately made me love the series so much more than I thought possible.Mariah Dietz is a superb writer  she gave her characters depth, she created an entire fictional world where they existed. This wasnt a story or series of two main characters, this was a story that every character had a major part. You got to know them, they aided in driving the story forward and although the first book was a little overwhelming with getting to know all the Bosse girls, I walk away feeling like I have a handful of new friends. This series was her debut, but there was nothing green about the way she molded her words or told her story.This book was a fantastic conclusion to this series and will go down as one of my favorite romance series of the year. If you have not yet read this series, you need to do that (right now!)  it will not disappoint. Bravo Mariah on another successful release and I cant wait to see what you have in store for us next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2RSO66LGATK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YLXRWCQ#wasThisHelpful","R3P2RSO66LGATK","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With one quick hit of the post button, the drama ensues as these two face off in a battle of wills that ends up in the most unlikely of places... the bedroom.What I enjoyed about BB was the humor and bits of sarcasm that we were treated two as these two battled it out, but coupled with an actual story line that gave both characters some emotional depth as the story progressed.  I had read books from Andrea before, but this was my first initiation into Evas writing.... I have to say that it wont be my last.Tossed in with the humor and intriguing coupling of the writer/reviewer was the sexy times these two shared.  I am still fairly new to the M/M genre of romance although I have a few titles under my belt, it is a genre that I do find myself overly picky when it comes to one-clicking a book.  But these two deliver the heat perfectly!  I loved seeing two very alpha men struggle to stay on top but be oh-so-willing to bottom when it came time.Now, I know this story has more than its share of publicity and quite a few readers that were content with blacklisting Black Balled without further thought.  And yeah I can see that there can be some lines of comparison drawn, but in reality even if the suspicions had any truth behind them... I say put on your big girl undies and suck it up.I feel my own little rant going on...I read a lot.  I read books I love and I read books that I dont love.  That is just how it shakes out.  A great book loved by most can easily be a book disliked by some.  I dont expect my reaction to any book to be the same as anyone elses.  However, I do try to take some care in my reactions to a book that I dont enjoy.  That is my personal choice.  I may not succeed in lessening a blow with a low rating when it comes to an author reading said review  but the intent is always to explain why I did not like something  not to drag the author through the mud.  Now, imagine you are dating a comedian and you screw with them, guess what is going to happen.  Youre going to become the punchline of their joke on stage, your actions are going to give them material... I see reviewers who behave badly in the same light.  Does this make a writer a bully?  No, as much as the comedian is not a bully by using their own personal experiences to draw from.  So heres the deal.  You want to write your honest reactions to a book  go for it. But heck, expect some blow back and when it happens take it like a champ.As a reader who stumbles upon nasty reviews from time to time I can tell you that for the most part they prompt me to do one thing.  Typically that is to buy the book.  Honestly sometimes that purchase is just because the reviewer was just so mean that I felt like I needed to lend silent support for an author who may not be great at what they love  but did in fact have the balls to hit publish.  So that in itself deserves some praise.  So Ill sum this up by just saying  dislike a book all you want.  Dislike it for your own reasons, not for the reasons of someone else.  But also recognize the difference between someone reviewing a book and giving feedback as to what worked and what didnt work vs someone trashing another person.  I get that authors need to stew silently when it comes to seeing bad reviews, thick skin is a must but there is also a time and place when it is perfectly okay for someone to stand up for themselves.  As a reader, Ive gotten messages on both five star and single star reviews and I have to say that no matter the rating, the approaching author did so with class and ultimately making me want to continue to consider their books.  Its a hard fact to admit, but the customer is not always right, sometimes the customer is just a jackhole.  And although policy may dictate that the customer should never be told they are a jackhole, but sometimes it just feels darn good to say it out loud.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VWF2AZXY99WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URTZLZI#wasThisHelpful","R3VWF2AZXY99WM","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Random & Rare is the second book in the Lock & Key series that focuses not only on the love story of Grace and Dig but then splits into a part two that draws her new love story with Miller into the picture.Who wants to read a story about a dead guy?  Well this reader certainly did.  There was no doubt that the story of Grace & Dig caught my attention in Lock & Key.  Although Dig was gone, I felt so drawn to their love story that I wanted to know more of how it all started and sadly, how it ended.But this wasnt just a story about Graces first love.  Cat Porter ties in Graces past with her present all while delivering a chance a future.  I loved this about this story.  My only fault that I really found was that the first part of this story where we are given Dig and Graces story felt a bit choppy.  We jumped quite a bit scene from scene and I completely understand that this was needed  there was still a story that had to be told so the pages could not be filled with a fluid love story, but I just wanted more of them together and sort of expected the story to begin with the little girl that asks a biker to help her sister and end with a broken woman who lost everything in one moment.But getting a chance to get back to Miller and Grace filled that gap for me.  I had an idea that somehow things would play out exactly as they had, although I wasnt sure how wed get there  I just knew that it would happen.  I have to say, that was one of the most touching moments for me.  It was giving me a taste of Digs love for her long after their story ended.I am looking forward to this authors future releases tremendously.  Lock and Key is easily one of my favorite MC reads and one that stands out completely from just a general biker story.  If you love a good MC read that is filled to the brim with emotion and where the drama is not the star of the show, but rather the characters  this is one series you need to pick up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U8GMMBS3T28C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TISOZLU#wasThisHelpful","R3U8GMMBS3T28C","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"100% Spoiler Free Review. First I owe Reanell T. a huge thank you for not only recommending this author but for sending me a copy of Beloved; which ultimately hooked me.Part two of the Consolation Duet is tricky, its all about the resolution that comes from the first part and the shocking ending of Consolation and so it would be a huge disservice to the readers out there to go into that resolution. If you have not read Consolation yet, fix that. Be wary of spoilers in reviews to Conviction  avoid them at all costs!I was dying for this book seconds after hitting the end in book one. After that ending, I knew I wouldnt survive the long (which ultimately wasnt long  a few months, but in book world that is like a lifetime!) wait. I was dying. I needed book two. This reader had questions and needed answers, but most of all I was scared to know. I was equal parts fearful and excited to start this read. I knew it was going to consume me and I also knew that I was going to be an utter mess while reading it.I was gutted within the first 10% of this book. My heart broke and then it broke again. The dual POV allowed me to get attacked by the feels at all sides  I was in tears and I didnt even make a dent in the story. At 15% I got the piece of book one that I wanted so badly and it confirmed everything I thought it would, but even that moment made everything more intense, more emotional. From this point to the halfway mark I was an utter mess. I was waiting for a huge moment that would twist my insides. The angst was delivered perfectly. I had to stay guarded, I had a heart I needed to protect but I couldnt help myself from having hope. This battle between my head and heart was all consuming and at this point, I was way past midnight and knew I hit the point of no return. There was no way I was going to be sleeping.Corinne Michaels wrote an incredibly gripping love story that was not an easy read, nor was it a simple story of two people falling in love. We grieved alongside these characters, we were standing beside them with our fist held high in anger, and we wept with them.One thing I love about this series (and the prior) is that although we are getting military heroes; we are getting a look inside the lives of the women who love them. We are shown the strength they have while they hold their lives together at home while their hearts are halfway around the world. Often times we get the romances with the soldier who has returned home, we rarely see the side of the story for those who are still active duty. I love that this author is paying homage to the wives of those serving.Jackson might have made me weak in the knees, but Liam stole the breath from my lungs. I am excited for Marks story in Defenseless and although Liam is going to be hard to top, there was something about the Mark we saw in this book that makes me think we are in for one helluva story. Now although this duet can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend that if you are going to read it  that you also read the Beloved Duet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FGTECPLV3T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194283408X#wasThisHelpful","R2FGTECPLV3T3","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Refresher: Lourdes is the photographer friend of Dair that we meet in Wild Side. We got a little taste of this story at the very end of the 3rd in that series, introducing us to the start of Heath & Lourdes twisted tale.**Lourdes is an early forties, recently divorced, mother of two who stumbles upon our brooding, twenty-five year old Heath. Everything about him screams danger but everything about him also screams sex. Hard. Punishing. Sex. Lourdes is left reeling as one encounter after the next leaves her needy in all the right places as Heath sneaks his way into her life and under her skin. But nothing is as it appears. For those that read The Wild Side, you know the backstory  or at least part of it  for new readers, hold on tight, because youre in for one helluva ride!I love R.K. Lilleys writing. Whether it is in the form of erotic romance (as we got with the Up in the Air Series, an emotional gripping romance (as we saw with Danika & Tristan) or this. A rhythmic, erotic romance that is filled the brim with suspense and teetering on the edge of darkness. The style was so different from the prior trilogies that put her on the map, yet the talent and the flawlessness was so evident from the very start.What I truly loved about his series was Lourdes. She had this confidence that we rarely see in our heroines. Sure there were slight moments of weakness, but she was not this pieced together girl verging on adulthood. She had lived a life. She had seen what the love she once held had lacked and seen the possibilities of so much more when she looked up on her friends (and yes, by friends I mean Frankie, Bianca and Danika).I think what I enjoyed most about this novel was not knowing what the heck was going on or what was going to happen. I loved that none of the pieces fit until it was time for them to fall into place. There was a constant hint of what was to come in the method that Lourdes narrated her story, but yet, even with that constant foreshadowing we were left in the dark until it was time for the lights to come on.Heath was this brutally damaged hero, which is one of my favorites. I loved that although it was so clear he craved more, his character stayed true. His growth was organic and not forced nor faked. It felt so natural as he shifted just slightly into what we saw towards the end of this novel. Nothing was rushed, it was paced perfectly.RKL produced another off the charts hot read with story. There is no doubt that every reader is going to need a little quiet time to themselves after a few encounters with Heath. Punishing doesnt even to begin to describe the way this man took what he wanted. It was unstoppable.All I can say after finishing this one is bravo~ oh, and bring us Tanner. I really want Tanner. He needs a woman to tame his wild ways!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NCZG1MQXJ1BE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9MGGC6#wasThisHelpful","R1NCZG1MQXJ1BE","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coops book. Okay so I do admit that Mr. Ryan had to win me over a bit, I was not a fan of his from his Sugartown days #TeamJackson all the way, but I can say without a doubt that I was easily won over. Cooper Ryan was downright delicious!Cooper Ryans life was in a downward spiral. After Holly left him (with his child) for another man, he was slowly drowning in the booze and the fame. But all that was about to change when one daring outburst tosses another red head into his path. Ali.Ali was on the brink of being swallowed alive by life. Alone, living in her car and having her dream job threatened if she refuses to become the personal assistant for one Mr. Cooper Ryan. Saying no to going on tour isnt an option, at least not when Cooper Ryan is insisting you go.Off the charts chemistry, sexual tension and a little bit of hate fuels this relationship into something explosive and utterly unexpected.So, Ms. Jenner.... where do I even begin. What the heck did I just read? Ill tell you  one hot as f#&% read, that is what I read.I never in a million years would have guessed this story was heading in THAT direction. But holy-h*** did it veer off into a fantastical fantasy world where, this girl was wishing on every star to live the life of this destitute girl for just ten minutes.Ali. B*@$#, Im jealous. And I mean that for both the real and the fictional Ali-cat ;)Again, we get a solid read that is filled with some of the hottest sex scenes that Ive read in a while and such humor that I could not keep the laughs to a reasonable level. If you have not read this author, you are missing out. Her humor is quirky and witty, a complete stand out from others in this genre. Where so many attempt, Ms. Jenner succeeds. Able to make her books not only humorous and sexy, but intense and oh-so-emotional when needed. She pulls you through the low times and catapults you during the high times. There is no room for just okay in these stories, it is just brilliant.Another stunningly sexy, hysterical, witty and emotional read from Carmen Jenner. I cant not wait for Levis book. Like, I might die if she does not hit publish like right now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XG6R5Z8YIZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXXAXJI#wasThisHelpful","R2XG6R5Z8YIZO","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, so I am a fan of the Evan Arden Series and I admit that after reading Isolated I was scared to jump into Irrevocable.  For those that have not yet read single book in this series, stop reading reviews of the final books!  Youre ruining all the fun and suspense.So Evan is back in Chicago, his stint as a law abiding citizen didnt last very long, if at all.  He lost the one woman that gave him a bit of peace because he had ties too strong to a man that he saw as a father to ever truly sever.  So he returns.  Back to Rinaldo Moretti and the mob.  Back to sleepless nights.He was only away for a few months, but things have changed.  Faces that Evan doesnt recognize and a feeling in his gut that something just isnt right.  But as Evans mind spirals he finds comfort in arms of a new woman.  A hooker, one that seems smart enough not to make the mistakes of the ones that came before.  Suddenly Evan is finding more than just slumber in her arms.  But for a man like Evan, normal just isnt going to be possible.  Normal doesnt play into his future.So I am slightly torn on this.  The writing and the story was done so exceptionally well.  No doubt there. And yeah, I got over my Lia issues near the end of this story but still feel a little on the fence over the whole thing.  And although this had strong elements of a romance story, it really lacked the romance side for me.  The action, suspense and drama were utterly nailed.  But the love just sort of felt like a very secondary part of the story.  By the time I started to have real feelings for Alina, I was looking for a grand gesture of sorts.  And I know that Evan is very limited in his abilities to be normal and I didnt need him to suddenly become this white knight... but I felt like the mob side of the story overpowered the other aspect.So here I am, a few days after finishing it.  Debating on my rating.  The writing and story  six stars all the way.  The small glitch I had with the romantic changes and romance playing a smaller role  four stars.  So the middle ground is still a five star read.  But I am still so flipping torn over the genre shift that I felt this book had.  Alina and Evan shared some hot moments but I didnt get the butterflies at their interactions like I did when Evan first met Lia in the first book. I think we had so much more time to watch that love story develop and Irrevocable just didnt lend itself enough pages to get it all down on paper for Alina and Evan.Overall as a series, this was an amazing series.  The story line was exciting and suspenseful and Evan shined as one crazy dark hero. There was a cast of characters that although you never got a chance to get too close to, you still enjoyed.  I will never hear someone say custom without thinking about Jonathan.  If you like fast paced action-romance, this is a series you should pick up.  Shay has a talent with taking on the male POV and creating a wonderful fantasy world to fall into.  Not many authors can deliver so often with the males POV  but Shay does. Each and every time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVFC46LXVP9XR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1512325163#wasThisHelpful","RVFC46LXVP9XR","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The final installment of The Excess Series took me by complete surprise.  I will not go into details of what happens.  That is something that truly has to be experienced firsthand. What I can tell you, is that you did not see that coming!  There is absolutely no way.  Like at all.What I loved about this series, much like with the Awakening Series is the maturity of the story and the characters.  It is become more and more rare to read about women in their mid-thirties, instead we get nineteen year old girls that we are expected are mature enough and ready enough to meet the man of their dreams.  Not with this series or this author.  You get a heroine that has lived a life already.  A non-perfect life and you get to watch her discover a new opportunity and a chance at love.  Feelings and situations are dealt with in an adult manner so the angst is low but the drama is high  if that makes sense.Aiden or Devin? Devin or Aiden? By this part in the series we have all made our choice. I know I made mine.I cant recommend this authors books enough.  If you need a great read then look no further.  So far her two series have been absolutely fantastic.

"Media brings you the final three installments of the Social Media Series (Status, Profile and Home).  As we have all come to expect from Julie's writing, we kick off part two of the bundle with what almost feels like a whole new set of books. We are getting a glimpse at the real Grace and Vaughn.  We are getting pieces to the puzzle that we need in order to solve it.  But again, this is a JA book - so we won't be solving anything until she is ready for us to see it.This series was nothing like I expected.  We start off with this sweet(ish) romance between a fan girl that is finding herself in the arms of the movie star she's fantasied about for years.  A fantasy that wanted and proving to be a bit too much for our Grace to take.  But what we get in part two is so much more.  More than I could have seen coming; a twisty plot line and characters that leaped off the pages as they took shape.Julie delivered yet another hit with this sexy, twisty romance series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZSZKQUDPGOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y1OYJHG#wasThisHelpful","R1KZSZKQUDPGOT","A2I9SOM8NW320O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I9SOM8NW320O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Social is the first three installments of the Social Media series that were released late 2014; this bundle consists of Follow, Like and Block.  So I won't go into the individual books, you can read those reviews if you wish.  From where we start with book one (Follow) and where we end up in Block - it would give far too much away.So I'll just say this...Don't let the start of this series fool you.  Sure, some may give up and miss out on one heck of an experience.  For those that are #fans of Julie's work, you know that nothing is ever as it seems and that she'll reveal all that to you in her own time, her own pace.  The story of Grace and Vaughn is no different.In the start of this series we get to know the characters.  We see who they are on their own and we start to get the real set up for who they can be together.  Oh, and yeah we get this hint of a secret.  Someone is hiding something.  Or maybe it's both of them that are hiding something?The first three books of this serial novella had my attention.  I was dying to know what was going to happen, how Julie was going to lay it all out for us as readers and ultimately I just waited to experience it all play out.

"This NAS is an excellent intermediate unit between the basic models from companies like WD and Seagate, and cheaper than larger more epensive units from QNAP and Synology. Setup is simple, and the unit was up and running in under 10 minutes. Apps are plentiful and the UI is pleasing. Because this is a lower power unit, I'm not seeing the same transfer speeds as on my DS214play from Synology, but it is still fast enough for day to day use with backups and remote storage.

"The new Q-See QCN8029Z is an excellent HD PTZ camera with shoddy software. The camera itself is excellent - and produces incredible picture quality and rock solid streaming.Installation is simple - you use the included template to find your location, unscrew three hex screws, then remove the top off the camera. Sadly, there is no separate mounting plate, so when you open the top, the entire inside of the camera is exposed. It would have been better to have designed a mounting plate so you don't come face to face with the inside. This also means you need to be very careful to install in dry weather, and to screw it shut correctly when done to prevent moisture getting inside the camera.Connections come from a power plug and Ethernet jack, though it does support PoE, which sadly means the power plug is then left unused (and dangling) with no included hardware to close it off. Again, in a perfect world, PoE support would mean you could remove or hide the power cable.This brings us to the software - which is a complete trainwreck of poorly translated stuff with badly documented features. I could easily detect the camera using the config software, but the NVR app (SmartPSS) is horrible.Thankfully, I was able to add it to BlueIris and use it there, though in BlueIris, I can't get the PTZ to work as it appears to be a newer generation Dahua PTZ protocol (yes, Q-See is owned by Dahua/Hikvision).Once in BlueIris, the camera is amazing. I get a rock solid 1080p stream with 30fps. At night, the camera is incredible sensitive.PTZ is speedy and the zoom lens is excellent going from very wide to really close.All in all, a great camera, at a pretty decent price for 1080p PTZ, but one you'll most likely need to invest more in to replace the software.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR9OYU3ERQLU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014MOGVVQ#wasThisHelpful","R3BR9OYU3ERQLU","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 21.16 ounce jar contains around 120 small 5 gram squares of chocolate. My initial annoyance is that the weight of the product is in ounces, and the weight of the chocolate is in grams. This way, they make it harder to find out you are essentially paying $60 for 120 tiny squares of chocolate, or 50 cents each when you ignore the price of the pretty poor quality glass jar. Unlike a good quality jar, this one lacks a rubber seal, it does come with a plastic shrink-wrap.The chocolate itself is just ok - keep in mind that this is essentially just the premium brand from the Hershey company, despite the cool German sounding name. The taste is pretty boring. The darks are pretty intense, going up to an 82%, which is a bit too high for a delicate piece of chocolate and an an average taste. The milk on the other hand is also too dark at 41%, it lacks the sweetness you'd expect from a good piece of milk chocolate. For a starter in chocolate (and someone who gets Scharffen Berger really will be), I'd recommend staying no higher than 70% on the dark as it is less intense.There are many other (better) brands of Chocolate on Amazon where you get better value for money, a better chocolate, and perhaps a slightly less attractive packaging, but quite frankly, I'd rather get more chocolate and less packaging. For lower budget shoppers looking for good quality, consider some of the bars from Leonidas or other Belgian brands, or Dutch brands like Droste found here on Amazon. You'll get a much better product at a better price. The Droste Pastilles ship in a 12 pack for $30, which will get you 42 ounces, or twice as much good chocolate for half the price. Again, they won't come in a cheap glass jar, but for most people, the jar will just end up in the trash anyway. Most premium brands also have gift boxes here on Amazon, where you'll get a little less chocolate, but still save up to 50% on the price of this assortment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9S5JLRX6T74B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116DEBFO#wasThisHelpful","R9S5JLRX6T74B","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where to begin with this pen... I've been a Livescribe user since the very first pen, and I've gone through all of their models in recent years. I currently use a Sky WiFi, along with many of their accessories.My first frustration with Livescribe 3 was its Android support - customers were made to wait well over a year for Android support. Sadly, that is also one of the major frustrations with Livescribe in general - their software products are a mess. Livescribe desktop and the various SmartApps are all gone (along with my investment), and the current newest pen is essentially phone only, taking advantage of the cloud.This Moleskine version is a great looking product (initially). It includes the pen, Stylus tip, MicroUSB cable, Molesine book, fabric pouch for the book and replacement ink.The pen is massive - really massive. It isn't too uncomfortable to use, and I do appreciate the rotating ink retractor, as it means you don't need to use the silly covers as on the previous pens. The pen clip is too rigid, making it almost impossible to wear on a shirt.As for the software, it usually works. The phone needs two apps for some reason - Livescribe Link and Livescribe+. Why they couldn't just put both features in a single app is beyond me.Transfers are fast - 10 pages were in my phone in seconds. Character recognition is weak - and despite a relatively clean handwriting, I'd say it only gets around 20% right. I also own the Neo N2 Smartpen, and find it much easier to use. It is also smaller, but lacks the pen retraction.Other downsides include the silly fabric cover that makes it impossible to use the left pages of the book as the fabric only covers a portion of the front - which means you are writing on a non-flat surface.All in all, the pen isn't all that bad, and I'm still a huge Livescribe fan, but this pen has too many shortcomings to be worth $225. Livescribe has a decade of experience to perfect their pen, and this is sadly just not something I consider perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R103Y6MC8YZKBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015A9Z1JK#wasThisHelpful","R103Y6MC8YZKBI","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless you are trained to look at a watch and determine its value, this Lucien Piccard watch will definitley fool you into thinking the lucky owner has a very expensive timepiece. The watch comes in a well made box, but shipping has made a few dents in it. The watch itself is wrapped around its holder, in a plastic protection sleeve, with a tag (no price). The build qualuty is excellent, and accuracy has not been a problem. Of course, this is not a handmade Swiss chronometer, it is in fact made in China. Many Chinese vendors sell these watches under a variety of names, but they rarely come in a such a nice box with good packaging, plus it usually take 3-4 weeks to get one, whereas this one can be shipped on Prime.Definitely something that most people should own, as there are too many peiple who dress up nice, then put on their lousy plastic watch. If you own a good suit, you need to own at least one good watch, and this is a great place to start.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2REAWC50ALEEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXHKBG#wasThisHelpful","R2REAWC50ALEEN","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This kit comes with the microphone, decent quality cable, a carrrying case, mic stand adapter and a small manual. What it lacks, is any kind of software, a table stand and headphones. The microphone isn't bad, but it isn't great either. You can not replace the mic with a better XLR version as the rig lacks phantom power, so you are essentially stuck with it.Still, it is much, much better than using the mic built into your phone, and the whole setup is great for on-site interviews or other recordings. There is plenty of software out there that'll help record and check the levels.My main issue with this is price - at $100 it is priced far higher than most other products in this category. The microphone is apparently the star here, and while it does perform admirably, it doesn't perform at a $100 level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JN5SN869X41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBPOBW4#wasThisHelpful","R13JN5SN869X41","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my review, I'm going to compare this new Epson PictureMate C11CE84201 photo printer to the most popular competitor on the market - the Canon Selphy CP910. Why? Read in and see the biggest difference between these and decide for yourself which printer is best.The basics are present in both printers:Wi-FiDisplayCard readerExcellent print qualityCamera supportGoogle Cloud Print supportThat is pretty much where the comparison ends as the Canon uses Dye-Sub technology whereas the new Epson uses their excellent inkjet tech. Included with the Epson is a starter cartridge, and like most Epsons, it wants to go through a lengthy (4 minute) initialization before you can use it.Based off current print supply prices on Amazon, the Epson is more expensive to operate. The Canon print pack (ribbons and paper) is $28, and the similar Epson pack is currently $48. That said, the MSRP for the Epson T320 print pack is $41. This put prints at the following prices:Canon 28 centsEpson 41 centsThis is a pretty significant difference. Print quality on the Epson is a lot brighter and more vivid, and prints come out much faster. I tested 1:39 seconds on the Epson, and 2:12 on my Canon. The Canon is much smaller, but it needs a lot of room on the front and rear to pass the paper through. Because the Canon uses Dye-sublimation, the prints appear to be less sharp, but in a side by side, most people won't see the difference. If you are a pro photographer, you'll most likely disagree with me here, but your average point and shoot photos looks perfectly fine on both printers.Pricing is also way different - a Canon Selphy CP910 is $80, and this new Epson is a whopping $249.Both models support Google Cloud Printing and the Epson adds support for their own Epson Connect Services, Both models claim support for many years of archival quality prints, but without waiting 100 years, I have no way to confirm this. The Epson claims a 200 year use when stored in an album.The major difference between the two is that the Canon prints have a small fold-off perforated tab on the edges, and it can only do 4x6, whereas the Epson is true edge-to-edge with support up to 5x7.Epson prints are  5760 x 1440 dpi, the Canon (since it uses Dye-Sub is only 300x300).Both printers continue the dismal history of not including a USB cable. For the Canon, you need MiniUSB, the Epson uses MicroUSB. And finally, both have a built in card reader and USB host option for connecting to a camera.Portability is also a big issue - the Epson is just too large to be portable, especially since it uses liquid inks. In the Canon, there is no liquid ink, and it has support for a battery pack (an additional $50-$75). If you want to print photos off-site, then the Canon is the best option.In the end, it is hard to justify this printer over the much, much cheaper Canon. Prints for consumers look the same to me, and with the $170 price difference, the average consumer really doesn't need the Epson. Don't get me wrong, it is a damn fine printer, but you can buy several years worth of ink and paper with the savings on the Canon.And finally, something I REALLY hate about the Epson is that it wants to print setup instructions for the cloud services on a piece of photo paper instead of just displaying it. This means you've gone through 2 pieces of the included paper sheets and some ink just to get the printer online.Reasons to pick the Epson over the Canon? Speed is one of them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIRW59QE0EXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KU0RIA#wasThisHelpful","R1YIRW59QE0EXD","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What you get in the latest version of this mount is not what I'm used to from Cheetah. As soon as the box arrives, you'll notice something - it is much shorter than the mount should be. This is because you need to assemble 50% of this thing yourself. In the box is a half assembled unit, and a variety of bagged metal parts.The entire left side comes in pieces, and you'll need a variety of tools (not included) and around 60 minutes to put this together the way it should be.Sadly, the final assembly is not as good as Cheetah mounts used to be, and even with careful work, the end result is kind of shoddy - the whole unit curves a little and the back is not straight. That said, it did straighten itself out once I mounted it thanks to the screws going into my wall studs, but it is still bad to see something go on the wall that is crooked.Additionally, I quite badly injured myself unscrewing one of the screws in a rail as I failed to secure the piece to a work bench when I tried to loosen one of the screws to prepare the TV mounting portion. While I do take some responsibility for this, putting a TV mount together should not require safety gear unless you are drilling into a concrete wall. I have a one inch deep gash right under my eye. Half an inch higher and I would have damaged my eye. Some of the screws are pre-installed in their factory, and need to loosened and removed before use, but they over-tightened many of them.The price is definitely fine, and the final unit isn't bad at all, but I'd recommend spending a bit more on a unit that comes fully assembled. Additionally, I think it is pretty disingenuous of Cheetah mounts to not mention the amount of work required to assemble the mount.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSEEH9MTF8U1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WL6YY8#wasThisHelpful","RSEEH9MTF8U1V","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In every possible way (other than price), I find this better and easier to use than Photoshop Elements. When compared to the full Adobe CS or Adobe Photography package, this one is also much cheaper, but compared to Photoshop CS, it costs a little more.Installation was a breeze. The include bonus content is quite extensive too, and with this ultimate edition, you also receive ON1 Picture Effects, AfterShot 2 (Which is great for managing RAW content), Perfectly Clear 2 SE, perfect for those (like me) who don't have a lot of editing skills, as it automatically does your post processing, in a much better quality than say Picasa ""I'm feeling lucky"" mode. And finally, the DVD also includes around 100 free backgrounds, which are not all that valuable or impressive.These tools alone are fantastic value, and that is even before you've immersed yourself in PaintShop Pro Ultimate. Inside the package are all the features you'd expect in a top of the line editing suite - features like auto text wrapping, Geolocation support for data extraction from your files, 4K monitor support (which works very nicely to scale the interface correctly.Additionally, the package has some great batch editing options, for adding watermarks or removing metadata.All in all. this is a real worthy upgrade, and at just under $100, you get a LOT for your money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBJB5NZBP6KH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60D8#wasThisHelpful","R3BBJB5NZBP6KH","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This keyboard is an excellent edition for many media players or TV's with USB support. In my test, I have it on an X810 Sony 4K Android  TV, and in most apps it works perfectly. The trackpad is responsive, range is great and the illuminated keys are perfect at night. In some apps (like Amazon Prime Video), the keyboard does not work, but this is an issue on their side, and not Logitech as the on-screen keyboards is made to work with the arrow keys on a remote, and not with a USB keyboard. The keyboard charges off MicroUSB, which is good and bad - it lasts long, but when it is dead, you need to charge before you can use it, instead of just swapping out some batteriesAll in all, if you do a lot of typing, you'll definitely get a lot of use out of this. That said, it is pretty expensive for what it does, and you can get the same (without the backlighting) out of a $25 Logitech keyboard/trackpad.

"I feel horrible doing this, but there is no other rating I can give to these other than a single star. The company (from its videos) appears to be pretty smart, and dedicated to their product, but what they released is quite simply not ready for prime time. In the cheap copies piece of manual included, they make it quite clear that these are not for consumers, and only for developers, but that should not permit the manufacturer to release something of really questionable quality.Let's walk through some of the issues:ComfortPut simply, these things are unwearable. They are so extremely uncomfortable that after about 4 minutes I couldn't bear wearing them any longer. They are extremely tight and quite heavy, so the combination makes them downright useless. They are also massive.The nose bridge is very uncomfortable, and there is a weird piece of plastic above it which is held on by 2 weak magnets, and appears that it will be lost int he first week.ControlsAgain, poorly designed here. The buttons are integrated into the slightly sticky black rubber housing, and there is zero tactile feedback, so you don't know when you actually power them on. You also need to press really hard on volume and the trackpad button on the bottom.The trackpad is no better, and controlling the cursor is really tough. I also couldn't get two-finger scrolling to work, which means it is virtually impossible to scroll though Android lists of options.OSThe unit comes with Android 4.4 KitKat - and that too is unacceptable in this day and age. Almost 30% of all Android devices have been upgraded to Android 5 Lollipop, so releasing 4.4 in 2015 just won't cut it.AppsThis may be sold as a developer edition, but there are no sample apps anywhere to be found. The company also makes regular mention of augmented reality, but they clearly didn't bother creating any demo apps to show off these capabilities. The only non-stock app installed is a sensor readout interface.To get the most out of the unit, you need to push Teamviewer to it using ADB, which will then allow you to open a remote desktop connection to it. This also makes it pretty clear that doing any real work on the unit is too painful to complete.DisplayThe company makes a lot of claims about their ""Flip-Vu"" folding display, but in reality all it does is move up and down - you can set it for see-through (like in the Epson Moverio or glance (like in Google Glass). They claim the display offers 33 pixels per degree of vision, on a 640x480  display. Sadly, even with this, getting the unit aligned for a good image requires a lot of fiddling. The standard angles of the flip-vu are not sufficient for a good picture, and you end up having to move the whole thing higher or lower on your nose. When you wear them, you also see too much of the frame surrounding the display unit projected on the optics.Value for moneyThe number one way to know that this product is doomed is that the manufacturer didn't even bother including a MicroUSB cable. These usually retail for $3, so not including one with a $1000 pair of augmented reality glasses is pretty weak. They also feel pretty crappy - definitely not $1000 specs. There is no case, no replacement frames, no headphones and no AC adapter. Most AR / HMD products I've tested come with a variety of accessories. Again, I'm fully aware that this is a developer unit, but other similar products are also sold strictly as development platforms, but do come with a good variety of accessories.There are several decent competitors out there, including Google Glass, which of course relies on your phone connection to use. The Epson Moverio BT-200 is another excellent option - which is half the price of the ORA-1, and offers DUAL displays. They are a bit heavier, but the display quality is much better, and it has a small external Android controller with integrated trackpad (and support for 2-finger scrolling). The Moverio also offers a built in custom app store and several pre-installed demo apps.All in all, this is a beta version of something that may become something good at some point, but is nowhere near close enough for retail sales, or even for developers. The SDK from Optinvent is impossible to find. On the Optinvent site, there are two videos showcasing the product - one shows a non-existent version of the ORA-1 with a much smaller frame, the other is a bit more realistic, showing the Android app drawer and a basic compass. There are no videos showing the ORA-1 with a truly well built augmented reality app, and the only options out there appear to be the same ones anyone can download from the app store (like Google Sky Map).Again, I apologize to the Optinvent team for such a brutal review, but charging $1000 for something this weak is only something Google can get away with, and their beta product was far more polished than the ORA-1.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LGAEPEX26KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QBISJ3A#wasThisHelpful","R36LGAEPEX26KU","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many of the features on this mid $30 stylish dual USB dock are nothing special - USB 3.0 support, dual bays for 2.5"" and 3.5"" drives, support for additional SATA drive protocols (UASP) and a decent package which includes a good quality USB 3.0 cable.What sets this specific product apart is that it has built in clone capabilities. With two drives, you can create instant clones of the source, especially handy for in an IT department where you are doing a lot of deployments. On the front of the unit is a clone button, and it has several LED lights that show activity, power and clone status.I tried several clones - first with a smaller drive (a WD 250GB), and copied to an identical drive. This is paramount to getting a successful clone - the target drive needs to be the same size or larger. Keep in mind that actual formatted size varies from vendor to vendor, so be sure to check the sticker on the drive for the exact formatted capacity.A second clone between 2 Samsung 120GB SSD drives worked fine too, but my third test using 1TB drives (Seagate) didn't work right. The unit started (or what appeared to be started), but progress never went up, even though I could hear the heads moving. Since this is such a cheap dock, it lacks an LCD display with error messages or status.All in all, your experience is hit and miss, but at this price point, you may end up finding it lacking as a clone dock, leaving you with a perfectly usable dual bay USB 3.0 dock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZHMI7I4QDP8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0115NB41E#wasThisHelpful","R1ZHMI7I4QDP8A","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'll refrain from touting any credentials that make me a ""professional IT person"" - Here are the steps I took to get this router up and running:I used Wi-Fi scanner on my Android phone to determine the best channels - and set the range extender up to use channels as far away as possible from my main router.

Going from the router to extender to Ethernet to my laptop, I measured 89mbit/s, when directly on the main router Wi-Fi, I measure 104mbit/s, which means the speed loss is quite limited, and the connection is definitely faster than when on Powerline which was my previous setup.The interface is rather messy, and documentation is quite limited - but there wasn't much I couldn't find when I needed it.

"This is a decent entry level knife set, sadly, the quality is not in line with other products from this brand. At first use, you'll notice that they are definitely not as sharp as they should be, but a few minutes with a whetstone or other knife sharpening product can take care of that.In the kit, besides the sturdy block, you get all the knives a decent kitchen needs (with the possible exception of a large cleaver). After 7 days use, and several times handwashed and in the dishwasher (which they advise against), I have yet to see any rusting or staining, and I'd be very disappointed if I did as stainless steel shouldn't rust to the point others mentioned.The set is made in China, and you can tell some shortcuts were taken - the block is acacia, but when you inspect it, it appears to be acacia on the outside only, and given its weight, I suspect it is not solid acacia.

"At first glance, this new Epson VS240 appears to be an incredible value for money - you get the incredible Epson 3LCD projection technology (which means not having to deal with the drawbacks of DLP), a great compact form factor, HDMI and a hole host of other features. What you also get is SVGA - which means 800x640 resolution, and in this day and age that just isn't acceptable. Unless you are 100% sure you can get away with this low resolution, spend a little bit more and get one with higher resolution.At SVGA, the resolution is just enough for some very basic computer connectivity or TV/video content that you can deal with in a resolution below HD. If all you ever do is some presenting in PowerPoint, make sure your text is larger than usual, so you'll prevent seeing jagged edges, or make the text entirely unreadable. On a screen around 110 inches, Excel sheets are barely readable without making the text much larger.Aroubd $100-$150 more gets you a 720p projector, where the resolution is high enough for actual business work, or even for some entertainment, but keep in mind that none of the projectors in this series are really well suited for movies.In operation, the projector is a real dream - relatively quiet, really bright, easy to setup and very quick warmup.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A28C3FHJ21K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119FYO74#wasThisHelpful","R3A28C3FHJ21K1","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Make no mistake though, that isn't really a bad thing as it allows these cubes to be packed down to next to nothing.

"Appears well made, non replaceable battery, but time will tell whether the unit works.This new Tria Age-Defying laser uses light pulses to reduce the effects of aging - the technology has been ""FDA cleared"", which doesn't really mean much, but Tria has along history of making good quality laser products. Given the requirement for at least 2 weeks of use, I'm going to regularly update this review with the results.Downsides to the unit are a slightly over-simplified operation - you turn it on, and it senses when it is on your skin, and uses vibrations to let you know when the laser is ""firing"". There is no pain or other sensation you get with hair removal lasers, so the whole process is rather pleasant.The internal rechargeable battery is not replaceable, and most likely won't last beyond 2-3 years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLDF4T8D5YL90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CR44C4#wasThisHelpful","RLDF4T8D5YL90","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Because this product page includes options for multiple products, let me clarify that my reviews is for the Belkin 3-port headset switch.The Belkin 3-port headset switch is a bit of an oddball - it is really designed for a pretty rare setup where you require three different headset sources; mobile, desktop computer and desktop phone. Sadly, the device doesn't really include many of the cables required to make the setup actually work. For most phones, you need audio (3.5mm) to rj11, and for your PC and phone, you'll possibly need other cables. What you essentially have here is the beginning of a setup - Belkin includes a sheet with parts numbers for the various other cables, but at the time of this review, none of those cables are available on Amazon. Without the desktop phone cable (for my Polycom phone), i could only test this on my smartphone and desktop. When you finally have all the cables plugged in, the setup does work, but it isn't sexy by any means. Most people are going to want to connect to their smartphone using Bluetooth, which can't be done using this switch.All in all, it works, but only for very specific setups, with very specific cables (which you can't yet get). Not impressed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309T8221JT0KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GNN81RC#wasThisHelpful","R309T8221JT0KJ","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This really is the best iOS mobile controller I've ever tested. I own controllers from Mogo and Logitech, but those always felt like ""mobile first, gaming second), whereas this SteelSeries controller is definitely designed around gaming first. Unlike others, there is no way to mount your phone or tablet onto the controller, but you can easily get around that with a decent standing case.The controls are excellent, and despite being paired over Bluetooth, there is not too much lag. At $40, it isn't even priced too high, and is in the same price range as similar controllers for consoles.

"Let me open right away with the elephant in the room - the price of this charger is quite insane - at least 5x more than (what appears to be) comparable chargers. But this Belkin 10 port charger is in fact extremely well made, and has some features not found on other chargers.For starters, there is the immense power brick - putting out 6.6A at 24V (or 31.6A at 5V), which means it can truly deliver over 3A per port.Building the main power source in an external brick helps dissipate heat. Additionally, it features a built in fan to keep the main unit cool. The unit itself is extremely well made, with solid USB ports. And finally, this power brick is actually designed for the Belkin tablet/iPad stands and secure enclosures, and these need to operate at things like schools, tradeshows and labs - where the devices may be plugged in and charging all day long.I own several much cheaper 10 port chargers, and none feel as well made as this one.I hesitate to remove any stars for the price, quite simply because this unit is extremely well made, and is for a much more demanding audience than most cheaper chargers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKULG1E46YZEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES8W4RW#wasThisHelpful","RKULG1E46YZEN","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The AeroFryer is essentially a hot air convection oven. It features a blower fan, Quartz lamp heater and a mechanical timer. The whole setup feels rather cheap, with a thin aluminum cooking tray, an assortment of accessories and the top heater unit. To use it, you place a very small amount of food in the cooking tray, then place the top on it. The whole setup feels a bit cheap, and the mechanical controls don't help that much either.The cooked products are pretty decent, and the hot air convection really can crisp them up. I tried oven fries and mozerella sticks, and in each batch I got a good crisp from the fryer.That said, I don't care for the design of the unit, especially when compared to products like the T-Fal Acti-Fryer or the Philips AirFryer - in those, you don't need to disassemble the whole setup to cook something, plus they are priced around the same as the AeroFryer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11132SBCO068L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSL89F8#wasThisHelpful","R11132SBCO068L","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a well performing home theater projector, this is not it - its resolution isn't really suitable for home theater use. That said, as an office projector, this thing is incredible. It features an incredibly bright 3200 Lumen lamp, networking, MHL support, and a neat cubby to store your MHL compliant device.Some of the basics; it is your everyday run of the mill DLP projector, but it features something that makes the colors appear a bit brighter and more vivid. Startup time is short, but it lacks a good short throw setting, so you'll need plenty of space to hook it up. Even though it is an office projector, it lacks a carrying case, so expect to spend an additional $50 - $75 on a case.Audio is excellent, and it supports audio over HDMI. Inputs include dual VGA, HDMI, Composite, USB and network. The network feature is pretty slick, and once installed, you can send content to it, and mirror your own screen. This worked much better than most laptop mirroring solutions, and saved having to mess around with video cables. If you hook this up to your office network, all you need is power and LAN, and you'll be able to send content to it off any other network port. Of course, this does require you to install the software.All in all, you get a rock solid projector, 1 year warranty on the lamp, 3 years on the projector and if you happen to bring it home for the weekend, it won't let you down - it may not be designed for home entertainment, but it'll serve you well on the occasional home movie. The projector even supports active LED 3D glasses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ORMZBMC2DQZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEV9MW8#wasThisHelpful","R2ORMZBMC2DQZT","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a left handed mouse user, I actually appreciate the ergonomics of this mouse - and it also scores high marks from me on all other fronts. The grip is just right - it has a slightly rubberized portion, a good amount of easy to reach buttons and a good sensor that really does work on glass. Now, not many people work on a glass surface, so it also works well on other shiny surfaces.The receiver is small, and stores right inside the mouse, but the battery compartment is quite hard to open, and a real nail buster.Batteries are included in the packaging, and need to be installed (unlike most others where you need to pull a tab).The mouse has a physical on/off switch, but I prefer the system found on Microsoft mice where the mouse turns off when you put the receiver back.All in all, this mouse is a good $20 cheaper than similar pro-grade products from Logitech and Microsoft, and along with its good ergonomics, good sensor and good buttons, I give it five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQCVRE52FEFQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6GOXUQ#wasThisHelpful","RQCVRE52FEFQY","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Linksys High-Gain antennas provide 4-7dBi improvement on your router. Based off my tests on an Asus AC68U router, the results are definitely good. The antennas are extremely well made, with heavy SMA connectors (which are actually a bit too stiff and heavy if you ask me). The antenna itself is thick plastic, with a larger portion at the bottom. You definitely feel like you got something good. Given their weight and the stiffness of the SMA screw, I'd advise that you are careful not to damage your router antenna connectors screwing them on.That said, the performance increase was identical to a $20 set of 9dBi antennas I got here on Amazon. Using WiFi scanner at the farthest range I can get a reliable signal, I did not see any increase in performance.Asus sells a 9dBi antenna on a sturdy base with SMA and extension cable for $27 - which means three (for my router) are almost $50 cheaper than this kit.In fact - these antennas are so pricey that you could actually buy TWO new WiFi access points (like the Ubiquiti UniFI AP) and get better range for LESS money than an antenna set.While I'm all for better antennas, inside these things is little more than some copper and wires - nothing inside these 7dBi antennas makes them worth $130. Better range comes from good router placement, checking that you are on the right wireless channel (and not on overlapping channels), and possibly upgrading to better antennas - but you don't need to spend more than $30 on an antenna kit. If you use an Android device, I highly recommend WiFi Scanner software from inSSIDer - it'll show you your signal strength, overlapping channels and more. In most cases, 10 minutes with this will get you more ways to fix your WiFi than spending money on antenna kits.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WA8CNWX1S947/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJJAUSA#wasThisHelpful","R2WA8CNWX1S947","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Recon Jet eyewear has been one of the most anticipated wearable products since it was announced almost 2 years ago. Sadly, a lot has changed in the wearables world, and the Jet has been left behind.The specs are impressive;CameraGPSBluetooth and ANT radiosRemovable battery packRecon styled sunglassesOptical trackpadRecon proprietary Android OSSetup is not as complex as others made it seem - you do need to start the install on a computer, which is a bit odd, especially for a wearable that will ""live"" connected to your smartphone.In the box is a small and pretty useless fioldout manual, a Micro USB cable, carrying case and the Jet glasses. The lack of an AC charger is a disappointment as it would have been cheap to include and would have made the product a bit more complete. In the case are some open spaces for what I can only assume is for spare batteries, but when you open the case for the first time, you can't help feel underwhelmed and wondering if something is missing.Operation is ok, but not great. You lose a lot of field of vision in your right eye where the ocular display sits. There is a small joystick style adjustment knob to move the display around, and you'll use that along with the adjustable nose bridge to get the perfect fit. In my case, I got a relatively good fit, but it never seemed to be perfect.Compared to my Google Glass, having the display at the bottom of your vision takes some getting used to, and the display unit is much larger for the same resolution. Also, the display on the Jet is not see-through like on the Glass.Controls are good - using a small optical trackpad and a small rocker button.Using the Jet in the real world is tricky to explain - if you found people wearing Glass to be weird, you'll get a real laugh out of people wearing these. You essentially turn into a mix of Robocop and Georgi Laforge from Star Trek.Once setup on your phone, Jet shows a great amount of information on its display which of course syncs to your mobile device and online site.This brings me to the biggest problem - since this product was announced, better wearables have hit the market. Android wear devices like the Sony Smartwatch 2 feature GPS, the Microsoft band does the same, and of course, the newest FitBit also offers GPS. One thing these devices don't offer is ANT connectivity. The new Garmin Vivoactive does offer GPS and ANT+ support, which means you can get something that is almost 1/3 the price, with the same sensors, without looking like a dork.Don't get me wrong - there are definitely situations where having an HUD is convenient, and biking with the Jet is a real treat, but it feels incomplete. App support is coming soon, and Recon actually managed to get LESS battery life out of the Jet than with Google Glass, which is quite an achievement. 4 hours is all you'll get, which means the product becomes useless halfway through a long bike ride.All in all, the product just isn't as impressive as the hype would have made us believe. It came out. The product was announced in January 2013, and if it came out in springtime of 2013, it would have been amazing. Sadly, coming out in the summer of 2015 just makes it too little, too late. There are not enough sensors, not enough great apps at launch, and limited battery life. All in all, a real shame because I really wanted to love these.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZLRWW5LE2ET7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCJ4CKG#wasThisHelpful","R1ZLRWW5LE2ET7","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The GOAL ZERO Venture 30 power pack is a battery pack in a very crowded field of other chargers. Inside the pack are Li-NMC cells with a total capacity of 7800mAh, and with the usual losses, this means you'll get around 2 full charges of a standard smartphone when you start charging around 20%. The pack also features a built in MicroUSB cable (sorry Apple users).The pack has dual 2,1A outputs, which means it can charge an iPad or other high power USB device. Per its specifications, the ports are ""smart"", and it even includes a shipping mode, a built in multi-mode flashlight and a very good waterproof rating. Despite its high waterproof rating, the top USB port is unprotected, so you may need to blow water or dust/sand out of it.Sadly, despite all of these features, some of the basics are lacking; its input charging capacity never got above 0.5A - which means an entirely full charge took 19 hours - totally unacceptable. I've tried multiple chargers and USB cables, but it never gets about half an amp. Much cheaper packs from brands like Anker can charge up to 2A - which makes its charging speed almost four times faster, but of course those lack the ruggedness of this pack.The waterproof Unifun pack (Amazon ID B00MG9VVW4) is just $20, and has higher capacity, can charge at 2A, has a brighter flashlight and even has a built in carrying clip. It does lack the built in cable of the Venture 30, and doesn't specifically support solar charging from other Goal Zero products.Of course, GOAL ZERO is a top quality brand, but there is a limit as to what an a-name brand can charge for something this simple.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LLSL35PV220X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY2HXFU#wasThisHelpful","R2LLSL35PV220X","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This new version of the Key West Frozen Concoction machine has only slight improvements over the original; it holds more ice, and it has a new jar with an ""easy pour"" lid which you no longer need to remove to pour drinks. These two improvements mean you can make more drinks, in the same amount of time, as you don't need to refill its ice reservoir as often. There is no larger motor as it uses the same 450 Watt motor as the original, and it has the same controls. The product review claims a new bullet style blender, but I got the exact same beverages out of it as my original Key West unit.Sadly, these improvements don't add up to justifying the new price - at current list price of $299, it is almost $140 more than the entry level machine, which does exactly the same:Shave Ice from cubesDispense ice into blenderBlend drinkAll of these machines are essentially the same, the only difference is the price. And for all of the fans of Jimmy Buffet - keep in mind that these machines are just mass produced by Sunbeam who license the name.The final product from this new Key West machine is certainly good, but it is exactly the same as all the other machines. Whether this increased ice  reservoir is worth $140 is a matter of personal taste, and how often you plan to make frozen drinks. If you are like most people, you'll only pull this out once or twice a year. If on the other hand, you enjoy a tasty frozen beverage daily, then a larger jar might be worth the extra money to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SUX6IIHVXQ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QZ5CVKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SUX6IIHVXQ0F","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Judging the usability of this product is extremely hard to do - the results are not known for weeks of use, and the technology behind the product is mostly based on theoretical results. All studies on these products use terms like ""are believed"", and ""the actual results will vary by skintype"". In other words - this may or may not work for you. That said, the technology isn't entirely bogus (like magnetic bracelets), so it isn't fair to give the product a poor rating based off on individuals results. In my case, I used it daily for three weeks, and didn't see any difference - but then again, I also didn't see my skin get worse (and it is summer), so it wouldn't be right to produce a bad rating, as there are clearly enough people who DO see good results. I'll leave it with this piece of scientific explaining about what goes on when you use the wand:Red light LEDs are also believed to target the skins oil glands to reduce cytokines, a class of pro-inflammatory substances believed to play a role in chronic acne.I don't have acne (at the moment), so perhaps NOT breaking out is thanks to this device.

"This is an incredible little charger. As promised, it pumps out 20V at 65W, and was able to keep my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro running and charging, without getting too hot.The charger beat the mythical Finsix dart to the market, but that is no surprise since that charger is 8 months late to market. It is also smaller than the FSP laptop charger, which until now was one of the smallest on the market.Downsides in my opinion are that the plugs are relatively easy to lose and that it doesn't come with a carrying pouch for the plugs, but other than that, this is a great purchase for people with a NORMAL laptop charger plug.The kit is missing charger plugs for the newer Samsung ATIV book line, as well (of course) with the Surface tablets which use proprietary magnetic plugs.

"As a wireless charger, this Belkin performs quite well. Once you position your phone correctly, it charges with abound 1.3A of power, which is about the maximum you'll get out of Qi. It does not work well through a case, as the coil is quite small, and the unit has a single coil (as shown by others). It does include a small AC adapter and a decent USB cable, but it is still around 2x the price of similar Qi chargers from reliable brands.The LED indicates when it is charging, and turns red when the charging isn't working right. Sadly, the whole product is entirely reliant upon the user placing their phone exactly right. This is caused by their decision to use a single coil. As you can see in the photo of the interior, the actual board and coil is just a small portion of the internals, so they made the product larger than it has to be, making phone positioning even harder.At the end of the day, it is just a basic Qi charger with a not-so basic price tag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33AIID9ITVV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VA5SU56#wasThisHelpful","R33AIID9ITVV9","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In its shipping box, you'd be forgiven if it arrives, and you don't realize the box contains a tent. The TN 2 packs/rolls nicely into a relatively flat pack, making it the ideal backpacking tent. At 4lbs, it is a good weight for your average trail backpacker, but may be too heavy for those trying to go ultra-lightweight.Setup was simple (in a backyard test), and as long as you've done this before, you'll have the tent setup in no time. The included stakes are fine for hard soil, but won't do you much good for sandy ground.One of the best features of this tent is a massive mesh opening on, making it ideal for warmer nights, or for when you just want to lie down and look at the sky. That said, when open, the mesh does not provide any privacy, so keep that in mind. The mesh is fine enough to keep blowing sand out, and condensation in the morning stayed on the outside and didn't penetrate the inside.As far as space is concerned, when I was in the tent with my Osprey Aether 85 pack, things were snug - so I'm not sure the 2 person moniker is entirely valid. If you feel comfortable storing your gear outside the tent, you could fit 2 people in there, but you'd better be good friends, because you'll be pretty close.Repacking the tent wasn't too bad, but you'll be re-rolling it several times till you get it tight enough to fit back in the bag. You may be better off with a different sack to store it in.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z5LGWESX8UMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6KURDI#wasThisHelpful","R2Z5LGWESX8UMO","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At $275, the Spyder 5 Elite is the most expensive Spyder 5 calibrator. Sadly, Datacolor seems to have fallen for the old Microsoft trick of offering several versions of their software. Express, Pro and Elite all come with the same calibration tool, but the different software versions do different things; and there is a $150 price difference between the entry level and the top one (Elite). For that $150, you get ambient light settings (using the light sensor on the front of the calibrator), faster tune-up calibrations and full screen mode for calibration before and after checks.The calibration itself isn't bad, but there are a lot of dialog boxes that get in the way and can be turned off after the initial check. Some small annoyances are present, like having to manually click ""update"" after each brightness change when calibrating. Why they didn't allow for live checks is beyond me.The final result is very good, so it definitely deserves some points there. The ""hanging"" lens cover system seems like a decent idea, but on larger monitors it isn't all that convenient and you'll need to tilt it quite a bit to ensure the sensor is positioned right. The USB cable is also too short if you are using a floor placement desktop computer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QK58XTEJJRLO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBSL3L6#wasThisHelpful","R1QK58XTEJJRLO","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This NuTone branded (officially this is the GD00Z: Linear Z-Wave Garage Door Opener Remote Controller Accessory) is the first full Z-Wave garage door controller. The product has been available since January as part of the Lowes Iris system, but now it has moved on to being available as a stand-alone product in four different ""flavors"": Lowes Iris, Schlage Nexia, NuTone and Linear . That said, because the system is entirely Z-Wave compliant, it should work fine on any other Z-Wave controller, For example; I can use this on my Smartthings controller, but it also works on the Vera Lite controller. Both need little work to get them installed right.One of the highlights of the system is its security. In addition to this, it is also a rare secure Z-Wave repeater - this means any Z-Wave products you have in the area of the controller will repeat through this, which should increase the range. On some Z-Wave setups, you may need to do a rescan or reinitialize of the Z-Wave devices to get them all synced.Installation was pretty simple, and I had the setup working on my Chamberlain controller in no time. Unlike the Chamberlain MyQ system (which I also use in its add-on version), this system is wired, and connects to the push button connections on your opener.The system also includes a tilt sensor, so it always knows the status of the door. All in all a good system, but one with some stiff competition. The MyQ system has its own app, and is independent of any third party systems (like Nexia, Smartthings or Iris).Speaking of MyQ - the system doesn't work with MyQ enabled systems where the MyQ is built into the control pad.

"Once you get past the firmware upgrade (which failed twice), this is definitely a rock solid large router. It has many of the features you'd expect from a $280 router, but is also missing a lot of them; It offers a USB 3.0 port and dual USB 2.0/eSATA Who in the home market really wants to try and get an eSATA drive hooked up to this?It also lacks a lot of the apps found on similar routers from Asus and Netgear like VPN server, download server and more.That said, where many of these other routers focus strongly on added apps and features, so far (on the latest firmware), the AC2600 has proven to be one of the more solid routers I've tested. Both speed and range were at least 50% above my Asus AC68U, and while it doesn't offer as many gimmicks, it makes up for that with a quicker UI and easier to find features.Now, on to the max link speed of 1733Mbps - I'll consider that bolderdash, since it really only can occur when you are right next to the router, and even then, home networks don't have the capacity to pull speeds like that. Even on the fastest services available, you'll have 1000Mbps to work with. In reality, you'll be seeing between 100 and 200Mbps on an AC capable device. On devices with internal antennas (like Microsoft Surface and Yoga 3 Pro), you'll start seeing speeds drop pretty quickly - albeit much more stable than on other routers.Downsides: it can't be wall mounted, and it only has 4 Gigabit ports.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UD0TVF4F16QO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVN21DK#wasThisHelpful","R3UD0TVF4F16QO","A2J8T58Z4X15IO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J8T58Z4X15IO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here in Colorado we've already had snow and I must say I'm really impressed with the simplicity of the Boa system in making these snow shoes fit over my boots without a hassle and maintaining the tightness throughout my trek.  At the cabin in the mountains there's already three feet of snow on the ground and it ain't goin anywhere soon so I went out for a walk with these and had no problems with maintaining my balance or with sinking in.  You get two of these in the package.  I thought I'd point that out because as of this writing Amazon's product page doesn't make that clear.They're much narrower than I'm used to but I'm old school snow shoe...been wearing the same pair for thirty years and I only got these because the kids said ""Dad, you need to move up to the new technology..we think you'll like it"".  Darned If I didn't.  They're less cumbersome and that dial in your fit system really works.  I love em.  Won't use anything else but now...I recommend for the High Country and anyplace snow gathers and you need to traverse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K757A9O7QKSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDP6SD6#wasThisHelpful","R2K757A9O7QKSD","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Average DVD player.  This is a bare bones DVD player (only rca and hdmi out)  usb is 2.0 but set-up is simple.  I don't recommend this for 4K TV's that up-convert.  My LG TV makes the picture seem like it's in some kind of minute animation in the movement of the human form (best I can describe it) and there is an occasional flash of green around the edges.  On a 1080P TV it looks great and the up-conversion is okay.Personally I wouldn't buy it.  I think the Sony's do a better overall job, especially on 4K TVs.  But It depends on what you're looking for really.  If you just want a bare bones hdmi capable DVD player with 1080p up-conversion.  This will fill the bill.  Sound reproduction is fine through my receiver.  Remote is simple but complete.Sorry Panasonic I usually love your products and I have a Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player that I love!!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R51M9EYEX292/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KC0HVTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2R51M9EYEX292","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This center speaker has remarkable sound replacing my Infinity Beta C360 which is a huge 2-ft 1-inch by 9-inch behemoth I've had since 2006 and haven't heard a better once since till now.  I don't know who Andrew Jones is and I am not an audiophile by any means but this smaller Elac C5 boasts as big a center speaker as the Beta C360 enhanced by all the audio advances made since 2006 and I can tell you it sounds better than the C360.  I bought the biggest Infinity at the time to handle all the new sound separations and dialogue and I thought the sonic field it provided was the best I could get without spending hundreds more but this Elac which cost less new than the 14 year old one did then is blowing it away and sounds as good as any high end center speaker I've heard.I am retiring the C360 for now in favor of this one and I must say that I had now idea what I was missing in that sonic field until now.  I'm not an expert and all I can report is what my ears hear.I'd recommend it.

"Got this for the college kid.  He's just the right fit for it and he likes the modesty it affords him in his co-ed dorm (a fact I just learned about...and where the heck were they fifty years ago?????).  He and the other kids built a Sauna (Russian Style - seats 8)  in the spare room attached to our garage and now on weekends he and his college friends hang out over here and use it so this is definitely gonna be good to have around here.  He bought seven more of them to keep for friends and guests to use when they come over (a fact that I appreciate - since I'm not out anything and I don't want a bunch of naked college guys upsetting the women folk - of course I haven't asked their opinion yet because I might find out that they didn't mind at all!!).  Timmy likes the micro-fiber absorbency and the fact that it dries quickly when they turn the heat up and the steam off.  Two of his best buds are Russians and they helped build and design the sauna (you should see this thing - you'd swear you stepped into a regular bath house) and they thought these micro-fiber wraps where marvels of modern science!  I wear it in the Sauna too and I can attest to the comfort and security of the velcro wrap around tab.

"Denon has put out a solid mid-range network receiver that focuses on the coming goodies in audio and video, including DTS-X (in an upcoming firmware release) and already has Dolby Atmos decoding out of the box.  I am replacing an Onkyo TX-NR646 receiver that was good but fell way short on Dolby Atmos.  My mind was made up when watching San Andreas and realizing the Atmos wasn't there or if it was it was so weak it was overcome by the other speakers.  If ever there was a movie besides the latest Transformers that was made for Atmos this was it.  Huge disappointment!  I can report that the Denon AVR-X2200W blew the Onkyo away with it's atmos decoding.  Some have noted that they believe this unit does not have the punch of the Onkyo series but I disagree.  At 95 watts per channel, delivered with clean power I have no problem rocking the room with this receiver.  I also have not experienced the sound drop outs that have been mentioned when using this with an HDMI Television box.  Changing channels is smooth and the sound is there.The 4K upscaling capabilities have made my Perry Mason dvd's look like they were filmed yesterday when upscaling from a Panasonic DVD-S700 which is strictly a DVD player (I still prefer watching DVD's on a dvd player for the memory, slow motion, and frame advance functions which never seem to work just right on Blu-Ray players)Set up is pretty straight forward and it does have the Audyssey Silver set up that really does a good job of measuring your room and setting things accordingly. This is pretty essential for me since I am by no means an audiophile but I do know if you're going to rely on this kind of setup then it doesn't get any better than Audyssey Silver.  I just want a set up that plays my movies and gives me the complete range of sounds available today for home viewing and this baby delivers in spades!It is capable of doing just about anything you want wirelessly for those of you that are into wireless streaming these days (I'll stick to my vinyl and turntable - which it reproduces magnificently - I am really pleased with that aspect).Overall I'd recommend this receiver to anyone like me who isn't an expert on these things and wants to hook up his movie theater with 7.2 sound and take advantage of the new Dolby-Atmos and then down the pike the DTS-X Surround.  I only had to add two speakers to move up from 5.2 to atmos (in this case Onkyo does make the Onkyo SKH-410 Dolby Atmos-Enabled Speaker System (2) for about $150 that work great in a room like mine where overhead speakers are out of the question).  Otherwise there are many overhead configurations possible that work and you should do your homework on Dolby Atmos before deciding and buying speakers for your set up.  The Atmos adds a lot in films like San Andreas where things are falling from overhead or filling the air and it is a thrilling experience when watching the film (I actually ducked a couple of times).  Sound reproduction is clear and doesn't overwhelm the dialogue (an issue with my age group) and this is the best receiver I've found for that particular necessity besides my $2K Marrantz in the family room upstairs and obviously I'm not gonna buy a lot of those.Like the title says I recommend it because I think it's the best bang for the buck in this price range for my needs and hopefully yours too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G4X693PQ2ZN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZPTBNXY#wasThisHelpful","R1G4X693PQ2ZN1","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These Scott Hard Roll Paper Towels are really good in my Sanitouch Hard Roll Paper Towel Dispenser (09990).  I like the texture  and they are very absorbent.  We use these dispensers in the Garage for mechanic work and in the kitchen (The Sanitouch) for working with raw meats and such for a quick hand clean-up without cross contamination because you never touch anything but the paper towel.  Now that we know how well they work we use them for spills and every other kitchen job as well.  Dispensers eliminate the ever popular never ending roll when you pull a regular roll of paper towels and it decides to unwind from a few to the entire roll which you have to patiently wind back onto the roll.  Never again with these dispensers.  We have a fully automatic one that uses batteries and another size towel (09992) and this one which is manual but still operates quietly and efficiently using these towels and the manual benefit is you don't have to use batteries!.  You do need some installation room in your kitchen (we mounted it over the sink to be handy) and garage as they are commercial size but the benefits outweigh any size considerations...believe me!  These models are elegant looking and smoke colored so you don't see the paper towel roll and your relatives and guests will soon find themselves using them all the time.  Of course the review is about the paper towels themselves and they are very good quality and not the old stiff paper towels you picture in your mind when you think of commercial paper towels.  They're not tissue soft but they do feel like regular paper towels and perform accordingly.These towels come 12 rolls to a case of 800 feet each for a total of 9600 feet.  Using these in the kitchen a case should last us about a year and a half or more.  At around $75 a case that works out to $4.17 a month (your usage may vary of course depending on size of household and the individual user - so bear that in mind).  Quite a bargain considering both the quality of the towels and the absorbency, which is excellent.  The dispenser is automatic and costs around $39.00 here on Amazon, even less if you buy from the Warehouse when available.Over all a great towel, in quantity, quality and the price breakdown after the initial dispenser investment.  I suggest this as an alternative to buying those high priced paper towels every week that you're just going to throw away anyway!!!  And I've noticed the quality of the home versions of paper towels has plummeted in the last two years or so (what's with that?).I recommend for people who recognize the convenience, the cost savings and the logic of their use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25JHRK2DE9SMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00375LQJ4#wasThisHelpful","R25JHRK2DE9SMM","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice 400 thread count sheets.  AmazonBasics has done it again.  These are nice and soft and wash out wrinkle free.  The fitted sheet has deep pockets and  and the flat sheet's dimensions fit over my Queen size bed (12 in deep memory foam mattress) with a nice drape.  The fitted sheet is nice and tight and doesn't pull loose on the bed but you could probably add an inch maybe two to your mattress depth.  Under my comforter I am not too warm so the sheets breathe well.  The Pillow Cases are standard sized but forgiving because my slightly bigger memory foam pillow fits nicely inside and it doesn't on my other standard pillow cases.  The price is right and the quality is there.  It's becoming my go to brand for an awful lot of household and techie items of late and I must say I have yet to be disappointed in any way.  You might want to put AmazonBasics in the search box and see what comes up these days...you might just be surprised and they're all backed by Amazon's return policy which makes the occasional lemon less painful indeed.I really recommend this sheet set for everybody.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EDG66RGRZIAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7OE3VA#wasThisHelpful","R1EDG66RGRZIAP","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have an old tub in the house and I had my doubts whether this would fit it but I went to my daughter's house to fix a bathroom sink leak and she had one of these DII mats in her tub (also a 15.75 by 39 inch) and her tub looks a lot like mine with the old claw feet so I came back & measured mine and sure nuff 39 inches is the length of my tub as well.  I asked her if she liked it and she said 'no...I just put it in there to annoy people'...but that's a typical answer from my daughter...ha ha...then she smiled and said it was the best non-slip mat she'd used.  She'd tried the appliques (am I saying that right) and the kids still managed to slip and she tried another brand whole tub mat and it kept bunching up and losing suction so on the strength of really liking their kitchen towels (micro-fiber and available here on Amazon too - great towels - but that's another review) she bought this mat and said she hasn't looked back since.  She said it stays in place and the kids don't slip and slide all over the place or trip over bunches and she herself likes it when she showers.

"I've raved about Scotts products for years and this one is something new for me.  I'm reseeding (yes in the fall here in Colorado) a lawn that had to be torn up to replace a retaining wall and I want to get the seed in the ground and taking hold before the spring so I'm seeding now and putting this down to hold water on the hard packed dirt through the remainder of the unusually warm fall we've been having so far (cross fingers).  I'll have to let you know in the Spring if this has had any effect although a few sprouts might actually start (two frost warnings so far no freezing at night).So for now all I can say is that I depend on Scotts for all my lawn needs and have for many years now.

"Great idea.  You can create your own 3x5 foot dry erase board with this roll-up.  I wanted to put it on the wall in the office to be permanently affixed to a frame with a wooden backing that had held corkboard before and this did the trick with no problems.I cleaned the backing and dried it carefully and unrolled this and peeled the backing back enough to start the sticking process on the backboard of the frame and lined it up carefully and just pulled slowly and pressed all the way across.  First time I've ever done this without hiccups and uneven application.  It stuck really well and has shown no sign of peeling back at any corner or along the edges.The dry erase surface is much superior to those boards you buy that have to be really cleaned to erase the entries but with this surface a dry erase eraser is enough.  I bought one like they use on blackboards.  I'm very pleased with the end result and it cost much less than if I had to buy a good one this size.I recommend without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNU1R2ZN5EYC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1D5YM#wasThisHelpful","RNU1R2ZN5EYC6","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are the best dish towels I have ever used and the family completely agrees.  We have the striped versions and now these grey ones will add a touch of elegance to our towel rack (the others are in blacks and whites).The DII towels are very absorbent right out of the package but improve with age.  The microfibers hold a lot of moisture and plates get completely dry quickly.  They wash good and are well stitched and using now for almost a year they are wearing very well with little sign of deterioration.They make wash cloths too and wash cloths with plastic scrubbing netting on one side (I love those) and they hold up much better than other brands I've used.I have no problem recommending these towels for the kitchen in any home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AE42CP2N6LFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTUXHG#wasThisHelpful","R1AE42CP2N6LFC","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice idea but the thing gets very hot on the outside and now after about seven months use the numbered display is slowly failing.  The top portion of the far numeral is dead so O becomes a U and the middle one is showing signs of dying as well.  I really like the concept and use this cooker about twice a week for casseroles for the family so I'm very disappointed to see the display beginning to fail after only 7 months (I suspect the surface heat of the unit is the culprit).  I would suggest you just buy the one with the regular old crockpot controls that are manual because it really does cook up casseroles of all types extremely well.  The manual ones are cheaper and will probably outlast this unit by a good bit.Personally I hope they address the issue because I like the timer and the automatic switch to low when done.

"This is a unique little idea and unlike other reviews I had no problems with getting it to work with my Samsung HU8550 2014 model.  I got it up and running in under an hour (including firmware upgrade).  Last night I watched Exodus and I must it admit it looked great on my TV but no better than my streaming a movie from Netflix.  This may be the way to go for some people but I just don't like the download times to get new movies... anywhere from two hours to overnight.  We deleted Exodus and bought another movie and I was really disappointed with the fact that four hours later it was still downloading.  I really think this will cause a problem with the target customers because I can stream 4K movies from Netflix and they look great.  The selection is sparse streaming but this is early in the 4K game and I'm sure the selection will grow.  I imagine people with slow streaming would find this idea beneficial and if they are willing to wait the download times it would certainly eliminate the problems slower Wi-Fi has with streaming.  I'm deducting one star for the download times involved.  The picture quality is slightly better than streaming in my opinion.I realize some people have no problem with this but I don't have time to download during the day and I don't leave anything turned on overnight.  Guess I'm old fashioned in that regard.  In my opinion people will buy the product of least resistance and while M-Go works and has a fairly good selection I'm not sure this is going to catch on...but that is purely personal opinion with no facts to back it up.  You can store up to 13 movies on the drive before you have to delete or buy another drive and at the current price of $69 that is a bargain.I'm ambivalent about this product as I can see how it would be nice for some customers and not really any more feasible than streaming for others.  And if, as others have pointed out, M-Go throttles the download speeds then the slim advantages I can see evaporate immediately.My advice is do your homework.  Decide how you want to access 4K material on your TV and if it's right for you...buy it.  It is convenient.  The software, copyright issues, website etc are in their infancy, so you might have to put with bugs till they get them all worked out but it delivers on what it promises.  You can watch ten movies stored on the device (two free - eight paid) and then you can buy more and download them and watch.Eventually if it catches on I'm sure they'll add other TV manufacturers.  Meanwhile caveat emptor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NJOXUCGJXZBQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012V9WC1M#wasThisHelpful","R3NJOXUCGJXZBQ","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using this keyboard since August to control my LG 4K TV and it works flawlessly.  When Vine offered the same model I jumped at the chance to add an extra one for the bedroom Samsung.  Just to make sure however I took the one I have and paired it to the Samsung to make sure I had the same level of control and surfing that I have with the newer LG and it works just as well there.Primarily I wanted the keyboard that lights up at night.  It's not too small for my hands and the touch pad works great and the keyboard isn't so light you'll throw it across the room swiping (I had that happen with another one).  It has some heft to it.  The battery life has actually exceeded the ten days for me and I usually recharge around the 12th to 13th day.  The light up keyboard makes it much easier on these old eyes when I want to go through web pages on the browser (The Samsung browser is a bit slower than the LG which has nothing to do with this keyboard, it was just odd that in the past it's been the other way around, I guess LG is catching up with the competition).I've used several brands of wireless keyboards (including microsoft (give them a C-) and this one has the features I want and works extremely well in your hands.  I highly recommend it.  The good ones are all a bit pricey so you may as well get the best one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSVT1APC6FV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOPVSKW#wasThisHelpful","R3FSVT1APC6FV6","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The day I got this the power company called and informed me that a recent bypass and rerouting of power to my house because of a new retaining wall that is still in the process of being built had to be redone because of fluctuations that couldn't be traced paced the new connection.  Because it was a faulty connector (can't remember the exact term the Utility guy used) and because the wall was nearing completion they wanted to send a crew out the next day to reroute the power again and I would be without power for somewhere between 20 minutes and 2 hours.  So the test for this device was on!!  I charged it initially in just over two hours and plugged in my modem, router, and phone in preparation for the next day.Next afternoon they came about 1 PM and started digging down to the new connector and about 1:35 PM they cut the power to my house.  The results were refreshingly good.  An hour in (they found they had a problem down there) I was still surfing the internet via my tablet.  At One hour and fifteen minutes I turned on my laptop to make sure it had internet and it did.  At one hour and  thirty-seven minutes the power came back on and I hadn't had even so much as a flicker on my wifi.I consider that test enough as I wanted it primarily to back up my wireless network and phone (voip) in case of power failure.  I made two calls during the power outage with no problem.I haven't used the battery charger that's part of the main unit yet but I can vouch for it as a backup system for your network.  I recommend this one without any hesitation at all.  It doubles as a surge protector so your apple products should be safe using it.  I use Android and don't spend nearly as much on my phone but I still want it to survive!!  Always a pain to have to break in a new one.  I think the price is worth the piece of mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TDW9QT3SPFZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JHYQNC#wasThisHelpful","R3TDW9QT3SPFZF","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used Brita water pitchers for years without issues and this one is no different.  The main reason I wanted to try this one besides the 10 cup size was the new type filter.  I've had filters stockpiled that I'm just now beginning to run out of and I wanted to see if the new one did indeed do away with the black flakes in the water and if it altered taste or didn't do as good a job as the old.  The flaking has stopped.  There is no discernible taste difference and it filters at the same rate as the old one as far as I can tell, but I must say I never hung around to watch the water flow into the pitcher, I never saw it as an issue at all.Reading other reviews clued me in to the fact that you could refill the old ones.  I never knew that and so it didn't affect me but I think that losing that capability probably would rankle quite a few customers.  All I know is that my water tastes better I feel better using Brita.  Call me an old fool.  I'm deducting one star for the new filters not being refillable but I'm happy enough about the flaking issue being solved to not deduct more.I'll still use the product as I have for the past ten years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HFC4U0O0H31U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VAG8M5I#wasThisHelpful","R2HFC4U0O0H31U","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My step son asked me to get him a modular crimping tool on Amazon because he lost his and he needed it the next day.  He didn't have time with his work schedule (Cable & Fiber Optic Installation Supervisor) to run to the store before then and he gets home too late.  He said try to pick a brand name and I had heard of Jonard  (he had too but he thought them inferior to a couple of others that cost much more).  So I ordered these and had them over-nighted.  I got lucky he was very impressed with them and stunned when I told him what I paid.  He's used them in the field now for over a month and told me last night that he was very happy with them and that they were holding up very well indeed in everyday use.  So I scored one with the step son.He said to say that in his opinion these were as well made as any he's seen on the market and he likes the feel and the balance in the hand.  They cut and strip as well as crimp first time every time for him.  When he's working a business job (installing networking and cable components) that's important to getting a highly complex job done within his allotted time window.He said he'll buy them next time too and other Jonard tools of the trade from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6E59FCLFVPNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIBH018#wasThisHelpful","R6E59FCLFVPNS","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally an AI system that I trust!  This racing set is amazing.  It is very easy to set up.  There's a bit of a learning curve on the controller but after that between you and the AI helping out...the race is on.  This will be the Christmas toy to beat since it's equal fun for adults as well as the little ones (8 & above recommended).  You can race alone with the AI or compete with another racer of course.My grandson and I have been racing for a week now and slowly but surely I'm getting the hang of controlling that car and I may beat him any day now!!!  Of course 10 year olds have plenty of patience with us old timers as long as they're winning and after I master it I'll probably keep him happy with more wins than loses but right now he's the King and I'm the wannabe!!Why an I so enthused you may ask!  Because this is realistic racing....not tied to a slot...or losing power when off the track...in fact you just drive your car back on the track if you slide off!  The battery life is very good (6 of both AAA's and AA's - 12 total).  You won't run out of juice in the middle of the race.  I am not a techie and I don't understand all the principles of design that make this track work so darn well...all I can tell you is that this is it....the home racing track and cars and controllers that everybody has been waiting for since I was a kid!!!Considering how well the system performs and how easy it all is to use it's more than worth the price believe me.  Of all the Vine Items I have ever tried (probably in the hundreds by now) this has been the most fun and the most consistently performing item I've seen...and I've had them all from smokers to fancy televisions and humidifiers just to name a few.I'm buying two more sets for my two other sets of grand kids for Christmas this year before they sell out and I've already ordered expansion packs for the one I have.  I'd advise you to get one now if you know what i mean.Any problems and I'll come back, but honestly, I don't anticipate any as my grand kid and I have put it through enough rough and tumble set-ups and races to see that it's built to last from the track to the cars and everything in between.Tips...you don't have to keep the track flat you can put some bumps in it (put something under it for instance) and that adds to the fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ANQ2Y4FCCUT2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGNT3KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1ANQ2Y4FCCUT2","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bottom Line...Does It Do What It Says It Will Do?  The answer is yes.  It has the most simplified set-up I've ever seen.  Very welcome to a guy who isn't tech savvy.  Out of the box it was up and running in under thirty minutes and the specific problem we had selected the product to solve or at least improve was completely solved.  My set up is a typical Colorado Tri-Level house with bedrooms upstairs and in the basement.  We had always had issue in the two bedrooms at the far back of the upstairs configuration.The unit for reasons of configuration (by that I mean that no middle section of the house is convenient or has the outlets necessary to set up the network)  has to be at the opposite end of the house on the middle floor.  I've been using a Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 Smart wifi router which has done an excellent job to date with the exception of the drop outs and dead spots in the three rooms upstairs.  I am using an extender but it is quirky and works about 85% of the time.  This Titan High Power AC1900 Router has given us faster speeds on wifi than the Nighthawk and has made 4k streaming seamless instead of a buffering nightmare.  I noted some people having trouble with guest networks.  I didn't encounter a problem and you can set up to 8 with specific users.  The instructions included are well laid out and cover everything.The Nighthawk was consistent and only needed to be rebooted on firmware upgrades I'll give it that and I can't speak to the stability of the Titan yet but if it becomes one of those routers where you have to reboot every other day etc. I'll come back and let you know immediately.  It features a 1GB dual-core processor (as does the Nighthawk) but the real boost comes from the 14 amplifiers and the four antenna configuration (guess that's my word of the day).  They deliver.  (on a side note way way off the subject at hand am I the only person on planet Earth that misses Nighthawk TV dinners???)Right now out of the box I'd say it's got to be the easiest to set up I've ever seen and it delivers on it's promise to extend your wi-fi!  If you're moving to 4k or 4k gaming then the improvement in performance in those areas alone is worth the switch.Right now I'm very happy with the results and to repeat the answer to the question:  Yes...The Titan - High Power AC1900 does what it says it will do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H7CZ1LAZ16IR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H4AVT0#wasThisHelpful","R3H7CZ1LAZ16IR","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very nice.  Easy on the eye in the backyard near the garden plot.  Easy to put together.  Stake included.  No problem sticking in ground.It's full of color and the Colorado wind really gives it a workout.  It does look very pretty spinning away in the morning and the evening when I sit out on the deck and drink my 'biotic' yogurt drink.  I'm getting used to it already as part of the landscape.  Right now the retaining wall on the other side of the yard is being rebuilt and all is ugliness galore so it's soothing to have something pretty to look at on the lawn at both those times (before the work crew arrives and after they go).Hard to describe something this pretty and I'm not techie enough to whip out the old phone and take a picture.  I don't think I've ever used the camera on my Fire Phone.  So all I can say is it's much prettier than the picture on the Amazon page.  And virtually silent...or I'm deaf...one of the two.Worth the price if you value this kind of yard ornamentation.  I find movement very relaxing as long as I'm not doing it.I'm buying a couple of these (they have different ones featuring hummingbirds and different things) for the neighbors for Christmas.

"Georgia-Pacific pretty well wrote the book on commercial towel and tissue dispensers and this item is a great home addition for guys who work on their cars or outdoors or any hobby that requires a workroom or garage and results in dirty hands.  My brother has one of these and it is very useful when we're changing sparkplugs or oil or what have you on our autos.  I've envied him this dispenser for about six months now and lo and behold Vine offers me one of my own to try out.  Couldn't have been more pleased.Being able to simply wave your hand and get a pre-detemined size of paper towel (you set the size or leave the default during set up) delivered right into your goop covered hands is a true triumph of modern technology...at least to me it is.  It comes with a roll of paper (which is available right here on Amazon) and set up and programming is easy.  The dispenser holds an additional roll as well and can be set to use up the old roll and move (literally it switches roll positions itself) on to the new one without any having to open and replace.  That means if you're deep in the dirt when the first roll runs out you still have paper towels!!!One piece of advice...hang on to that key...you can't do anything without it and though I'm sure you can get it replaced that means a wait for shipping etc or whatever it takes to get a new one.  The towel rolls are not the old rough feeling tear away kind you find in most commercial bathrooms (remember this is a commercial towel dispenser) but are softer (not too soft) and feel better and are way more absorbent.If you have a business your customers will thank you for using this dispenser and G-P towels (I know I would!)  But I'm really pushing this thing for the garage or workroom in the home itself because it has made life so much easier for the garage mechanic that my brothers and I are.  My brother paid more for his unit (which is the same model) than what Amazon charges so you're getting a deal worth having.  His first roll lasted him five months and he's out in the garage every weekend with his buds and their cars so that should speak to evening out the cost factor.  Remember you're using it in the privacy of your home not a public facility where maybe a 100 people are in and out in a day if not more and the rolls are 500 up to 700 feet  He's also never had a glitch or a torn or distorted towel and the towels tear evenly every time out.So summing up.  The unit is well built and will last.  The mechanism is trouble free and stands up to repeated use (commercial quality).  The rolls are not that expensive and last forever.  After a set up that is carefully explained (instructions included and online videos available too) and not that hard you're up and running.  Priced at around $75 dollars or so with rolls ranging from about $18.00 single to $90 for five figuring conservatively around 25 months for the 5-roll price that's over two years before you have to spend again!!!  All these figures are outside estimates for my family usage so bear that in mind.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGS031U5F5VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123F01LW#wasThisHelpful","R2NGS031U5F5VH","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Epson scores with the best presentation projector out there.  This baby can put a picture up on the wall or screen in a bright room that is just like you're watching an LCD screen.  Unlike the other projectors I've owned this one is light weight and easy to handle.  It comes with every imaginable hookup built in and it can go to sleep in the middle of your presentation and wake instantly up and continue on (I had to turn the other two off).  I also like the fact that you can turn it off quickly when your done and don't have to wait minutes for it to cool down.The picture is stunning and the 1080p accounts for a great deal of that!.  The color brightness is much better than any projector I've seen before in a lit room and in a darkened one will knock your socks off.  You can also go off-pc and use USB sourcing (remarkably easy software download and installation required) for your material (nifty for movies).  I need to get a better screen as it's outperforming my old one but a new one was due anyway.When Vine offered this I had my doubts at this price range and I don't really like Epson printers and I'd never thought of them for office projectors, but now I'm glad I took a chance and tried it out.  It really is just outstanding.  The size is completely portable and I've already indicated that it is amazingly light to offer the performance it does.  It's fully pc integrated meaning your remote works with both for smooth handling of your presentations.  It doesn't come with every cable needed (no HDMI or USB cables included) and that's a wee bit of a downer but the price point reflects the lack of high end accessories.You won't go wrong with this little projector I promise you and it's brighter than those costing twice it's size.

"De'Longhi has a winner with this 5 in 1 ceramic grill.  I love the paninis that come out of here.  I had never had one (panini grill I mean...I've had plenty of paninis)  but my daughter-in-law is Italian and she's been making them at home for years and years so I invited her over here and she tried out the De'Longhi and came away really impressed with the ceramic heating plates...she said they eat more evenly than her iron and they sear magnificently (apparently the most important part of the panini process).As a griddle it's equally excellent I make pancakes to perfection and cook eggs without a problem.  Pressing some bacon is easy enough and if you just want a grilled cheese you can do both sides at once, quick and efficient.  The wife loves the ceramic plates and says also that they heat more evenly than our old combo machine and are a cinch to clean.  The plates are durastone ceramic and are dishwasher safe.  The base unit is really solid and easy to clean.My wife also says that the controls are the most precise she's seen and definitely offer more direct control than our old Cuisinart.As for grilling it came up aces again.  I grabbed two frozen ribeyes out of the freezer about an inch thick and cooked them from frozen to keep the centers juicy and the grill worked like a champ.  No overcooked spots on the surface and medium and juicy in the center.  I really like that convenience and even with the Cuisinart I had trouble getting them to cook evenly over all.Barring any future problems that I will come back and address if they occur I can give this multi-cooker a five star rating without hesitation.  Of course I'm gonna have to buy one now for the Daughter (maybe for Xmas - I'm safe - she never reads these) because she raved and raved about the paninis and I have to admit they were even better than her usual offerings which were good to begin with!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR5C0SNBTR62Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BHEBVA#wasThisHelpful","RR5C0SNBTR62Y","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Uses the double ring holder for the neck tie and the strings are wrap around twice on most folks.The ladies will appreciate the added coverage area as well I think and the apron is well sewn and sturdy.

"Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed is just the best product for what I needed.  I'm having a retaining wall that collapsed on the side of the house rebuilt and that required digging up the lawn ten foot back to find a city power line that couldn't be located (put in in 1973) and had to be moved on top of that. They will be digging six feet down and taking up all that dirt and depositing it on the back lawn which will kill it as well so when Vine offered me this I knew that it was exactly what I needed formulated for the hot/cold cycles we have in North East Colorado.  I don't know if I'll have enough time to seed this year when they're finished as we're rapidly approaching October but I have used nothing but Scott Products for some 18 years now and I'm sold on them.Will report results back here when used either early fall (sometimes it stays hot here through October) or more likely next spring early.

"Not a bad idea but you'll have to keep expanding to keep the fun up.  It's kind of a new take on Laser Tag in some regards with the interactive arm bands and the target stands, but it has pre-programmed missions and such  for the kids to act out their hero antics.  It is a lot of fun for the 8 and 11 year old we have using it at present.Be warned that it takes 12 AA batteries to power up the whole system and that the drain on them is pretty quick.  I think I'd go with rechargeable if I were you.  The pieces are well made and seem fairly durable thus far.  Nothing has broken between the two boys yet and they seem to really enjoy themselves when immersed in play.The system has 25 missions built in and there are things you have to accomplish to progress in the game so bear that in mind with kids who are easily frustrated by such things.  You can download others online, but I haven't tested that yet since they haven't used up what's already programmed.  It is a good idea to be able to download more I think.  Also there supposed to be an app for this too.Of course the real profit for the toy company is in the expansion of the system.  I've already got the eleven year old asking for additional sets and this isn't even available for sale yet!!Over all I'll give it 4 Stars.  I'm deducting one for not having the capacity to recharge everything via USB or adapters.  That and the 12 battery toll it takes.  So far the kids have gotten 2 1/2 sessions max out of batteries so that's an expense you'd better consider too (like I said rechargeable).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R360JB0QL3KFBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCSS5SE#wasThisHelpful","R360JB0QL3KFBC","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great idea and I think that they last as long as my Energizer batteries.  I just had a good test because they had to reroute the power cable to our house due to a retaining wall giving way before the re-construction could begin and I had these in my portable lamp because I had to be in the basement area (with no power - hence no light) while they cut the old cable and laid the new...a total of about an hour and 45 minutes or so and I had dug out an emergency light that uses double 'A' batteries (twelve of them) and drains power like a vacuum cleaner.  Energizers will give just about two hours lamp time (double florescent) with this particular lantern and the GoGreen batteries lasted the hour and 45 minutes without the light weakening in the slightest.  I left them on and at about 1 hour and 55 minutes the light began it's dance with one bulb flickering and going off and the other dimming substantially so they passed my acid test for longevity first time out.The idea that everything about them is renewable is long overdue when it comes to batteries and I'd highly recommend these just on the principle of it's time we started giving back instead of take take take from Mother Earth.Didn't try them in any cameras (don't have any that take them) so I can't vouch for items that have an intense immediate draw down.  Other than that I consider them good to go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HBT0BL35NEA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IWP0C94#wasThisHelpful","R1HBT0BL35NEA6","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I remembered Riptide as a fun action adventure series from the 80's that had that early to mid Eighties cheek and attitude that was the best part of the era.  Joe Penny and Perry King brought that Southern California laid back way of doing things to solving their weekly crimes which always involved sexy girls and guys going about their business in the tightest clothes this side of a Circus.  Including a whole cruise ship crewed by girls that Hugh Hefner himself would have drooled over and Captained by a mama hen played with perfect 'been there done that' street smarts embodied quite handily by Anne Francis, at least in the first season, after that she and the producers parted ways because she wanted more character development and they didn't.  Countering Joe And Perry was Thom Bray playing what was undoubtedly the very first computer nerd on a TV show (now watch...ten other shows will come out of the woodwork with earlier portrayals of computer nerds) and he did a good job of being the innocent among lamb among the lions on the show.  The plots were forgettable, the guests were great fun,  Anne was top notch while she lasted, and the true star of the show the California Lifestyle of the 80s made the audience tune in and have fun.  I did and I think you will too.  Doesn't matter your orientation, remember what I said about everybody was showing off great bods every week...there's something for everyone.  Watching this show is a lark.The early computer equipment and the first computer robot sidekick (besides Robbie in Forbidden Planet and The Robot on Lost in Space) is a hoot and still Thom Bray makes what he does seem logical to the layman.  The cars are great.  And yes ladies there's always the 'hair'!  It was usually non stop action with a little implied romance for our boys Joe and Perry that never went anywhere and a damsel in distress to rescue at the end.  And of course the eternal struggle to get the computer nerd hooked up with someone...anyone!!  Fun Fun Fun a la Beach Boy chic.I recommend it a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2HC9D0WGHUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GNOSHW#wasThisHelpful","RD2HC9D0WGHUC","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a true eccentric British series that Ian McShane did a few years ago (cough cough) that truly captures the British ability to find mystery anywhere.  In this case with an Antique dealer, who in his pursuit of the classic and the profitable usually comes out on the short end of the stick involved in anything from smuggling from the Continent to murder most foul and everything in between.  Shane's performance and those of his superb supporting cast are spot on in keeping the eccentricity level high and the motivated mystery solver's interest at a boil.I loved these when I first discovered them years ago (on PBS I believe...perhaps elsewhere...my memory not being what it used to be) and now that I've had a chance to watch the transfers (very good indeed with both picture and sound - the British always do these things right) to our format across the pond I have rediscovered why that was in the first place.  I think you will too if you're a follower of British mystery, a fan of Ian McShane, or just a simple individual who loves good entertainment.I heartily recommend this series to you.

"This stuff is very good really.  No orange tinge or anything like that.  Considering that I ordered it from vine to play a joke on my lodge brothers I wound up being thoroughly surprised at how good a Tan it delivers.I always go on vacation and just stay home and my lodge brothers always talk about pasty face and his two weeks on the dark side of the moon every year...so this year when I saw this item offered on Vine I thought I'll kill two birds with one stone.  Try out a new product and pull a cool joke on my brothers in the bargain.  I have seen these tanning products and sprays on people before here in Colorado and they always look fake no matter how well the people apply them so I thought I'd wind up looking the same but good enough for my joke.  The thing that drew me to it was its claim that it doesn't wind up looking orange color and fake.  The price is up there but I can attest to its advertising veracity.First off you need to know how to apply it properly.  The first thing I learned is that to apply this properly with the best chance at success you need to order a special mitt for applying (wouldn't try this without it if I were you - and it's also available on Amazon at a good price so I'd order them together)  I suggest you watch a couple of the readily available U-Tube videos on the subject of tanning solution application.  I did and that helped me avoid the first time users pitfalls.  I had my daughter (used to work in a beauty and tanning salon) help me get those hard to reach spots and made sure my application was evenly distributed.  My daughter kept me reminded of elbows, knees and ankle areas and making sure they were evening covered.  You apply it to clean dry skin and then wait at least three hours while the tan 'develops' before you can shower.  That's all there is to it and I was stunned to see myself in the mirror looking like I'd spent a month on a tropical island!There was no orange tinge of any kind and the application developed into a dark tan that looked absolutely stunning.  The Moroccan Oil in the lotion has a clean light scent that I liked.  My brothers were taken in by it and none of them even questioned my story of cruising the Caribbean in style.  Of course I've come clean at the lodge, but the tan lingers on and is fading evenly as well.  No blotchy retreat (almost as important as the initial tanning results to me).Bottom line this product produces a dark even tan that looks completely natural on me.  I recommend it without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6YPX1HRGA3NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIQALAC#wasThisHelpful","R6YPX1HRGA3NQ","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well built smoker.  Some thought has gone into its construction and design and it shows.  From the front mounted controls to the remote control you have complete control over the smoking process.  4 racks if you're cooking ribs or anything without too much height and plenty of room when you remove one and stuff in some butt roasts.I fired it up for the all important seasoning session before you can actually use it with all accessories in place with no water and no wood chips by pressing the temp button and then the up arrow until  I had selected 275 degrees and then pressing the time button and using the up and down arrows to set 2 hours for the heating time and then I left it alone until the time had passed.  I was still detecting a bit of a chemical smell and vapors coming out so I added another hour and came back and turned it off and let it cool.  That's all there is to seasoning it.First up was two 6 pound chickens (brined overnight) with the legs tied and my favorite rub applied dry to all parts of the chicken inside and out.  Legs tied and placed directly on the the second and fourth racks with the first and third removed and set aside.  Put the probe target temperature at 165 and used the temperature probe placed in the breast of the top chicken and let em go.  4 & 1/2 hours later they're done (the temp probe said 160 but an instant probe used on both chickens gave 167 and 165 bottom to top so out they came and sat loosely covered in foil for twenty minutes before chowing down.  I had used a combo of hickory and cherry chips and the smoker kept a good quantity of smoke coming out till I turned it off.  Must say everybody was ecstatic with the flavor and the juiciness.  Didn't even need any BBQ sauce.  Fed four people and had one wing left over...so not too shabby if I do say so myself.I like the fact that the excess drip pan is contained on the bottom right side of the unit and pulls out for easy dumping and cleaning.  I'm not too thrilled that the built in drip tray over the heating and wood unit (separate from the bottom drip tray) empties into the water pan before excess drains out the bottom of the unit to the built in drip pan as that defeats the purpose of the water as it gets covered in oil and won't evaporate properly.  It is stressed that in this cooker you don't need the water or to replace chips every hour (the wood pan has a special heavy duty lid that diffuses the smoke as it comes out and maintains a steady heat on the embers (it lasted five hours without refilling so I guess it works)...But I like my water for moistness so I'm deducting a star for that design flaw in my opinion.  You can put a drip pan under the meat but that takes up one shelf.  (pointing out however that the chickens came out moist and perfectly cooked - the problem is I don't know how much of that was the brining and how much the cooker)Over all I've smoked several racks of ribs in foil with holes to allow the smoke access and one 8 pound brisket that I foiled for two hours at the end  as we wanted pull apart as opposed to sliced brisket this time around and I needed to get it up to 190 or so.  This is a new model and there's not a lot of info out there or recipes specific to it but I just used my smoker knowledge from the last 35 years and everything turned out fine...if you're a newbie you'll find plenty of tips and recipes for electric smokers in general on the internet that can be applied to smoking in this unit as well.I also think the light design is flawed as it only illuminates the interior when the door is open and not while cooking.  But then the window smokes up anyway and it's hard to see.  But at least you can see any flare ups.  The remote's distance isn't all that great but if you leave it indoors in a place you can check every hour it'll tell you the temp of the meat as it cooks with the probe.  Just remember to check as you near the temp with other instant read thermometers in several places in your meats because you have to watch for even cooking.  A good tip to remember when cooking different meats with different times to put the longest on top and proceed down from there.  That way the last item won't be dripping all over your already semi-cooked other items.  The smoker has built in vents and nothing about it is made cheap.  No cheap plastic with everything I handled made of metal.  It's very well insulated which makes it do its job extremely well.Next up is my favorite.  Beef Jerky and all indications are that I'll have some really good results with this excellent smoker.  Clean up is a chore, but that's true of them all.  It has back wheels for rolling.  Just remember to empty the water and the drip pans before you tilt it to move.  Compared to Masterbuilts I""d say this one has a slight edge with the smoke pan system that doesn't require adding wood (you can if want to though...just remember to wear heavy High Temp Resistant mitts).I'm buying one for my daughter and her husband since they're drooling over everything I pull out of it and I'd like to have some leftovers sometimes!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GH4BJIRF7EK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMRXYCE#wasThisHelpful","R3GH4BJIRF7EK6","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this in one night!  Miss Smith has always fascinated me as an actress despite my being a Colonist since The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie where she gave one of the most subtle performances I have ever witnessed.  The novel from which the story comes (written by Muriel Spark) is a miracle of brevity and wit and Miss Smith brought every bit of it and just a touch more to the screen in her Oscar winning performance.  She is just the Olivier of Actresses as far as I am concerned and this biography (written with her co-operation) beguiles as much as one of her screen performances.  It is both informative and highly entertaining.  Filled with insights and delightful observations.Dame Maggie is still astounding audiences and other actors alike in Downton Abbey of course as it approaches its sixth and final season and winning new fans from around the world of all ages.  So now's your chance to learn her story and take that knowledge back to her performances for fresh insights.I cannot recommend this biography highly enough.

"Excellent roll about or carry tote for your laptop (mine's a 15 1/2 inch Toshiba) with many pockets and padded places for your tablet and its accessories.  It's not too bulky or heavy.  It wheels very well and doesn't snag or drag.  The handle is telescopic of course and when down hides behind a zipper compartment so that usuing it as a carry tote is much easier and you won't accidentally grab the handle and wind up with your bag on the floor looking silly.  Amazon basic products take the high road on construction, utility and design and while they're not top flight they are upper tier.  For this kind of quality in stitching and design I would have expected to have to pay quite a bit more than the asking price.I am very pleased with it and now that I'm back in school at (%$# years of age*)  I find I can keep my combo laptop/tablet and bookds and various and sundry supplies in one case and take them all to class without having to carry it the whole way...very important at this age.  Then when I am in the school milieu I can handle carrying it from class to class with no difficulty.I would imagine the same would apply to the modern student of proper age as well.

"It's okay.  I wouldn't give it any great kudos.  The scent is too light to last long.  The moisturizing is just so-so in my opinion and my skin didn't feel silky smooth after application (in all fairness tho I'm in my sixties and my skin is sandpaper rough to begin with).  Bottom line I might or might not buy it again.  It does moisturize some and the grand kids like the aroma while it lasts.  So I won't totally trash it.

"Does the job well.  I perimeter sprinkled this on my front lawn because our yard is the only one not xeriscaped on the block and we're right in the middle.  Needless to say we get more than the average share of dogs and cats using the facilities.  I waited a week to test this and my security cam caught all the walkers with their dogs in the evening and early in the morning.  In defense of some they do carry the required baggies and scoop...but most don't...and don't care what their animals leave.  I was very pleased to see that from the tiny toys to the large protectors the dogs uniformly refused to cross the line onto the lawn or the big tree in the middle.That's a 100 percent success rate that I observed there on the cam and I was pretty darn impressed.  The container will treat 300 square feet and for my use of about 75 square feet that means I'll get at least three more applications out of it.  The size of your lawn of course dictates your usage.  It is going into the middle of the second week now and I watched the security cam recording again this morning and saw that the animals are still avoiding the lawn much to their masters' chagrin.  I guess now they have to go three blocks to the park.It doesn't appear to have any really dangerous chemicals and the warnings only warn off moderate eye irritation and skin sensitivity...so don't get it on you...just the grass...or mulch...or whatever.  You can spot apply or do the whole lawn but so far I've warded off the pets with a three feet wide perimeter application.  Haven't seen any cats either...they are always setting off the security light at night and I fast forwarded through last evening and didn't see the light come on all night except for once.  Of course an animal being chased as cats often are aren't going to worry about your repellent and that may have accounted for the once it was triggered.  If the animals are on the sidewalk they are out of range of the motion detector.Overall I am very pleased.  It says it'll last 60 days barring frequent rain (which we've had all summer here in Colorado - Sorry California) and I'm planning on laying more down at the end of the week unless my cam tells me otherwise.I can easily recommend this product and if there are any added problems I'll come back and let you know.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG7KNMB552BQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W5TRG5Q#wasThisHelpful","RG7KNMB552BQB","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Daughter has trouble every summer with itchy skin.  She was ecstatic to find this solution.  Despite the fact that we use a swamp cooler to cool the house (about an 80% savings over conventional air conditioning BTW) she has had this problem with dry skin for the past five years ( I guess because her job keeps her outdoors a lot) and Curel Itch Defense Soothing Moisturizing spray has put an end to it.  After applying the spray I let her use from Vine she now keeps one of these in her bathroom at all times and one in her car.

"These are very well made measuring spoons and the magnets work extremely well for holding the set together.  Well worth the price and extremely convenient to have both the oval and the rounded measuring on each spoon.  I have used a plastic set for three years and the other day two of them snapped in the middle during the same recipe.  Guess the plastic hardened and became brittle (hand washed only).  So I decided to go with metal and this set fits the bill in spades.They look like they'll last a whole lot longer than the plastic ones and they don't bend easily (tho any spoon will bend if you put it to too hard a task).I highly recommend them and if there are any developing problems I'll come back and update my review!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVY89BNWTPBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GAQKKW#wasThisHelpful","R2WVY89BNWTPBF","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very convenient and the grand kids love to be able to use the Keurig of course.  Having the bulk of the flavors be their favorite candy flavors is a plus too and there's something for everybody including this old codger (I'm partial to the Boston Bean Midnight Hot Cocoa myself).  It's a good way to get a variety without having to buy them all individually.  Works out to around 50 cents a pod so keep that in mind.Over all I""d recommend it to keep around for convenience sake and the kiddies. The flavors are fresh tasting and true to their names.  I didn't find any duds in the selection itself and since I had to review it I tried one of each.Makes that cocoa break or bedtime treat very simple to serve.

"Very lightweight.  Very small.  If you're cooking for one or two this will do.  You can't use high heat or you'll ruin the ceramics.  It is decidedly nonstick however and what you cook will not stick.  That is the only plus I see to it.  It's too light to hold its place on the stove and in my house it gets knocked out of place on a busy stove.  I won't hold size against it because that's what Amazon sent me to try out.As far as it goes I am impressed with it's nonstick quality and cleanup is a snap indeed.  I'm deducting one star because in my opinion being too light is just as bad as being too heavy.  But I imagine for one or two people with any kind of arthritis or handling problems then that weight is going to be a blessing and it will will sit flat and stay put if you don't knock it.Update:  My wife has pointed out to me that the skillet is not light weight and in fact has quite some heft for its size and will keep its place on the stove unless I'm a complete klutz (her words - not mine) but she also thinks it won't be a burden to arthritic hands because the heft is relative to the size...so I'm already coming back and updating my review!  She also said it's quite handy for small amounts of browning and such for recipes and things like that as well as cooking two or three eggs...she thinks the size is a most convenient addition to her skillet collection.  She also said it is high quality construction and she doesn't expect it to fall apart or chip etc.  So...so much for my expertise in the kitchen folks because I KNOW she knows what she's talking about.  Hence my adding back the star and shutting up.That's my review.

"Ziploc has made this process so simple.  I use my regular old Hoover upright vacuum and it sucks the air right out.  The seams seem strong and I put 8 blankets in and got a package about two blankets thick.  I've never used this kind of storage system before, but it is so simple to operate that I sure wish I'd known about them sooner.You put your items in and zip lock all the air you can out then you affix the nozzle of your vacuum to the valve and suck out all the rest.  Cap it and you've got water proof dust proof storage that shrinks the volume down to about 25 or 30 percent.

"Belkin's The Best.  This apple MFi-Certified cable both syncs and charges and it ends that problem with never having a cord long enough to do what you want.  At 4 feet it's plenty long enough to reach from my pc to my bed in my bedroom which is pretty close quarters these days since I gave the rest of the house over to the kids and the grand kids when they moved in and moved to the basement (familiar story these days).  The cord is braided which makes it more manageable and easier to handle.  The tips are metal of course and well connected.  Unless you abuse it because, face it, the nature of these things makes them susceptible to pulling apart because of how they're used and the world's need to do things quickly when care should be taken.  So if you use it reasonably carefully (I'm not saying it's delicate because it appears to be really well made) it should last a long time.  But if you yank and pull on it or twist it a lot then it's probably going to ruin it or the usb connection you're using.  Yes...I'm speaking to you...Grand Kids!I've had no problem with either syncing or charging and you can plug it into a wall adapter too.  I'm very happy with it.

"Onkyo continues to upstage the competition.  I was so impressed with the TX-NR636 and the new Dolby Atmos that I retired my $2000 Marantz SR6009 in favor of the overall peerless performance of the Onkyo.  Today's receivers have to be so much more than just audio processors now, what with video processing becoming an inherent part of their job.  At the end of my comments I will add some technical information for the techies but for the average middle of the road user like myself I must say that this unit has all that I want in processing capabilities and the overall sound performance has been superior to that of the Marantz.  I am in that age group that has trouble with dialogue when viewing movies on a home theater set up and the most amazing aspect of this receiver is that I can follow the dialogue of any movie I've watched so far and lose none of the impact of the audio decoding when it comes to aural effects.  A lot of people look upon the Dolby Atmos system as a gimmick but I find it offers a real dimension added to the viewing experience and I'm using the extra speakers that sit on top of your floor speakers and bounce the effect off the ceiling instead of utilizing ceiling speakers that were not feasible in the basement area I use for the Theater set-up and I really can't tell a difference between them and the ceiling mounts in my bedroom.  I'm looking forward to the new DTS-X and it's added theater effects that will be able to utilize more aural expansion with the coming 4K discs and 4K blu-ray players (coming later this year).  The video processing is astounding on my LG 4K tv with the upconversion of some dvds rivaling current blu-rays.  This Onkyo TX-NR646 is even better than the 636 in that regard.I replaced the TX-NR636 with this unit because I wanted to be ready for the new DTX-X (can't review that aspect yet as it included in an upcoming firmware upgrade).  I have also prepared for the new 4K experience by upgrading my TV and Sound System accordingly.  All I can say about the new unit is that it works just as well as the old one and adds two HDMI inputs that I badly needed.  Onkyo hasn't skimped on this unit and that should be obvious in it's going head to head with the higher end Marantz and coming out on top!I'm a very happy camper with the sound I'm getting in all quarters, music, movie, streaming.  Here's some techie facts from Onkyo:DTS:X SupportDolby Atmos Support170 W per ChannelHi-Current Amp Design for Authentic Sound ReproductionHDMI 8 In / 2 Out Including 1 FrontHDMI & HDCP 2.2 for 4K UltraHDBuilt-in Bluetooth & Wi-Fi with Pandora, Spotify, and AirPlayDSD 5.6 MHz, FLAC 192 kHz/24-bit Hi-Res Audio Capable384 kHz/32-bit Hi-Grade DACAccuEQ Room Acoustic CalibrationDTS:X is a next-generation object-based surround sound technology that includes height to deliver a fully-immersive listening experience. DTS:X provides listeners the ultimate in flexibility, immersion, and interactivity. Unlike channel-based audio, you will be able to personalize your audio experience. For example, you can turn up JUST the dialog within a mix. DTS:X allows you to customize to your room layout as well as control dialog and dynamic range.From the quietest dialog passages to booming action scenes, Onkyo's exclusive amplification technology dramatically enhances the audio dynamics of your movies, music and games.This Wide Range Amplifier Technology (WRAT) is at the core of Onkyo's signature sound. The innovative amplifier design is comprised of three key elements:(1) a low negative feedback design for punchy, true-to-life sound, and cleaner audio across the frequency ranges;(2) closed groundloop circuits to reduce individual circuit noise and keep the ground potential free of distortion; and(3) a high instantaneous current to handle big dynamic gains.This allows massive power at 170 W/Ch (6 Ohms, 1 kHz, 0.9% THD, 1 Channel Driven, FTC) and 100 W/Ch (8 Ohms, 20 Hz20 kHz, 0.08% THD, 2 Channels Driven, FTC).I will add that it has a phono input and vinyl sounds incredible with full warm sound filling the room.  I haven't heard a better vinyl set-up on any other receiver I've ever owned.Overall I give the TX-NR646 my highest rating without hesitation and when I have experienced the new DTS-X I will come back an make my comments on it here as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315I3WEPD829D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WM1V9KU#wasThisHelpful","R315I3WEPD829D","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Remarkably Clever Design!  The strainer is built into the top of the container (with large comfortable handle) and bits and pieces are extracted as the  juices pour in and then when it cools enough to separate the fat from the liquid it does so via a stopper in the bottom of the bowl which lets the liquid out and prevents the fat from mixing in with it which sometimes happens with the spout from the bottom models no matter how well you tilt and turn it.  I don't usually go for kitchen gadgets but this one is an improvement over the old designs that is light years ahead of the competition!!I have been using it regularly with flawless results.  My gravy is now truly fat free and my au jus is flavorful without being heavy.  It's great!!  It's BPA free too.  The baster is nice and long, longer than my other two standard ones and comes with two interchangeable tips that brush on the basting liquid or rains it down like a shower head or you can forego either one and just baste the old fashioned way with the open end.I don't know how I cooked without it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21FDMJILMV4NS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG6FQCI#wasThisHelpful","R21FDMJILMV4NS","A3MQ15651KGVLJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3MQ15651KGVLJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own both the black pair and the grey pair. I like the quality- soft, comfortable, not too thin and not too thick a material. They don't feel itchy or too heavy during my workouts, and believe me, I sweat! They're not the most form-fitting cropped pants in the world, but don't expect them to be all flowy, either. They're sort of in-between. The waist could stand a bit more spandex to stay in place. As you work out and sweat, the pants definitely start to droop a bit. However, I have a small waist for my frame and I know this can add to that issue.An Important Sizing Note: I bought them within a couple of days of each other. The grey pair fits me well in the waist. The black pair fits much more loosely in the waist, and looser overall. However, both run small for the size that they are listed as. Penningtons 4X (which according to their website is the same as 28/30) actually fits more like a 24/26. I wear a 24/26 in every brand out there- Lee (Jeans), Woman Within, Jockey, Levi's, etc. I haven't gained weight, as I just bought pants in these other brands which fit like a glove in a 26. (Although my waist is smaller and would be better with a 24, I need a 26 to accommodate my heavier legs.) I have a couple of Penningstons shirts, too- they also run small. I wear a 20/22 in shirts, or 2X in most brands. Penningtons, I always have to size up to a 3X. So be aware of this when shopping for yourself.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R133K64SEO6WDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T7403BQ#wasThisHelpful","R133K64SEO6WDF","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An excellent bag. It has enough pockets, all of which are a good size, but not so many that you cannot find what you're looking for easily. The side pockets are lined with mesh and zip up, allowing room for a water bottle, sunglasses, or a cell phone more safely than just a slip-in pocket. The outside pockets are designed well. I keep my wallet in one, and basic little toiletries (lip balm, pressed powder compact, etc.) in the other. The one outer pocket has card slots and slots for a small cell phone or similar item, although I really don't use them much. The zippers are all nice and strong. The main zipper has a mechanism for locking onto the purse itself, a nice safety feature. The color of the purse is true to what I saw online, a stone color that goes well with silver, beige, grey, taupe and so on. The strap is easily adjustable, stronger than what you could typically find of a purse in this price range. I could use it easily as a shoulder bag, but typically wear it cross-body. The purse is large enough to hold what most women need to carry, not one of those crazy bags where you can't fit in a wallet, purse, cell phone, and water bottle (for example). It would hold a tablet or a paperback book in the center. There is a mesh-lined pocket on the interior of the main section. I don't mind canvas bags. The stone color helps keep it looking a bit more neutral and elegant, not so sporty that you can't get away with it in an office setting or from day-to-day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODO67P8PDM05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C75L4NS#wasThisHelpful","R2ODO67P8PDM05","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Others have reviewed the workout itself, its layout and length, in other places here on Amazon. Just be aware that this and some of the other FIRM DVDs put out have worn out fast.  I used Super Cardio approximately once a week for the last four months. I keep my DVDs in a case where they are protected and do not rub up against other DVDs. There are no visible scratches on the DVD whatsoever. However, after ""sticking"" on a particular frame in places since about a month after purchasing, it now will not pause at all onscreen. It also will not go forward to the next scene or flip back to the beginning of the chapter with my arrow buttons on the remote. Nor does it budge if I go to the DVD player itself and hit the buttons on the front panel. The same problem existed in my portable DVD player, too, so it wasn't my player acting up. If I get a sip of water or need a second to put away a piece of workout equipment, I cannot pause the DVD now! I have to go to the menu and manually select the next scene from the menu. Very aggravating when you're trying to keep the heart rate up during a cardio workout. I have no kids or anything that get into my DVDs and scratch them up or anything. I've had this happen with four or five different FIRM workouts now. Whether that is just the nature of DVDs one uses as often as once a week or so, I don't know, but my VHS tapes lasted a lot longer than this! Disappointing.

"Love, love, love this watch.  It keeps flawless time.  It came with the time and date already set for me.  Battery, fine.  Inexpensive but TOUGH.  I put it through the wringer from dawn till dusk each and every day.  I found the manual online for free, and learned how to change the time that way when Daylight Savings Time came about.  It's not full of bells and whistles, just a nice simple alarm and stopwatch and timekeeping piece here.  (I have enough bells and stuff on my cell phone...)  WOW, does this fit a real woman's life!  No more taking off my watch for every workout, hand-washing, laundry duty, dishwashing, shower, swim, long session doing homework or office work online, etc.  SOOOO many watches are uncomfortable to work, work out, or sun oneself in.  They get too hot, don't ""breathe"", aren't easy maintenance...this is.  I've owned watches Ecclissi, Burberry, Timex, and more, but this Armitron watch is the one that I reach for first thing every morning.  It's become a part of me.  And unlike the leather- (which apparently doesn't like sweat or water or reality) or metal- (which doesn't like water, cold, heat, sun, and more...) strap watches that I took off in frustration, this stays on until the day is through.  Now it drives me nuts if my watch isn't on!When women say this watch is too tiny, I'm confused.  I ain't thin.  I'm 5'7"", muscular, a size 14/16, my wrist is about 6 and 3/4"" (in other words, not small by female standards)- and this watch fits me grand.  The face is the size of most women's watches, so it's not teeny.  I can wear the watch tighter, up at the wrist where it meets my hand, or I can wear it further down on the forearm (as needed).  The resin is flexible and comfy, but doesn't stretch out so much that it loses shape or anything.  It's a barely-there watch, in the sense that it never snags anything or feels heavy and clunky.  I once had a big manly sports watch that was pretty darn awesome with bells and whistles and larger size, but it would catch on sweaters, doors, and more.  I was constantly taking it to the jeweler to get the pin put back in it (after a big metal door would rip the watch off my clumsy wrist as I struggled with my 30-lb. backpack), or getting the battery changed.  Not with this, it's as carefree a watch one can get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HCN8RZBKGWRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J30ERI#wasThisHelpful","R3HCN8RZBKGWRD","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the 18-lb. bar.  The padding on it is great.  The weight is balanced.  It's very comfy on my shoulders while doing squats or other lower body work, and it's comfortable in the hands for upper body work.  The only reason I wouldn't give this five stars is the SMELL!  It's a weird, strong chemical, rubber smell.  It gave me an awful headache the first few days I had it.  I bought it over two months ago, and I can still smell the chemicals in it faintly!  So be aware that while this is a comfortable padded bar to use in place of a barbell with plate weights, the odor is a bit of a concern from a health standpoint (although I'm not losing sleep over it).

"Like probably every coffee lover on the planet, I naturally prefer to grind my own beans and have my coffee made in an expensive machine. Add a touch of heavy cream and a spoon of raw sugar, and I'm a happy girl.  However, in real life and clothed in my pajamas at some ungodly hour of the morning, what I can accomplish with one eye still half-shut and my brain still half-asleep is to make this in those most decent drip coffeemaker I could locate.  It is the kind of coffee in flavor and aroma difficult to find easily nowadays.  I remember well the era when good coffee could be found within the average supermarket aisle, even in a can of coffee that didn't break the bank.  I'm also old enough to remember when coffeemakers were made on my side of the pond, and lasted twenty years or more.  (My great-grandparents wouldn't have tolerated buying a new coffeemaker every three or four years like I have to do, but that's another story entirely.)

"Nice-looking, but sizing is off and comfort is just not there. Easy to walk in for a heel, but more cushioning and better attention to shaping a shoe correctly would set Aerosoles apart. I wear a 10B in most shoes. At most a 10.5B, and then I normally add a heel snug for pumps (for comfort and better heel fit). Unfortunately, the 10.5B hurts my big toes and feels a bit tight across the top of my toes, too. Oddly, I still had to make the strap quite tight to fit this when trying them on, and the heel was loose even though my big toes were being smushed. This despite the fact that I just bought another 10.5 in an Aerosoles loafer, which were too big and require me to wear socks with them to fit properly! This shoe looks cute, but feels like a cheap shoe.

There is also very little bleed-through of those Sharpies to the next page.  The lack of aggravation is worth the wait of shipping time, short as it is.  I have yet to experience any ripped holes, poorly printed lines, lack of holes, or anything else I've read here.  I just ordered my third pack, and I will keep coming back for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCPC2R0CRM4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IDV8#wasThisHelpful","R2DCPC2R0CRM4V","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute pink case that allows me to angle my cell phone on my desk or nightstand instead of just leaving it flat. I like this angling feature a lot, because I use my cell phone as my clock during much of the day and night. I can have my cell phone angled high or low, depending upon how I fix the bend in the case. This is good, because of course the light changes as hours pass and different angles are best. The magnetic part is nice and strong, but not obnoxiously hard to open. The holder for the cell phone itself (it's the black part within the case) is perfectly good. No problems using volume keys or anything.The only problem I've had is when taking photos- there is a distinctly pink cast over the entire frame, and I've found no way to overcome this flaw. I have to take the camera out of the case in order to take photos without this pink cast. I don't think it's my fault, as the case is perfectly lined up with the phone. For this reason, I must give the product four instead of five stars. Sometimes I'm trying to capture active photos with moving targets, and this aspect of the case is quite inconvenient.The wristlet part is very large, and would fall off of my arm quite easily. But the case protects my phone well in my purse or backpack.There are only a couple of minor changes that I would make to this product, things that I'm not deducting any stars for but am notating just for feedback. One is to have a belt clip on the outside, and I'd be willing to pay a few dollars more to have a good on this case. I really miss that clip, which I had on my Android Smartphone cover. Sometimes I'm not bringing my purse with and having no belt clip is a nuisance However, that is not this product's fault- it's just my personal preference. The other thing would be to either have a dedicated loop to put the stylus in, or to have the stylus be magnetic, so that it stuck to this case automatically. I like the stylus a lot, and hope I don't lose it, since neither one of the options is available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HPGPM487EQFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM33WB8#wasThisHelpful","R1HPGPM487EQFM","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Washing floors went from being a huge ordeal with a bucket and lots of rinsing to being a five-minutes-long, very easy task.  I have an older apartment with two bathrooms and a kitchen/laundry room off of a long hallway, all possessing the original white vinyl flooring.  (I didn't choose the color or the style of floor, I assure you!)  As everyone who has to clean them knows, white and flooring are two words that should not go together!  I have a moody set of knees and a cranky back.  Washing floors is so easy and thorough with this large mop head and the accompanying Sh-Wipes, though, I could do that chore every day if I wanted to.  I never have to scrub floors on my hands and knees, because using this mop once or twice a week after vacuuming first keeps the flooring looking great.  This mop also has a low profile, so I can easily get in tight spaces, ones that my old sponge mop couldn't quite reach.  It will even clean part of the floor under the stove and refrigerator, due to this feature.  I can definitely see why some of the housecleaning pros use this mop.This is a great mop, with only one issue.  The Sh-Mop is threaded into a Versapole.  The part where it screws into place on the handle comes loose and causes the mop head to turn and twist, leaving me unable to control the direction the mop head goes in.  However, some extra-strong duct tape solves that twisting and turning problem.  Otherwise, this has been a fantastic product.  I have had mine for several years, and I've never had to replace the mop itself.  Amazingly, I've also had some of the same thick, white cotton terry cloths that they sell (the Sh-Wipes) for that same length in time.  They don't get threadbare for a very long, even with weekly washing.  I take good care of them; I wash them in hot water, Clorox bleach, and powdered Tide.  They come out white again and like new from the washer and dryer every time.  For sanitary purposes, I also love that I'm not using and re-using the same old mop head- every time I wash my floors, it's like they're getting a brand-new mop.  When the Sh-Wipe gets dirty, I simply replace it with a fresh one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2USFF87XA7V4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001PFKI24#wasThisHelpful","R2USFF87XA7V4D","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this originally because I am a) on a very tight budget and this is reasonable in price, and b) it had good reviews on every site I went to.  I've used Jergens (and despised it, because the product broke me out and I am NOT acne-prone); BE Faux Tan (overpriced and underwhelming); St. Tropez (which I love but cannot currently afford for the amount I go through during the spring and summer), and a few other products over the years that probably aren't even made anymore.  One was from Avon, many moons ago.  I would say overall, this one really is the best.  Even if I had the money to go back to buying St. Tropez, I probably would not do so, although ST gives a bit more brown and natural a tan once the color is well-established.I am fair-skinned with a cool undertone (pink/blue), have turquoise-blue eyes, and dark blonde hair.  I don't mind my pale skin in the fall and winter, but come spring, this is my go-to product for a faux tan.  I do not use this product to the point where I will look like a Brazilian babe.  It probably COULD get me that dark, but in the past I've found going that dark to be very odd-looking with my natural eye and hair coloring.  This product turns me from wearing the very lightest and cool- or neutral-toned (never warm-toned) foundation sold into a medium-skinned lady, and very quickly at that.  So that you have an example of the skintone difference- Revlon Shade 001 PhotoReady Foundation, typically not available in stores because it is such a light shade that few people wear it, is what I have to buy normally.  If I don't allow it to dry an hour or more (and I often don't), I may add a drop or two of Revlon SkinLights in Bronze to Revlon's PhotoReady Shade 006 Foundation to up the ""bronze-y"" factor.  If I apply two coats in one day, it will turn me truly ""tan"", which for me means I'm wearing Revlon's PhotoReady Shade 008 Foundation.  If you are not starting out with ber-pale skin like me and/or you are sunning outside regularly, you'll probably get quite a bit darker.Re-applying will depend on how dark you want to stay, how active you are, how dark you are to begin with, how much you bathe and/or sweat, etc.  To stay what is, for me, really tan, daily re-application would be required, twice daily on the face (yes, I'm that pale).  I'm fine with staying in the medium range, though, and so the following is what keeps me in that skintone.  I find that I must re-apply this more often on the face, tops of my feet, and my hands.  On my face, I typically apply it once a day, prior to applying my makeup in the a.m.  Because the hands are washed more often, then of course this will fade a bit faster on most people there- for me, it means I re-apply it every two to three days there.  The tops of my feet also fade more, probably because I work out daily and the friction of my workout shoes and socks rubs the product off somewhat.  While on the body I can get away with once a week application, the tops of my feet also need retouching every three days or so.I bought three bottles back in early April.  It is now the end of August, and I'm using the third bottle that came in April now.  This is with daily use on the face and one to two times a week elsewhere- so I'd say it lasts awhile!  Considering the cost, that is very impressive.One thing I ADORE about this product is how little it transfers onto clothing, sheets, towels, and other such items once it's allowed to dry on the skin.  Most self-tanners I've used leave a terrible amount of bronze coloring on pillowcases and such.  Not this!  Again, for the price that is incredibly nice.This product does have some drawbacks:1) The smell while it's drying and for several hours afterwards on the skin.  I don't notice any bad smell out of the bottle; only once it's sat on the skin for a bit.  If you just use it on the face (which I do almost daily, and it never breaks me out or clogs my pores), the smell is hardly even there.  But put it all over, and you'll detect it.  Have the perfume and scented deodorant ready!  It's not the worst I've ever used, but it is especially harsh on application day, and can make me a little self-conscious if I put it on the day of a big event or a date.  I do not notice it the days after application, though.But that said, I've never had any complaints from anyone about the scent of it when they're around me, so maybe it's not bad.  I do know it is FAR better than Bare Escentuals Faux Tan (which is far more costly and fades much worse than this), which was so bad that the second any water hit my skin (shower, swimming pool, etc.) the fake tan product odor became INSTANTLY apparent!  Talk about nerve-wracking!2)  The fade can be patchy.  Again, not the worst I've seen, but it's not the best.  I'd say that St. Tropez's self-tanner was the best-smelling, had the most natural color, and faded a bit better than this.  However, it is FAR more expensive and doesn't get me as dark nearly as fast as this does.  It also doesn't dry as fast as Banana Boat's, and wears off A LOT more on sheets and clothing.3) If not completely dry yet (as in not already on the skin SEVERAL hours), it will stain your towels and such when you dry your hands after washing.  It does stain my towel a bit at night after I've removed my makeup and washed my face, but then I do apply the Banana Boat tanner daily to my face, so I can't complain too much.4) While I like the look healthy and glowing in this, and everyone else who's seen me in it says I look great with it on, I cannot say it is quite the same as a natural tan.  I do not get the, ""Where did you go to the beach?""-type comments with this very often.  I try my best between this and my makeup to make it look natural, and I get very close, but I know it's not quite like a real suntan.  It is a bit more medium-toned, a tad more orange, and not quite as natural-looking as a real tan on ME as a real tan would be.  (This may not be true for those with a different natural coloring to start with, though.)  The closest to that real suntan look which I've found is to apply St. Tropez's self-tanner, with a tad of BE's ""A Little Sun"" sprinkled on the skin for that red-brown touch on the shoulders and other places where the sun hits the heaviest.  However, that look costs a lot more to obtain!  This and my current makeup gives me more of a look like the fitness-buff ladies get in Oxygen magazine.  It can't make me look like Christie Brinkley in ""National Lampoon's Vacation""- I wish it did! :DI hope that this review will help other fair-skinned souls out there if they want to buy this or not. :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMVSS9ALU2NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G7PPNI#wasThisHelpful","R1AMVSS9ALU2NH","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful bra, and it fits okay- the cups might be just a tad small or low for the cup size advertised.  It's not a super deep-cut bra, but it's certainly not high up on the bust, either.  However, the band size fits perfectly.  It is a lovely-looking bra in Black, which is the shade that I got.  It is also very comfortable, yet is also supportive.I have broad, well-developed shoulders which bra straps can almost never fall off of.  It is very important to note this, because the straps are set quite far apart on this bra and that affects fit and shape on different ladies.  While this bra fits me well, that may not be true for a lady with a different build than I have.  If you have small and/or sloped shoulders, this bra might not be the best for you.

"This review is mostly about the Gain Original Scent.  I like to use Febreze Fabric Refresher in the same ways as everyone else:1) To freshen up the bed linens each day, so that it seems more like I just put fresh sheets on the bed.2) To finish off weekly housecleaning.  Naturally, it's especially nice to spray on just-vacuumed upholstered furniture, those throw pillows everyone has somewhere in their house, coverlets and blankets, fabric (not vinyl) shower curtains, the curtains hung up at windows, the dining room chairs which have cushioned seats, the rocking chair cushion set, etcetera.3) To use right before company comes over, making the house smell clean, fresh, and homey.I've never had any problem with it spotting anything permanently.  I do wish it would spray a tad bit more finely (more like an aerosol air freshener spray), because the spots are obvious for a bit of time on solid-colored items.  I'm taking off a star for the fact that the sprayer could work better- especially as the bottle gets down to the last few ounces.  The sprayer cannot be easily repositioned, and therefore it starts spurting out larger drops of fabric refresher if it's held at the wrong angle.  The dampness this product creates is quite temporary, as the spray dries fast, but I have had a couple of complaints about the dampness if a person sits down on a chair that I just sprayed a moment earlier.  I do think that it removes nasty scents from fabric items (cigarette smoke being one example), but it's obviously not a replacement for washing items, spot-cleaning, a proper upholstery scrub-down, or vacuuming.  Occasionally I'll see people using this product to try and cover up the fact that they haven't done that deeper cleaning, though!The Gain Original Scent is my favorite.  I haven't been able to find it in awhile, but the Meadows & Rain scent was also nice.  If I can find it, I like to match the Febreze products around the home- the air freshener, candle, plug-ins- and use the same fragrance throughout.I've tried the Antimicrobial formula and the Anti-Dust formulas, the latter of which I don't see offered anymore.  I do like those qualities to my fabric sprays, but with both of them the scent was NOT to my liking- kind of musky and overwhelming.  However, the Antimicrobial is kind of nice to have on hand when someone in the household has had the flu, a cold, etc.  I wish the Gain Scent had one or both of those attributes, but you can't have it all, I guess.There is one grocery store near me that carries the Gain scent, but it's nice Amazon carries it for times when they're out of it.  I just don't like the other fragrances that much, so Gain Scent is what I stick to.  If you like the laundry detergent and fabric softener scent of Original Gain, you'll Also, my housemate is extremely picky about fragrances I spray, but loves the Gain-scented one.

"Worse than any other extendable duster that I've ever used.  I've used feather dusters, extendable wands on vacuum cleaners, cotton-covered dusters, dryer brushes to clean out lint...honestly, ANYTHING would be better than this piece of blue junk.  The wand has to be screwed in just right, or it will collapse in length.  No matter what you do, the head will not stay in place.  You can try to hold the head in place with rubber bands...duct tape...a cloth tied around it.  Nada.  Nothing works.  It will just turn and turn, getting loose dust everywhere, if it dusts as all.  Forget using this on an angle- if you bend the duster, it will spin and spin, not stay at the angle you set it at.  I tried to dust the top of my kitchen cabinets with this- what a mistake!  The duster doesn't hold ANY dust- electrostatic, my foot!  A plain microfiber cloth is more electrostatic than this thing.  A feather duster, heck, even a SWIFFER HOLDS MORE DUST THAN THIS THING!  I cannot steer a potential buyer away from this enough.  All this thing does is move the dust into the air and onto surfaces below where you dust- and I do mean ALL OVER those surfaces.  I have never been more disappointed in a cleaning product or item.  I hate leaving negative reviews, but I have no choice here.  Buy anything for extended dusting but this darn thing, but save your dollars and don't buy this.  Even if the head stayed in place, it just throws dust everywhere, so I would never suggest someone with allergies or asthma use this.  It also has a strong chemical smell out of the packing, and sheds little blue threads EVERYWHERE (as if the dust wasn't bad enough...)  After using this, it took me an hour to wipe down all of the kitchen surfaces.  I expect some dust to fall down- but there's no excuse for this thing to be marketed as electrostatic and hold not one speck of dust in the fibers.  But that's what it does.

"I am very good at taking care of my brushes. They are stored in a BE bag carefully. I've had many of my brushes for ten years, and they look and feel like new. This is important to note, which is why I'm giving the background.I used this to apply a highlighter and bronzer, and it worked well, though it isn't up to (for example) Bare Escentuals Kabuki Brush quality. The bristle are soft enough and plentiful, but they don't ""grip"" the product the way BE brushes do. They are also not as soft, and shed a tad more.But my gripe is that the ENTIRE brush- the whole cover to the brush itself- fell off within two weeks. It had no locking mechanism or anything where I could just slip it back on. I'd have to glue or tape it back together. (Which would look and feel tacky, to say the least!) I have no children or anyone around who touches or uses my brushes. So I know that it wasn't destroyed by a careless third party. I have NEVER seen a makeup brush- even cheap dollar store ones- fall apart so fast. I'm not seeking my money back, because it was not enough of a cost output to warrant sending it back. Maybe this is just a fluke- but I will steer clear of this brand forever, despite the good reviews many people have given their brushes.It's back to Revlon brushes for me! They're a good drugstore brush brand that I can trust...I will never buy Eco Tools brushes again. If I have the income again in the future, I'd return to my Bare Escentuals brushes for any new purchases.

"I wear an 11W shoe, and bought the size Large. They fit like a glove. They are cute, breathe well, and make my lower legs look slimmer than when I wear crew socks! I bought the hot pink color, and I love wearing them. They're a tad expensive. Be careful when washing these, as the outer layer snags easily. I highly recommend washing them in the sink, or using a mesh laundry bag to enclose them in the washing machine. I also recommend either air-drying them, or only putting them in on low in the dryer. They don't shrink, but the elastic can be a bit fragile- and the stitching is even more fragile.That said, I cannot stand wearing other socks when I work out now. They can lose a bit a stretch if worn all day long, so I don't care to use them for everyday socks. They can end up sliding into my shoe by the end of an active day, because they stretch A LOT.  But I love that they are thin, but with two thin layers, they always keep my feet at the best temperature- not too cold, not too hot. My feet feel very comfy in these.

"I have been a regular exerciser since 1996. Heaven knows, I have owned MANY pairs of workout shoes in that time. Typically workout shoes last me anywhere from three to six months, with a schedule of working out forty to sixty-five minutes a day, six to seven days a week consistently.  I've had many good pairs of shoes, and many awful ones. The best pairs of shoes I've owned (either for workout or wear-a-day) have ALWAYS come from Saucony. Obviously, one cannot wear sneakers all the time in life, but I wear these when I can get away with it! Not only are they designed to keep your feet breathing (thanks to the mesh upper in most of their designs), but they are always fashionable in looks, and feel good on from the second that they are taken out of the box.  Very rarely have I ever experienced the need to ""break in"" Saucony shoes. This is not true for the New Balance brand with me, as a comparison in workout shoes. While initially Saucony shoes can cost a bit more money than some other sneakers out there, this brand consistently tends to wear out much less quickly than others, at least in my case. Workout shoes almost consistently follow the rule that you get what you pay for, especially if you have anything but a completely pain-free body, no injury history, and perfect feet.My stats (for you to compare your stats to mine, seeing how these shoes might work for you): I wear a size 11W, and this is my true size in every shoe that I have ever worn since I was a teenager. I have average-sized ankles for a full-figured woman; I'd say about they're about 10"" around.  I am plus-sized, so I require some padding in my shoes to keep my feet, joints, and lower back happy.  Yet I am big enough that I definitely do not want extra heft in my shoe- and it can be tough to find the right shoe meeting those two conditions.  I have problems with under-pronating (supination)- evidenced by the fact that I always wear the outside tread of my shoes out before any other part of the tread.  I have an average instep, and my arches are basically normal, with a little bit of tendency towards flat feet (especially if I'm stuck wearing low-quality shoes, like for a friend's wedding...)My point is that I know if the shoes are right for me IF they give me a spring in my step. These definitely achieve that goal! Before I switched to supination-correcting shoes, I had really given up on high-intensity exercise. But I do brisk walking, aerobics (both floor and step), plyometric exercises (jumps and high-impact moves, but in moderation), light-to-moderate strength-training, lots of floor-based exercises for the abdominals/core/spinal erector/glutes/hips/thighs/, some Pilates, some Yoga, and lots of athletic stretches.  So in other words, I need a combination of stability AND flexibility in my shoes. I need something that will flex when I do lunges, but won't make me wobble when I require extra balance, such as when I'm doing high-step aerobics. This shoe is amazing in that it allows for both of these requirements to be met! And they are lightweight. Honestly, it's like ""barefoot, but better"". I never feel like these shoes are ""in my way"", adding weight and too much motion control to get full range-of-motion in exercises. For the daily exerciser, they know how important this is!They are also great as day-to-day shoes. I walk so much faster in them than I do even my other sneakers. I spent an eight-hour day recently touring NW Washington, D.C. (mostly on foot), pounding the concrete as I toured the city, climbing steps to get in, on, and out of the Metro a zillion times.  I took the long trip past the Navy's Memorial Fountain, the National Lawn, walking up the National Gallery steps and around its marble floors towards the end of the day. Yet I felt great all day and into the night, and had no fatigue or pain the next day, either! I had very severe knee problems at one point, and I can tell you that these are fantastic if you have those problems in your history.A hint that may help in doing exercise shoe-shopping: Do not automatically buy shoes labeled for flat feet or high arches, if you have either of those problems. Instead, look at the tread of a pair of your well-worn shoes. If they are shoes related to the activity you're buying a new pair for, all the better.  My tip is to remember that your arch type is only a part of the equation in shoe-shopping.  If you wear out the inner tread of shoes, then you'll likely need motion control to move more safely, and will probably need a shoe designed for over-pronators. But here's the thing to watch out for...Many times it is the standard recommendation to buy shoes for over-pronation automatically, if one has flat feet. I took that advice for years at face value, and doing so slowed down my workouts, and was hard on my knees and back. I was doing the exact opposite of what I needed, as despite being flat-footed to a degree, I am actually a supinator. The tread on my shoes was the clue. (Although it must be stated that I've regained my arches significantly through losing a lot of weight and by doing exercises/stretches to strengthen and regain normal arches.) While supination is allegedly more common in people with high arches and/or very high insteps, don't automatically assume that you need the kind of motion control which shoes for over-pronators are often designed for. Regardless of your type of foot- look at the tread. Everything starts with the feet- the wrong shoes lead to ankle, knee, back, and foot problems. No one needs MORE wear and tear on their body! :)Once I addressed my true issue- supination- I FINALLY found the shoes that give me the spring in my step needed! I could finally do the high-impact aerobics, running in place, jumping jacks, deeper lunges, deeper squats, tall-box climbs, and plyometric jumps without feeling pain in the knees and/or lower back.  It was also more comfortable for my feet.  If you do the type of workouts that I do, you probably need a shoe with a lot of flexibility- almost like being barefoot- but cannot take the ""barefoot shoes"" currently in vogue due to high-impact movements. Some people do well with the ""barefoot shoes"", but my shoe size, body type, and level of physical activity make wearing those type of shoes less-than-ideal. So this sneaker is a godsend to me! I love to exercise, and these make that easier and more enjoyable. Saucony excels in giving me a flexible, supportive, strong shoe with good looks, and just enough motion control that I never feel like I'm losing my balance in them. It was so important to my body, that it actually lessened the fatigue I felt post-workout to invest in these shoes! I work harder than ever in my workouts, but experience far less achiness from my workouts since wearing these shoes. They are truly awesome! I hope that anyone who buys these has the same wonderful experience with them.To the Saucony Co.- PLEASE expand your availability of this shoe in the various colors for ladies like me with wide feet!  11W is now a very common shoe size. I would buy a pair of these in every color if I could, but you only make one color available to me in that size. And keep your best shoes (like these!) available for purchase.  Please don't change these- they rock!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273WGYKOE4LJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO309MC#wasThisHelpful","R273WGYKOE4LJI","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The older I get, the more light that I seem to need for every single task. Come nighttime, my overhead lights caused terrible glare on my textbooks and electronic devices. Table lamps provided either inadequate light or give off a terrible glare themselves, especially off of glossy white college textbook pages, not to mention my electronic screens. I don't know if it's because of the LED or not, but the glare with this is really minimal- astounding, considering how bright it is.I love that this inexpensive light can both sit freestanding, or can be attached to your laptop or desktop via the USB cord. It's virtually weightless, making it a convenient accessory to bring along in your backpack or laptop bag if you have to work in dim spaces on-the-go. I certainly do use it to light up my laptop keyboard as I type away in my living room, bedroom or home office at all hours. But even though I bought it for my laptop, and to try and light up my schoolbook pages when I study at night, I've ended up using it for so many other tasks- things that I's never even thought about before owning this. It definitely makes a good portable book light (important, since I'm a full-time college student right now). It makes tasks like trimming fingernails, sewing, knitting, writing, little household repairs so much easier on the eyes- and now I see so much more detail as I work. (I know- I sound so old...) I also use it to add light around my face when putting makeup on the morning. I've found that this helps me see my face with greater clarity and detail than my beautiful but somewhat dim $80 makeup mirror- probably because this one has so bright, clean and white a light. It helps me catch makeup application mistakes that the more neutral/yellow, dimmer makeup mirrors just don't uncover. I take it with me on longer travels away from home, too, just in case the light where I'm staying is inadequate for things that I need to get done.Since it has a bendable cord, it's far more versatile than any regular lamp, task light or flashlight that I've used before. With it's own stand and simple on/off switch on top of the base, it has none of the aggravations trying to use a wobbly, circular flashlight for fix-it jobs can create. I have a wall-mounted USB multi-port over my computer desk, and can stick this little light into one of the slots in order to create light from a whole new angle that way, too. (This is where the bendable cord also comes in handy.) I often place it on a shelf to give more light temporarily in closets, as I'm getting things out or putting items away. I have a very dark pantry space, for example, and this light helps me see all the items which get shoved way back on the deep shelves with ease. I can get light in any angle that I need it, for any use that I need. I haven't had any power outages yet since I've owned this, but this is so much brighter than the average flashlight, I'm really glad to have it on hand in case that happens. Since it'll run on any charged item possessing a USB port, or will stay lit up on AA batteries alone, I think it's a nice addition to an emergency household or automobile kit. I do wish that it had an A/C adapter power option, though. I like this light so much, but it dims pretty quickly when running on batteries alone. It's a bit tougher and more durable than many of my flashlights, too. I've accidentally dropped it a few times, as heaven knows I tote it all over the place with me these days, and it's not been hurt a bit.Update on 8/17/14: After several months of use, I still like my light a lot, but it drives me nuts that it eats through batteries in a nanosecond. That is why I must remove a star from my original 5-star review. They have increased the price quite a bit since I bought it a few months ago (although it is currently less expensive than the price I had seen lately, which was really steep). Because it has no A/C power option, this light can be a bit inconvenient for my needs, personally. Consider carefully what your own habits are before buying this light, especially if you're on a really tight budget. I like to use it for adding extra, clean white light to my dark bedroom when I'm putting on my makeup in the a.m. I also like to use it sans computer/USB, while studying out of my textbook and writing in longhand, again because it does add a useful task light which is bright and clean. And typically I'm studying at night, when house lights are all that I have to work with. The dimming which occurs within a day or two on battery power alone (and we're talking maybe an hour or two of use a day, max) is really annoying when I'm trying to do tasks like that. (I'm a full-time student and just don't have loads of money to invest in lots of expensive task lighting.) Batteries aren't cheap, and I buy the high-quality, name-brand ones which last forever in my other battery-powered items around the home. So I know that problem is the light itself, and not my choice of batteries. It doesn't totally die on batteries for a long time, but it goes dim fast and stays that way until it finally fades completely. While this LED light doesn't get hurt easily, the tipping over so often can get old fast. It also doesn't sit up well at all if taken out of it's base and placed in a 12-port USB hub that I own, even when I place it dead center in the port. While the coil of the light is flexible, there is just no heft to it at all (in a negative sense). Also, I often study for college or do work while lying in bed, and the light is constantly falling over if it's sitting on my bed, which is pretty firm and flat in surface. I wouldn't remove a star for that alone, but the lack of light on batteries and the flimsiness DOES get old, because not everyone works at a desk!Now my mom, grandmother and best friend all want one of these, too! :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV1K8BWEJVBZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DEP2AG#wasThisHelpful","RV1K8BWEJVBZZ","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I went into reading this with an open mind, because I like fitness and nutrition books a lot.  I'm always hunting down up-to-date info on the best nutrition plans, exercise routines and supplements for the dedicated fitness buff.  I wanted to add in more walking to my routine, in order to build my cardiovascular endurance up to better levels.  I hoped that this would provide me with some inspiration to do just that, plus keep me on the straight and narrow path nutritionally through a week-by-week program to abide by.  But it just doesn't deliver on that- at least it did not do that for me.  I don't knock the other positive reviews that this book got- if this worked for others, great.  It just taught me nothing new, personally, and I didn't find it interesting (though I did read it all the way through to the end and followed the plan, loose as it was).  Frankly, this was boring and I had to force myself to finish perusing this.  Most of her ""plan"" was just sort of keeping a journal, aiming for one rather minor dietary goal a week...hardly anything new or earth-shattering.  She didn't discuss injury prevention, supplementation or cross-training.  I really don't like books lacking specifics!This book actually doesn't stress exercising very much- it is heavy on dietary advice, most of which is rather vague and generic.  I assumed that this book would contain a detailed walking program of some kind to follow, but it didn't.  I found this lack of exercise planning in the book surprising, considering that the author is an exercise video guru and gym owner!  The author sites few, if any, scientific studies or medical research for what she espouses, too.  Though to be fair, the vast majority of her work here is plain common sense- drink lots of water, don't overeat, get some exercise most or all days of the week, don't smoke, don't drink much (if any) alcohol, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables...you get my drift.  All of this information can also be obtained quickly and easily from the Internet for free, except with far more detail about how to achieve peak health through living, eating and exercising intelligently.Even if you actually want a book instead of delving into the vast resources of the web, there are many superior choices available to buy.  A better book on total health and fitness is ""Firm for Life"", by Anna and Cynthia Benson.  At least that book delves into the actual science of staying youthful and strong through modified bodybuilding nutrition, consistent vigorous exercise and lifestyle balance.  It also provides real women presenting their own fitness stories and testimonials, which are fun to learn and draw strength from.  Anna and Cynthia Benson preach an exercise method of aerobics, weight-training, abdominal work and athletic stretches- a program that has worked very well for thousands of their clients.  If Pilates is more your thing, Brooke Siler's ""The Pilates Body"" is excellent- no diet advice is offered, but an incredibly solid and easy-to-follow matwork and upper body exercise series is presented there.  ""Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss"" is a great book to utilize if you prefer to develop better flexibility, joint range-of-motion and balance through gentle yoga and a nutrition plan based on simple vegetarianism instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R88DWQ5C6I4UN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QFY2KW#wasThisHelpful","R88DWQ5C6I4UN","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very impressed with how solidly constructed this is- though for the cost, it should be!  It is made in China, but that's pretty unavoidable these days.  I think that the price is fair for the smooth finish, all-in-one welding that makes the piece super sturdy (no way will it tip over or have shelves breaking off) and the large storage space it provides.To advise how I'm utilizing this: One of my hutch shelves was just a sea of papers, extra file folders, printer paper, etc.  I'm a full-time college student and I also needed somewhere to put my ""active"" files (i.e., papers for current classes I'm in).  Before I bought this, I kept knocking the files over losing them in my shelf o' crap on the hutch.  Now, I've got files for all four of my classes neatly stacked vertically via this organizer.  I put spare manila folders and printer paper in the two bottom, horizontal shelves of this organizer.  The horizontal shelves are all wide/deep/long enough to hold legal- or letter-sized files, just to let you know.  This sits on top of my hutch nicely, very accessible and pleasing to the eye.  Well, as much as a metal organizer can please the eye, that is...This comes with little felt pieces (four of them) to put on the bottom of this organizer, so that it stays in place better and doesn't scratch whatever surface you put it on.  I'd actually bought some 3M Command sticky stuff to lay it down on my desk with- but the felt pieces work just fine to keep this in place, especially because it's a relatively weighty piece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RA3V13KA08CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GR80L8#wasThisHelpful","R1RA3V13KA08CO","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are made of heavy, if comfortable, sweatpant material.  I'm 5'7"", so I'm on the tall side, but I have average-length legs (a 30"" inseam is perfect for me, 29"" is do-able but can't shrink at all if they're going to work).  So quite often I only need an Average in pants because a Tall (which typically has an inseam that runs anywhere from 31"" to 34"" long) will be too long in both the rise and the inseam for me.When I wore these the first time, without washing them first, they fit okay.  Not particularly long on me when I'm in sneakers, but long enough that they weren't high-waters.  After washing, the length had shrunk at least two inches (probably three), though the overall fit seemed no tighter.  This was very aggravating- now they ARE high-waters on me!  However, I like the pants style and color- I have Light Khaki.  So I ordered another pair, this time in TALL, knowing that they will shrink after washing and finally be just the right length!  The old ones, I'll only wear around the house from now on...This length issue was true of two other Woman Within pants styles I've had- their 7-day Sports Pants and a pant which had a running stripe up the side.  So be warned- if you're at the top of the height bracket for pants, order the next length up.  A woman with average-length legs who is 5'3""-5'5"" would wear the Average pant size well in this particular Woman Within item AFTER washing.  Cotton pants at Woman Within (though not their jeans) seem to have this problem quite frequently with the length shrinking, because I've read many other reviews with the same situation popping up.Update: I have since bought the Tall length (same size in number alone) in these pants and after washing, they did indeed fit perfectly on my frame.  This perfect fit was true both for the rise and the inseam.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R268NOICDHIBBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005GVRPJW#wasThisHelpful","R268NOICDHIBBF","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recommend sizing up in these panties. They are a tad skimpy, especially in the lower ab/hip area. If you are between sizes, of course go up to the higher size since that's been stated. That said, they fit grand when you get the right size- no riding up on the tush, no elastic rubbing uncomfortably at the hems, etc. Overall, they're well-made, especially considering the diminishing quality of clothing around the world today. I've had no problems with the elastic coming undone, loose threads or any of the lace being scratchy.I do like the color selection here. I don't like wild colors or prints in my undergarments. I only wear beige, white and black in my undergarments, so finding a set like this makes me happy. The price for these is reasonable for the volume that you get, too.I've had no problem making these last a long time. I always wash my bras and panties on the delicate cycle in a mesh zippered laundry bag. They won't get any pilling on the fabric IF you wash bras and panties alone, no other clothes or items in the washer with them. I then let them all air-dry on hangers with special clips overnight. This set of panties has lasted a couple of years and still show no sign of wear thus far. If you are unwilling or unable to wash and dry them in this careful manner, they probably will wear out much faster. Lace on clothing IS fragile and if you're tough on your clothing, these probably won't be your favorite panties.I think that they look very pretty on the body, especially the black pairs. I wear the beige panties under white pants so that there's no see-through (an old trick my Mom taught me- same with wearing a beige bra under white shirts). It's easy to find white, beige or black bras with a touch of lace that will match these grand, making for a sexy combo underneath your clothes each day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBN5U3HZZNJL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00794Z5FK#wasThisHelpful","RBN5U3HZZNJL1","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bra is highly rated on Amazon, which made me want to give it a shot. My mother warned me, ""Don't buy Playtex!"", because she felt they came up too high under the arms with excess fabric and that their cups fit weirdly compared to other brands in the same size. But I bought this anyway, mostly because it was half the cost of my fave brand, Glamorise. Boy, did I make a mistake!Okay, I will say that this covers and holds the bo*bs up just fine. Almost too well- it reminds me of that ""Lunch Lady Song"" Adam Sandler sang on SNL years ago, about a lady who has 76 hooks in her big old bra or something like that. That's how I felt while wearing this! Granted, I'm a big woman but my chest isn't sagging that much (yet) and I don't need the ""duct tape holding method"" that this bra feels like. I wear a 48F and this bra just didn't feel right to me. Not tight or with any spillover...just icky. As my mother warned, there is indeed too much fabric on the sides of the bra under the arm. Maybe women with a lot of fat in that area like this extra fabric, but that's actually one of my lean spots (genetics and years of weight-training to thank), so all it does is rub against my upper arms and underarms (which feels awful, too).The fabric is also SO scratchy! Really uncomfortable on my skin all day long. I always hand-wash my bras/panties alone, rinse well and then let them drip dry. My delicates last for years this way. And I have never had a bra with fabric that felt so rough! This bra pilled along the edges, too, which doesn't happen to any other bra that I have (mostly because I hand-wash and drip-dry, I'm sure). Forget 18 hours- after 6 hours, I couldn't wait to tear this scratchy bra off!The straps are just too thick for me. Unless you're wearing a crewneck, these may peek out of your shirts because there's so much to the straps and cups. The bra comes up high on the chest, too, which is fine if concealing your breasts is your goal. But for those who wear ballet-neck, v-neck or sweetheart necklines, this bra comes up too high on the chest and the straps are too wide.I praise Amazon for carrying many bras for plus-sized women like me. I just don't care for this bra and will purchase Glamorise (despite the extra cost) because I've learned my lesson. I DID try another kind of Playtex bra and didn't like it, either (similar problems).","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354GW90YYDJNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007YY8H0#wasThisHelpful","R354GW90YYDJNY","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not much that one can say about a bucket, but here goes. I've had mine for a few years. I use it to clean windows- clean ammonia-and-water solution goes for the cleaning in one side, plain water in the other side for rinsing the window scrubber in. I use a soft window scrubber in the ammonia solution to actially clean the windows, then a squeegee to wipe them dry, FYI. Works like a charm and goes quickly, thanks in part to this large bucket.It also makes a great storage caddy for cleaning supplies because it's so large and tall. Nothing falls over in it because it's got height and is divided in half. It'll hold lots of cleaning cloths, spray bottles, big bottles of all purpose cleaner, you name it and is still easy to carry. With the plastic piece over the handle, it's pretty comfortable to carry around.It pays to buy durable cleaning equipment and this is no exception to that rule.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XETLNCXP3HHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KD7QUO#wasThisHelpful","R1XETLNCXP3HHZ","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have light ash brown hair, fair cool skin (pink undertone) and blue eyes.  I prefer not to wear sparkly or glittery makeup because I am in my mid-thirties and matte colors look a bit better on slightly-aging eyelids.  I also want to be taken seriously and sometimes brazen makeup colors can prevent that from happening.  I have a ""remember the woman herself, not the wild makeup/clothes/hair she has on"" philosophy when it comes to beauty.  This palette works fine for that look- modest, calm, understated.  However...on someone of my cool coloring, it can appear dull and make me look rather tired.  It seems to make my very light dark circles under my eyes look worse than they really are and doesn't accent my blue eyes all that well.  I can wear just about any makeup color or formulation and pull it off (thanks to my coloring, the type of facial structure I have, good genes and good skincare)...but this makes me look a little blah.  I think it'd be better suited to a woman with green (or maybe brown) eyes, warmer skin, warmer hair color.  For women with cool coloring (black, cool red, ash blonde or ash brown hair), a pink undertone to their skin (as opposed to yellow, brown, olive or tan) and blue or grey eyes, I just don't think that this would be a spectacular choice in color palette.  Obviously some will disagree and that's okay- I'm just basing this on personal experience.  It does possess a lovely matte finish for those who look good with this neutral set of color choices.  Finding an eyeshadow quad with an all-matte finish to each color is quite difficult, especially in this price range.However, the product itself REALLY needs some work.  It's been flaky since day one (and it was fresh when I opened it, not old or rancid) and the powder goes EVERYWHERE.  So much of the product goes to waste due to this.  I use high-end makeup brushes, not cheap sponge applicators, so that's not the problem.  The color saturation on the lids is only moderate at best.  I'm not a makeup line snob- if I can get away with using a drugstore product, I will.  I'm on a limited budget, so I love drugstore finds that work well.  But I have to admit that in terms of not flaking and the color intensity once applied, Lancome and Estee Lauder eyeshadows blow this stuff away.  My Lancome eyeshadow quads last forever because I don't lose half the product to the wind!  If you wear this, you must tap the brush off before putting on the eyes because otherwise the powder will fall on your cheeks.The durability is just okay, too.  I have fairly dry skin.  Oily breakthrough is never a problem on my eyelids or facial skin and I don't use eye cream or anything like that.  I also prep my eyelids with foundation and pressed translucent powder before putting on shadow, which always helps product last longer on my lids.  Even Maybelline eyeshadow lasts all day on me!  But this product?  Gone within four to six hours from my eyes no matter what I do.Overall, this is not worth the money for me.  Were it reformulated to be better quality, I'd give it four or five stars.  The color choice doesn't work for me, but I wouldn't remove stars for that because that's just a personal thing.  At this point, I'd have to say one should either shell out the bucks for a matte palette in a better department store line of makeup or use a drugstore product and most likely put up with the shimmer that seems to be in nearly every eyeshadow quad these days.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I44ZKEAHVIXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ZD3DHI#wasThisHelpful","R1I44ZKEAHVIXQ","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've taken to eating green salsa on every Tex-Mex, Mexican and egg dish I eat.  I'd been using Herdoz, but this is MUCH better.  For one thing, this has more texture- it's not as liquid-y as Herdoz.  I love the little chunks of garlic and green chiles in this, and the tomatillos just sing.  It has potent, fresh, spicy flavor that's well-rounded and yet not so hot that you're dying for bread and water.  I love that this is such a big jar, too, as I go through this product very fast.  It is incredibly hard to get good green salsa in my area (and I don't like most red salsas), so I'm glad that Amazon carries this.

"The crackers, beef stick, fruit medley and cinnamon nuts are all good. I bought a package of six boxes, though, and while all the packages were fresh (based on their expiration date) the cheese had this little bit of watery liquid in the container. This was true of every single box. All of the other items tasted very fresh. I bought this in wintertime, it was kept in a dry and dark pantry at all times and so I must conclude that it is simply not a great cheese product. I did try to eat it once and the flavor was plastic-y and not at all appealing. Perhaps this won't be everyone's experience, but I felt I needed to alert people via this review. I personally love the GoPicnic concept, so I'm not knocking the brand- the hummus one is my favorite in the line. But these are too expensive to have even one dud item in the box.

"My Background As A Student of German (which I'm sharing so that you'll know if you need what I needed from this book): I'm technically a third-year student of the German language, having taken one year in middle school and two semesters of it in high school. I'm now in my first year of German as a college student. However, my years of German in secondary school were taken many moons ago, and I fully acknowledge that I was a less-than-stellar student when I was a teenager. There were no Internet resources available back in those days, either. I now consider myself a truly self-motivated and dedicated student, as I love the language and culture of Germany, and possess a strong desire to live and work in the country itself someday. From the start of my college course, I was spending an immense amount of time studying German each day on my own, usually an hour a day or more. I could read basic text in German fairly well, pass the vocabulary tests with flying colors, and understood my professor's German speaking on the whole. But passing a collegiate-level foreign language course requires more and different abilities than just learning conversational German, demanding an intimate and extensive knowledge of grammatical rules. If one doesn't know all of the grammatical rules within your native language, then of course you can't even begin to apply that knowledge to another language. While memorizing the vocabulary words in German was certainly doable, especially due to it's common origins with English, the grammatical ignorance on my part was really making me struggle. I found myself turning to Google Translate or some similar program constantly in order to quickly write or phrase complete sentences and questions properly, even when I knew all of the basic vocabulary to put together what I wanted to express. That is so frustrating and demotivating. No one in my personal life outside of class spoke German at all, and as I'm primarily an auditory learner, I was at a real disadvantage in that regard. Forming questions, as opposed to making statements, are even more difficult in German. Asking questions in German is frequently done with reversed word order, compared to how we'd ask the same thing in English, and word order is also altered depending upon whether it's open-ended or a yes/no question. If you're struggling with similar issues, please read on to see if this book is for you.I wish I'd had a good grammar book (or knew about the great websites for learning German which I now utilize regularly for help) from the very beginning of my studies. That would've eliminated some of my frustration, probably would have improved my grades a tad, and it would have left me feeling less clueless in class when the grammatical topics came up. My excellent professor recommended this particular book as an add-on to our mandatory Kontakte textbook, which even she acknowledges is a horrid textbook for learning German. (She had no choice but to teach from it though, for the time being). Me being me, I didn't buy the book until about the end of the semester, and that was really moronic on my part. Will you need this particular book on your very first day of learning German? With the Internet to utilize as a vast reference library today...probably not. If your grammar skills are super-strong to begin with, you may not even need a brush-up on the topics within it. But it still wouldn't hurt to have this on hand as an add-on to your textbook, especially for use during class time (as long as your instructor will allow this). If you don't have Internet access and/or have no firm foundation in grammar, a book of this nature will be essential to your studies, in my humble opinion.The Pros Of This Book- It uses very basic, beginner-friendly German vocabulary to demonstrate it's points, and the English translations are right there with the German for easy deciphering (something for which Kontakte gets a giant FAIL!) This book excels at clarifying the English language's grammatical rules vs. those of German. If you ignored all that grammatical teaching in English class like I did as a kid, you will probably need this book to maximize your German study time and master the new language more quickly. It's a great introductory reference book which shouldn't overwhelm the new-to-German student too much. While it requires consistent and repeated effort to understand and memorize the concepts, I DO feel more confident now in speaking or writing German sentences and questions. I owe that in part to this reference guide.The Cons Of This Book- It has a few limitations you should be aware of. Many times this book says, ""Refer to your textbook for further information/elaboration"". (I'm paraphrasing, but that's the gist of it). My Kontakte textbook has confusing, occasionally incorrect, and illogically-laid-out grammatical help. So with that being said, I still must turn to the Internet for further elaboration on the topics first presented in this book. Thankfully, there are MANY free and very detailed websites on various topics like dative clauses. Also, this book doesn't bring up more intermediate-to-advanced grammatical learning, like using the comparative and superlative forms of German adjectives. I highly doubt that this would be the only grammar guide that you'll ever need as a student of German, especially if you'll be going beyond taking just one semester of it.Some Additional Resources To Consider- I mostly utilize the Web and a variety of Smartphone apps for additional resources in learning German. I can say that about.com has superb grammatical advice for English speakers who are learning German. My professor loves this online resource, and the site is pretty thorough when it comes to teaching grammar with LOTS of good examples to pore over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UELAT5D92BH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0934034389#wasThisHelpful","R2UELAT5D92BH0","AX3T5TI76TOJ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AX3T5TI76TOJ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The artistic aspect of this movie is off the charts. It is a visual feast.It also give incredible insight into the vast and subtle cultural differences within Eastern and Western minds.I have heard that Asian children adopted as infants into Western families tend to have deep issues with self-worth and connections if they grow up in an area where they are the only Asian or one of few; especially if the family is unable to connect the child with their heritage due to lack of resources or understanding.After watching this movie I started to wonder how much harder it might be for an older child who is adopted. Their brain is already being wired for language, behavioral, and thought patterns that are so different from a Western approach.I understand that love can bridge many gaps, but parents and children in the adoptive process have so many expectations. Adults, especially first time parents, may not be prepared. Parenthood like marriage takes work. Marriage and parenthood are wonderful, but are definitely not lived out in fairy tale conditions.Even parents of biological children get a bit of a wake-up call as their child traverses the road to adulthood and often stands in opposition to them. I can only imagine how confusing it must be for adoptive parents when they are blessed by a child with a well-formed sense of self from a culture they do not understand.So it becomes not just parent-child misunderstandings and tension but a deep cultural aspect adds a very confusing layer of mystery.I know that some people are up to the task, but I hope that adoption agencies are really and truly preparing parents because the children have so little choice in the matter. We owe it to the children we so desperately want to love.These are all the thoughts that have been brewing in my mind after watching this movie and none of these topics were blatantly addressed. It is a movie that causes you to question and think without telling you what to think or what conclusions to draw.Please note, you never see Jinhee with her adoptive family. ""A Brand New Life"" leaves the viewer with many thoughts of what her ""brand new life"" will be.

"This is probably the most pratical ""sippy"" cup innovation since the ""Tommee Tippee"" version.Basic Information:-Munchkin has two versions, this one is the slower flow version for the little ones who are handling a cup for the first time.-It is made for the Canadian company in China.-As stated in the informational section, it is BPA free; but the packaging and informational slip inside the cup gives no further information regarding the manufacturing materials.-You can wash this in the dishwasher on the top shelf, but from personal experience with other such products, I recommend alternating machine washing with hand washing, just to preserve the life of the softer materials, especially if you don't have a closed basket to keep the soft pieces secure-Other cautions given by Munchkin: don't use this cup with carbonated or pulpy juices and don't allow your little one to play with or chew on the ""valve"" (the entire insertable piece).Overall review:These cups are rather expensive but they are quite practical for teaching children to use a regular cup. There still will be an adjustment period, because when you tip a regular cup beyond a certain angle, you get a face full of water. No sippy cup is going to be perfect.I can see there being a problem when the little ones reach teething age, because they just naturally bite down on everything and teething often coincides with the age at which the little ones start drinking from a regular cup (3-12 months is the teething range and most babies start drinking from a cup around 6 months). So if your little one is really biting down on everything, this cup might not be the best option if they are not closely observed while using the cup. The upside is this: most mom's do not leave an infant unsupervised while eating or drinking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A1PZ2HX54Q12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRZIFD0#wasThisHelpful","R1A1PZ2HX54Q12","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't had a blender in years, but I have been looking for one. Even the top and most expensive blenders seemed to have issues that made me question if I should purchase one.When I had the opportunity to give this model a test run without paying for it, I decided to give it a try.I tried it this morning with a yogurt smoothie. I followed the instructions regarding what order to add the ingredients (liquids first then frozen solids and ice). The blades did stick a bit but I did not follow the instructions to let the frozen items sit out for about 15 minutes. Next time I'll try that and see if there is any difference. It wasn't a huge problem: I just took a spoon and separated joined chunks of fruit and then mixed things up a bit before restarting.I don't know what the life of the item will be as two important parts are made of a plastic type material. I'm including pictures below. The plastic on the bottom of the pitcher is a little softer and has a slight ""give"" and the plastic slot on the base is a hard material.The blades worked very well. I used a frozen berry mixture of cranberries, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. All were blended to a pulp...of course the seed of the raspberries and cranberries were detectable, although definitely broken down.The soft plastic in the cover had a very strong smell even after washing in cold water. I'm pretty certain it will dissipate over time.The cap can be a little hard to align at first and does need to be pushed down firmly to get a good deal once it is in its proper position.All in all this is a solid little blender and from what I can tell in this short period of time, priced fairly. If I have any troubles within two years, I will report them. After that the warranty is up, so I figure that is the expected lifetime of the motor and parts with regular use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYX8S1WDHUOD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHBD10K#wasThisHelpful","RYX8S1WDHUOD3","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The idea behind this small case is that it will help make switching lenses a little safer. If you're doing a wedding you're typically carrying two cameras so it is better suited for when you are doing outdoor landscape type shots (not animals, they'd hear the Velcro sounds and be gone). For this type of situation, the case is quite practical.The ""pop up"" temporary case for the lens you've just removed is quite ingenious. Place the removed lens there, take out your replacement lens, twist it on to the camera, and the take the other lens out of the pop-up case and place it in the more secure spot.The only problem I see behind this concept is that once you take the new lens out the case becomes a little unstable. So, this is a nice protective lens case but you still need to be a little careful if you're setting it down as opposed to hooking it on your belt (probably the best option) or using the included shoulder strap.I've included a picture of how the case sits with a lens in the temporary pop up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG6BNOGJI3IRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDYS0ZM#wasThisHelpful","RG6BNOGJI3IRD","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my kids recommended this movie to me. I was hesitant because, even as a teen, I never really cared for the ""teen"" movie genre. This is not an exciting movie. It is an incredibly thoughtful one. It keeps you thinking long after you watched it and you'll find that you have little to complain about if you enjoy this type of movie. Even though quite thoughtful, this movie deftly incorporates humor. You will laugh a lot, you will cry, and in some instances you will be laughing and crying. Keep the kleenex's handy.I found the movie to be well-written and the acting superb. It reflects a confusing stage of growth with such sensitive intelligence and yet without being morose. Yes, there are some flat characters that are a bit cliche, but they are used appropriately in moving the story line along and they are not portrayed in a completely vacuous or a completely reprehensible light. Even the flat characters get an intelligent and gentle touch and some are given the chance to grow. I love the way the writers developed the characters without imposing too much of an adult sensibility. Somehow they captured that hard to define space between childhood and adulthood.We enjoyed the mother's character. She is not too intense, allows her daughter some space, tries to provide a different perspective when necessary (without being pushy), and has a sense of humor. I guess I can relate to her because my parents approached parenting the same way. They didn't live my life for me, but there was no doubt they were there for me.Vanessa's (main character) father is never seen in the movie, but his mother keeps an open line of communication through letters. Though she is never seen, the grandmother actually plays a pivotal role in Vanessa's growth process.I love magical realism in literature and movies. ""Dear Lemon Lima"" has just the right amount. I feel like every person's life has a little bit of magical realism in it if they are willing to see it. I feel like these are the events in our lives when we realize that there is an entire world beyond just the physical and that our value is somehow more tied up in the intangible that we normally don't acknowlege. In this way the movie makes a nod to the rich spiritual searching in the lives of teens, even those who've been overtaken by the commercialism of our current society.I want to watch this movie again. But I will wait a while, because right now I want to savor the beauty of my surprising first encounter.SPOILERS FOLLOW:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There is very little foul language in this movie. What a relief for my ears. In the winter games, one team calls themselves ""fubar"", but as far as I can remember the ""f"" word is never spoken, although it is blurred out in one scene.One of the characters commits suicide. This is a very delicate issue and if you have a teen struggling with depression and suicide this might not be the movie for them. The script handles this in a very delicate way. I found it to be incredibly beautiful even though the Inuit beliefs of the after life differ from mine. There is no discussion of the value of human life and the need to try and draw on the strength of your community when suffering from depression or feeling like your life is of no value. I am fine with this but other parents may not be. You can always have a discussion with your child after the movie.Note: I read a review that said it was not believable that the particular character who committed suicide would have done so. Sad to say at this age, it is hard to say who is a candidate for suicide. We never know what can push a kid into thinking their life isn't worth living. They of all people have fewer skills to deal with the blows that life sends, and they have a much harder time understanding and articulating how they feel. They also have a time being heard, because adults don't always take their struggles seriously. This is not a knock on adults, it is hard being a parent. We made it through, so we figure they will have the wherewithal to do the same thing. We need to take a step back and listen.

"Compared to the Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty Mega Bloks sets that I've received to review lately, this set has considerably fewer pieces, but then it is targeting a younger age group (4-10). The 10 year olds may find it a bit too simple if they're into the building aspect, but they won't be disappointed with the versatility of the Barbie Mansion. It will be fun for them to switch room locations around and the fact that it comes with 2 figurines makes it more ""shareable"".Even though this is targeting a younger age group, I do wish that the figurines were articulated like the figures in the sets for older kids. I think that would have made the set infinitely more fun. This is why only 4 stars. It would have been possible to make them articulated in a way where they don't come apart and become a safety hazard.Other than this, the girls like the set and all in all I like the quality of the Mega Bloks sets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PJC13GT0CEEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J05NHJC#wasThisHelpful","R3PJC13GT0CEEC","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my kids recommended this movie to me. I was hesitant because, even as a teen, I never really cared for the ""teen"" movie genre. This is not an exciting movie. It is an incredibly thoughtful one. It keeps you thinking long after you watched it and you'll find that you have little to complain about if you enjoy this type of movie. Even though quite thoughtful, this movie deftly incorporates humor. You will laugh a lot, you will cry, and in some instances you will be laughing and crying. Keep the kleenex's handy.I found the movie to be well-written and the acting superb. It reflects a confusing stage of growth with such sensitive intelligence and yet without being morose. Yes, there are some flat characters that are a bit cliche, but they are used appropriately in moving the story line along and they are not portrayed in a completely vacuous or a completely reprehensible light. Even the flat characters get an intelligent and gentle touch and some are given the chance to grow. I love the way the writers developed the characters without imposing too much of an adult sensibility. Somehow they captured that hard to define space between childhood and adulthood.We enjoyed the mother's character. She is not too intense, allows her daughter some space, tries to provide a different perspective when necessary (without being pushy), and has a sense of humor. I guess I can relate to her because my parents approached parenting the same way. They didn't live my life for me, but there was no doubt they were there for me.Vanessa's (main character) father is never seen in the movie, but his mother keeps an open line of communication through letters. Though she is never seen, the grandmother actually plays a pivotal role in Vanessa's growth process.I love magical realism in literature and movies. ""Dear Lemon Lima"" has just the right amount. I feel like every person's life has a little bit of magical realism in it if they are willing to see it. I feel like these are the events in our lives when we realize that there is an entire world beyond just the physical and that our value is somehow more tied up in the intangible that we normally don't acknowlege. In this way the movie makes a nod to the rich spiritual searching in the lives of teens, even those who've been overtaken by the commercialism of our current society.I want to watch this movie again. But I will wait a while, because right now I want to savor the beauty of my surprising first encounter.SPOILERS FOLLOW:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There is very little foul language in this movie. What a relief for my ears. In the winter games, one team calls themselves ""fubar"", but as far as I can remember the ""f"" word is never spoken, although it is blurred out in one scene.One of the characters commits suicide. This is a very delicate issue and if you have a teen struggling with depression and suicide this might not be the movie for them. The script handles this in a very delicate way. I found it to be incredibly beautiful even though the Inuit beliefs of the after life differ from mine. There is no discussion of the value of human life and the need to try and draw on the strength of your community when suffering from depression or feeling like your life is of no value. I am fine with this but other parents may not be. You can always have a discussion with your child after the movie.Note: I read a review that said it was not believable that the particular character who committed suicide would have done so. Sad to say at this age, it is hard to say who is a candidate for suicide. We never know what can push a kid into thinking their life isn't worth living. They of all people have fewer skills to deal with the blows that life sends, and they have a much harder time understanding and articulating how they feel. They also have a time being heard, because adults don't always take their struggles seriously. This is not a knock on adults, it is hard being a parent. We made it through, so we figure they will have the wherewithal to do the same thing. We need to take a step back and listen. (Talking to the choir).","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JRUE5S1LCBMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HFBXE0#wasThisHelpful","R3JRUE5S1LCBMQ","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Building Process/Tips:As with the Assassin's Creed Gunboat, you might want to plan to do this build over the course of a few days as your fingers will start to get sore after a while with the many small pieces you will be snapping together. Parents, if your kids are younger you may want to be there to sort out the pieces in a way that makes sense for your child and put them in ziplock bags so nothing gets lost in the building process.End Product:The end product is incredible. I love the nearly invisible stands for the mini-figures. It really does look like they are in outer space. You can manipulate the figures to be in any position on the stand (upside-down, sideways...).It doesn't matter if your kid never plays the game and never will because of your own personal standards. The Space Station doesn't need the game reference to be fun.Fun Mechanisms/Features:This piece has some fun featured like the hingeing mechanisms that allow you to open and close the all the outer panels and the rotational feature on the top attachment.Another important feature is the stand that elevates the structure. It gives a better ""feel"" of being in outer space.Action Figures & Accessories:The action figures are almost fully articulated (like the figures in Assassins Creed) and much of the clothing can be removed and switched up. The main difference here is that you will not see faces as the helmet is not removable. The coolest accessories are the guns because each one has a unique look.None of the clothing has the flexible feel that some of the Assassins Creed cloths do, but this is outer space and this makes it more realistic for this particular setting. Much of the clothing/packs are removable and interchangeable which makes this much more fun for the kids, but also requires the extra care in not losing the pieces.General Details: The metallic gold and silver pieces at just enough realism that help the kids as they imagine they are in outer space. With all the detail comes lots of smaller pieces, but it is worth it the sore fingers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJYN13GBPCRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J05N0BM#wasThisHelpful","R3GJYN13GBPCRS","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was taking care of a family member in another state and stumbled upon a wonderful natural food store with a deli. It their deli they sold a Lemon Kale salad that included Soofoo. I became addicted to that salad and now that I'm back home I've been CRAVING the salad. I called the store and they said that I could find the recipe on Soofoo's website as well as purchase the product there.For the moment, Amazon's price is cheaper by over a dollar so in the future I will buy from Amazon.The recipe was on Soofoo's website. I am not a vegetarian, but I love good vegetarian foods that is also filling. This salad fits that requirement for me. If you are trying to eat healthy and want to enjoy the process, you need to include Soofoo in your menu schedule. The Soofoo website has a lot of recipes, but for now I'm stuck on the Lemon Kale salad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R820U3C3V4IET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSKTXHG#wasThisHelpful","R820U3C3V4IET","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our Lego fan has not been totally won over by the Mega Bloks, but he is still pretty impressed by the look of this gunboat.Action Figures: The figures are highly articulated, look very realistic, and have removable and interchangeable head gear (hair, hats) and of clothing. I think this allows the kids to be creative and imaginative on so many more levels. These details make make the transition from the present day to the pirate past more seamless than ""cartoony"" looking figurines.Game Compatibility: If you are an Assassin's Creed Black Flag purist, this boat is not one of the pirate's warships you'd see in the game, it is a smaller ship (sloop). That said, this is a pretty big boat.Detailing: The gunboat has a lot of really nice smaller details: lamps, barrels, two toned pieces, gold toned pieces, etc.Rigging: The rigging that goes through the ""sheets"" (sailing speak for sails) is very strong, but I'm not so sure how well the sails and the shrouds (the rigging that has a woven triangular look) will hold up in play. I'd advise the kids not to try to have the figures hang on to the shrouds.Packaging: The packaging is fairly well thought out. I especially like special ""encapsulated"" type packages that the small clothing pieces come in (such as the sashes). I've included a shot of that packing from a sash that we haven't used yet.Notes:-Our builder completed the complete hull of the ship first and then took several days to complete the detailing. He said his fingers really hurt from all the pressing in of the little pieces. So if your kids are younger you may want to do the build over several days as opposed to doing it all in one session.-In between the hull build and the detailing I went to look at the remaining pieces and saw them all dumped into the box. Most of the pieces were small so I separated them by color (gold, silver, red, light and dark brown). You may want to do the same after the hull is complete. It will help you find those small pieces much easier.-I also put the rigging and sails in a separate bag because the delicate shrouds were tangled up in the mess and I could foresee them getting damaged before actually being put on the ship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB3P7X8ANDVTQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MY3T30O#wasThisHelpful","RB3P7X8ANDVTQ","AHKPZ11JT110F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AHKPZ11JT110F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been feeding this to my 2 cats for a couple of months. They likes it the first day and are so-so about it since then. I'm just at odds about feeding it as there are no good kibble options out there. The GOOD is that this contains 40% protein which is very important for felines (carnivores). Cats should NOT eat fruits, herbs & veggies which most brands are now adding for ridiculous reasons... The BAD is that ROSEMARY is the preservative. Rosemary is toxic to cat digestion, so there will be long-term issues unless you know how to counter this problem (I do) by dosing cats with supplements.The company simply needs to replace the Rosemary with VIT E. I'm unsure if the company is kitty-nutrition incompetent (excusable & fixable) OR is deliberately cutting costs by using (cheap!!) rosemary (inexcusable).I hope they read these reviews & make a very necessary correction.

"There are already many great reviews on this product so I'll just say that it's a hit with my very bright, 6 yr-old master builder grandson, but will include a couple of negatives:CONS: Buyer beware: the instruction booklet includes instructions for ALL of the sets which only upsets children who don't have THOSE sets, so right from the beginning, one feels like a crumb when the child wants to build something that is impossible due to lack of needed shapes; Very cleverly, the company made sure that each set doesn't include ALL the shapes, so showing those cool models that one cannot make with this set is a bit mean in my opinion. Isn't it enough that I just spent $130+ on this set, without causing me to have guilt that we don't have the other shapes???  Everyone was shocked at the high cost, BUT the kid loves itAnother issue for me is that I save boxes for storage so this is put away after a day of continual play. The problem is that there is no way to know how to place the pieces back the way they came. And there was a particular order/manner in which to do this. I've emailed the company & asked for a photo of how the box was packed upon opening it up. There are wells for the pieces but several don't fit no matter how we try.

"I bought this to replace Diamond Naturals Active Cat chicken & rice because Diamond has changed the ingredients & now includes fruits, vegetables & some very feline-toxic herbs. WIthout going into the science as to why those items will harm a cat, I will just say that cats don't have the apparatus to process them. Felines are obligate carnivores & need just meat.So, because of the change in what was an almost ideal cat kibble (Diamond Naturals Active Cat),  I seek a good substitute. Unfortunately most all cat kibbles contain harmful ingredients.Enter Sportmix Wholesomes chicken & rice...Each kibble is extra tiny & I have to wonder if this is the reason my 2 cats are not eating it after initially giving it a paws-up for a day. They seemed frustrated trying to pick the tiny kibbles up with their teeth and then barely chewed them. (actually, cats don't ""chew"", but pierce food with pointed teeth; they have no flat molars. That said, I still don't think cats should swallow kibble whole & but more than a few people who've fed his say their cats seem to be swallowing whole too) This bothers me.The ingredients are ok BUT the protein is too low so one must supplement with meat. (ideal protein for kibble is 40% or higher & must be meat-based protein). So that's another bother but can be easily resolved by offering some roast chicken etc.My biggest concern is the addition of EXTRA L-Lysine! I learned a lot about Lysine after my immuno-compromised cat died from daily Lysine supplements that I misunderstood as being good for him, when in fact, the opposite was true. L-Lysine is meant only for short-term use, not daily ingestion. I don't have all details, but someone I know consulted the Sportmix  ""expert"" who is the one who suggested Sportmix add extra Lysine to this formula & his initial reasoning made no sense. We await further clarification from that expert but he has not replied to a follow-up call, as he said he would.With the loss of the original Diamond Active Cat kibble (40% animal protein), there are just 2 other kibbles that don't contain harmful ingredients, but they are also very low protein (30-32%), so a private feline nutrition expert is researching what one can give (anti-oxident etc) to counteract the effect of the additional Lysine that mayl cause an imbalance that could lead to harm down the road...It's sad that vets only get a few hours in pet nutrition & then are used as ""expert"" consultants for pet food formulas. The people who talked the pet food industry into adding fruits & veggies or herbs (rosemary & yucca are the most toxic) to cat kibble will be responsible for many cat deaths down the road. IF you are feeding cat food (wet or dry) that contains fruits & vegetables (with the exception of pumpkin) please take note that your cat may eventually experience urinary issues (crystals, stones etc) that can & do lead eventually to chronic renal failure (CRF) due to the change in the urine from acidic to alkaline. Alkaline urine is caused by plant & vegetable matter = kidney damage. Acidic urine is produced by meats. For optimal feline health, cat urine should be acidic at all times, so DO NOT FEED a cat fruits & vegetable-based food.I assure you that my info is correct. I challenge any vet or pet food company to disprove me. My info is based on fact & research; their info is based on marketing/advertising/sales gimmicks, and only that, and at the cost of feline health! Just sayin'..So, will I continue to try to feed this? Maybe, but not until I find out what I need to give to my cats to counter the unnecessary addition of extra Lysine that will throw off the nutrients that must be properly balanced...","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKI91TNIG9YOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVB1Y2O#wasThisHelpful","RKI91TNIG9YOY","A1PU9GCX6AB40D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PU9GCX6AB40D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading the many reviews, I ordered my usual size but also chose the ""C/D"" wide width and glad I did as they wouldn't work if any narrower - I had to keep tucking the tongue in before closing them. Really frustrating. And I don't measure as a wide foot so I think the company needs to rethink the width of this line. People shouldn't have to buy Wide when they don't normally wear Wide. I bet the regular width fits narrow feet perfectly, and the reviews seem to agree.What I don't like:1. Velcro closures. Due to zip closure being unavailable in my size in Wide, I had to get the velcro. The straps overhang the attachment strip so I have ""wings"" sticking out the side of each foot. Not a great look but not extreme do will do as I needed comfortable sneakers, and these are very comfy.2. Removable sole. I can't imagine taking it out as there would be no support at all. With the sole in the shoe,  my heel doesn't feel like it's sitting down as low as it should due to the thickness of the sole.  I'll have to get used to this new feeling.3. The color: the photos must be black and white because the true color is not white on white; the faux leather areas are  off -white & makes the sneaker look like a child's ""t-strap"" shoe because it stands out. Result: looks juvenile imo. But comfy, so keeping.I wish more wide widths were available both in retail and online stores; some don't carry wide sizes at all, and the others are all out of 9 and 9.5 wide in the zip style, which is the one I wanted.Today is only day one of wearing this shoe, but I was in them for 4 hours and they were comfy the entire time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28B2UK7ZKEJ3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WNQTLO#wasThisHelpful","R28B2UK7ZKEJ3J","A1PU9GCX6AB40D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PU9GCX6AB40D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a special story. Cassandra pours out her feelings in a notebook that delights the reader with the sweetness, the quirkiness, the apt descriptions... It's so hard to tell how it makes you feel.You are transported back to 1940s England which is when this book was written. Cassandra's family, fallen on hard times, rent a dilapidated castle. They barely have enough to eat and live in hopes that their father will resume his writing which brought him fame and for awhile, a good income. The characters include the dysfunctional father, an artistic and rather impractical step-mother, Cassandra's older sister who longs for a swain, a younger brother and a young man who has lived with them ever since his mother died.They live quite isolated in the castle, with little hope in sight that their situation will improve. Overnight, it all changes as an American family moves into the local manor house. The older sister sees the opportunity for an advantageous marriage that could save the whole family. Cassandra records the whole scenario in her journals.Life isn't simple any longer and Cassandra finds new feelings that stir her up and complicates the situation. A wonderful coming-of-age story told beautifully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AZP8NJTQTXDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXU4R46#wasThisHelpful","R3AZP8NJTQTXDF","A1K9IG5MP8RW75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IG5MP8RW75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you don't want to run out to the store every few days for milk, keep some of this on hand. It's easy to mix up and chill, then drink or use in coffee or recipes. You can even put it in powdered form in recipes to get more calcium.Ingredients are nonfat dry milk, vitamin A Palmitrate, Vitamin D3.The first time I made it, I followed the directions and put water in the container then dumped in the powder and shook it up. Turned out a sludge settled in the bottom and didn't get dissolved. The second time, I put the water in a bowl, added the powder and stirred it with a whisk. Then I poured it into my milk jug. No problems with undissolved powder this time.Tastes like milk, convenient to keep on the shelf, great product to have on hand. The only problem for me, given the amount of milk I use, is this runs out way too soon.

"Lucille Ledoux narrates her parent's story and then her own first 30 years to her son, Denis. He wrote these down and I'm so glad he did.This memoir gave me insight into the life of my own Franco-American mother-in-law as there were many parallels to her life. Lucille's parents left Thetford Mines, Quebec to make a life in Lewiston in southern Maine. So many immigrated from Canada in that early part of the century, that French-speaking communities sprang up around the mills where many of them worked.Lucille tells stories of her school years and of growing up in a large family. The eldest of 12 children, she had to assume some of the care of the younger ones while she was still a child. It was a hard life, but families helped each other out and times gradually got better.The story continues into Lucille's adulthood and her marriage. The time includes the Great Depression and World War II where her husband was away in the war. I found it a most enjoyable read since I love these homespun memories. I wish more people would take the time to collect their parents' stories and commit them to paper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPQQ489UWSYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH94K32#wasThisHelpful","R3MPQQ489UWSYD","A1K9IG5MP8RW75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IG5MP8RW75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He left his overcrowded, abusive home to live on the streets. Bullied and extorted by street kids, newspaper boys, he gets taken under the wing of a bigger bully and learns to kill and steal.Third is Seamus McGregor, born in Scotland who took over his father's blacksmith work on his death. Raised in a supportive and moral home, he left for Canada and then the U.S. to earn money to send his family.Time progresses and in the 1890s gold is discovered in the Yukon.

"This is a memoir telling the story of growing up as one of 7 children in the 1950s. The setting is Australia both rural and small town. The author creates vivid scenes of a sometimes idyllic childhood, yet hints at the secrets her mother kept from them. There was an earlier husband and children that were taken from her.The last part of the book is the author's attempt to learn more about the experience of her half-siblings who grew up separated in orphanages. Although that part lacks the flow and the warmth of her childhood memories, it's an important contribution to the history of Australia's institutionalized children of that era.I see now that there was an earlier book that she wrote about her mother's life explaining what happened to her and her children in that first marriage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAZJ3YRRDJFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGPLWLI#wasThisHelpful","R1FAZJ3YRRDJFU","A1K9IG5MP8RW75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IG5MP8RW75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Callie and Luke both have some raw feeling from bad relationships in the past. In this short romance, the pair seem to have moved past those to find a solid relationship together. They even share a house and Callie hopes they have a long future together.Too easy, eh? Well, the fly in the ointment soon appears. It's Luke's former lover, Victoria, who he thought was well out of the picture. Their meeting is accidental but Victoria never misses a chance to bring a man to heel. He warns her off, but the thought of taking Luke away from his new love is irresistible to selfish Victoria.The suspense begins as the reader wonders how far will Victoria go to spoil Luke and Callie's relationship. The characters develop over the short span of the story with Callie feeling vulnerable and insecure in Luke's feelings and Luke struggling with a reluctance to bring up past issues and his difficulty in articulating his true feelings.There are some tense scenes and some pretty sexy ones too that keep the story moving. There are 2 more stories in this series but this one easily stands alone. You aren't left hanging.Apparently the next book features Callie's best friend who is a real estate agent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2IYVNQ2QYRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M4U4N5W#wasThisHelpful","R2E2IYVNQ2QYRC","A1K9IG5MP8RW75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IG5MP8RW75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hard to believe it came out 50 years ago, but Elsie Lee has some devoted fans who will want to check it out.The publisher didn't know quite what to do with a sexy, smart, liberated career girl novel, so they marketed this with a slutty cover and lurid blurb.

Too many male bodies had possessed her, the girl with the soul of a courtesan combined with the morals of a geisha.

"This book made me glad that no children came along as baggage in my second marriage. The syndrome described by the author is all too common from stories I hear from my twice-married friends. It's the dad trying to make up for the divorce by giving his kids more than he should, teaching them to be dependent and always asking for more.It's no fun being trapped as a stepmom with grown stepchildren plaguing their re-married dad and making life miserable. Kerry Kendall found a way to cope with counseling, girlfriends and a glass of wine. She turned the horrifying downward spiral of her stepkids into a fun read.Each chapter is another part of the saga, the train wreck that is her life. I couldn't stop reading as I couldn't wait to find out what the next disaster was and how she applied her wicked sense of humor to it.I've heard the author read from this book and it's even funnier in person, probably due to her experience as a television reporter.

"Growing up in a remote coal mining village in England, Winifred Foley tells the little stories of family hardships and the love that kept them going. Her memoir is of the 1920s but the village in the Forest of Dean could have been in the 1800s. No running water, meat only for Sunday and bread spread with lard for the rest of the week.It was a hard childhood but she captures the reader with her descriptions of playing in the forest, her memories of her grandparents and aunties, and her childish tribulations (no doll, no pretty dress to wear to the school performance).  At 14, she must go into service to lessen the burden on the family. The second half of the book recounts the difficulties of adjusting to different households often with stingy mistresses who overworked her.I stayed up late reading this one and didn't want to stop. A masterful, very personal glimpse into the past.The last 10 pages might better have been left off. She skimpily mentions her interest in Socialism and then her first sexual experience. It seems abrupt and lacks the eloquence of the rest of her memories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG4F1SFRCPR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0349122180#wasThisHelpful","R2CG4F1SFRCPR6","A1K9IG5MP8RW75","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K9IG5MP8RW75?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There was no explanation of how he markets these other than getting the SEO right starting out.Can someone else read this and do the same?

"I usually load up my Kindle with free books, but this one looked so good, I paid for it. I'm glad I did.It reminds me of Half-Broke Horses by Jeannette Walls. The writer retells the stories she heard from her grandmother and does it in such a way, that you feel you are hearing them first-hand from Maude herself.She didn't have an easy life and her problems parallel the early times around the turn-of-the-century in Missouri, on into the hard life of the Great Depression, the migration to find work in the north, struggle to adjust to big-city life, sending sons off to WWII, etc.It's not a dry history book, it's the life of one woman struggling to care for her family.

I discovered it while working on genealogy and finding I have an ancestor who served in Company A of this regiment.It includes first-hand accounts from recruitment to mustering in, and training. As the chapters progress, you learn about incidents, often humorously told, of long days marching, nights huddling in a tent with rain running through it and of foraging for food to supplement the rations.There is great detail on the Siege of Vicksburg, descriptions of scenery and people...

"I enjoy reading childhood memoirs from this era, but this one had the novelty of being an Australian childhood and teen years rather than the more common American ones.Fun to read, and you'll learn a lot about the typical activities of kids in that era. Some of the family scenes were funny. The author's father was British and her mother was a New Zealander. Their adjustment to living in Australia adds further dimension to the memoir.Towards the end of the book, the author does some backpacking and you get thumbnail sketches of traveling in Turkey, around Asia, and Europe.

"In this go around, Reacher gets off a train, and a woman comes to him, thinking that Reacher is someone else.  The woman is Michelle Chan, ex FBI and now a PI, and she's looking for her missing partner. Soon Reacher joins the search, and uncovers something much, much, bigger. That's all I want to say about the plot.Wow, this is a clunker. The downward spiral continues. There are so many problems with it. 1) It's far too long.  This book was easily 100-150 pages too long.  If you cut that you, then you'd have a nice tight story.  2) We get page after page of useless description on non essential things and places. We get an endless inner monologue by Reacher, and it just drags the plot down.  Honestly, at one point, I wasn't sure if Reacher was fighting, or planning his moves. 3) It seems that plot gets dragged out for no reason, it just adds to the tedious mind numbingly plot, it's fluff, and nothing more.  4) There's a repetitiveness of terms and sayings, it grew old, really fast. Okay, we get it, do we have to hear the same phrase over and, and over, and over, and over?  5) The female character was flat and boring. 6) Reacher obsessed on finding out what the town is called ""Mother's Rest"". To be honest, it was a distraction. 7) Either one of two things have happened, 1-Lee Child just doesn't care anymore, or 2- He's having the book ghost written. Ever since The Affair, and when the Reacher movie came out, the books have changed. Either way, I'm kind of let down by Child.Now, that all being said, there was one good part of the book that I really liked...at the end, there was a plot twist. It was one I didn't see coming.There have been rumors that Child is planning on killing off Reacher pretty soon. If this is the case, then he better give Reacher an honorable death. Personally, I'd love if Child just ended the series, and keep Reacher alive, it'd be nice to know that Reacher is still out there.

"This is a very solid follow up to the first  book.  This time Flea is ""fitting in"" to the life at the North Pole.  Soon he find outs that Jack Frost is planning an attack, Frost can't be found. Flea soon finds out that the danger is much, much closer than he thinks and soon finds that he's been betrayed by someone. With all of this going on, he learns some new things about his family.  Honestly, that's all I can say about the plot, anything more would be spoilers.I really liked how Flea was fitting in. He took part in some snow games and against many different people that's at the North Pole. Think of it as the Triwizard Torment from the Potter books. After this is done, Flea learns of an attack at from Jack Frost, but soon Flea learns that everything isn't as it seems. I really like that the character of Flea is growing and developing.I can't enough good things about this book series.

"In this go around, Kari's brother has been kidnapped and it's up to Kari and her friends to get her brother back. The thing is that Kari has to go up against an unseen force, and when all the puzzles pieces are in place, Kari isn't ready for what she has to face, who she has to face, and the sacrifices that it brings. She also has to get help form a total stranger.Overall, it was an okay read at best. The reason I gave it four stars was because I really liked the ""End Game"" that Sealed with a Lie has. I can't really say too much because it would involve a lot of spoilers and I want the reader to discover them on their own.That being said, this wasn't a perfect read. I grew tired of Kari's worrying about her brother. She's worried, I get it. But do we have to heard about it every other page? It was just so over the top for me. Say it one or twice, but that's it. We know she's worried about her brother, that's why she wants to rescue him, we get it. Also I could have done with out all the times that Kari is checking someone one out, I can't say who, but then says, ""I don't like him"". It was done over and over, and was annoying. Then this author did one that's a major pet peeve of mine, and that's using parentheses when she writes. I loathe that, it just grates on my nerves. Anything an author puts in a parentheses is nothing more than meaningless jibber-jabber. It adds nothing to the story.Overall, this was an okay read, not as good as the first, but I liked it enough. I really liked the End Game.

"I saw this had it's fair share of poor review, so I took a gamble on it, not sure what to expect. I'm glad I picked it up, because it was such a good read. Suzanne's boyfriend, Joe, is shot in the line of duty, and has to spend time with her so he can recuperate. As the story develops, someone is after Joe, and knows exactly where Joe is, and goes after him. With this going on, someone from Suzanne's past is also after her, and this person knows where Suzanne is. That's all I really want to say about the plot, anything more would be spoilers. Some things happen with secondary characters that just add a nice touch to the book/series.One part I really liked was the we, as the reader, get the point of view from the person that's after Joe. It was a nice touch. For me, the series is still fresh and new and keeps me glued to the page, and that's all I can ask.

"I had such high hopes for this book. For me, this series is a hit and miss, with most of them being good. This isn't one of them.To make a long story short, Tricia's sister has a secretary, nobody liked her, and she was found dead. It's up to Tricia and her sister to solve the murder.This had such a shot at being a good book As Tricia digs into the victim's murder, and finds some pretty shocking things her. To me, that was really good and interesting. I actually wanted to find out more about it. The problem is that there was so much fluff to it. There was one plot line about Tricia's ex and a love triangle. For me, that didn't work, and it had a very creepy element to it. It was just uncomfortable to read. Also to add to the fluff, Tricia learns something about her past, a deep dark family secret. Just more fluff.I so wanted to like it, but it was a major letdown.

"First off, I really wanted to like this. I really liked the first one in the series, and I was really wanted to like this one. This was a major let down.First off, there's far too much fluff.  The first 20 pages are a complete waste. She talks with her friends about solving a ""Locked Room Mystery"". It has nothing to do with the plot (and I use that term loosely) and just drags us down with useless information. Then we get to what I thought was the ""plot"" about a guy who hung himself, but it was actually murder and Mack solves it. The problem is that she solves it quickly, and that lead to another case for her to solve. In other words, it was a total waste of time.  Secondly, the writing style is pretty bad. Some characters talk, just to talk, and it was tedious to read and grew steadily on my nerves.Normally, I'd say get this book at the library, but don't even waste your time. Life is far too short to waste time on reading books like this.

When I found out that the series was going to be continued in books, I was excited, I couldn't get this fast enough, boy was I let down.There are so many things wrong with this. 1-This is just a retelling of the plot, but with a few things added. 2- The start was confusing and hard to follow. From what I able to get from it, it was terrorists mad at each other, and some shooting.  3- The writing style is horrible. It was as if an elementary school child wrote it.  It was complete with BAM! WHAM! BANG! SMASH! For a second or two, I thought I was watching the old Batman (The one with Adam West) TV series. 4-The language. What was the purpose with all the swearing. It's not necessary. 4-The sex in the book was over the top. Come on, The Pretender has nothing to do with sex. It was a joke.Over all, skip it.

"This silk scarf from the Chinese direct-sales brand Simplicity is a really impressive one in appearance, that could easily pass for a much more expensive gift if it's repackaged before giving. Despite the page title, the variety I received (B10634), like one of the other three choices, is a design apparently derived not from Van Gogh but from Klimt's Tree of Life, covered in curlicues in a gorgeous color gradient from deep earthy orange at one end to deep ocean blue at the other. This, combined with the scarf's length, allows for lots of variety in how you wear it. The material feels good it's not going to pass for Herms, but it's smooth and attractively lustrous, with a nice hand and rolled edges and the printing is high-quality.Really, the only sign of the budget price is the packaging, a simple cellophane wrapper within a protective ziploc bag. If you're buying for yourself, that shouldn't be a problem at all and if you're giving it as a gift, I'd recommend simply repackaging it before giving. The scarf's folded size as shipped is 9.5"" x 11"", so a flat presentation box such as this or this should do nicely; and after re-wrapping it, you could tell someone you got it for them at a high-end museum shop (or just let them guess) and they'll be none the wiser.

"For the price, this Nivea multi-pack is a great deal on men's grooming products, though not all the components are first-rate or even really worth buying individually. It's a nice cheap gift option, but gift buyers should be wary of the packaging: mine came with a big, prominent sticker reading ""Special value! $9.99!"" That's not exactly something to make any recipient feel appreciated.The individual components, all in fairly full-sized containers, are body wash, face wash, aftershave balm, and a lip-balm stick. None is luxurious, but all are usable enough, with pleasant mild drugstore-manly Axe-like or medicinal scents. The body wash is a nice basic product, nothing special but functional. The face wash has a somewhat unpleasantly slimy consistency, and contains polluting non-biodegradable plastic microbeads; altogether it's the least pleasant product in the bundle. The aftershave balm is also a fine, basic product, with a mildly spicy aquatic scent. The lip balm is waxy and nice, with only a mild Chapstik-like scent. I'm not sure I'd buy any of these products in preference to my usual ones, but they're all perfectly fine, and together at this price it's hard to argue with the assortment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3066XONWVOSHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYY6UWE#wasThisHelpful","R3066XONWVOSHC","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Some assembly is required the arm mounts to the base with a couple of very small screws, and an allen wrench is included, but it's a slightly fiddly process to get them in. Once done, the flexible rubber backing accepts the Apple Watch magnetic charger with only a little bit of shoving, and holds it firmly. The stand looks nice enough, and works well. It's nothing special, but it's a nice basic stand.The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9DR52ZGDLZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016Q01R8Q#wasThisHelpful","RH9DR52ZGDLZU","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Eightwins nailclipper is an excellent one, with a somewhat unusual design in heavy steel. The large pivoting handles so big that they may be a little too big for small or weak hands to operate provide a lot of leverage, useful for tough toenails. The blade is reasonably sharp and precise, unlike some budget drugstore models, and the look is attractive in an industrial way.

"Considering the low price, this Freeker is a really good two-pronged ""rabbit""-style vibrator (provided you like the smooth texture and look). It's made of a surprisingly high-quality, warm fuchsia silicone that feels pleasant and cleans easily, and the smooth sides make for easy maintenance. The look is basic in size (not excessive) and abstract shape, with a little bit of flex (it's not rigid on either end of the two-pronged head). The motor is surprisingly strong, smooth, and quiet for a budget-oriented vibe, with multi-speed and pulse operation available with repeated button presses (a long press turns it off again). It's a nice, very fun and functional choice for a basic rabbit-style vibe without the odd look of the actual animal-shaped ones, just a tasteful abstract shape that won't weird anyone out.The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD41BT7ADSXVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WQCR8C8#wasThisHelpful","RD41BT7ADSXVA","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Cupider vibrator has some nice points the shape, the waterproof use but is a little weaker than some of the manufacturer's other products. It's essentially two pieces, a slightly soft silicone toy with an insertable bullet vibe. The toy is nicely shaped, smooth and usable in different ways, but the vibe is a bit on the weak side and uses a hard-to-find ""AAAA"" battery, which limits its practicality and strength. It does have pulsed as well as steady operation, which is a nice feature, available with repeated button presses (a long press turns it off). But the vibration transmitted to the tip of either prong of the toy is a little weak.

"First and most importantly, the Remington Beardsman Beard Boss (cram the word ""beard"" into the branding a few more times, won't you?) MB4045A is essentially identical, apart from cosmetic details, to the MB4040, which is sold at a lower price. Buy whichever one is cheaper; there is no reason to pay substantially more for this kit's few extra nice, but cheap, accessories, much less its ""copper"" (brown) color or its ridiculously twee beardo branding.That said, this is a nice trimmer for beards, sideburns, body hair, and so on. It's way too narrow and jams too easily to use for a full haircut; you'll want a full-size trimmer such as Wahl's for that. But the narrow width, along with the nice adjustable guides, allows precise grooming and easy handling. It's a convenient size, the battery lasts for a long time, and the lower cutting power that's sometimes annoying in a cordless hair trimmer doesn't seem to be a problem for the Remington at all.

"The Ulak Clear Slim case is a very nice combination of protection and attractive slenderness. It's one of the best iPhone 6/6s cases I've seen, especially considering the price, and well worth considering for clear-case fans. The case resembles those ultra-thin soft and flexible TPU cases you can buy for a dollar in transparency, allowing you to show off the phone, but provides a much sturdier-seeming thick rim and more rigid back plate for protection, with air pockets at the corners that appear as if they'd help with impact from a short drop. It's still not an ultra-protective case, but considering the slenderness and clearness it's a good tradeoff; for a step up in protection I'd go to the Silk Pureview, but that's also noticeably thicker and has a less clear rim.

"This Hoover Commercial upright vacuum is light enough to be easy to move around, but still boasts very good suction power. On my first quick living-room pass with it, it pulled a significant amount of junk out of my carpet.Unboxing is easy but not instant. The vacuum comes mostly assembled, but needs to be lifted vertically out of the box, a bit of a challenge, and a Philips-head screwdriver is required for the one screw attaching the handle -- but after that, it's plug and play. The instructions aren't great, and the illustrations do not clearly show how to insert the one (and only one!) provided bag: the secret is that the bag's rigid cardboard hole-guard inserts into a guide in the front, and the rest of the bag fits behind the guide.In use, the vacuum is light and easy enough to maneuver, comparing well to other full-sized uprights. The handle tilts easily when unlocked using the foot pedal, which is easy to operate like all of its controls and attachments. It's not quiet at all in fact it's pretty loud, as a ""commercial"" model, compared with most home vacuums but considering the combination of power and lightweight plastic that's not a huge surprise. And the noise level is not intolerable.The dust bag detaches and empties easily, and the ""one-touch"" drop system is really nice, requiring little to no contact with the dirty full bag. The Y-type bags the machine takes are enormous and should last for a very long time between changes.All in all, I think this Hoover vacuum is a pretty good value.

The strong cocoa flavor and excessive stevia sweetening can't mask the underlying bitter, nasty mix of fermented flavors, and combine with them to make them even worse.

"Wrath of the Righteous is another in a series of fun customizable card games in the Pathfinder series, but there's not a lot new here for players of previous versions it's more of the same, but still fun. In brief, I'd still recommend it strongly as an entry point for people looking for a collaborative light-RPG-like adventure experience, but there's nothing to prevent you from picking up previous sets instead (perhaps used) if you haven't already played them.The rulebook is still one of the worst in gaming, with terribly opaque explanations, distracting color text and layout that doesn't make the basic rules' structure clear, and all kinds of annoying ambiguity. Short of a total rewrite by a better writer, a quick reference card would be really welcome here. As with previous versions, new players will probably spend a lot of time searching rules questions on Web forums while you get up to speed.The game, though, is still a lot of fun, capturing the spirit of dungeon-delving power gaming in a quick, playable form and needing no Game Master or competitor to give collaborating players a feeling of a fun but eminently winnable challenge. This version gives a nice sense of ""higher-level"" play, with powered-up characters. These include some fun variations, and some returning old favorites from previous versions, and feel somewhat better balanced than previous sets, especially the terribly unbalanced Rise of the Runelords, where some were borderline unplayable. It's genuinely fun to replay and experiment with different party combinations.As with the previous sets, though, there is a lot of reliance on adventure-deck expansions to provide more hours of play. You can, theoretically, design your own adventures, but in practice the variety and leveled-up progression of the expansion decks make play a lot smoother though more expensive. It'd be nice to see this already fairly expensive box provide more variety before players are asked to spend another chunk of dollars.

"The Soundpeats M20 are a great set of cheap in-ear buds, with soundquality far exceeding their price. TheThe M20s are packaged in a clear plastic box, reasonable but not great in appearance or quality -- mine arrived somewhat banged-up and dented. Inside, you'll find the earphones along with a baggie of extra tips in various sizes. I found the initial fit good enough that I didn't need to experiment too much with the others, though they're nice to have. The earphones themselves are well-made, light enough to stay in the ear without much fuss. The cable is flat and soft-feeling; the one major problem with it -- and the set as a whole -- is the amount of noise it transmits. Handling the cable or brushing against it at all results in quite a bit of in-ear noise.The sound, though, is impressive for earphones this inexpensive, rivalling sets that cost two or three times as much. I found it satisfyingly bassy and also sharp at the top end, with perhaps a bit of a hole in the lower midrange, though not too bothersome or steep. Everything from vocal and guitar-heavy music to jazz ensembles to hip-hop sounds well defined and surprisingly clear, considering the price.The M20s' sound is really impressive for earphones this inexpensive, and I'd recommend them for any use except exercise, given the slight problem of cord-handling noise.The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J94ZV1L1FB9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RXUX60#wasThisHelpful","R2J94ZV1L1FB9F","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though it works as a Bluetooth scale, the iHealth HS4 is a deceptive privacy nightmare, sharing your health data in ways that the manufacturer doesn't disclose until after you've already purchased and set it up. It requires not just the use of an app on your phone reasonable enough, by itself, for local app data viewing and storage but also that you set up an account on iHealth's servers. After which setup, it silently and without your consent sends all the data it collects to iHealth's servers! Let me repeat for emphasis: this scale has no apparent option allowing only local data display and collection. There is no opt-out allowing you to store your data only in iOS's secure and local-only HealthKit, and no clear disclosure that you are consenting by using the app to uploading all your data to iHealth's corporate servers forever. There is also no apparent way at all to delete your iHealth account once created your data is theirs forever once uploaded!In a huge and unethical grab, using iHealth's app at all means being coerced into sharing your private health data with iHealth and storing it on their servers.

"The DBPOWER BX-100 is a surprisingly okay-sounding little speaker for such a small package, though its volume is limited. It's a substantial rectangle the size of pair of bars of soap end-to-end, with only a USB charging cable (annoyingly, a wall-plug AC adapter is omitted -- this limits its usefulness as a bedside or in-room clock radio) and a headphone connector. Switched on, it's easy to pair (giving its name as ""BX-100"") and works straightforwardly. You'll want to turn the volume up to maximum immediately, as that's the only way to get it to a listenable volume level (even then it's not very loud), and use your source device's volume adjustment from there. It provides sound of something like the quality of a tabletop FM radio -- not room-filling dance beats by any means, but perfectly pleasant as background listening even for most kinds of music, as well as podcasts and other talk content.This won't really replace anyone's main stereo, or even their computer speakers or good headphones, but it's still a nice backup speaker for travel use, for hotel-room listening, or a small office desk or kitchen, that kind of thing. For that use, it's a nice pickup -- you'll just have to remember to keep it charged. For bedside use as a clock radio, I'd look for a different device.The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2ZELIOHQEJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFQ1W7C#wasThisHelpful","RN2ZELIOHQEJP","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Klymit Inertia O-Zone (what a silly name!) is a pretty nice ultralight inflatable sleeping pad for backpacking, with an impressive combination of comfort, light weight, and small packed size. It's a strong competitor to products like the old standby for ultralight hikers, the Therm-a-Rest ProLite, in comfort and weight, but the Klymit is significantly less convenient to pack and unpack, so you might want to try it out in person before buying.The design is interesting -- like a traditional inflatable sleeping pad (note that there's no foam core inside the fabric facing), but riddled with big circular Swiss-cheese holes. This saves weight, obviously. There are a ton of bonded seams, both around these holes and elsewhere in the pad to create air chambers that give the pad a surprisingly rigid structure when inflated, even without any internal foam. (All those bonded seams also make me pretty worried about the prospects for the pad's long-term durability, even compared to a Thermarest.) It isn't ""self-inflating"" like a Thermarest (which mostly aren't, either, in my experience), and needs to be blown up by mouth, which only takes a moment or two.The O-Zone is quite surprisingly comfortable when inflated, both for back and side sleeping, and the built-in pillow with separate air chamber and valve is an excellent touch, far better than you'd expect for an ultralight backpacking pad -- it might even let you dump a few extra ounces if you've been reliant on a hiking pillow for head support.But packing it is a bit laborious. Compared to a rectangular Thermarest, the Klymit is very finicky to deflate and roll; even on a flat indoor floor, I found it needed several steps. Only after first rolling it up repeatedly to remove the air was I able to re-fold and roll it tightly enough to be packed in the teensy included stuff sack. And without any straight lines or right angles in the pad's design I had a lot of trouble rolling it evenly after folding it over in fourths, as the stuff sack demands. It's not a big hassle, but it is one more little one, and added to every morning's routine that might be enough to make me prefer a solid-foam pad or an easier-to-roll Thermarest.Apart from packing and possibly seam durability, though, this is a nicely designed product and a great addition to the sleeping-pad choices for backpackers. Worth checking out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UW3KRLMHUEL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GK4LUXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2UW3KRLMHUEL4","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Summer Palette"" version of these cloth napkins is far nicer in person than it appears in the photos. The colors are much warmer, richer, more saturated; with the purple, green, and yellow, it seems sort of like a 1980s Benetton color scheme, not the weak, washed-out cool yellow represented in the photos here.The fabric is soft, thick, coarse and heavy, though not at all wrinkle-resistant; the napkins are very large, more like dishrags than anything dainty, and will do a great job for casual dining.

"The Kelty TN2 is a really, really nice tent for moderate 2-person backpacking use, with a ton of nice little touches.In weight, it's a moderate backpacking tent. It's not for ultralight packers, but it still checks in at a fairly reasonable figure, with a claimed minimum packed weight of 4 lbs and a packed weight of 4 lbs 9 oz (though those are optimistic figures; on my scale the complete packed tent, in its packing cube with its stakes, checks in at a fairly portly 4 lbs 12 oz). For light or ultralight use, something like the significantly smaller, non-freestanding classic Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 saves more than a pound in packed weight; the TN2 is a direct competitor not for that but for their Flash 2, a taller freestanding 2-person tent with a more reasonable, non-squashed footprint, and it's a good competitor.The design is a traditional, two-pole freestanding tent (with a small extra spreader pole), with a big side-zip door, a mesh canopy and a fly with a small extended vestibule. It's a fairly easy pitch, with some helpful color-coding, well-designed grommets and clips, a pole ""hub"" up top, and good quality aluminum poles. A matching footprint is available, but a basic tarp trimmed to size should really serve just as well, since it's a rectangular design.But really, it isn't the basic design of the tent, but all the little nice, thoughtful touches that make it an attractive package. The fly has a roll-up ""stargazing"" feature -- I wasn't able to test this much, but it seems nice in concept. The included stakes are relatively high-quality, durable and rigid flat stakes, not the kind you have to throw out and replace immediately. The color choices are excellent, subdued greens and grays that won't be jarring and ugly in a wooded setting. The tent comes packed in a mesh-backed packing cube that, while it adds a bit of weight, makes a great stuff sack even if it gets wet in use. The fly and floor seams are taped from the factory, so it works well enough to get started without seam-sealing (the manufacturer still recommends urethane-based sealer for stronger waterproofing, but it's not as mandatory before the first use as it is for most cheaper tents).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JIBGPM3S6MK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6KURDI#wasThisHelpful","R3JIBGPM3S6MK8","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Soltech TubeMat is a nice, attractive rubber matting system that is adaptable to many different situations and locations. It can be a bath mat (at least if you don't need a water-absorbent cloth mat because your floor drains), a kitchen mat, an outdoor mat, or many other things; as the product page describes, it seems easy to cut to fit whatever size/shape you need and there are connectors provided that allow two or more mats to be fairly securely yoked to each other.The only problem is that you probably shouldn't rely on it for slip protection, even though it's designed for wet situations; the bottom tubes, and hence the mat itself, can slide around on many surfaces (especially sloped or curved ones like the inside of a shower). To use it for slip protection you'd have to bond it tightly to the surface it's covering, not just hope it won't slide around. Apart from that, it's very much as described, attractive, heavy, durable, and useful, and comfortable (if not quite flat) beneath bare feet.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307ZVMXM3W8AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4YAQZK#wasThisHelpful","R307ZVMXM3W8AA","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This DeChunXian tea is a hard packed cake of ""raw"" pu-erh tea.""Raw"" of course means that it hasn't been aged and fermented for very long and shouldn't be expected to have the intense fermented flavor of an older tea. I found the taste consistent with that -- it's very pleasant tea, but quite light in flavor, with the dominant notes being basic, tannic bitterness and metallic/mineral aftertaste, rather than any noticeable tastes of fermentation. I suppose it can be aged further after purchase, but I haven't tried and I will probably use it all before any significant change in flavor occurs; if you're looking for a real heavily aged pu-erh, there are many other well-reviewed options on Amazon, like Longrun.The tea is high-quality, and seems to me basically worth the price, with nice long leaves and very little of the junk or twigs you sometimes see in a cheap pressed tea brick. It holds up to multiple steepings, too (the comically badly translated directions suggest 1-2 minutes steeping time, with longer times for later pots, but I found waiting a bit longer produced a richer tea, perhaps because I couldn't really understand the suggested portions either).The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EINTJSW1F3XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWMUWYS#wasThisHelpful","R2EINTJSW1F3XZ","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mild insecticidal soap from Miracle-Gro seems to work well against aphids and other common garden bugs. Like all the similar potassium-fatty-acid soaps you have to spray heavily enough to cover the whole plant, or all the bug-affected surfaces, so you'll want to give it a little time. Competitors' products (e.g. Safer) are quite similar, and if you're willing to dilute and use your own sprayer, buying concentrate may be a cheaper way to go; myself, I like the pre-mixed form for convenience.Unlike some sprays it ships nicely packaged, with the spray head packed separately so the product remains securely capped and sealed in transit.

"This battery-powered wireless mouse by Tonor is a perfectly fine, basic mouse with good feel on top but some poor design decisions on the bottom side. The battery compartment is hard to open, hard to insert the non-included AAA batteries in (the top one keeps popping out and has to be wedged at just the right angle), and hard to store the USB dongle in (there's a provided spot, but it sticks in very tightly and is hard to remove). Apart from that it's a nice mouse. The button feel is clicky and positive, the scroll wheel is excellent, the shape is comfy, and the finish is grippy.

"This bag from Avber is a very nice PU ""leather"" school-bag style tote in a size between purse and briefcase. It's small enough to work as a fashionable handbag but big enough for a guy to get away with, too.The bag is packed nicely, with paper stuffing to retain its shape and a two-layer overwrap to keep it from harm in shipping. Unpacking is easy and there's not much of the unpleasant vinyl offgassing smell that I encountered with another Avber bag. A thin, low-quality strap is included within the bag.The material is fairly heavy, soft and supple fake leather in two colors, an orange-brown stippled print for most of the bag and a burgundy accent color. It won't fool anyone into thinking it's leather up close, but it is soft and pleasant to touch. (I was reminded of '70s car seat vinyl, but in a good way, if that makes sense.) The top flap is two full layers of material, so quite heavy. Edge trim is nice if not totally neat, and the fasteners and fittings are a really nice slightly dull/antiqued brass, better than the ones on another Avber bag I tested. Magnetic closure on the two straps makes it easy to open and shut. There's a thin fabric lining with a few convenient pockets as well.All in all, this is a really nice bag and I'm looking forward to using it a lot.

"The Tendak SuperSpeed is a nice, basic, fast and functional USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet network adapter.Though a mini-CD of drivers (shudder) is included in the basic plastic-bag packaging, it doesn't actually need them. It works seamlessly with Mac OS X, showing up immediately as an interface named ""USB 10/100/1000 LAN"" in the network settings. Speed is just as good as expected (though I didn't test it rigorously, I transferred a few files and found perceived speeds as fast as built-in Ethernet or high-speed wireless-N). The adapter is not ultra-compact, and it does run slightly warm in use, which worries me a bit about longevity, but at this price it's hard to complain.

"Tauri's clear case for the Apple Watch is okay for basic scratch protection, but not really an impressive product.It's made of that thin, clear, rubbery polyurethane plastic that you see on ultra-cheap iPhone cases, and if it sold for their prices (say, at most a buck) it might be worth considering. But even so, it's neither attractive nor easy to use -- inserting the watch is very difficult, involving an awful lot of stretching and fiddling along with removing the band (which is hard to re-remove once the case is on). And once on, it cheapens the look of the watch considerably in exchange for not that much protection. I guess if you are planning to wear the Apple Watch while doing action sports or construction work the tradeoff might be worth it (though you might really want to consider a more armored outer-shell case instead), but for most wearers this is probably not going to be a very useful product.The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18BXDN5DIQ7FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUEBTM2#wasThisHelpful","R18BXDN5DIQ7FO","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Impressions sheet set is made from relatively nice-looking, soft-feeling microfiber, but it's still a 100% synthetic (polyester) fabric. The set (2 smallish standard pillowcases, fitted and flat sheets) is delivered in a basic zipped vinyl package. Construction and stitching are basically fine but wouldn't win any awards for neatness. The fitted sheet has good elastic running all the way around the perimeter, a good touch for a cheap sheet set, since sometimes only the corners are elasticized.The fabric is lustrous, almost to the point of being shiny, with attractive subtle gray stripes that run vertically on the bed. The feel of the fabric is very soft and smooth, but also a bit plasticky; it retains a lot of static electricity (feeling a bit strange and charged against body hair) and doesn't breathe well -- I felt very clammy sleeping under these sheets compared to cotton, which breathes better. Between these problems and the way microfiber retains smells so much more quickly than cotton, I didn't really enjoy my trial run with these sheets much, and I'll be switching back to cotton sheets immediately. Even similarly low-priced cotton sheets, to me, seem to breathe and feel much better.

"This Geoffrey Beene silk robe is made from a very nice-feeling silk fabric and is attractive and pleasant to wear, but the rest of its presentation isn't quite commensurate with the luxury price tag. If you're giving it as a gift, you'll want to order in time to repackage it: the robe comes packaged in nothing more than a plain, clear plastic bag (the one mine came in was pretty dirty, even) with a white cardboard folder, more like a shirt from a cheap department store than a luxury product (you'd really expect at least a nicely designed cardboard box or something from most clothing at this price). And you'll want to use scissors to remove the hang tag boasting about Beene's charitable giving, since the silk fabric seems too fragile to pull.So the whole unpacking experience is kind of poorly thought out and un-luxurious, but once the robe is unpacked, it's pretty nice. The silk material is lustrous without seeming too glitzy, soft and thin, and yet pleasantly warm and breathable as only silk is -- its feel and look are simply wonderful. The white piping is more prominent than the photos here show, and quite attractive. There are two small hand pockets. The stitching is generally okay but not especially high-quality given the price -- mine had several loose threads and poorly-sewn overlocking at the seams, but nothing too bad. There's a sewn-in size tag in the neck that is quite itchy and annoying, a bit of an oversight in comfort and possibly something you'll want to remove.Here are some measurements from my Medium (taken lying flat, quite approximate):Length collar-hem: 49""Chest armpit-armpit: 26""Waist seam-seam: 23""The robe fits fairly well and forgivingly, but note that it's pretty long, perhaps longer than depicted in the photos -- it hits midway down the calf for me, not too high above the ankle. The sleeves, chest, and waist are all pretty much true to size, generous without being ridiculous. If you overlap the lapels enough and cinch the belt tightly, it can be worn in a not-too-baggy way (given that it's still a robe, of course), but it's cut in a way that will forgive wearers of most weights and sizes.If you're looking for a luxurious silk robe for yourself, this Beene will be a pleasure as soon as you throw out the packaging; if you're giving it as a gift, it will be a welcome one provided you re-wrap it.

"The Shark steam mop was a surprise and a revelation to me, never having used a device of this kind before -- and I found it works well enough to at least justify considering the purchase, despite the high price.Assembly and unpacking are a little annoying (it's packed in a pretty excessive quantity of boxes and bags within boxes and bags) but basically straightforward. The illustrated instructions are a bit inadequate -- they don't show that the nozzle connector is directional, and will only click into place properly in one way, and not if you're holding it upside down without knowing it. But that's easily enough resolved, and once unpacked it's a quick job to fill it (using a provided strange little water cup that, annoyingly, still spills lots of water easily, since it doesn't include a funnel or spout). Then you just plug it in, turn it on, and a minute later it begins to steam audibly and visibly.And it cleans pretty wonderfully. I found that a bunch of scum came up from my vinyl kitchen flooring that a soapy regular mop hadn't been able to remove -- and it lifted up without the effort or elbow grease of regular mopping.

"While it's a bit of a stretch to call it ""pour-over,"" the KCM0802 delivers on its basic promise, providing better-tasting coffee than a standard drip machine at the cost of a slightly longer wait.Unboxing and setup are simple, and the machine is more attractive than most despite being almost entirely plastic, with a prominent stainless-steel outer casing on the drip basket displayed prominently. It has a smallish capacity compared to other machines its size, a nominal ""8 cups"" (denominated in those strange tiny coffee-maker-capacity cups) that equates to about three real 12-oz mugfuls of coffee when all brewed up. The machine is fairly big, but still just short enough to slot under a cabinet on a countertop. (Note that it fills from the top, though, so you'll need to pull it out a lot.) It has a number of nice convenience features, like an easy-to-see water level indicator and an attractive display with a programmable timer. The only down side to all the electronics is that it beeps -- quite annoyingly and loudly -- at the beginning and end of each brew cycle.The machine's concept is that it works like a pour-over brew at a high-end coffee shop, allowing the ground coffee to ""bloom"" in hot water before it completes brewing it with the remaining water. This means that the brew cycle takes a bit longer than a conventional drip machine (I clocked a 4-cup brew at 5:45), but in exchange should provide much more depth and richness of flavor.It doesn't quite live up to the ""pour-over"" promise -- I compared it directly, using the same fresh-roasted beans from my local high-end shop, to a real pour-over (as well as a French press), and the machine's brew was far weaker and much less complex in flavor (perhaps because of its lower brewing temperature; it doesn't seem to consistently get hot enough). But it's still a huge upgrade from drip coffee! If you like the taste of drip (better than the oily, chewy brew of a French press, still my favorite), this is a great way to upgrade to a richer brew that will get more out of good fresh-roasted beans. That's a quite specific niche, but for that use I'm happy to recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U4C5MQDCR9ZM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQJ7X8S#wasThisHelpful","R3U4C5MQDCR9ZM","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Seville Classics storage cube/footstool is a nice little item for the price, resembling Ikea's BOSNS but with a nice light-gray finish and padded top. It's made of very thin-walled MDF all around the sides, encapsulated in a one-piece sewn fabric housing that becomes surprisingly rigid when you pop the bottom plate into place (this is the only assembly required, which is a nice surprise). The removable top is heavily padded and feels more rigid than the other parts. The fabric covering, in a variegated medium-light gray, is attractive and seems at least lightly stain-resistant.When the unit is put together it's remarkably sturdy to pressure and weight from the top (though not to flexing from the sides). I could sit and stand briefly on it without fear of collapse, which I wasn't expecting. All told, for the low price it's being sold at, this is a nice little piece of storage furniture or a pleasant footrest.

"Unless you have access to a Costco to buy Kirkland Signature's more premium-grade paper towels at a lower price, these Bounty Basics are about the greatest deal you'll find. 24 arrive at your house in a huge Bounty box inside an even huger Amazon shipping box, packed in separate plastic 12-packs, in what's... if not the best for the environment, at least a very protective arrangement. The paper towels inside are, as the name implies, basic, and fairly lightweight, but with a quite rigid imprinted or debossed pattern that greatly increases their air-holding and rigidity. They work better as napkins because of the debossing and should pick up much more dirt in the little pockets than bargain brands, despite being price-competitive. Of course, they're still fairly thin and light, so mopping up liquids sometimes takes one more of these than it would of a heavier, thicker towel.

"This product from iGearPro is a very nice basic digital voice recorder with an 8GB capacity. It is quite small, with a postage-stamp-size screen that provides a barely legible UI, but fortunately once it's configured and you've set the time you won't need to look at it often.The device is packed with a passel of accessories -- everything you'd ever need and more, in the cheapest possible quality, from terrible earbuds to a terrible clip-on lavalier mic to a telephone adapter (with RJ45 cable, even!) -- which is actually kind of handy, despite the low quality of everything included, because it really expands the range of uses out of the box.Sound quality is pretty decent in use, provided you can position it somewhere out of range of knocks and vibration. The device is crazily hypersensitive to handling noise of any kind, including the button-presses necessary to turn recording on and off, so be sure to allow some time at the beginning and end of your recordings for editing, and don't talk while clicking buttons or placing it on the table. It records in some kind of slightly obsolete WAV format: I wasn't able to get a current version of QuickTime Player or preview on my Mac to open its files, but the old QT7 Player opens and exports/converts them just fine, so it's not a very big deal.This won't replace a high-quality recorder with good mics and better handling-noise muting, like those from Olympus, so spending a bit more might be worth it for the upgrade -- but at a low enough price the iGearPro might be worth it just as a disposable recorder.The manufacturer provided a free sample for this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AR1KJ4RLHK70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9SI8IE#wasThisHelpful","R2AR1KJ4RLHK70","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The TP-Link Archer D2 is a nice package, delivering quite a lot of bang for the hardware buck -- complete with gigabit wired networking, AC750 dual-band wireless, and a functional DSL modem.It's a sleek-looking and attractive enough unit, though it's also a pretty large device, and it will be hard to conceal or position in a compact space, given the large external antennas and lack of a vertical stand or foot.  The D2 asks for a lot of desk space.Initial configuration is quick and painless, and even unconfigured, the Archer D2 provides basic security out of the box as it should, with the guest-network feature turned off by default and a default password printed on the bottom of the unit (in annoyingly tiny type on a tiny label!). The device's web user interface is bare-bones but functional, delivering quick and easy enough setup. Some of the instructions and online documentation are occasionally poorly translated and written in garbled English, but apart from the most advanced settings everything users need is basically straightforward enough for a mid-level or experienced user to set up without too much trouble.Note that to use the unit as a wireless router only, without DSL, requires taking up one of its four Ethernet ports, leaving you with only three to use networking your other Ethernet devices. It also requires you to log into the router and change ""modes,"" requiring a reboot of the device.The D2's user interface is not remotely as nice as the simple, attractive user-facing web interfaces you see on routers from companies like Belkin or WD, but it's good enough to get the job done, and you don't really spend much time looking at these things once they're set up and working.The router's software provides all the basic functions users will want, though some of the advanced functions are a bit opaque and user-unfriendly compared to other manufacturers' offerings -- the QoS and similar advanced features, especially, could use better provided defaults rather than just blank fields to fill in. So far, the factory firmware appears stable and snappy enough based on my initial use, though TP-Link has seen its share of security problems in the past; I notice there hasn't been a single firmware update for this device, over more than six months of life, which isn't an auspicious sign about their level of support. The device appears not to be supported by open-source DD-WRT firmware for advanced users, limiting flexibility.Wireless-AC can be a pretty substantial improvement over Wireless-N in range and speed, but of course your computer or other devices need to support it before you'll see that improvement in practice. The D2's ""AC750"" designation makes it a middle-of-the-pack, basic AC device, without the eye-popping increases in claimed speed that some high-end AC routers promise, but in practice those higher designations are probably more useful to multi-user installations in busy areas than to your typical home user (since relatively smaller speed increases are delivered to single devices and the largest upgrades are in multi-device simultaneous uses). The D2's bandwidth should be perfectly sufficient for any typical home user for, at least, the next several years.While it's not perfect, the D2 is pretty clearly a good deal based on function, features, speed, and apparent stability -- better than anything else I've seen at this price point, as long as you're comfortable with its bare-bones interface. Compared to other DSL-router combos this seems like an excellent deal. I've been a fan of TP-Link's affordable and speedy, stable hardware for a while, especially their last generation of cheap, well-made Wireless-N routers, the WDR4300 and WDR3600, and this looks like another successful product (though I wish it had DD-WRT support).UPDATE: I'm dropping my rating on the Archer D2 after living with it for a while more, because of recurrent stability and speed issues. It has dropped and hung way, way more of its wireless connections than other routers I've tested in the same location and with the same clients.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I69FP7NYDIYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGMDGG0#wasThisHelpful","R3I69FP7NYDIYR","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Turtle Beach Impact 100 is a pretty unexceptional product, a basic keyboard with not much to recommend it over any other one. It feels basically like the keyboard you'd get in the box with a new PC, neither a special beefy ""gaming"" keyboard nor one with especially pleasant key feel for writing.  The layout is a standard extended keyboard, with some slightly strange touches like modifier keys labeled with a weird triangular hieroglyph rather than a standard label.  The keyboard body is sturdily built, but not excessively heavy like some older metal-framed models. Keyboard and keys are finished in an attractive low-luster black with a red accent ring, and a basic non-detachable USB cable (despite the box's false claims it has a braided cable) with Velcro wrap is provided. (The font used on the keycaps is kind of silly and a bit hard to read, with little vampire fangs on the T and H like something you'd see on a schlocky heavy metal album cover; it's consonant with the ""gamer"" branding, I guess.) There's no backlighting, except, pointlessly, for the ""Impact"" logo on the space bar.Basically everything about the hardware and key feel is just okay -- not bad, but nothing special. In typing, it's soft and a bit mushy in feel, without a positive click or a clear way to feel when a keystroke is completed. The ""guided sleeve design"" seems like marketing without substance; the keys feel soft and wobbly in use. There's just no reason why anyone, gamer or typist, should choose this keyboard over other, much cheaper competitors from no-brands or makers like Logitech. The key feel, quality, and lack of features aren't good enough to differentiate this from a basic, cheapie replacement keyboard.Mac support is also nonexistent. As with the Impact 500, despite advertising Mac compatibility right in the product's title, the attitude with which that support is provided seems to be ""hey, it's a USB keyboard, what do you want?"" There are no included keycaps or labels for Mac modifier keys, for starters; users will have to label their Command and Option keys themselves somehow, or live with Weird Triangle Glyph and Alt keys, a very cheap-feeling omission for such a premium product. Furthermore, the keyboard doesn't report its layout correctly to Mac OS X: when it's connected for the first time, a Keyboard Setup Assistant pops up, requiring you to pick the keyboard layout, and even after choosing ""ANSI"" the modifier keys don't map correctly to the Mac standard layout (the one closest to the space bar should be Command, but instead it's Option). This can be fixed to some extent in OS X's Keyboard Settings -- I was able to remap most of the modifier keys to behave as I expected, though some others like the Windows Menu key, annoyingly, can't even be remapped there and don't seem to do anything when pressed.Essentially, this is the kind of Mac experience you'd expect if you were using a totally unsupported, Windows-only product. Turtle Beach's claims of Mac support are questionable at best -- I notice that the product's in-box manual doesn't even claim Mac compatibility for this keyboard. Competitor gaming keyboards like CM Storm also don't support Mac users very well, but at least they don't make false claims about it. For a high-end keyboard with genuine Mac support, the best option still appears to be the Das Keyboard, though models from Razer and Matias may also be worth considering if available.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSGES17HQOG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1SCDSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1JSGES17HQOG5","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new ""Enamel Strength"" version is part of a somewhat baffling proliferation of toothpastes from Tom's of Maine, all of which are wonderful in subtly different ways. Apparently (if I've understood the packaging correctly, which I'm not sure of even after spending some time on it) the difference here is the inclusion of mineral fluorspar as a source of fluoride, which is claimed to help strengthen tooth enamel more than the regular Tom's peppermint toothpaste. (I obviously can't evaluate that claim scientifically, but I do note that the FDA endorsement only covers the claims about this being fluoridated, same as the regular one. Skepticism is probably warranted.)Anyhow, like all Tom's this peppermint-flavored gel is strongly and refreshingly flavored (peppermint), while being nowhere as sweet as the big traditional brands. (The lower level of sweetening can take some getting used to, but once you're used to it the other stuff tastes unpleasant and candy-like.) In texture this is a very soft, smooth, almost gooey paste, more like Tom's gel than the other products. My favorite, the baking soda Tom's, has a much more dry, scrubby feel, by comparison; this one is very wet and foamy. I still enjoyed the experience of brushing with it, and it left my mouth feeling ultra-clean. It tasted even more strongly and freshly minty than I'm used to with the baking-soda paste.Note that the tube is significantly smaller for this product than for other Tom's: this is 4 oz., not their regular 4.7 or 5.5 ounces (it's sold by weight, and not labeled with its volume, as I keep trying and failing to explain to the TSA).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4E8I822N5E3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGHNT2E#wasThisHelpful","R4E8I822N5E3Y","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though it's very similar to the cheaper CM Storm, the Turtle Beach Impact 500 is a wonderful piece of hardware, pretty close to my dream keyboard for writing purposes, not just ""gaming"" uses as advertised. It's a compact ""ten-key-less"" keyboard layout (that is, it has arrow keys and Page Up/Down, but no numeric keypad), which fits even a very small lap or desk ideally for writing-centric users. The keyboard body is sturdily built but not excessively heavy like some older metal-framed models. Keyboard and keys are finished in an attractive low-luster black, and a nice braided-nylon-jacketed micro-USB cable is provided.

I also noticed that Turtle Beach's marketing photos didn't exactly match the appearance and positioning of the printing on the key caps on the unit I received.)Basically everything about the hardware and key feel is great, thanks to the glorious Cherry MX Blue keyswitches, which have a light click reminiscent of the old ADB Apple Extended Keyboard, with cushy deep travel, and very positive action (that is, it's very easy to tell when you've completed a keystroke). After spending a few years on short-travel laptop keyboards, typing on the Impact 500 feels to the fingers something like flopping onto the world's most luxurious hotel mattress would to the whole body. It's simply great. And for Windows or Linux users, that's probably review enough.The only (and sadly somewhat major) fly in the ointment here is that despite advertising, and technically, I guess, providing Mac compatibility, the attitude with which that support is provided seems to be ""hey, it's a USB keyboard, what do you want?""

"The NYNE Cruiser is a surprisingly loud and acceptable-sounding little speaker for such a portable package, marred only by a very buzzy midrange. It's a substantial ovoid cylinder the size of a mini-football or a can of soda. Included in the package are a neoprene carrying case, audio and USB charging cable (no AC adapter is included, annoyingly) and a set of handlebar mounts (which are kind of a silly gimmick if you ask me, considering how quickly it'll be stolen if you ever leave it on the bike). Switched on, it's easy to pair and works straightforwardly. You'll want to turn the volume up immediately, as that's the only way to get it to a listenable volume level, and use your source device's volume adjustment from there. It provides sound of something like the quality of an old tabletop FM radio -- with impressive loudness good enough to fill a small room, and perfectly pleasant for background listening even for most kinds of music, as well as podcasts and other talk content. The only problem is a very buzzy, imprecise midrange; it sounds to me like the speakers are mounted too loosely in the housing and tend to buzz and get very muddy around sung vocals and guitars. Still, for undemanding music listening it sounds basically okay, I guess. The bass and loudness are downright impressive for such a small device.This won't really replace anyone's main stereo, or even their home computer speakers or a good set of heapdhones, but it's still a nice backup speaker for travel use, for hotel-room listening, or a small office desk or kitchen, that kind of thing. For travel, it also has the nice extra feature of providing USB charging capacity to other devices, which could come in very handy if a phone battery unexpectedly runs down. All in all, if you need a portable Bluetooth speaker and don't mind a buzzy midrange, it's a decent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24L490AMC6I6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9ICXFA#wasThisHelpful","R24L490AMC6I6E","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LAX case is a pleasant, low-cost and fairly slim protective option for the iPhone 6 if you're looking for a shiny and sparkly look. It's fairly similar in form to the Silk PureView, my current favorite slim case, though with a more flexible back panel and, obviously, a very different look. Installation is easy, as the LAX is fairly flexible all around, and the rim feels protective while preserving button feel and function. It is a fairly substantial rim all around, though -- I found the cutout for the silent-mode switch slightly on the deep side, requiring a bit of a fingernail reach, and the lip on the front face of the phone is also deep enough (much deeper than Silk's) that it can get in the way slightly during use. Still, the LAX is a nice option and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some cheap and sparkly iPhone protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FAN33N0KZ548/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RH0IXDC#wasThisHelpful","R3FAN33N0KZ548","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered Head & Shoulders' new ""Instant Relief"" on account of the mentions of peppermint/tea tree in the description, hoping it would be a more pleasant-smelling form of the shampoo than the goopy medicinal scents usually offered by the brand. Unfortunately, I found it undifferentiable functionally -- despite the ""instant relief"" marketing, it behaves just like ordinary Head & Shoulders, with mild flake relief but not much difference, in practice, in how my scalp feels afterwards, from any other shampoo. And it seems pretty horrible in scent to me -- the large bottle I received, branded Instant Relief, contained a bright green shampoo smelling strongly of synthetic green apple, like nothing so much as coating my scalp in Jolly Rancher candies.Perhaps it's some kind of packaging mistake, but the shampoo I received appears very similar to Head & Shoulders Green Apple, not a mint/tea tree product. I don't think I'll be using it again; if you're looking for a true tea tree shampoo I'd really recommend Nature's Gate's superior natural product instead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3679G7N7THQR7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP261N4#wasThisHelpful","R3679G7N7THQR7","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Repel Sportsmen Dry (don't think too hard about the name, they certainly didn't) is a very nice bug-repellent product in a slim and portable aerosol spray can. It seems like a direct competitor to [[ASIN: Off Deep Woods Dry]] and works just as well. It feels dry almost instantly after application, has no strong smell at all, and is easy to apply.Because of its relatively high concentration of DEET I preferred applying it mostly to clothing, not skin -- though the directions for the Repel don't have any strong cautions, so other users may not worry as much as I did. Repel also has non-aerosol products in a variety of forms -- from stick to pump -- if you prefer those.As a primary repellent for hardcore outdoorsmanship I've become a big believer in permethrin leave-in clothing repellent, but you always need a spray to supplement that and to touch up exposed skin.

"(Be aware: several different Inateck products are grouped under this Amazon listing, and the unwieldy product names may make the reviews hard to distinguish.)This Inateck sleeve is a handsome, minimalist gray felt fabric case for the Kindle Voyage. It's made of a soft, thick felt fabric which is cushy enough to provide some bump protection, though I wouldn't want to test it on any severe drop. The quality of construction is very good, with handsome stitching around three edges and a nice-feeling faux-leather tab, attaching via Velcro, at the top; the top of the case also has a separate small Velcro closure. The top tab, rather ingeniously, connects to a small strap that runs beneath the Kindle when inserted within the case, making for very easy removal -- you just tug on the tab and the Kindle slides right out. I found the case fit my Kindle Voyage, as well as naked (fitting slightly loosely), even with a typical ""Fintie"" Chinese-made slim shell cover still on (fitting quite tightly, making the removal strap useful), which was an unexpected bonus.This is a really pleasant, useful case executed nicely in gray felt fabric, and I'm sure I'll be using it whenever I travel.The manufacturer provided a sample for this review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UA4ZFWWUO58E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RV4JZY0#wasThisHelpful","R2UA4ZFWWUO58E","A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZY3S7SD3QO8Z?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Dr. Scholl's product is a bit of a strange-seeming invention -- basically a battery-powered drum sander for callus removal -- but it works just as advertised and is quite pleasant. Living with it for a while, I've found it surprisingly useful; I'm updating this review after a few months because it's actually grown on me.It's packaged in a terrible hard plastic clamshell designed for drugstore shelves; you'll want to have a heavy set of shears ready, and even so it's not that easy to remove from the packaging. But once set up with the included two AA batteries, the sander (sorry, ""electronic file"") works just as expected, spinning its emery drum pleasantly against the skin and gently removing calluses or dead skin without pain or damage. Despite the dire warnings on the package against using it on any non-foot body parts, I found it worked fine on hand calluses, too; of course, a gentle touch is obviously best when power-sanding one's own body.It's hard at first to see what it offers that a much cheaper foot file doesn't, but in fact it actually makes it possible to achieve a smoother result, and to work on callused fingers and chipped nails as well. After living with the gadget for a while, I'm surprised how often I find myself reaching for it, despite my initial skepticism.

"I love the design on this shop vacuum.  The wall mount is a great feature, especially in the garage when coupled with the 21' hose length. A thick plastic mounting plate is easy to attach to the wall and from there, it's simple to hang the vacuum. There are two hoses than combine to get the 21' length. You can reach a good distance with the 20' cord length as well, so between the length of the hose and the power cord, you can cover a lot of area. The hose is 2"" in diameter and can suck up good size debris. RIGID makes a few different filter types for different uses. Mine is just for standard vacuuming, so I don't have need for the fine particle filters, etc. Still, it's nice to have that option.It comes with the Utility Nozzle, Dusting Brush, 2 Extension Wands, Car Nozzle (with LED light), Crevice Tool, Diffuser, One Qwik Lock Filter, a 14 Foot Hose and a 7 Foot Hose - and again - both hoses can be hooked together. One hose is a 14' Tug-a-Long and the other is a 7' expanding hose. It's not too loud, it sounds as loud as our air conditioning unit, so not quiet, but not too bad.

Side pockets are great for quick access to keys, phone, etc. and the interior fits my laptop nicely and safely. There are 3 compartments, the laptop is in the first one and the second and third are successively smaller. There are ""D"" rings that I sometimes use to attach my keys or ID card on a lanyard.There's plenty of room and pockets for pens, cards, mints, gum and the like. It seems sturdy, certainly for my use and I'm not about to use it to hike the Appalachian Trail.  For me, I load everything I'll need for my day in it. Then then I just grab and go.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GNOLKTDX6CT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VX1K62M#wasThisHelpful","R2GNOLKTDX6CT3","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love to entertain and while for my part, while I like to cook, I'm learning presentation.  These 4 plates are 6"" around, small but good for serving small bites. While they might not go with your formal dining room on Thanksgiving, these are fun informal plates. These are great for canapes and other small bites. They can go in the dishwasher or microwave, they are sturdy and the contemporary style is fun.One note, as of this writing, these are $36 from Amazon under 'other sellers' and $70 otherwise.

"I love to cook and I already have 2 GreenPan Ceramic pans that I love. Mostly I use cast iron, however there are some jobs better suited to ceramic pans.  We have eggs often and this is a perfect egg pan.  The size is just right to make a scrambled eggs, fried eggs and clean up is very fast. The handle doesn't get hot and the heat gets distributed nicely on my gas stove. I make 1 fried egg at at time and I've make a 4 egg scramble in this small pan. I've made omelettes too. The eggs come out great every time. If you want to impress someone with eggs for breakfast and you can't cook to save your life, beat some eggs, season lightly with salt/pepper, heat the pan to medium, add a little butter and add your eggs to the pan. Add some goat cheese at the end so it melts a bit. (Goat cheese is the duct tape of cooking.)Even though it's dishwasher safe, I can't see this getting to the point where you'd need a dishwasher. I have had cooking discoloration on my other GreenPans that came right out with a quick rub with baking soda. That hasn't happened with this pan, but if it does, I know I can do that as well to keep it looking like the day it arrived.Ceramic is better than any of the non-stick options out there, both in safety (No off gassing like with Teflon) and in use. I highly recommend ceramic. That said, you need to know that you cannot use metal utensils in the pan, you will likely scratch the ceramic coating. My recommendation is to use silicone utensils. This is a great value at $10 for an egg pan. If you make eggs a lot, this is a must own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O3173K38KHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Y20MVK#wasThisHelpful","R2O3173K38KHQ","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ZAGG Folio Case Hinged Keyboard is not your best option from ZAGG.The keyboard case fits the iPad and it's easy enough to get it in and out of the case. Bluetooth pairing work as expected, I had no problems. The hinge is quite stiff and I hope it gets better with time. The exterior of the case has faux leather type surface, which grips nicely.The case should provide some good protection, however it's thinner than other ZAGG and other brands I use. They keyboard is comfortable and functional, but the keys aren't backlit. The battery life gave me all day use.There are some minor issue I've noted so why only 3 stars? The issue for me is that there are better value cases for the money from ZAGG, if you spend $10 more or even $25 less. There are a better values from ZAGG themselves.

"In short, I like this diffuser. It works well, does a good job, has a few nice features, however it's price is high as compared to units with the same features. I have a diffuser that is $28 that is essentially the same as this unit.The unit is simple. There are only 4 parts, the cord, a measuring cup for filling, the top and the body of the unit. You don't really need the measuring cup, but its nice to have. There is a single button on the front that is not just on/off, but rather cycles through the options of on with no light, on with blue light, off. Pay attention to the fill line, as if you go much beyond that it won't make mist. It runs until you turn it off or it runs out of water. The mist stream goes straight up, there is no directional option. There is a slow moving ceiling fan, so the scent is well spread.It performs well and the mist is generated fairly quickly and covers a large room, ~400 square feet. I have several oils and with some, the recommended 3-4 drops are plenty, however other oils need twice that to be effective, such as peppermint and orange. I tried different brands, same results.I get about 4 hours on a fill and during the day, I turn it off, refill and keep going. I don't use it in my bedroom, so running time is sufficient for me.I like all the features, the design but I can't figure out why it's $20 more than my other one that does the same thing,","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEA6C6FYGIJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9OO6HG#wasThisHelpful","R1CEA6C6FYGIJS","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Viva Labs is a brand often found in my home. While I am reviewing this for Vine, I already use this Vitamin D3 and other vitamins they produce. My feeling is if I am going to take a supplement for the betterment of my health, it's best to know the source and better still to trust it. I've come to trust Viva from use and happy that they are made in the USA. I use Labdoor, which has given them high marks on independent testing for label accuracy, product purity, nutritional value, ingredient safety and projected efficacy on other Viva Labs supplements. I expect when they test this D3 it will be no different.It seems we're alway hearing about the most important supplements. Vitamin D has always been known to be important and it seems we've recently been learning that it's even more important than we thought. Studies state that 70% of people are deficient in Vitamin D and the ""15 minutes of sunlight"" to get your RDA isn't that simple, there are many factors that go into that being sufficient or not. Sunscreen, skin pigmentation, body fat, age and living in a northern latitude all affect the Vitamin D bioavailability and production.Supplementation of 4,000IU daily is sufficient for most people and should you desire to test your level, people with 40-60ng/ml have the lowest all cause mortality.If you're inclined, search for the latest published studies to see just how much we've learned in the last few years to how Vitamin D works and how important a role it plays in our health.TL;DR: Vitamin D is important, supplementation can be good for you, great if you're deficient. Viva Labs makes quality supplements that I trust.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE7LX16B92SAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JUT04I#wasThisHelpful","RE7LX16B92SAD","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Wolverine WS58V2 Portable Wireless Speakers are made for indoor / outdoor use and appear to be a second generation of this product. They aren't meant for being out in the rain, they can probably easily handle a splash by the pool, as the design is made to be water resistant. The speakers are light and have a carrying handle. They appear well made. The first thing I realized is that I liked having stereo speakers outside.  I often use the BRAVEN 805 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker [18 Hour Playtime] - Black/Black and while it sounds good, it's just one speaker. For a larger area, having two speakers gives a nicer effect.The speakers can be powered by batteries or an AC adapter and you can buy additional speakers to add to the network, which is a nice touch. I didn't use batteries, but I'll suggest AmazonBasics AA Rechargeable Batteries (16-Pack) if you decide on using batteries. The range from the base and speakers allows for plenty of distance. In my case, 50 feet, and Wolverine Data claims up to 262 feet. There are plenty of ways to input your music. I use Bluetooth, the base unit is Bluetooth 4.0. They include RCA plugs and line in 3.5mm jack as well for devices that don't have Bluetooth, so pretty much any output made in the last 30 years should be able to be connected. You can even connect this to older TV's and audio receivers via RCA or 3.5mm jack from any computer. That's one big plus over Bluetooth only speakers.With the 262 foot range, you can place the base near the source if need be, as in the case of using wires. I connected using Bluetooth and tested it outside listening to radio with coffee in the morning, background music while doing work and during a dinner party. Overall, high marks are justified for the easy of setup, use and sound.  The convenience is excellent as well, as you can place these where you want, more so if you use the batteries. (NOTE: I did not)The only reason for 4 stars is the sound. It was good, not great, but left a little something to be desired. The aforementioned Braven has very good sound and bass especially. Spoken audio, such as news and audio books were good, perfect even. It was only while listening to a playlist on louder volumes, when *some* songs sounded ""muddy"" and only occasionally.Overall, I'm quite happy with the Wolverine WS58V2 Portable Wireless Speakers. The are easy to setup, use and as long as you aren't expecting the same audio as a Vegas pool party, I think most people will be happy with the sound overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CMLHQ8VWIX74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01686P1XA#wasThisHelpful","R3CMLHQ8VWIX74","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's become so much more important to guard one's personal information and with documents containing your personal information, shredding them is a very secure option. I've had my identity stolen, no idea how, but between online precautions and shredding, I feel safer.The Sentinel FX124BC is a highly capable shredder for the home or small office. Beyond the high capacity, which can take the advertised amount, or heavy paper stock and go right through staples, it also crosscuts. That makes confetti basically and good luck trying to piece even a little of that together. It's quite secure.The shredder is similar to many others, the top has the shredder motor and it sits atop the collection bucket with a window to see how full it is.  This unit has a few nice additions. The top fastens to the bucket and can be carried by the handle. The shredded paper can be compacted, so you won't need to empty the bucket as often. It's fairly quiet for a shredder, compared to my much smaller and less powerful Office Depot one.I love Amazon Basics and have their 12 sheet shredder.  This is $10 less and has more features. While both are very good and are excellent for the home or small office, the Sentinel is my current pick.If you aren't shredding your personal documents, take a few minutes to see what highly personal information you might tear up and throw out. Then ask yourself how you would feel if someone were able to access those documents. Take it from someone who had their identity stolen, do what you can to protect yourself, with printed documents and of course, online.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R179KIEAS3N47/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FD2QYY#wasThisHelpful","R179KIEAS3N47","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's too many headphone choices to count and I think the Apple headphones aren't very good, especially for use in sports.The Panasonic RP-HSC200 are reasonably comfortable, they do stay in place when I use them at the gym, biking, etc. I am not a fan of the ear clips, but you don't notice them after wearing them for a while. The sound is passable, but nothing great and I am not an audiophile. If you have more stringent standards than I do, you might not like the sound quality. There's only so much you can expect from a ~$20 pair of headphones, but they are on the tinny side, not too bad and bass is lacking. To be completely fair, good bass is hard to come by in a cheap, small pair. The cord is decently long, something you'll want when running or on a treadmill or bike, plus the controls are good as well.  It's a 3 button control, I prefer the single button with a volume control, but that's just me.My current favorite for sports headphones are the MEE audio M7P Secure-Fit Sports In-Ear Headphones with Mic, Remote, and Universal Volume Control(Black).For me, these are a very good cheap option for a sports use headphone. I tend to be frugal and shop for value, so while these are cheaper, I don't see them as a good value as there are better options for a few dollars more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R49BA836UZJ3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MMEI32#wasThisHelpful","R49BA836UZJ3A","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested the Instanatural Essential Oil Aromatherapy Diffuser for 2 weeks before reviewing and it's an excellent unit for me.It is used in the bedroom exclusively and it easily covers the ~300 square feet with whatever essential oil I use. It's also small enough that I take it when I travel, which I do 3 out of 4 weeks. I just bring some essential oils and plug it in at the hotel room and it's a nice touch while I'm away. It diffuses very well and I like the blue LED. I also like that I can turn the LED off as well when I'm not in the mood for the blue light. It is very quiet, I can't hear it running when I'm near it, let alone when it's ~10 feet away from me.Overall, this is a simple unit, uncomplicated and easy to travel with.  My only wish is that it would last longer than the 4 hours I'm getting, but I understand you can't have it both ways.  It would have to be bigger to hold more water to last longer.  As I use it at night, I'm often asleep when it automatically turns off, so that's not much of an issue.The design is nice and it looks and feels well made.  Lavender is my favorite for bedtime and after 10 minutes or so, the entire room smells softly of lavender.  This small unit does a very good job at diffusing the essential oils. I'm very happy with it and how it performs.**I received this product free or at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.

"I've been tempted to buy some inexpensive phone cases and while some are good, I end up buying a case from Speck or OtterBox. Why? I need my phone and while it's rare that I drop it, it's happened. The last time was a fluke and had a $5 case with a design I loved. My screen was shattered and the repair for my iPhone 6 was $140 for a new screen.I have 3 cases, I use one for the gym, one for going out and night and most often, the OtterBox Defender for all other times. I'll be straightforward, changing cases can be a pain to do or to remember to do.  When I am traveling in state or internationally, I love the no worry that I have with the case.The case fits my iPhone 6 very well. It's a snug fit and it protects very well. This is my 3rd Defender and while using them, none of my phones have been damaged.So if it protects so well, why do I change cases?  I have a case for going out, also an OtterBox, the OtterBox STRADA iPhone 6/6s Case - Retail Packaging - NEW MINIMALISM (BLACK/BLACK LEATHER). It holds a few cards and looks sharp, no need to take my wallet. I also swap out for my gym case to fit on my arm.I think that it's entirely reasonable to spend $30-40 on a case for your $600-700 phone.

"I take supplements everyday and fish oil has been a part of my regimen for years. The benefits are well know and documented in these review and many places online, so chances are if you're reading this, your just looking for a good brand.One of the first things *I* look for in a fish oil is a 1:1 ratio (or close) of EPA and DHA. An equal ratio is associated with healthier blood vessels,  lower lipid counts, plus a reduced risk for plaque buildup. Fish oil has shown a decreased risk of diabetes and a number of forms of cancer, including breast cancer. At 880mg and 660mg per serving, the Zenwise is within range, in my opinion. It's well priced, especially for the amount of Omega-3's you get per serving.The benefits of fish oil take days and weeks to see. Don't expect an overnight miracle. The addition of lemon flavor helps with a common side effect of fish burps. Some people are put off by that, which is understandable. The lemon flavor helps, but taking them with food does as well.If you are serious about your supplements, I'll share that I often read laboor and examine dot com for in depth information on supplements. Highly recommended.Store these in a cool, dry place, as fish oil can oxidize if left out in the sun or in heat. I refrigerate mine.NOTE TO THOSE ON MEDICATION:Fish oil can reduce blood clotting and should be supplemented with caution if you are taking blood-thinning medications talk to your doctor!Such as:asprinwarfarin clopidogrel","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQELZBBMAYPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG6ZFSM#wasThisHelpful","RKQELZBBMAYPP","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To me, there's nothing better than a good cookbook. To learn about a cuisine and how to prepare it is exciting, especially when it's one you already enjoy. I love watching Sushi chefs work; they make everything look easy, but they have a lot of skills that belie the simplicity in preparing sushi and sashimi.The Complete Guide to Sushi and Sashimi is a great book on the subject and I'll recommend that you buy it if you're interested in making sushi or sashimi. It's spiral bound and made to be used, not sit on a coffee table! This is also a great gift for someone that cooks and like sushi too.After reading the initial chapters on what equipment and food items you need, I made a trip to the local Japanese grocery store. I bought all necessary ingredients and equipment to make sushi and sashimi. I bought my first Japanese steel knife recently as well. It wasn't 100% necessary to make have, but it sure helps. It's crazy sharp and is a pleasure to use. It's the Tojiro DP Gyutou - 8.2"" (21cm) and I love it.The book is laden with great photos, something I appreciate when learning a new cuisine. The step by step instructions make it simple to understand. We made rolls and sashimi in not time. I have to work on my roll skills, and the first ones didn't look the greatest, but after a few, they looked great!I'm just starting out, but feel confident enough that I have some basic skills I can improve upon.Bottom line: This book is well written, with lots of great photos.

"For me, jerky is a great snack and it's satisfying, easy to store and not high in calories.  The Old Wisconsin jerky are gluten free, have zero trans fat and contain no MSG, BHT, BHA or fillers. That's the plus.However, in the beef sticks, the salt kills these for me. I don't eat a lot of sugar or salt in my diet. The results is that when there is sugar or salt, I can really taste it. These are really salty and have twice the salt of the brand I usually buy. The texture is fine and the flavor is ok, but honestly it's hard to judge the flavor when the salt is masking themI'd try these again if they could reduce the salt, but as of now, I'd only  buy or consume these if there weren't other jerky available.The turkey sticks have a better flavor and are sweetened from fructose. I limit my sugar intake, so the turkey sticks are not for me. They are the better tasking of the two, but it's the sweetener that makes it better.The company describes the sticks like this : "" Fast fuel sticks and bites are a high-protein, low-calorie meat snack and a healthy alternative to sweet and salty snack options. "" The beef has 580mg of sodium and the turkey has 600mg. An alternative to salty snack options? More like an alternative to a salt lick. But seriously, the US RDA is 2400mg of sodium. One of these snacks is 25% of that.If Old Wisconsin were ever to reduce the sodium in the beef sticks, I'd be open to trying them again.

"These are a welcome convenience. Like many conveniences theres a trade off. Sure, you can buy a plastic jug of bleach and use it as you need to. But if you want to have individual bleach pods that you can use around the house or in your laundry (they go in with the wash -*not*- the bleach tray), these are just fantastic. I know, we have pods for laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent, so why not bleach?These perform just like liquid bleach. I was unable to see any difference in laundry or cleaning. Only the form seems different.Pros:These are individual pods of bleach that you can toss in the washing machine. No spilling bleach or splashing where you *dont* want to get bleach.Drop one in the toilet to clean it clean and fresh.Easy to store, carry and use. They only turn into a bleach solution when added to water.Drop one in a bucket with a gallon of water to make a bleach cleaning solution.ConsThe only con I can offer (and its a bit weak) is that you pay for the convenience. With the current pricing, these come out to .23 each and you can buy a gallon of bleach for $5.These are versatile and easy to use. The minor cost differential is overshadowed by the may pros these bleach pods offer. If these pods prevent bleach from staining just one thing, youd be happy you spend a few dollars more for the bleach packs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D21SKD6VMNJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EVP32S#wasThisHelpful","R2D21SKD6VMNJR","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is just a photo printer that prints 4"" x 6"" and 5"" x 7"" photos. It's not a multi purpose unit.The footprint is small, but as it only prints photos, that makes sense. This could be easily transported due to size and weight. I don't print a lot of photos, but enough that I'll get a lot of use from the PictureMate. It was really easy to set up and since it's wireless and small, finding a place for it was simple. You can print from your wireless device as well as your computer.You do need to buy Epson ink for this, as of this writing, there are no other options for ink. I'm ok with that as this is for photos and the Epson PictureMate produces very nice quality photos. I find myself finding more opportunities to send photos and updating the family albums.  I've had photo printers before and multi-use printers, but they don't come close to this quality.Epson states a 200 year lifespan of the photos, which I don't think we can prove or disprove at this time. What I can say is the clarity of the photos is stunning, the speed is pretty good but it doesn't come at a low cost. At $249.99, it's pricey, so you'd have to see if the exceptionally quality is worth it to you. There are more popular printers that are much less expensive, but at the expense of the photo quality.

After the initial cost of the printer, the printing cost per print, including paper is .39.

"The bottom line comes first:For $10, every wine drinker should own this wine vacuum stopper.We don't always finish a bottle of wine and I'm sure we all know what happens if you try to put a cork back in or screw the top back on.  Vacuum pumps for wine bottles have been around and used to be much more costly. For $10, the Kollea wine preserver will pay for itself quickly in the wine is saves.We've used it several times recently and not only is it dead simple to use, it works very well.  A bottle of red we opened for dinner had had half left and using the Kollea wine preserver, it was perfect when we drank it 4 days later. We've used this for red, white and champagne.  The champagne worked but it had lost some carbonation. The reds and whites all were preserved nicely until we opened them again, never more than a week, as wine doesn't last that long around here.This is a nice gift to yourself or anyone that drinks wine. What's really nice is I can open a bottle and preserve it, whereas before, I might not open something if there weren't enough people to drink it.**This item was provided free of charge for an honest and fair review.**","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ATFS4PF8N8T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S21B1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1ATFS4PF8N8T4","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living in a sunny state, I wear sunscreen daily.  As the manufacturer advises this isn't for your face, I only use this elsewhere. Because I wear it daily,  I prefer sunscreens like this that don't smell like coconut or other beach scents. This sunscreen goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I expect this tube will last a while, as a little goes a long way.It doesn't leave me oily and is a great daily wear and great for the beach as well.

"Astronomy is an interest of mine and I had purchased the original Super Moon In My Room 5 years ago and put it in my office. This one is much improved and is going in the kids bedroom. They love mine in the office, so this one is for them.It's just really cool. It looks great, with a textured surface that curves, it makes a nice effect on the wall. Kids and adults love it equally.The new model is larger, has some cool noises (cricket and moon landing) but the one we love the most is that it syncs to the moon phase once you set the date.You'll need batteries for the moon and the remote control, sizes C and AAA. I've been recommending AmazonBasics AAA Rechargeable Batteries (8-Pack) Pre-charged for the AAA and you can use the Panasonic BQ-BS2E4SA Eneloop C Size Spacers for Use with Eneloop Ni-MH Rechargeable AA Battery Cells, 4 Pack for the C cells.It's a great addition to a room.

"I use a lot of Viva Labs supplements and I've never been disappointed. Personally, I strongly prefer brands that I trust so I know I'm getting what the label says I am.CoQ10 is a popular supplement and there is a great deal of research on the various effects that supplementing with CoQ10 provides. My go to source is examine{dot}com, which concisely lists the different effects provides, how strong the effect and links to the studies. There's plenty of anecdotal reasons for taking CoQ10 that don't have research behind them, such as migraine relief. I take it for cardiovascular health and improved cholesterol levels, which are both backed by science.Lastly, Viva has paired CoQ10 with Bioprene which helps increase the absorption of the CoQ10.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3440ZZAZZ133M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HES205Y#wasThisHelpful","R3440ZZAZZ133M","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"XEN-TAN makes some excellent self tanners. I've just used the XEN-TAN Transformation Ultra Weekly Tan, 8 fl. oz. with great results. I should have left that one on longer, but it was my first time using it. Live and learn.It turned out to be a good thing as I was able to use the XEN-TAN Mousse Intense Weekly Tan. The texture of the mousse is great and allows for an even distribution of the product. I would do a few pumps and sections by section.  I also used the XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt as well, making applying this even faster, easier and evenly. I'll suggest the mitt to you as it is washable and reusable, in addition to how it improves the application of the product.Take your time when you apply and be sure to not to let it accumulate unevenly and rub it in well. Also, you need time to let it set, so no shower, swimming, etc. for a few hours for best results. The color looks great and though I'm usually pasty white, the XEN-TAN gave be a great, natural looking tan.  It also smells good, which is a plus.While I did get great results, I'll share that I do exfoliate and moisturize regularly. I also use the Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel (3) Blue Yellow and Pink for exfoliation of my skin.

"I play guitar and record my own tracks and I'd like to think I have a good ear. I'm far better at making the music than recording it. The M-Audio Micro DAC is amazing at improving the sound quality far beyond what you'd think is possible in a tough aluminum form factor that is barely bigger than a lighter.The Micro DAC is really very simple. It works for Mac/PC and plugs into the USB port. From there, you have two options for output, optical co-axial (digital) or  1/8"" headphone jack (analog). I use the headphone to listen to the music and the co-axial to connect to the audio system. There is an impedance switch, so this will work will all headphone types.This is a great way to get a optical/digital out from a USB port that you can connect to recording equipment or sound systems. If you want to get professional sound quality from your Mac/PC, the M-Audio Micro DAC delivers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H2Y8GC0C33I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X67G4Q8#wasThisHelpful","R1H2Y8GC0C33I7","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have two modes of skin color: sickly pale, my typical daily or burnt to a crisp, reserved for when I go on vacation. I'd like to look nicely tanned and I've used a number of self tanners to either tan for looks or before I go on vacation, as a 'pre-tan'. I've had mixed results in the past, once resembling a carrot-like skin color.  The XEN-TAN was much different and was a complete resounding success for me.I could have done it mostly all by myself but I had help and a XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt. The cream applied easily and covered well. The scent wasn't bad at all. No chemical smell, more a sweet scent. Anyway, it's good.The biggest difference with this self tanner is that it intensifies with time, so you need to leave it on at least 45 minutes, then after you've waited the amount of time you like, you shower off.  The color will still intensify, so I had to guess and I went for two hours and then showered.  It came out great when woke up the next morning.The color looked natural, the best I've had a self tanner look.  I wish it didn't take hours, but to get these results, it's worth it to me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XOG2HVZQW10W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CL2HK#wasThisHelpful","R1XOG2HVZQW10W","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a small speaker, the size of a typical yo-yo. Solid black, integrated rubberized buttons on the tops below the strap that you can use to hang the speaker. The strap can be unfastened/refastened so it can be hung in a variety of places.It powers on by holding the power button (the circular icon between the - and +) playing a 'power on' tone. If you press and hold the power button again for a few seconds, you put the speaker into Bluetooth discoverable mode and it plays a tone to let you know that. It connected quickly and easily to my iPhone. There is a small blue LED light that signals the speaker is on. The LED is red when charging.  A 6"" USB cord plugs in under a rubber cover on the speaker. It arrived with a 50% charge and I was able to play music for an hour. It charged up fully in < 2 hours.The sound comes from one side, it seems to me, or the treble anyway.  It's a nice balance of portability and sound. Do not expect to have a home theater experience. It's a very small speaker that plays sound well for it's size. At the highest levels of both my phone and speaker, the sound degraded, as I expected. I just wanted to test.This is perfect for traveling as it is light and takes up no space. (I stuff it in a shoe in my suitcase).

"I was very happy to try the Ubervita Curcimim with Bioperine.  I already take Curcimim and Bioperine separately, so to reduce two pills to one, is preferable. Curcumin is poorly absorbed inherently, so the addition of Bioperine is one way to greatly increase the Curcimim absorption. If you are taking Curcimim and you're not also taking Bioprene, it's kind of a waste of time and even mega doses won't be absorbed enough to provide any value.Ok, so now that you know that Bioperine is a must and that it's in there, let's move on to what we know about Curcimim. As an avid reader of examine(.)com, I know the most notable effects are reduction of pain, inflammation and it's one of the better anti-oxidants available. I don't suffer from pain that Curcumin could help with, but I do read up on inflammation and right or wrong, I think that reducing it in our bodies is a good thing.  Finally, a good anti-oxidant?

"First, I'm a fan of the Jarrow brand as I like their quality.Additionally, I have a 'stack' of supplements that I take, something I have done since college. Reading up on phosphatidic acid & phosphatidylserine on Examine dot com, I was able to quickly see the research, the effects and the scientific consensus. Plus links to all the studies. It helps be decide to try a supplement or not. There's quite a lot of study around phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine, most notably as lowering LDL-C and total cholesterol. Additionally, studies show a minor, but measurable effect on both cortisol and lower stress in stressful situations. I do not take these with food and it's no problem for me.My personal observations are currently limited to the calming effect I have noticed. It's there, but it's not like I've been shot with a tranquilizer. My daily diet is consistent, so at the next checkup, I'll see it there's a change in my cholesterol. There's a lot of promising information from studies and there are ongoing studies as well, so I'm going to keep this up and use at least one more bottle before I make a complete decision.

"This is a modest laptop from Toshiba at a modest price. For typical office usage, this performs well. I use it as a dedicated office solution, for email, browsing, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Quickbooks and similar programs, this is a fine option. The Celeron line of processors are slower, use less power and cost less. We have much more costly and powerful computers but for these tasks, the Toshiba Satellite appears no different. The 15.6 screen display looks sharp and bright. It comes with Windows 10, a DVD drive and 90 days of free support.It also comes with 4GB of RAM, which is pretty decent, the 500GB hard drive is also good for this size and price point. With cloud storage virtually everywhere, disk size isnt as important to some as it used to be. Connectivity options include the 802.11b/g/n wireless, 10/100Mbps Ethernet, Bluetooth 4.0, 1 x USB 3.0 port, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, DVD-SuperMulti Optical Drive, an HDMI / VGA output, Media Card Reader, Microphone input / Headphone output, so you can connect to a variety of peripherals including printers, speakers and mouse(mice?) easily.If you need speed and power for video editing or gaming, this is not for you. The keyboard is really good, its comfortable to type on, The laptop itself is quite light, weighing only 4.85 pounds.  The battery life is good, it went a full day on a single charge with moderate use and I was watching training videos over wi-fi, so the battery life was a little better than I expected. Wi-fi just worked fine, connecting as needed, but seemed to be a little weak and didnt get as strong of a signal in some places.The build is a little plasticly but at this price point, thats the trade off. Part of the build is to keep cost low and part to keep the weight down, so keep that in mind if you are rough on your laptops. We have this on a desk in the office or in a well padded laptop bag when were on the go, so it doesnt see a lot of wear and tear. I strongly suspect that it wouldnt hold up well under rough handling. If you are considering buying this for your child for school, this is a good machine for that, IF they take care of it.The primary feature of this laptop is price. Secondary features are its lightweight portability and decent battery life.  Personally, I see this as a laptop for school, office and traveling.My bottom line is that for $278, this is a very good value in a laptop earning 5 stars for what it gives your for the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJTOHK1POIGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZD8Q7OC#wasThisHelpful","ROJTOHK1POIGJ","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They have left out the bells and whistles and used lower end hardware in a few places, but this remains a good solid phablet at a very low price point.When I could write about what it doesnt do that I wish it did, I recall this is $130 for this unit.

"With pets in the house a good vacuum is a necessity. The Panasonic Jetforce is as capable as it is compact. While I used to love my Dyson, the Panasonic has the same (and better) features, plus it edges it out in several ways.Its short and small, it rolls easily and for a vacuum, its on the quieter side. Its really easy to maneuver around the house, up and down 3 floors. Its lightweight and has a handle that makes it easy to carry. The power cord is retractable! So much nicer than the wrapping around posts.The HEPA filtered bagless system is easy to empty, but one trade off is that it doesnt hold a lot, so you might find yourself emptying this a few times in the course of a full day of cleaning. Also, the dust cup is fully washable as well. This is a feature I like as vacuums can accumulate a musty odor from the collected dirt and dust.  Washing the dust cup out goes a long way in preventing that.The Jetforce has a crevice tool and a dusting brush that snap on to the telescoping wand and are stored on the wand just below the handle. You can switch from carpet to hard wood with the push of a button on the wand. The Gliding Pet Brush works very well in picking up pet fur from the carpet and the sofa. It has two rollers and they do a noticeably better job at collecting pet hair than I am used to.Overall, this is a compact vacuum that has a lot of features and is well designed. The compact design is great not only for when youre using it, but it takes up little storage space as well. Its a pleasure to use, it does a great job with carpets, tile, hardwood and furniture. Its a lot less than what I paid for my Dyson and Id say this is easily my favorite vacuum.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W1OMYJERBXJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFUVNKS#wasThisHelpful","R2W1OMYJERBXJ1","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im a long time Roomba user and I like it. I was excited to try the Samsung VR9000 Powerbot.First, its more costly than a Roomba, so I certainly expected more from it. Its very different from a Roomba, with a blue LED screen and a ceiling facing camera that helps it navigate. Its 5 tall and cleans a path just over 12 wide.In the box you get: a docking station, a remote control, a cleaning brush and the VR9000. There are 4 cleaning modes to choose from, I use the max clean option, clean until theres no battery life left. Others are spot clean, auto (which cleans to the VR9000s satisfaction that the area has been covered) and manual clean.  The remote control allows you to fully control the VR9000 for scheduling cleaning times, direct it on manual mode, set the max cleaning with the dust sensor.The remote allows you to set the cleaning mode and drive the VR9000 to where it you want to vacuum. It will then set a pattern and clean that area.  As I have pets, I have this scheduled daily on max clean. I have yet to use the remote to drive it, other than testing it out.What really impressed me was the essence of the product: a vacuum. It vacuums very well.  It cleans a 4 room area with tile and carpet in under an hour (I didnt time it) and it gets up everything. While some of the features are more advanced than a Roomba, this is where it separated itself and made me prefer the VR9000 over my Roomba. The Roomba does a nice job, but the VR9000 just did better.There are 6 wheels that give high maneuverability to the VR9000. It moves around differently and doesnt go bouncing off obstacles, instead it senses them and slows down to very gently bump them or work around them. Its supposed to sense and remember the rooms, I cant tell if it has, but it has vacuumed all areas in the rooms.While I like the Samsung VR9000, its not without the some of the issues that the Roomba has.  Depending upon how we leave our chairs at our dining table, we can trap either robot, unintentionally of course. This happens when the chair is angled and allows a robot vacuum to get it, but hard to get out. Its hardly anything to be concerned about and the worst that happens is it doesnt clean when you expect it to. This never concerned me with the Roomba, it still doesnt with the VR9000, but it just goes to show that any robot vacuum has limitations.  Also, they can miss some debris, though the VR9000 was noticeably better at picking up, it had an occasional miss. There are areas that robot vacuums will not reach, thats just going to be a fact of life.While this is about ~$200 more than what my Roomba cost, to me, its worth it.  Its very good at what its designed to do and I really enjoy coming home to a freshly vacuumed room. With pet hair, its a must for me. Samsung has made an excellent robot vacuum and if youre looking for one in this price range, this is a very good option to strongly consider.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21P0SIPMXPQJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZRJIOAM#wasThisHelpful","R21P0SIPMXPQJ6","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We make guacamole at least once a week.  This mortar and pestle is great not only to make it in, but to serve as well.I seasoned it with rice and salt, just to be on the safe side. Even when cooking items say they are pre-seasoned, I do it anyway so I know it's done. The mortar is a stout piece, heavy, but not overly so. The pestle has the natural rock finish and it's easily gripped, even with hands wet from lime juice, etc.Maybe it really is dishwasher safe, but I don't put it in there. It cleans up easily with hot water and a good scrub with my nylon bristled brush.

"The first thing you should know is these are a very different type of headphone. They use bone conduction, they do not go in your ears. It's quite a different way of using headphones, but the concept is decades old. As these don't transmit audible sound like typical earbuds, no one can hear them but you. No sound leakage at all.They are very light and comfortably fit, since they don't cover my ears, these are great when riding my bike, something I do often.  I can't explain it better than to say you can hear your music/podcast/etc but you can also hear everything else around you.  So for a safety factor, these are excellent, however, if you want to tune out the world and listen to something, this is not for you. Additionally, the fidelity of the sound is not as good as in ear headphones. It's good for me, but I can tell the sound isn't what I get in my Shure noise canceling earbuds. That's not a fair comparison, but the underlying point stands.Once you get used to the proper placement, it'll be easy to do. If you don't place them properly, you won't hear anything. The cord is 47"" long, plenty for me and the headphones are water resistant.Where I really loved these, was on a 12 hour flight and coupled with Etymotic Research ER20 ETY-Plugs Hearing Protection Earplugs, Standard Fit, Clear Stem with Blue Tip (Light Blue) it was perfect for me. I could hear my audio book perfectly, the ETY plugs dimmed the drone of the airplane and I could still hear the flight attendant when they came by.The function is good for my needs and I have use for these certainly, however, they will not replace my earbuds completely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTS8X0BUBIGS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QN43YLO#wasThisHelpful","R2RTS8X0BUBIGS","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've owned many Epson products over the years, some were good and others left something to be desired.  The Epson Expression is one of the good.It's smaller than expected, but that's a good thing. A small footprint is preferable to me. It fits nicely on a recessed bookshelf near my desk, something that the wireless connectivity makes easy to do. One big difference with the Expression line is the ink tanks. Part of the reason I placed the printed in a recessed bookshelf  is that it won't be moved, bumped, tilted, etc, which could cause the ink to spill. For most people that's not an issue, but it's good to know before you decide where to place the unit. That's also the reason they include a plastic bag to cover the printer, should you need to move it.The setup was quick and easy, the most notable feature is the ink tanks. I'm sure many people know the ink refills are a sore point for consumers, the high cost and the lengths some companies will go to ensure you are buying more ink all the time. With the Epson Expression, it's different. The printer is a higher cost, but the per page cost for printing and copying is about 1/4 of the current average with conventional ink cartridges. If you don't print and copy much, this is something to consider. If you do, you'll appreciate that you can print 20 times that of a typical cartridge!So far, everyone has been able to print from desktops and laptops, iPhone/iPads and a Samsung Note too. The Epson iPrint app is really good. Often printing software can be horrible, this one isn't. The speed is reasonable for a home office inkjet, the standard quality is very good. I'll print some photos next once I get some photo paper, plus I'll try printing from the flash card from my GoPro, as the printer has a slot for it.There are several Expression models, this is good for our home use. If you are needing features that are common in office printing, like high paper capacity, auto 2-sided printing/copying/scanning and faxing and 35-page auto document feeding, you might look at the other models.  For the home and home office, we find this to be more than sufficient for our printing needs.We are very happy with the printer.PROS:Wireless works with every device used so farYEARS worth of inkLow cost printingSmall footprintGreat printing appGood quality printingDon't have to buy cartridges!CONSDon't spill the inkBest for those that print often/ a lot","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XKJT6L5CFLXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JE56#wasThisHelpful","R1XKJT6L5CFLXS","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We spent a lot of time in the kitchen, either in front of the stove or the sink.  That means one of us in standing in the same area a few times a day for a good period of time. The Imprint Cumulus floor mat is really nice to have in the kitchen, as it is *very* comfortable to stand on. When you step on it, it's a great feeling. We use these in bare or stocking feet only.The 20"" x 36"" mat stays in place and doesn't slide around. It grips well to our tile floor and doesn't move or slide one bit. Of course being in the kitchen, it gets stuff dropped on it, but it cleans up easily. If you spill liquids, you need to take the mat up and dry the bottom. Because it grips the floor so well, any liquid caught between the floor and the mat won't dry out. We wash the mat and let it dry every time we mop our floors.When there's a lot of dishes, we move it to the sink area. I know it's just a squishy mat on the floor, but if you spend time in the kitchen like we do, you'll quickly appreciate the Imprint Cumulus floor mat. It's very nice on your feet and on your back.

"This review is for the seafood savories pack.Most everyone knows that cats are not all the same; what one cat loves another will turn their nose up at.  With two cats at home, that's what happened with the Wellness Divine Duos.The come in plastic cups with a plastic/foil top that you peel back to open. I peel back just a bit, serve a little and put the balance in the refrigerator for the second feeding. If you just peel enough to get a spoon in, you can almost reseal it.The favorite was the tuna ones, the least favorite was the salmon. Still one cat ate all without reservation. The other would eat a little of the tuna ones, but wouldn't touch the salmon. For what it's worth, they refused leftover sashimi from Nobu. Cats are weird. Moving on, the top layer is a pate, the lower layer is chunks in sauce.I am very familiar with the Wellness brand and they do make a very good product.  It's a little more costly than average wet food, but right in the middle of the pack for the upscale foods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DT2WBX7T9TSK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4GLVW4#wasThisHelpful","R1DT2WBX7T9TSK","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a brand I hadnt heard of before. The Florida based company states they have been making watches for over 25 years. This model, the Highlander chronograph, is their 2015 model and comes in 6 colors. This is the black on black model.The case is is a 316L stainless steel in a brushed finish with a synthetic sapphire crystal face and a wide stitch white on black real leather band with a tan opposite side. The movement is Swiss design, ISA 8171, a 3 jewel quartz electronic movement.  I expect this watch to keep very good time. The hands and markers are luminous and are very easy to see in the dark once exposed to sufficient light. The contrast between the white numbers and markers against the black face are sharp and make for easy reading.Swiss Legend rates the watch as water resistant down to 10ATM/100Meters, typically meaning that this watch can be worn in the shower or in the pool. No scuba diving with this one, besides the band is leather, so getting this watch wet repeatedly in the shower or pool wouldnt be a good idea.This watch is 52mm, on the large side and has some heft to it. Just on feel alone, the watch exudes a quality that belies the cost. If youve held a very cheap watch, you might know what I mean. My daily watch is 44mm, so this is noticeably larger.I do love watches and I have a small collection. These is very good looking watch. The design is quite nice and independent, meaning they arent trying to copy popular or expensive brands. These are priced well, have Swiss movement and a 5 year warranty. Overall, this is a very good looking watch that isnt cheesy looking for a very reasonable cost.4 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BE6RSJ65AON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UPTGH26#wasThisHelpful","R37BE6RSJ65AON","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I am sitting at my desk, I tend to have bad posture. I catch myself often and adjust my posture. For a while I took to sitting on an exercise ball, just like the one in this chair, just bigger. For me, its a great way to always keep a good posture while sitting.It is a comfortable way to sit as well. If youre not used to sitting with good posture, this might take getting used to. You will be forced into centering yourself using your abdominal muscles. This is good for your back and helps you learn good posture.  You can adjust the firmness and add more air if youre like me and prefer it more firm. I have used a ball as a chair before and Im used to it. However, I shared my desk with someone and they experienced some discomfort for almost a week.  It did go away and she prefers this to a chair now.This was easy to assemble taking just a few minutes. I used the included hand pump to inflate the ball. Im well below the maximum weight and at the top for height. This fits me ok at the desk, but I do wish it were a touch higher. The chair can roll on the casters, but I use the lock and keep them immobile. Also, make sure that you inflate the ball as per instructions. If this is completely new to you, expect that you will have an adjustment period. Id suggest that you give it a week at least before you decide if you like it or not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AY9W73Y7GLZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0102UUH0U#wasThisHelpful","R2AY9W73Y7GLZC","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used a lot of teeth whitening products and so far, this is above average. I drink coffee daily and wine here and there, so my teeth need some help staying white.The two part system is simple, brush with one for 1 minute, then the other for a minute.  After almost two weeks in, I have some progress which I can tell from taking photos from the start until now.  I have had no sensitivity to my teeth or gums, something common in whitening.Everyone is going to be different, but for me, I do a lot better using a whitening gel and then a whitening product like the Crest 3D.  It is working for me, slowly, but working.  Personally, I recommend 5 XL 38% Dentist Recommended High Intensity Teeth Whitening Gel Pro Dental Lab Direct!

"First, I have always been satisfied with Viva Labs products having used many of them. I find them to be above average in value, though they tend to be a little on the upper end, which is fine with me.In our house we use protein powder daily, or I do at least.  With a vegetarian in the house, there can be challenges to what we eat but the Viva Labs organic hemp protein is not one of them.  I was unfamiliar with hemp as a food, so I didn't know what to expect.The 15g of protein per serving is great, better is the 1g of NET carbs (overall carbs minus fiber=NET carbs). It tastes good, kind of a earthy nutty flavor. We've used this in smoothies, shaked it up with just water and even made protein bars with it. The bag is resealable.There is plenty of fiber as well and the sugar content is very low. For me, I'll keep using my whey powder, but I have to say this organic hemp is quite good, perfect for vegan or vegetarian needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJZ1ZBR324LH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MGW28R8#wasThisHelpful","RXJZ1ZBR324LH","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My water bottle is with me at work, gym and in the car.  I have several and after using the Contigo Autospout, its now one of my favorites. I do love my Kor One at my desk, but for me the Contigo is great on the go.  If you're reading this, I don't have to tell you how we should all keep well hydrated. That's why you're looking at water bottles!Its a BPA free plastic, standard these days, but always welcome. The body has measurements in metric and imperial on it.  The interior top has a rubber gasket to prevent leaking and a rubber ring on the exterior for a good grip.  The loop has a spring latch, like a carabiner. I like this a lot. The body is sturdy and already survived a flight of concrete stairs.  (I tend to drop things as I lock my door of my home). There is a button, that when depressed, opens up the top and presents a spout to drink from.  You can hold the Contigo, open the spout, take a drink and close it - all using only one hand. The spout attaches to a removable internal straw inside, which also has a rubber gasket. Everything can go in the dishwasher as well. There is also a lock to keep the spout from opening unintentionally, a great feature if you are packing it in bag.For such a simple product, the design is refreshing, feature packed and well executed. For $12 this is a great bottle.  Contigo states that it is not for hot or carbonated drinks, so know that.  I love that I can clip this onto my belt for a second. (No, I dont go walking about with it clipped to me). I do clip it to my backpack while biking, though. Its quite convenient.I havent found anything about the Contigo that I dont like.  In the car, I like it the best, as it fits the cupholder well and I can use it with one hand. I dont have to look at it and it closes up to prevent any spilling. 5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30N5TSL58Z8CR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YYBBYN8#wasThisHelpful","R30N5TSL58Z8CR","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I camp several times a year in a variety of climates.  I tend to buy decent gear, but I wont be out for weeks or on long treks. To anyone that has shopped REI, you know that there is a wide range of costs on outdoor equipment. The Slumberjack boundary is in line with the gear I buy. Its not the most high tech, doesnt have all the bells and whistles but it does the job well at a good price.The Slumberjack is 4.5 pounds (2.04 kilos), so not the lightest or the most compact available in a 0 degrees sleeping bag. The build is good as well, but the fill is polyester, which has proven in my experience to not be the most effective at keeping you warm. It offers more room than my other mummy style, but just a bit more for me. The foot box is generous. The zipper has material running its length to seal it from drafts. The velcro sealed padded collar is comfy and keeps the draft out. The hood can double as a small pillow, but also works with my camping pillow nicely.For the money, this is a good sleeping bag, but you have to know what you are getting.  If you need a true 0 degree sleeping bag, this probably isnt for you. Or if you need a lightweight and compact bag, also, this isnt for you.  If those previous points dont concern you, then youll almost certainly like this sleeping bag. Its true in most products that you can choose a from a ratio of cost to features, this is no exception.  Its well designed, well made and is selling at a reasonable cost. If you compare this to Kelty or the ultra high end Vilandre, then it's not a fair or reasonable comparison.My feeling is that this is for the weekend adventurer, not a professional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MALBYIM3VTRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LQF9G2Q#wasThisHelpful","R1MALBYIM3VTRF","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With everything being wireless, why would you want this? That is what I thought to myself. I have a good router and my ISP just increased my speeds for free (a little fear of Google fiber??) So with a 50Mbps line everything should be great, but I get far less speed (70% less) on the most distant computer and smart tv. As it turns out, the security settings plus the distance slow down the connection. I turned off the security and it was a big improvement. As I live in a densely populated area, I cant leave the wifi open.The TP Link Powerline solved the issue easily. It was very easy to setup and use, plus I get no slowdown. Yes, its hardwired, but it is a desktop and my smart tv, neither of which move. So wired or wireless for those doesnt matter. Now on those devices I get the full 50Mbps that I pay for and its crazy fast. Plus I still have my wireless too. Its the best of both worlds. Streaming HD? Not a problem, before it was unwatchable. Now, its perfect.Its as simple as plugging in the Powerline adapters, pugging in your ethernet cable and clicking pair. Its like magic.

"Im not a hunter, but I have a house in the foothills in Arizona.  We get a fair share of wildlife roaming, but they do a good job of keeping out of sight.The camera is really rugged and I expect that it will hold up well outdoors. The unit takes 8 AA batteries that fit in *very snugly*. It can take up to 32GB SD/SDHC cards and since memory is cheap, buy the 32GB and call it a day. At this writing, a Sandisk 32GB SDHC is $12. Maybe get a few.The mode options are photo and video with time lapse options for both. If you want to extend your battery life, photo is the obvious choice, as the more the camera is on, the faster the battery will run out.Our intended plan is to use this when we go camping, but it occurred to us that it would help solve a question for us: what is on our roof, making a racket at in the middle of the night? The roof is flat and I attached it on a corner with a complete view of the roof. We set it for photos. It took a couple of days, but finally we had some pictures.  What we initially (a few seconds)  thought was a neighbors cat, was in fact a bobcat. It climbed a tree to get on the roof, which I didnt think was possible, but now we have proof!The camera is really quite simple, yet its made rugged.  We will take it camping next to the high desert, though Im not sure its such a good idea. We could hear *something* outside rooting around. Do we want to know what is outside our tent? I do and Ill use the Primos trail camera to find out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO1LI4UCMWWJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP85YUE#wasThisHelpful","RO1LI4UCMWWJ7","A122SFGLAHQLSJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A122SFGLAHQLSJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I guess you can't complain about owning one of the finest guitars ever created.I too, have owned this guitar for about a year and a half.Upon the first strum I knew that my overly-expensive Takamine Santa Fe was going on eBay immediately.The tone is astounding compared to most other guitars.Nice evenly balanced warmth and clarity.You can ""bang one out"" or delicately pick & strum a tender melody or tune.The included Fishman pickup system that I received with mine is different from the other review.There is not a built-in tuner on my model.Gibson frequently experiments with various different on-board electronics and uses different formats even on the same guitars.The Fishman Electronic Pickup System on my SDLX is not implanted inside a routed-out hole in the body of this beautiful instrument, rather, they installed a system that is mounted directed above the inside soundhole. You can adjust the settings with your fingertip.There is a good side and a bad side.First the good side:This allows for your guitar to NOT have a hole in the body and possibly create more resonance. I like this. It also has a ""modeling feature"" that mimics the settings of a studio mic'd guitar. I think this is cool but have found to like the ""straight pickup"" setting which does not alter tone using modeling circuits...just straight pickup.The bad side:There is no built-in tuner.You cannot pop in a soundhole damper plug/ring to help reduce feedback because the ""hardware"" that is mounted inside the soundhole prevents a damper from fitting snug.The battery is mounted inside the guitar, in a little Velcro bag and makes changing it a cumbersome task unless you happen to be changing all the strings at once, which I rarely due, so I look forward to having ""string marks"" dug into the back of my hand when I do change the battery.One weird thing happened:When it arrived there was an obvious inconsistency on the higher strings. The sound would ""drop out"" and was noticeably lower in volume.When I called Gibson (and they answered immediately) I was told to get a ""spark plug socket"" and a screwdriver. Place the edge of the socket on the bridge and ""sharply tap"" it down making sure it was well-seated. I was shocked and scared being asked to whack on my several thousand dollar guitar, but the guy stayed with me on the phone and walked me through it...WHALLAH! - The sound was perfect and I couldn't be happier.The inlays, appointments, wood binding is just gaudy enough to be cool and not overdone. It has a dark mystique to it and I love the extra detailing and craftsmanship. After a lifetime of playing music full-time I definitely deserve this guitar. That was the only criteria in my justification. You only live once and this guitar is a dream-come-true for me.The neck is just wide enough to do some nice fingerstyle playing without muting or dampening adjacent strings which is easy to do with guitars that initially seem easier to play with their skinny necks, but find out later down the road that you will actually need the width to accomplish certain riffs, picking and chording.Once my hand got away from the Takamine trip and used to the slightly wider Gibson neck, I found myself playing much cleaner and more articulate...and sounding ten times better.Yes the Takamine sounds nice when plugged into an amp, same as the Gibson, but when you hear them unplugged, purely acoustic side-by-side there is absolutely nothing to compare beyond that point. The expensive Takamine sounds like a cheap toy compared to the warmth, big tone and volume of the Songwriter Deluxe. The same situation occurs when compared to the Sigma Cutaway acoustic....just sounds like cheap junk when put side-by-side. I highly urge you to do this when purchasing a guitar. Just because your favorite artist plays ""X Brand"" - doesn't mean that guitar is the best, most desirable, or even right for you.Disclosure: I have been ""married"" to Gibson for over 30 years -lol.I knew that I wanted a Gibson. I believe in the company even though they are becoming more compromising as the years roll on.Yes, the Custom Shop ""ain't what it used to be"" and Yes, you MUST have your guitar professionally setup to suit your style and needs. If not you may not be getting the most out of your professional expensive guitar.The action is lower than most from the factory, but you may find it a little high or a little low depending on what you like or are accustomed to. This is a given with all guitars. They crank them out at the factory, and you tweak them in at the shop. Everybody has different likes & needs when it comes to their personal setup and tastes. The higher the strings, the louder and more breathable it is, the lower the action, the easier to play but may seem more ""compressed"" and weaker in volume. It's all a ""trade-off"" and you have to decide where to demarcate the balance. Sometimes I wish my action was a little higher, then other times I am so glad it's not!I also did some research on a killer acoustic guitar amp.My conclusion, for the money PLUS under one thousand dollars price tag, goes to the SWR California Blonde II amp.It has plenty of power and many great tone features. I couldn't be happier, and when playing live I use a very slight amount of compression (Boss Compressor Pedal) and it smooths everything out perfectly without sacrificing tone or dynamics...in other words, Yes, it makes me sound like I can play better than I actually do! A compressor will even out the volume and dynamics so that strings & notes that are weak are brought out, and ones that are way too dominant can be tamed a bit.A full-sized professional guitar with all the bells and whistles any great craftsman would be proud to build complete with a Gibson Custom Shop logo!The photo does not show but there is a fantastic inlay seam running down the length on the back side of the guitar made of gold, red and jade green using a southwest motif.There is a nice wood bound seam at the end of the guitar bottom. (where you plug in and attach strap.)There is NOT a strap button on the neck or neck butt joint. You will need to tie a strap to the headstock or install a strap button, and I would ask Gibson where they suggest and how before doing anything irreversible.I am glad they didn't use the ""Mustache type"" saddle bridge, I like the traditional one much better!One more note:The newer models no longer use the ebony fingerboard. They are using the rosewood. I think this is probably for the best as it seems to be a little warmer than the hard snap of an ebony fingerboard. This guitar is bright and ringy as well as warm and full. Not too much bass overtones dominating the overall tone, but a well-balanced expression and three times as loud compared to most Takamine's and other imports.Buy this guitar if it is still being made!(You deserve it and remember: You only live once!)Don't forget to keep track of humidity (or lack of) with a good guitar case hygrometer & humidifier for dry climates or the winter months. Don't worry, it comes with a killer hardshell Gibson Custom Shop case with plush velour lining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TI0KP73IO9TU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00267KIUC#wasThisHelpful","R3TI0KP73IO9TU","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Punchy & Clear - High Power CapableThese might even be a wee bit too tight, but for the price I am happy with them.It takes a noticeable amount of power before these really start to kick in, so at lower volumes you will need to adjust your EQ/Tone settings for more bass.

"Installing the battery1. Locate the small screw for the battery cover plate on the back of the unit2. Using a small Phillips head screwdriver, rotate the small screw counter clockwise.3. Remove the plate.4. Insert the two AA batteries with the correct polarity.5. Reattach battery cover plate, insert screw and turn clockwise to tighten.Testing cables1. Move the On switch to Cable Tester.2. To test pins 1-3, you may adjust the Switch 1-3 selector to SW1. For cables with more than three pins, you may adjust the selector to SW2 for pins 4-6 and SW3 for pins 7-8.3. Insert one end of the cable into one of the various inputs.4. Insert the other end of the cable into one of the various outputs.5. If the Grounded Shield LED lights up, this indicates that the XLR out shield has been connected to pin1/sleeve.6. Once the cable has been connected to both an input and output, the LED grid will light up to show which pins are connected.7. Each LED shows which input pins are connected to each output pin. The Input pins are represented vertically while the output pins are represented horizontally. Ex. The LED in the top right hand corner shows that Pin1/Sleeve on the input is going to Pin1/Sleeve on the output side.8. For cables with more than three pins, you may adjust the Switch 1-3 selec tor to SW2 for pins 4-6 and SW3 for pins 7-8. 3Intermittent ConnectionsTo test for broken connections1. While in test mode with a cable plugged into both an In and Out, press the reset button to clear the Intermittent LEDs.2. Next, move the suspected cable end around vigorously while plugged in.3. If there are any shorted, loose, or broken connections, one of the Intermit- tent LEDs will light up showing where the break is taking place.4. Press Reset to clear the LEDs to continue or try again.Installed Cable ModeTo test the integrity of a fixed cable or one in which both ends are unable to beconnected.1. To enter Installed Cable Mode, Press and hold the Reset button while Switching from off to Cable Tester. The On LED light will on and off to indicate that you are in Installed Cable Tester Mode.2. Insert a cable into the one of the outputs.3. The LED grid will now show any short circuits, if any by indicating which out pins are connected. If there are no LEDs lit, then there are not short circuits in the cable.To test for continuity in Installed Cable Mode1. With the Installed cable plugged into the output of the cable tester, attach a shorting jack to the other end of the cable, or connect the ends.2.

"#1 Best Camera AUDIO Recorder on the Market for the Price!Zoom's by-line used to be:""A little bit of video and a whole lot of audio""The reason you buy this recorder is you only have 100 bucks and you want killer audio recordings to accompany your average videos.Believe me, an average video with great sound is much better than a great video with lousy sound.For one to get both, you will have to shell out a lot more money or get fancy with various equipment. This is a handy, quick to grab camera that records audio very well.You can hold this up to a savage drummer punishing a crash cymbal with near perfect clarity. The bass and subs come through most excellent. Great for concerts, loud events and people with little money.NOTE:Not convenient for editing the video files without using third-party software applications like Adobe Premier, Sony Vegas, ProShow, etc. Many times I find myself using something like Xilisoft Video Converter to convert them into *.AVI files which are much easier to work with in Windows apps. The good news is nowadays, there are many more options for editing and working with *.MOV video files than just a few years ago.This unit records *.MOV file types.*.MOV files are difficult to work with for a novice in Windows.I suggest NEVER using the included ""Handyshare"" application. It is total junk, and will only frustrate you.If you record and cannot see video or hear no sound:(how is that possible...to ""hear no sound.""?? -lol.)...but I digress:First try different settings on the Zoom camera.Windows does not natively recognize every video & audio codec.Windows must be updated to recognize all the different types of audio & video formats, just like when Windows 95/98 first came out, it didn't recognize what an MP3 file was, so you had to use a third-party application like WinAmp or RealPlayer to play the music file. SAME THING TODAY.I suggest Googling ""K-Lite codecs"" and download the free updated drivers for Windows.This will also update Windows to understand many different, old & new, file types.Once you install a ""codec pack"" (codec means ""compression-decompression"") Windows will most likely recognize the files and play them correctly.If you have the Zoom camera set to high fidelity PCM audio, try setting it to 320kbps AAC audio. This is a slightly compressed form of hi-fi audio that Windows understands and recognizes.I can tell you that Windows 7 with the updated K-Lite codecs play the files just fine on all settings.HDMI connected to a TV: No Sound?If you connect this camera to a TV using the HDMI output, you need to go into the settings Menu on the Zoom camera under the INPUT category and select Output Monitor ON. You also have to use the correct/proper HDMI cable. Some of the cheaper ones are crap. (some of the expensive ones do not work either!)Also you need to make sure that you have not inadvertently turned down the volume. This is easy to do until you get used to the little 4-way circular control on the unit. I have a few times tried zooming in and out only to find that I was just moving the volume level and not the digital zoom without realizing it. Zoom is left & right and volume is top & bottom (up & down)using the 4-way control on the back.I also know that some computers can't ""keep up"" with the large video files so easily with the *.MOV format.I recorded a 1920x1080 video using the highest audio settings (96KHz/24-bit) and when I played it back on the PC, the audio was out of sync. - When I converted it to an AVI file type, it played perfectly in sync with sharp video. I hate *.MOV files, but I LOVE THIS CAMERA!Most people buy this for recording bands and concerts because of the great audio.If you are a novice, average user and you have no special needs for clear audio at loud volumes, you may want to buy a cheap regular camera that records videos...like your mobile phone.If you are in a band, or just a drummer who hangs around musicians...this is the camera for you! (lol)Remember: A little bit of video and a WHOLE LOT OF AUDIO.I have owned and used the older Zoom Q3 (640x480) Handy Recorder for a couple years and have waited for the price to drop on the HD version. It has and I am a proud and happy owner.The audio is just about the same, but the full size HD video is a nice plus, even though it's not great video with many options, it is significantly larger, clearer & better than the older version.If you have the MIC gain setting to Manual, be careful not to bump or move the little thumb wheel control on the side of the camera when recording unless otherwise necessary. The new version only has Auto, Low & High MIC settings, so be glad you can manually control the MIC on this model, even though it may be inadvertently moved during recording.The older (and newer) models do not allow to manually adjust the MIC input gain level, and what would happen is when set to Auto, a loud sound would lower the gain automatically to the point where only loud sounds would be audible. Example: A drummer plays a loud beat, stops and then talks to the camera. Because the Auto setting(s) have lowered the level greatly, you cannot hear him talk. This problem was overcome by using the manual thumb wheel control on the side. I like it!Yes, it eats batteries like you wouldn't believe!I ordered some Tenergy Premium 2500mAh rechargeable batteries. A fresh pair of them lasted for almost 3 hours in full HD and hi-fi audio mode. Make sure the camera settings are set to ""Ni-Cad"" when using rechargeable batteries.Easy Power Adapter:Buy a cheap one dollar USB wall socket charger and hook up a USB cable to the unit after turning it on.You can even take out the batteries once it has powered up.Zoom also makes a power adapter you can buy that does the same thing.I have seen killer video recordings made with iPads and iPhones, but the audio was always terrible. This in turn made the whole video terrible. The Zoom camera takes average video and turns it into a killer recording worth watching, and hardly ever annoying when viewing loud & live events. I know of no other device that does this, and does it well, for under one hundred dollars.Yes, I am bummed out that the newer models do not have a metal camera mount insert like the older ones. Fragile plastic threads are the new design so be careful and gentle.The jury is still out on the ""video aspect ratio.""When the zoom is fully wide, it still seems a little ""zoomed in"".I think this might be a good thing in the long run. Most times you are standing at a distance and the extra ""zoomed in ratio"" will most likely be appreciated more times than not. This model has a 4x digital zoom function. It works ""okay.""I have many times found myself having to use the ""zoomed in max"" to get ""close enough"" from where I was standing.If you are very close to your subject, this might be compromising, such as close range in a small space.The ""view monitor screen"" is very small and sometimes hard to see.When you are playing video back on the camera you can make the video bigger by holding down the PLAY button and it will switch to a larger Landscape view, and you turn the camera sideways to view it.You cannot do this in record mode.While in record mode, the screen displays the video and audio settings as well as the MIC setting. This helps.I highly recommend getting a tripod or what I use, a ""Microphone Stand Adapter"" to hold this while video recording.I also urge you to get a protective case.Smaller, lighter and ""plasticker"" than before, but hey, it's smaller & lighter!(just be careful with it.)You will probably want to buy a much larger memory card. I use a 32GB card with a speed rating of 10. Zoom advises using a speed rating of ""6"" or higher.The 2GB card that comes with it will provide about 15 minutes of full HD video and Hi-Fi Audio.If you select lower settings, you can get more ""time"" but may sacrifice some video quality...then again, you may never really notice it whatsoever. This is not a twenty-thousand dollar television camera.One more thing: Update the firmware on the camera.Mine came with version 1.0 - The newest version on the Zoom website is 1.2I found it by Googling ""Q2 HD camera software update"" - once again, I only installed the FIRMWARE upgrade. I did not update or use the webcam driver or HandyShare ""crapplication."" (I just invented that word...street creds & props accordingly.)You will need to download and install the Firmware using 32-bit or 64-bit version for Windows.(see the website)So in recap:The reason you buy this is because you want to easily video record loud events that generally distort most cameras in this price range.You are not expecting great video for this price range, but do expect great audio with average HD video!If you want to ""work"" with these video files, you will need to use third-party applications, editor software, converting software, etc.(You will probably learn a bit about *.MOV files and video processes.)Use the USB port for unlimited power from a wall socket.Facebook may not recognize all audio/video types, but YouTube does.If you ever have a ""problem"" try uploading it to YouTube, and then download it back from YouTube after they do their conversion processing...for you! This works for virtually all video files.Happy to help!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DPUU46QYTMLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008TVGUJC#wasThisHelpful","R1DPUU46QYTMLL","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not reviewing this for TV or even high quality video applications.The main reason I got this TV is to use as a PC/Computer monitor.I needed a larger screen but did not want to shell out the big bucks for an expensive monitor made for PC or computers.This TV works great, but keep in mind I am not using it for high quality video editing or photo applications, though I edit videos and photos just fine as a ""regular user.""I am sure this TV is not great by any standards except for price.If you need a larger screen, have trouble seeing small text, etc., buy this and try it out.I always get the extra warranty just as a precaution and peace of mind.I had trouble at first when using with a KVM switch (hooks two computers up to one keyboard, monitor & mouse) as the switch would not support all modes. When connected directly to the PC video card it works great!The USB port only seems to recognize JPG photo files and nothing else. I tried AVI, WMV, MOV, BMP, PNG, FLV, MKV...none of those files were even recognized and did not show up in the menu.The speakers are kind of crappy but so are the ones on my new and slightly expensive 47"" LG - normal for nowadays.It stands up without the included stand, but I suggest using the stand for full support.Nice to see that it uses LED lighting. My old monitor went out because the old mercury fluorescent lights burned out.3 HDMI ports was also a nice surprise.Audio INPUT is through using the 1/8"" (3.5mm) headphone jack.Audio OUTPUT has the standard two RCA Red & White connectors.Digital Audio Output SP/DIF RCA connector.VGA 15 pin for PC/Computer video.Although it is not full 1080p, the 720p size is just fine for my needs and price range.It is so much nicer to see things larger!I am not a gamer, but again, for the price, you get a pretty good & large TV/monitor.CON: If it cannot find a channel through the ""scan for channels"" function, you cannot select a channel unless it can find it first.There is a way to fine tune the advanced options and adjustments, but using the controls available I can get a great picture.The text is fairly easy to read, but the greys seem a little green when black text is not as bold. Not quite as sharp as a dedicated PC monitor, but works well enough for older eyes, and did I mention the nice larger screen? -lol.It has a energy saving mode that will shut itself off within a couple of minutes if there is no signal present, so that works well with the PC screensaver and/or power off modes. It automatically senses a signal and turns itself back on. (energy mode.)It takes about 7-8 seconds to ""boot up"" maybe not as fast as others, but ""geez, eight seconds ain't fast enough?""Stand is cheap plastic and fairly sturdy if not violently abused.(Sure would have been nice to get this for the ninety-eight dollar black Friday price.)I paid full price, plus the extra warranty and am quite happy.If there are any dead pixels, splotchy screens, dark, etc., send it back until you get a good one.This was the first one I was sent and it's a keeper.*** NOTE: Nov. 2015 Update - It has been over one year and 7 months.. TV is still working perfectly!Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JA583OOIDAXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BXF7JAA#wasThisHelpful","R1JA583OOIDAXW","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Remember kids:When replacing your Power Output Tubes (such as these) it may be best to have your amp biased/checked for proper plate voltage settings by a qualified service technician!If the settings are too hot, it may sound great but the life of your tubes will be much shorter.Too low and your sound may be brittle or sterile lacking the balls and oomph you like so well.I have 9 Fender Pro Tube amps and have played full time for over 27 years.When choosing between 6L6's and EL34's I tend to go for the 6L6's sound that has a more ""American"" sounding bottom end, not quite as ""woody"" as the English overdriven tube sound. The bottom end sounds clearer and more distinct with 6L6's, but there is also a lot to be said about the EL34's, too!Similar to Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq, etc. not making computers, JJ's does not manufacture tubes, but rather they test and rate them , eventually pairing like kinds within similar tolerances and voltages. This is critical if you have an amp that uses two of these. This will ensure that both sides of the amp output stage are as equal and balanced as possible before any biasing or adjustments.The ""burnt silver/black"" inside the tube is called the ""getter"" which is a chemical that is burnt upon first initial firing and burns up any leftover oxygen or air inside the vacuum tube.Very nice price - lower than most other places online!Hope this helps!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257DS8CS27TS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003X5HE08#wasThisHelpful","R257DS8CS27TS","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered these parts because everything was available in one package deal!Even though they are not Prime Shipping, it arrived super fast within two days well protected in a box.The CTS pots are well-known to have good reviews on quality, but let me add my take:The CTS pots seem a little too ""touchy"" and are very quick to react with just a small turn of the knob.Gibson pots have a slower slope to them and require them to be turned more to get the same type of response.Once you get the idea of how quickly they change with a smaller turn, they're not too bad, though I find myself wishing that they had more ""travel"" to them. The range I use seems like I barely need to turn it, which would require me to pay a little more attention when playing live on the fly, and possibly over-crank the knob because I play several different guitars.If you mainly play one guitar, getting used to it poses no problem once you get your ""habits"" memorized.With that said, these are great if you want to use them to do volume swells, and if you were overly erratic, you could use the tone knob as a pseudo-wah effect -lol!There are tabs on each side of the front casing (where the shaft protrudes) that are crimped and hold the casing together, BUT, there are also tabs that are bent/crimped down that are used to lock & hold the pot, preventing it from turning. If you have a guitar that has a plate inside the cavity for mounting parts to (Les Paul Custom, Etc.) then you must first BEND THESE TABS UP. Be careful to bend the correct tabs straight up, and not the ones that hold the unit together.The Russian ""paper-in-oil"" capacitors sound better than a shirtless Vladimir Putin wrestling a bear!Be mindful. These capacitors are much larger than you think and may require a little forethought as to leaving enough wire on the ends to allow them to be bent up and out of the way...if need be.Over a very long time (10-20 years) these capacitors will probably dry out and need replacing, which after gutting your electronics and replacing everything, will seem like a breeze! -lol. The only way to make sure is to check them with a multi-tester.A large part of the decision to get this set was due to the CTS spec-tolerant potentiometers.Regular CTS stock 500K pots may have a larger than 10% variance in value compared to their rating.The 525K pots are tested, sorted and verified to be within their actual rating.The pots turn and feel almost identical to the average Gibson volume or tone knob.Smooth but not loose. Solid and steady but not stiff. Completely noiseless.The CTS pots have grease inside them for lubrication and use a quality bronze shaft.The cheapo ones (and anything cheap from China) have no lubricating grease and use a steel or pot metal shaft.The sweeping contact medium is a separate wafer piece that is adhered to the base.The cheapo's have the medium ""painted on"" and most times it does not travel as far.Save your old nuts from the top of the guitar front!Although they provide a flat washer, a lock washer and two hex nuts, you may need to use both hex nuts- one to mount inside, one to adjust the height, -leaving one needed for securing it on the top (under the knob).It would have been good for them to include one more hex nut for each pot...but no biggie!I would definitely order this again and recommend this to anybody replacing parts or making upgrades!Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18KV3PFR23G73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H9M8IXS#wasThisHelpful","R18KV3PFR23G73","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reviewing and reading literally hundreds of reviews, comments and questions foralmost six months I decided on his particular model.Overall, for LCD/LED video technology offered during this ""transitional period"" ofemerging formats and designs of the 21st century, I am quite happy overall to givethis a fair, honest and somewhat pleasant review after a few weeks of owning and usingit while attempting to point out things that may have not been mentioned in otherreviews and reiterate the main features in plain English.I also opted for the extended warranty due to past experiences -lol.OWNER'S MANUAL:(22MB)***************Online: Search ""LG 47LA6200 Owner's Manual""D/L: zippyshare(dot)com/v/81744772/file.htmlView: manualowl(dot)com/m/LG/47LA6200/Manual/361204File Formats Played*******************Video:*******MKVAVI3GPFLVMP4MPGASFMOVMP4WMVDIVXAudio:******MP3WAVWMAOGGPhotos:*******JPG, JPEG OnlyUSB FORMATS:************NTFSFAT32FAT (12/16)(I have used 32GB & 64GB USB Thumb Drives)INTERNAL TV STORAGE MEMORY AVAILABLE: 4GBINPUTS:*******Combo RGB (red+green+blue) and Composite RCA (yellow)Standard Cable TV COAX JackAudio RCA connectors (L & R / white & red)Standard Internet/Network Ethernet RG45 Cable JackBuilt-In Wireless Network Device3 each HDMI ports3 each USB portsOptional USB MHL cables allow for MHL enabled devices, phones, etc., to play.(NOTE: No 15-pin VGA PC/Computer Video input.)OUTPUTS:********Optical Digital Audio OutputStandard Mini 1/8"" (3.5mm) Headphone Output Jack.(headphone output is analog stereo and can be used for standard stereo amps with acheap male mini to RCA cable.)NOTE: There are no video outputs, ports or signals available.VIDEO PICTURE MODES SIZES/RATIO:********************************16:94:3 (gets a little squashed when screen filled)Zoom (enlarges but does not always fill in 4:3)Cinema Zoom (fills screen, plus picture size and position adjustment)Auto (set by program)LETTERBOX & PILLARBOX BURN-IN WARNING:**************************************It is best practice to keep the viewing time & duration to a minimum when viewingcinematic, 4:3 or other images that use letterbox or pillarbox.There is a warning in the manual and you should read it.This is standard on most LCD TV's & known to sometimes cause bad problems.1:10 ratio of viewing letterbox video, and/or breaks should be taken to fill entirescreen for prolonged periods of over one hour for 10-15 minutes of full screendisplay.TV Stand Base Specs:********************The modern design base/stand is a little wide at 26""W x 13""DCheck your tabletop or entertainment cabinet dimensions.Base is strudy and solid though most TV's will sway when bumped if they have a swivelviewing angle design.

Most times youcan use the keyboard, but in all honesty, you really don't need it unless you plan ondoing a lot of typing. For regular TV watching, the included remote is just as fast asthe keyboard and sometimes easier.The Good:*********Nice wide format with small bezel frame.

I was blown away.Very lightweight and easy to lift or move.Shipping Carton is not overly large and moderately sturdy. (51"" x 30"" x 8"")TV powers up and plays within a few seconds.The TV reception using a regular antenna (digital or analog) works quite well!PC or Laptop display using HDMI cable is sharp and clear.The standard remote control is just fine and does everything you need within a fewclicks.If you have a fast Internet connection (or one that isn't shared or simultaneously inuse by others downloading/uploading files, playing online games, or watching streamingvideo), -The Internet Video & functions work well!98% of the time the videos are sharp, clear, smooth without any buffering orstuttering.Be aware that when watching HD video streaming from the Internet, it can use a lot ofbandwidth and GB's in data usage. If you have a ""limit"" on your Internet plan, you maywant to keep an eye on it so you don't get whacked with an outrageous bill.I can't wait to use the Skype video teleconferencing app when I can afford theoverpriced LG camera! (LG suggested price $99.00 - don't pay more!)The 3D feature works great!You can use the following 3D modes: blurr type, the left/right split screen type, orthe top/bottom split screen type.The 2D to 3D feature works remarkably well if you take 30 seconds to adjust thesettings. Always adjust settings to your liking. Most times the factory settings kinda suck compared to what a little tweaking will do!There are fine tuning and advanced adjustment options for the 3D mode.You can adjust for intensity, mode, viewing angle (really helps!) L/R flip, Auto,Manual, etc.Start with a subtle effect level to avoid any eye strain, headaches or nausea.There is a dual game mode that when two players are playing a game and using a splitscreen, the TV can make it so each person sees their own screen in Full Screen!The Bad:*********If your Internet is ""lagging"", maybe because the website is busy, or your providersucks, or teenager jumped online, your TV may freeze temporarily until it resumes agood data connection again. During these rare moments I find myself just turning offthe TV to 'get back to it' more quickly than maybe waiting around for the Internet to""flow"" again. Sometimes this happens when a YouTube video is slow. Usually it is notthe TV's fault.Did I mention the overpriced specialized LG camera was $99.00...??? -lol.I had to perform three software updates to get the current version. Not bad.You have to create an account on the TV and register it online with LG using the TV,as well as agree to some garbage where they will collect ""some usage data"". I didnotice an option to 'not allow them to send file info & personal info/data' & suchback to their servers. Who knows what really goes on with any Smart TV data.???The overall TV volume is lower than expected.When using the headphone audio out, the internal TV speakers are bypassed and cut off. You can use one or the other, but not both.There are no settings to adjust the video quality when using the YouTube app. It willtry to stream the highest quality, whether or not you want it to. If network is slow,it will look like a bad YT video. -lol.No PC/Computer VGA port.Slight ""soap opera"" effect. (not too bad & common on low/med priced TV's.)Cinema & Game video modes do little to help. It also depends on the movie or file.There is no adjustment to force it into a 60Hz refresh rate mode.Factory Settings Need Changing:There is a review here that gives a detailed list of advanced settings in ""ExpertMode"" (after updating) that is quite remarkable. Half of the settings I have no ideawhat they mean or do, but I followed it through and it looks wonderful!When navigating to the LG Smart Menu, there is an annoying short video that loops over and over until you make a selection, and of course, you can't turn off this annoying feature.It has normal motion & nominal blur, comparable to most 120Hz refresh rate TV's. Notbad, not great.SMART TV Features:Shopping, weather,YouTube, Amazon, Pandora, Skype, Web Browser, Games, etc.The Web Browser works really well.I can get to most places and most video works 98% of the time.Overall after extensive research and hair-pulling... I am happy with this TV.Low energy long lasting LED back-lighting technology uses less electricity, less heat,brighter light and another good thing is this is a rear-lit TV. From my research theyare looked on with more approval than the edge-lit LED TV's.If there are any issues regarding this TV or any Service Problems, hassles, etc., I will be sure to update my review!Thank you for investing a rather sizable chunk of your time.I now return you to your previous life.Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD2XXCD9G4X2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB9ORWQ#wasThisHelpful","RD2XXCD9G4X2","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier.After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas, especially the body where it is needed the most.Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these. (I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Don't worry about the ""thing"" hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything ""built up"" to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1"" X 4"" costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KWBM957ZQER2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002D0COE#wasThisHelpful","R1KWBM957ZQER2","A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fits nicely and tight on standard wide threaded microphone stands. If you have the smaller ""screw headed"" ends on your microphone stand, you can get a little threaded adapter at any music store for next to nothing. (Maybe a dollar, if they don't just give it to you.)Using this with stands that have a heavy round base takes up less space onstage and other places, as well as making it easy to relocate and keep out of the way.No need for a tripod stand with the legs folding up and out, getting in the way, plus most inexpensive tripods are cheaply made, very light and will break easily when moving gear or simply tripping over them.The base screws down all the way onto the stand until it is hand tight.The set screw allows for tilting and turning adjustment of the camera.The set screw presses against a ball-socket hinge and has a plastic thumb knob that seems a little fragile. I am very careful not to over-tighten in fear of twisting off the plastic thumb tightening knob.I am also leery of stripping the set screw or the threads inside the housing, but at this price I guess you can't expect to have a sophisticated adjustment mechanism, eh?There is a notch in the side of the housing to allow for a 90-degree preset angle.The metal thumbscrew that attaches the base of the camera to the adapter has a rubber washer as well as a thin rubber mat acting as like a cushioning gasket when tightened to your camera.Be careful. The metal thumbscrew can easily fall out from the holding plate when transporting, removing or switching cameras. I found a little 'plastic threaded washer-like ring' that screws onto the holding plate screw when not in use. You could easily find many types of washers, screws, plastic pieces, etc., to hold it in place when in storage or transport. You could also leave it attached to your camera. Either way, be careful not to let it fall out and get lost.Overall the ""little thing"" is quite solid, heavy and sturdy and takes up little to no real estate and does a great job at being small, basic, solid and inexpensive.It holds well when bumped or moved. Mine has absolutely ""no slop"" in it, does not wobble or come loose. I would not put a larger sized 8mm camera or heavy camera on this adapter. Most modern devices will do just fine.Again, just make sure you tighten it up 'just enough' to hold it well. Don't put the grip of Hercules on it and it should last for years.

The pixelated colors are not intended to be use all over the eyelid, and they would look absolutely awful if you tried to do it. I like how pigmented the colors are, but I'm really put off by the fact that the pixelated colors have black mixed in, which makes them really muddy. I get that this is to help them blend with your eyeliner, but I'd rather mix them myself to get that effect.

"I received this case free in exchange for an honest review.This case is a three-piece case that protects the phone from all angles. First, this is a silicone sleeve. The sleeve fits into a hard case that covers the sides and back of the phone. Both the sleeve and the hard case have all the cutouts in all in the right places. This case also includes a hard case that cover be snapped over the front of the phone to protect the screen when it is not in use. The front cover also slip over the back of the phone, which gets it out of the way while you are using the phone and allows it to work as a kickstand.The whole setup feels very solid. I definitely think it will protect my phone well. I don't think it is particularly stylist, and it is a bit too bulky for every day use, imo, but I still love it. I think it's great for things like running, working out, hiking, etc. I also have an Otterbox LifeProof case, but I like this one a lot better than that one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R95HUEWPOEGYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HTWKJY#wasThisHelpful","R95HUEWPOEGYU","A8WAYVOKYBLO6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A8WAYVOKYBLO6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been an Izze fan for a few years, but only recently tried the cans. The cans are small, but they are full of flavor.

My preference is still the bottle, but the cans do in a pinch.As for the flavors, I would rank them Clementine, Blackberry, and a distant last is Apple.

"So far, I'm really impressed by this. I like that it has three different modes, which each have three different speeds. It makes it very customizable. I definitely appreciated having the lower speed when I first started. The vibrations on my gums felt kind of weird, almost ticklish, and the lower speed helped me adapt to it. Once I got used to the feeling, I went up to speed two, which is where I am right now. I really like the white setting, which is timed to give you 30 seconds of cleaning time for each quadrant, then an additional minute of polishing time for the fronts of the teeth.The only thing I don't like is that it turns itself off once the cycle is complete.

"I have been using Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Hi Fiber, which has about the same amount of protein but a little more fiber. I may end up switching to the Viva Labs. The Viva Labs blends a lot easier into my drinks and doesn't have as much grit. Hemp protein in general is great, because it has a lot of fiber and is free from allergens that can irritate the stomach. The sift on this is great. Even though it doesn't have quite as much fiber as the hi fiber hemp protein, it is still packed with fiber and the lack of gritty hulls is probably why it blends better.

"The curtain has a fabric-like feel to it. The color is kind of a dark khaki and the print is really subtle but very pretty. I like that this feels softer and more like fabric than a piece of plastic. To me it feels durable. I think the color and pattern are fairly neutral and would fit into any decor. The one thing that had me scratching my head was the packaging. It comes in a plastic pouch with the zipper. The pouch is too flimsy to be reusable, so the extra packaging just seems wasteful.

"The book is great, but it isn't what I expected at all. Realistically, most of us can't just leave a job without a backup plan.

"If you are new to Word this book is a great place to start.  With it you get good advice on the most basic features of word processing (e.g., use tabs instead of many spaces) out through fancy/complex useful skills (e.g., doing mail merges).  While this book is clearly geared to people who are brand new to Word, if you are an old-time user you will find new tricks.  I have been using Word since the days of WinWord 3.0 and picked this up to see what was new or what I missed as Word evolved.  Happily, I found useful stuff in this book that I have never noticed (e.g., how to recover files that I forgot to save) as well as features that I had forgotten or thought lost as Word evolved.The writing is clear, the layout of each topic is consistent and very nicely done.  As you will see, if you preview the book, you get text instruction on the left side of each page and pictures to the right.  Each section has tips.  The tips are excellent.My only complaint is that some of the images are too small.  The author consistently shows large chunks of the display, which is nice because it keeps you oriented.  However, when the author is focused on what is happening on the ribbon (i.e., the top of the page) it can be hard to see exactly what is going on.  It is not too bad when you have word open in front of you but it does detract from the book.So, if you are new to Word and if you want to become a power user pick this up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UM9PASF4EKPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119074665#wasThisHelpful","R3UM9PASF4EKPN","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good keypad for when your mobile phone or tablet is on your desk.The setup is simple with Mac products.

Rather, it feels solid. The keys do not feel cheep but they are not as crisp as an expensive keyboard (like a real external Mac keyboard or a high end Logitech).They keyboard has a rechargeable battery built-in and the box includes the micro USB cable to charge.There is a handy slot to hold your tablet or phone if it is not in a heavy case.

"I just used this bag for a 5 day business trip to Bogota Colombia, from the USA, and it was perfect.  It easily fit a man's business clothing (complete with a sport coat, dress shoes and medium weight jacket) and casual clothing for such a temperate destination.  The design, with two independent sides, one with integrated hanger holders, is excellent for holding dress shirts and sport coats.  There is a solid central flap with a mesh pocket that closes off one side and keeps dress clothing neat. The other side uses two triangular flaps with a plastic clip where they join to hold them together.  This is a brilliant design which also holds things in place well while allowing you to quickly get at things on that side of the bag. The inside pockets are nicely designed and out of the way but there is not a dedicated ""waterproof"" pocket.The zippers are solid and the pulls work perfectly.  The bag has a zipper to access the main part of the bag and one outside pocket.  The pulls are designed to be locked and the bag comes with one lock which is easy to set.  It would be better if the bag came with two locks instead of one.  I was able to use a standard travel lock on the second pocket.The bag rolls perfectly over nearly every surface.  The handle and general shape of the bag make it perfect for perching a computer bag on top.  Even with a fully loaded messenger bag threaded on the handle I was able to move it effortlessly even on cobbled/brick sidewalks.  I only tipped it once on a steep outside ramp with very large razed bumps.While this bag is not inexpensive, you get what you pay for here.  This is an absolutely excellent, perfectly functional, bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NS2ZVHOFRBTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DC0C2U#wasThisHelpful","R3NS2ZVHOFRBTN","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This travel sized headphone amplifier is great for getting some extra bass out of your headphones as the cost of some clarity on highs of songs. I tested this using iTunes on my iMac as well as with an iPhone 5S with the integrated music application with these high fidelity headphones: Grado Prestige Series SR325e Headphones . The unit itself is very, very small, perfect for your pocket next to your phone or on your desk. On it is a volume control as well as a switch that acts as a ""bass boost"" with three modes of operation, as well as two ports for standard headphone jacks. The amp charges with a generic micro usb port and battery life is decent at about 8-10 hours.This little unit adds a lot to the bass's presence. It is most noticeable in EDM and hip hop, where the bass is borderline overpowering on the middle switch, and ridiculous on the bass setting. In rock, loud alternative, and punk music, the amp feels almost balanced with a healthy amount of bass and decent acoustics on the middle range. I also noticed a very feint amount of static with the volume up very high in the form of a static in the background, which didn't bother me much but might be an issue for some. In more tame songs and jazz, the amplifier doesn't sound quite right; piano keys feel darker and heavier than they should, and string instruments don't sing quite like you'd expect. This is decent at best and grainy at worst.Depending on your music taste and how much treble clarity you're willing to trade for bass, this portable amplifier may or may not be right for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KW38FA6QUXP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X67G77O#wasThisHelpful","R1KW38FA6QUXP0","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want to develop a new instrument/scale to assess health behavior get this book.  I have been doing biostatistics for a living for more than a dozen years and this book in its various forms has remained one of my favorites because of it's clear writing and spot on advice.  Over the years countless doctors have proposed using an instrument they have created to assess response to a new treatment.  This book covers exactly why that is two projects not one.  Development/validation of the instrument is its own project.  This book covers the statistics and methods used to properly assess the reliability and validity of new (or existing) instrument/test/scale with fantastically clear writing.  There are many examples taken from medicine and a fair number coming from education and psychology.  All are clearly explained.There are no proofs or derivations in this book.  Instead you will find basic algebra and worked examples for most of the statistics.  All the coverage is good but one of the truly excellent features of this book is the coverage of intra-class correlation.  Nobody has done a better job explaining ICCs.Some of my students find Norman and Streiner's Biostatistics the Bare essentials hilarious others find it too wordy.  While there are rare funny comments this book has been edited to be much more concise and not silly.  So, while it is not mathematically rigorous, it is a serious book.  While this is a statistics and methods book at it's core, the writing is accessible for anyone with a background in medicine, education or psychology, as well as people coming from mathematics who like clean prose.While this book could be better (if it had a web supplement with detailed coverage of SAS and/or R) it is otherwise fantastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3747RZ1YPI6TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199685215#wasThisHelpful","R3747RZ1YPI6TA","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Also included is the rubric for how the essay portion of the test is scored as well as the scale for how the rest of the test is scored. Otherwise, the book is just a set of questions with detailed answers to each question as well as how it is ranked in terms of difficulty to other questions in the section.

"I teach university level statistics and I find this book to be lacking because it covers no modern statistical methods and it has no coverage of analysis software.  If you are taking a high school level statistics class where you are not allowed to use a computer and if your teacher is still using methods from the 1960s this is not bad at all.  In general the writing and the graphics are nice and clear if you want to do things like calculate a median (or draw a box plot) by hand.  Nobody in their right mind works like this any more.  Perhaps worse is the fact that fundamental statistical topics are missing.  Bayesian statistics, which are the backbone for a huge number of modern methods are not even mentioned in the index.If you need something to supplement your work in high school class that stresses hand calculations consider this.  If you are not stuck working like the early 1960s consider OpenIntro Statistics: Third Edition instead.

"The Turtle Beach X50s are a solid entry level headset at a reasonable price. They are mainly designed for Xbox One users with the newer Xbox controllers with headphone ports, and are to be just plugged into the controller. The chord is short, but this shouldnt be a problem if youre playing with a controller in your hands or if you sit next to your computer. The headset is comfortable to wear for many hours for gaming or music usage. The cups are made of a faux-leather material and slip right over your ears, and the headband has adjustable length to compensate for very small to medium-large heads. The microphone is easily detachable for storage and flexes well, and the headset itself feels generally sturdy. Attached to the chord is a volume control as well as a switch to turn your microphone on and off when it is attached.While they sound somewhat tinny compared to higher end gaming headsets/headphones, the soundstaging is solid for shooters at this price range. Basses are satisfying, but treble is lacking (this is somewhat expected for a gaming headset). I tested the headset by playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, and Team Fortress 2 and I was able to hear around my surroundings well in Counter Strike, and spells and attacks sound clear in League. In Team Fortress 2, sound staging is more difficult to detect as the sounds start to wash together in the chaos, but I was still able to hear enemies creep up behind me and explosions go off in the distance.These do not do active noise canceling but they are substantial enough that they do block background noise.  If you are not mindful of your surroundings you will end up yelling while wearing these.However, to say this headset is for PC/Mac gamers is slightly misleading. In order to utilize the detachable microphone, you will need an adapter that accepts a headphone jack on one end and the red/green audio in and out ports. These are cheap and easy to find (I found one on amazon for eight dollars), (http://amzn.to/1LfmqI3) but it would have been nice of Turtle Beach to include this if they are going to advertise it as a PC headset.This headset is a solid buy for Xbox One users who want a microphone to talk to friends and teammates. PC gamers will be less satisfied due to the cost of an additional splitter, but this is an otherwise excellent product from Turtle Beach.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RQMOHAJ7UEYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5U40#wasThisHelpful","R1RQMOHAJ7UEYT","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I teach programming at the university level and I think this is a thoughtful, well written book on computer algorithms ... in other words it does a good job explaining how software works.  I picked this up thinking that it could be useful to supplement my (not for majors) introduction to programming.  I will recommend it to people who are thinking about becoming a computer science major.  It is surprisingly deep while avoiding the mathematical notation (and rigor) that typically gets in the way when people who don't love math try to get beyond a cursory understanding of computer science.  Given the depth of the technical details, the authors clear style is to be envied.  However, the presentation is probably a bit dry and too deep for the masses.  Basically, the author strips out the math and the programming and explains, in fairly intuitive terms, how different programming methods work.  If you think that you want to get fairly deep under the hood of the machines that drive modern software this is an interesting place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0JLE1ZQXKEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593276664#wasThisHelpful","R3J0JLE1ZQXKEQ","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nicely constructed surge bar.  It feels solid and has turning covers that keep dust out of the unused plugs.I installed this last Friday and on Saturday one of the arms on the power pole behind our house was hit by lightening, caught fire and the transformer on one arm blew out.  No really! Thunderstorms in Miami are rough in the fall....  We had a brownout for about four hours before the power company turned off the power completely to replace the damaged parts.  All that time my APC and CyperPower uninterrupted power supplies (protecting my computers) were squawking about the low voltage and ""noise"" in the power line.  The circuit breaker on this little surge bar never tripped.  So, I can categorically say that it takes a lot to trip it.  Happily we had no problems from the outage including the TV, router and cable box that were protected by this bar.I have two gripes.  The biggest is with the insurance policy.  If this bar fails and you make a claim you need to have the original receipt for both this and the damaged device.  A minor complaint is the spacing on the plugs. They are the typical width apart.  It would be nice if there was more space to afford enough room for the bigger plugs on electronics.Overall, this things seems to work like a trooper and is a good buy for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8VQS1G15VU2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EFKUHBS#wasThisHelpful","R8VQS1G15VU2O","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is wildly creative and the premiss of exploring human life in the FAR distant future should have made this book legendary, but the writing which is a mixture of hard science fiction and action adventure does not work well.  The story gets bogged down in hard science (relativity theory and anthropology) and nearly grinds to a halt a couple of times.  The action adventure just instantly switches off an conflicts are not resolved because the next bit of hard science shows up.

"I teach statistics and statistical programming for a living and while this is not a bad book, it is so far from optimal I would not recommend it for my students.  Typically people approach R because they have a dataset (in Excel or coming from REDCap) and they want to do basic summaries, graphics or make inferences.  In everyday use that data gets imported into an R object called a data frame and then people play with the columns inside of the data frame.  Rather than starting with real data imported into data frames, this book begins with manually typing data and doing basic operations on vectors.  The authors do not get to data frames until page 132.  Excel is not covered until page 229.Instead of first covering the basic tasks, like importing and describing data the authors cover key programming ideas, which are critical for a deeper understanding of R.  That coverage is not bad at all but it could be better.  All the material is hampered by the authors not sweating the details on their code.  R is a case sensitive language and the authors are not consistent in how they name objects.  For example in chapter 3, where they cover R naming, they include objects called Intro, Total.baskets, baskets.of.Granny.  Because R pays attention to what is capitalized, readers of the book who are trying to follow along will have to waste time fixing the authors inconsistent capitalization.In general the writing is good to very good but it could be better.  For example the coverage of methods vs functions is not crystal clear and it needs to be.If you are coming to R with a programming background there is some very nice stuff here.  The authors do regularly point out things that are different about R (for example its coverage of vectorized functions and recycling) and they have useful technical points throughout the book.  If you are coming to R from a database background you will find the lack of coverage on R and SQL integration disappointing.While each has its own flaws, readers are better off getting Data Manipulation with R (Use R!) to learn to slice and dice data and perhaps OpenIntro Statistics: Third Edition to learn statistics with R (or SAS) and/or The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design to learn how R actually works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5Y5SXCRQ2GNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1119055806#wasThisHelpful","R5Y5SXCRQ2GNH","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These speakers are simple to use and they sound good.  Unpacking and setting them up with a MacPro took about 2 minutes total.  The construction feels solid. The sound is just right if you want to listen to TV shows or movies on you computer but you don't need audiophile quality sound.  I have been using them at work for listening to teleconferences and for when my computer proofreads writing and they are more than adequate.I normally use Grado headphones and Yamaha speakers (which are at a totally different price point).  So I can't say anything too good about the sound quality but these do not sound bad at all.  The big problem I have with them is that they shut off fairly quickly to save battery.  So, if you pause and come back you need to turn them on again and that takes a couple seconds (which feels like a long time after you push the play button for the 4th or 5th time in a day).

The tower itself is pleasantly small.  The mouse and keyboard are both surprisingly comfortable with buttons that are easy to press/click and are not at all mushy.  The video card works with multiple cables (DVI, VGA and HDMI but not DisplayPort).  Because the OS is Windows 8.1 the configuration is easy.  If you don't have an outlook account it walks you through the steps.  Of course you then need to deal with idiosyncratic ""features"" of Windows 8.1 but the system does prompt you to allow the free upgrade to Windows 10 (for the next year).Once setup the boot time is quick and the machine is nearly silent.  For every day use the USB ports are plentiful with a good mix of USB 2 and 3 across the front, top and back.  For watching old movies or listening to your old discs there is a DVD drive.I stress tested the machine with modern AAA video games and was satisfied.  Alien Isolation runs on ultra settings with a good frame rate. Wolfenstein: the New Order runs cleanly with medium to high settings.  The only game that gave it trouble were the Metro Redux games.  Which ran on low setting perfectly but lagged with higher quality renderings.

"My family uses Vysk and Mophie charging cases for our iPhones.  Compared to those cases this OtterBox is our least favorite.  I let my daughter, who normally uses an OtterBox, try this and she disliked it.  These things in particular bothered her: it does not feel as rugged as the normal OtterBox, the install instructions are mostly useless, it is heavy, it makes the phone to big to fit into her ""girly jean pockets"" (her words not mine), it requires a headphone adaptor, it is slippery, it gets very hot as it charges and it changes the dimensions of the phone so much it is hard to hold.  The last point is noteworthy when compared to our other charging cases.  The outline of this case is nice and slim on the top and sides but that is at the expense of making a very large footprint at the bottom of the phone. There is so much material there, it makes it hard for her to reach across the entire phone display.  If you are looking for a charging case your best bet is probably the Vysk EP1 Privacy Charging Case for iPhone5/5s - Retail Packaging - Blue.  It has the good qualities of the Mophie cases but is less slippery (and it has a nice shutter to protect your phone's camera lens.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQJNXEUXRA4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KX91RZK#wasThisHelpful","RQQJNXEUXRA4U","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In some, but not all respects, this camera beats the GoPro at its own game.  The first advantage for this is the adapters.  The ones included in this set are incredibly versatile.  It is easy to use them as designed and with a bit of creativity we were able to attach them to all kinds of things including our dogs collar and a paddle-board. We spend a lot of time at the ocean and the camera itself has held up nicely after three weeks of playing including time in the surf.  The wrist mount display is extremely nice and far better than the display you can add to the back of a GoPro but it is not waterproof.  So, unlike the GoPro you can't see what you are shooting when you are snorkeling/paddelboarding/surfing.  However, the iPhone app that goes with the camera is excellent.  So, if you have a waterproof case for your phone you can check your shots while in the surf (or on a board).  That setup is a huge advantage over the GoPro because the back mounted display for a GoPro burns battery like mad.I have used a GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition since they came out.  I think it takes very good video but this beats it hands down.  The stabilization on this is at least as good and the resolution and frame rate are superb.  If you are going to share videos on the web you will not notice the difference but if you are going to capture stills off the video or stream to your TV the difference is big.Sadly the case on this camera, unlike the GoPro, can not be used for SCUBA.  The Sony MPKAS3 Underwater Housing (Clear) will work with this camera but it will set you back $40 and it does not come with extra o-rings or grease.  Again unlike the GoPro there are no Backscatter (or other brand) lenses for shooting underwater yet.So, if you are a diver get a GoPro. Otherwise give this camera serious consideration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34IP7KOI6AV0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1CO9X4#wasThisHelpful","R34IP7KOI6AV0O","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good looking, well constructed, washable pot holder.  It is designed to fit on the handle of a pot and keep you from getting burned on the handle.  You can also use it to grip or hold a pan if you fold it over.  It holds very well when you fold it over but when it is on the pot handle it can slip around.  The ribbing which makes this not slippery is excellent but the coating is not on the inside of the sleeve that fits around the handle.  Because the handle can slip in the sleeve you need to have strong hands or lots of experience as a chef.  If that is you, pick this up.

"This is a nice necklace but it has its down sides.  Its biggest weakness is its really awkward length. It comes in a standard 18 inch length and has a two inch extender which helps but it is still awkward.  The necklace has two separate chains which are connected at the clasp so you can not adjust their lengths individually.  The main problem is that they do not lay together well.  The distance between the two pendants just doesn't work.  It seems that the smaller one should lay inside of the larger or they should be much farther apart.  The pendents are small but in a tasteful way.  See the picture for scale.  The stone is a nice rich purple and the chain and silver heart are nice and shiny.  The presentation is excellent. The pendent comes in a black velvet lined clam shell box with blue accents and that comes in its own black box.  You could easily slap a bow on this box and present it to someone.  However, the necklace came as a tangled mess.  So be sure to untangle it first. The proportions on the chains are really unfortunate because if you could adjust them individually or if the ratio was different this would be a five star buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R95JXCAK5OVCI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFRSZA6#wasThisHelpful","R95JXCAK5OVCI","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is like Romeo and Juliet, without Capulets and Montagues but with demons, vampires and witches, without great writing and with an interesting, mysterious book which does something important but you never really know what.  This book, like that sentence, just will not end.... The book begins great with a modern day witch, who is hiding from her magic ability, stumbling across a strange book.  She is soon stalked by a pile of potentially interesting characters.  From there the book flames out and crashes  into a fabulously annoying romance.  I know the book was in trouble when it got to yoga with vampires.  I did make it through the entire thing in the hope it would resolve the story of the mysterious book but the ending is entirely unsatisfying.If you are looking for PG rated romance masquerading as an urban fantasy belly up to the bar.

"If you are trying to decide between this and a Mophie case, get this one.  I have been using a Mophie on my 5S for a year and I love the battery but that case is just too slippery.  I have dropped the case hard twice because it slipped out of my hands in the cold.  This case has similar battery performance and it is about the same size but it has a striated grip on the back which is not slippery.The phone comes with an app to handle security if you are worried about the security of the iOS.  I was not so I didn't add the clutter.  The battery is driven by a manual switch on the back so you don't need to mess with the app.  There is a manual slider to cover the camera (if you are paranoid).  EvenIf you are not, it does cover and protect the lenses.  Unfortunately it covers that flashlight.The speakers built into the case are small but surprisingly good.  If they are not better than the Morphie case they are at least as good.  The case requires a dongle to plug in your headphones.  Those are notorious for breaking but out of the box it works nicely and feels solid.The only gripe I have is with the instructions which do not mention that you need to pull the bottom off the case before attempting to slide the phone in.  I knew how to do it because of my other case but my son didn't realize that it slides apart so he was scratching his head trying to figure out how to get the phone into the case.So, while the case is not inexpensive, it seems to be well made and slightly better designed than the competition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ANXSDUO6BZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCP376O#wasThisHelpful","R20ANXSDUO6BZ5","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fairly high level introduction to data science which should be perfect for someone who is just starting out and wants to know the ""what is what"" in data science but not the gory details on ""how do I accomplish ... whatever"".

Over and over you will see very simple code or screenshots that give a flavor for the tasks that the language/tools are used for.  The only real risk here is the reader may be left thinking that data science is easy, when in fact the devil is in the details.  If you want to get started with data science this is a great resource.  From here head to Coursera and look at the Johns Hopkins Data Science series.

"If you are not a mathematician but you are comfortable with basic algebra and you want to learn biostatistics, this is the book you want to get.  The writing is consistently very good and there are plenty of worked examples mixed into the body of the text.  This book does go deeper than the average non-math major biostat text but it does not get lost in proofs and derivations. Rather, it provides a decent in-depth explanation of how things work.  What sets this book apart from others is its solid (pleasantly balanced) introduction to Bayesian thinking.  While most of the book is about traditional frequentest hypothesis testing, the authors do bring Bayesian approaches into play in several chapters.The book is showing its age.  It is missing discussions on how to deal with the huge data problems associated with modern medical records.  It is also missing a web supplement showing how to do the statistics with programming languages like SAS/R/STATA or general purpose tools like Python.  Happily, it is easy to take the worked examples in the book and feed the data into analysis software to see which of the algorithms a package is using.Overall, this is my favorite biostat book for non-math-majors who want to go deeper into how statistics work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183G7QW89DV5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0632052570#wasThisHelpful","R183G7QW89DV5U","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of the Baldur's Gate franchise rejoice because the folks at Obsidian have come through with the best isometric Role Playing Game  in a decade.  PoE plays essentially the same as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or Torment.  That is, you play it in real time by moving characters around the screen, which show outdoor worlds, buildings, caves, etc (rendered in an isometric view like Diablo 1, 2, 3).  Movement choices and conversations are controlled with clicks. You can use AI during easy combat or you can pause to micromanage your characters during difficult fights.  The big difference betwen PoE and the classic iRPGs is that PoE has been rendered for modern hardware so the backgrounds and animation are absolutely gorgeous.The game grows slowly so even if you have not played BG or its children it will be easy to pick this up.Combat is smooth an easy to figure out.  There are some places where it could be improved.  In particular if you are not moving your characters one at a time the AI can leave one of your characters blocking a doorway in a fight (basically wiping the party).Like the classic iRPGs there is some voice acting mixed into the game but you will spend a lot of time reading.The plot supporting PoE is competent but not impressive.  However, the writing which supports the story line is absolutely brilliant.  I have been playing games for decades and I can't remember ever thinking ""that was a masterful choice of words"" when reading dialog.  The prose and occasional poem in PoE are consistently great.  Clearly many extraordinarily talented writers devoted huge hours to this game because even the side stories are impressive.The replay on this game is staggering.  The game world is huge, and the set of choices for how you interact with the world's NPCs is strikingly diverse (going way beyond basic good and evil).  You are given many classes of characters to choose from and specialization choices are vast (and useful).If you have a a couple weeks to lose yourself in a beautiful, well thought through world pick this up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G1PR3CDTLXQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXIU82O#wasThisHelpful","R1G1PR3CDTLXQI","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a beautiful, easy to set up TV which  has a very limited set of apps.  Going from opening the box, through setup, to working perfectly took less than 5 minutes.  The assembly involves sliding on the base, screwing in 4 screws (no screwdriver included) and plugging in the power cable.  The TV automatically picked up the HDMI line in from my cable box and the automatic onscreen setup instructions were a breeze.  I have an ancient DVD/Video player which works nicely with the RCA plugs on the back of the unit (but that did take a minute or so to find which jacks to use).  Right out of the box, with no tweaking, the picture and sound are excellent.The remote has just the right amount of complexity.  You can easily jump to the apps that ship with the TV and quickly jump to the menu to set the TV in movie mode (or several other color configurations).  The simplicity of this remote is superior to those that shipped with my Samsung TVs (which have way too many buttons).  The stuff which I want is here and the display is not significantly cluttered by buttons that I don't need.There is only one noteworthy downside to the TV and that is the limited set of apps.  While there are plenty of jacks to set up streaming/casting to the TV, the TV itself does not have a library of apps to choose from.  So, unlike Samsung Smart TVs which have many, here you are basically stuck with what the box ships with.  For example if you want to watch the mlb.tv app you can't.  Instead you need to stream from another device or mess with the built in web browser (which is actually surprisingly responsive).Overall this is a great, well priced TV which is ideal for someone who craves simplicity.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24XVZZFBTQUT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTVMG1M#wasThisHelpful","R24XVZZFBTQUT8","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a good, no nonsense, supplement for people who are learning human anatomy and physiology.  Because I am a biostatistician, who does predictive modeling in medicine, I am forever needing to learn physiology to understand the projects I work on.  I picked this up to help.

So, it is not as complete as I would have liked.  Specifically, there are excellent text descriptions of all kinds of things but the labeled diagrams that go with them are no always in the book.  Frequently the labeling of key pictures are left for exercises (with solutions).  That means that most everything is here but  you can't read this like a textbook and learn the material.  The reader without a solid textbook will have to scrounge on the web for diagrams (or look at the answer key).If your goal is to supplement your human anatomy/physiology textbook and/or to get additional test questions, this is an excellent buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LY6GVKDW712M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118940075#wasThisHelpful","R2LY6GVKDW712M","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are just starting out with SAS or if you are a guru, there is so much that you will like in this book.  I have been using ODS since SAS 7.  So, I know my way around but I often mind myself thinking there has to be an easier way (especially when dealing with Excel).  Everything here is practical.  The book begins with very basic things like controlling multiple output destinations and then it moves into tricks everybody needs to know (like how to temporarily stop writing to an output destination) and then into fancier voodoo to help make good looking output in any format.  Every chapter has stuff that I remember looking up and tricks that I have been meaning to lookup forever (like how to color code and italicize single key words in SAS output titles).  The chapter on Excel, which led me to get the book does not disappoint.  It has great coverage of the different ways of writing to Excel (with advice on the strengths of each) and it covers tricks that I needed (like how to keep zero padded values for medical record numbers).  If you want to impress people with beautiful reports this book is a must.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H7NC9Z9UJVWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612908543#wasThisHelpful","R2H7NC9Z9UJVWQ","A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Where I live in Southern Utah, we are blessed with hiking trails literally everywhere. More than any place I've ever lived or even visited for that matter. Not that you need hiking trails to use a good water bottle, but I'm just illustrating why I chose to order this one. I've been using a plastic, insulated bottle which also has a built-in mister--which on these hot Southern Utah summers comes in quite handy. Unfortunately, even though ""insulated"" the water tends to warm up much faster than I would like. As in MUCH faster. My hope with the Contigo was to find something that would--if nothing else--provide a cooler environment for my water even on hot days.I was NOT disappointed. First off, its a nice size and the promise of a non-leaking lid is 100% Right On. Nice change of pace from the plastic bottle I mentioned before which, as it would get warmer, tend to leak, almost too much, regardless of how tight the lid was. I wish the bottle could hold a few more ounces of water, but I'm not going to complain too badly. I'll just need to buy another one if my hike's go farther I guess.Does the water stay chilled? YES--for the most part. On extremely hot days, you'll notice that the water will warm up, but nowhere as fast as in a plastic bottle or something entirely non-insulated. Let's face it: aluminum helps keep things cold better than plastic. It just does. I like how it is manufactured so that regardless of how cold the water is, the surface temp on the outside won't freeze your hand, which was a problem with another bottle I used recently. I left my bottle in my car overnight and when I got to it in the morning, even with the sun directly on it and quite warm to the touch, the water inside remained fairly chilled, which is just how I want it. I imagine it would work nearly as well keeping warm liquid warm, but I don't use my water bottles for that so I cannot offer an opinion regarding that, sorry.I DO have one small--but potentially very annoying issue--that I think is quite important to note before using your bottle. It was quite by accident that I looked INSIDE the bottle before using it. I'm rather glad I did. There was an additional information pamphlet regarding the bottle stuffed inside in such a way that it did NOT want to come out, even with needle nose pliers. I ended up getting it out in pieces, which made reading the material afterwards a bit challenging I must say. I just wish the pamphlet was placed almost anywhere BUT inside it. Bad form, Contigo. STOP doing that. Like NOW. I still like the bottle enough to give it 5 stars though, which should give you an idea of how much I like it. I think anyone would find this to be a wonderful water bottle--especially if they can deal with getting that paper out of the bottle before using...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3499X409FY84O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160988S0#wasThisHelpful","R3499X409FY84O","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay, yes the case looks great. It fits my S6 Edge+ wonderfully. My basic issue with phones today is that they manufacture many that are way too slick on the surfaces and/or the bezels are so slippery that holding the actual phone can be an exercise in holding tight otherwise the device will definitely reaching the floor soon. The Edge+ is without a doubt, THE coolest, well-made phone on the market as I write this (IMO). It is absolutely, positively well-manufactured and a world of difference from what we've seen Samsung make in the past, especially comparing it to the S5. With that new design comes what some would consider a deal breaker, the device is shockingly slippery in the hand. Much more so than the regular S6 due to the super slim bezels. For me, owning a case is a no-brainer, and this phone needs one more than most simply just to hold on to without fear of it falling from your grip.With that said, this case is AS slippery or more so than the actual phone by itself without a case. Again, it fit well and snapped on quickly and surely. However, the surface is SO slick itself, that I almost immediately dropped my phone after placing it in the case due to slippage. In MY personal opinion. that is a key design flaw which dropped it to 3 stars. Had it been easier and no nearly as slick and slippery, I would gladly have given it the full 5 stars. I don't want to increase my odd's of dropping my phone because OF the case I have it in...but unfortunately, that is exactly what happened. I kept it on for the better part of a day on the off chance that after getting a bit more used to it I'd figure out some trick to holding it differently, or better in order to not worry as much about dropping, but after the 9th time nearly hitting the concrete I just pulled it off altogether.If you have a grip which allows you to hold this better, kudos and maybe you'll love this case...but unless my hands were very sweaty, I found that holding my phone was more of an adventure in juggling than anything else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJZM1GKZIXYQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015R3ZT8W#wasThisHelpful","RJZM1GKZIXYQV","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All I can say is, WOW. Not only does the UAG case stand out with fairly unique looking design, but it just FEELS solid, too--all without adding major bulk to a very trim phone. The back is genuinely cool looking in my opinion and the clear color shows off the gold tint of my phone rather nicely.Button placement is spot-on. The phone by itself is slippery in a way that is almost ridiculous. The trade off for the new design for Samsung is a device that is as easily dropped as you are likely to find anywhere. I've always believed that a case is pretty much a required purchase for your smart phone no matter HOW careful you think you are. Sooner or later its gonna drop. Whether by you or someone else mishandling it. I guarantee it WILL happen eventually. Protecting your investment is not only wise, its downright critical. Why take the chance?The UAG Case is just about the best case for a phone I believe I have ever tried. Great protection for not a lot of money and best of all, it does all of that without adding unnecessary bulk to your phone. This Case is definitely a win-win investment if you ask me. I couldn't be happier with mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ9DWN2GZW0DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ERM9S8#wasThisHelpful","RZ9DWN2GZW0DU","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The honest truth is these are great...however, the included chalk tended to literally scratch the heck out of the actual planner. Like ridiculously so, which I found to be not only frustrating, but a little upsetting, too.

"I was absolutely convinced that this would be compatible with using my bluetooth mp3 player when I selected it. As it turns out, it wasn't. However, does it work as advertised? Absolutely. I know better than to order without reading very carefully what the product can and cannot do, so that was MY bad clearly.My problem stems from the fact that I do not use my phone to listen to music. Period. I have mp3 players for that. However, I know a lot of folks DO use it for exactly that, and for this reason (and one other) I think it is actually quite convenient. It also qualifies as a very nifty tool for speaking to those who call you while on the road. If this is something you deal with regularly and if you find it difficult or maybe even nearly impossible to make out a conversation while driving, this device can literally be a life saver.

"Let's be honest, complaining about how long it takes to fumble and attach a cord to charge your smartphone these days qualifies as a weak reason to moan when taking the world into perspective these days, am I right? Talk about first world problems. Plus having to worry about getting that darned Micro USB turned the right direction in the dark...? That's just shy of impossible as I think we all know. However, with that said, just sitting your phone down at night regardless of how dark it is, man is it hard to beat that for sheer convenience.Sure, its lazy to complain otherwise, I recognize that. I really do. Even so, I am over the moon happy to not have to worry about that plugging in thing so much. Plus, they have definitely come a long way in making it a lot faster to charge than those first generation wireless charging ports used to be. Do they equal plugging directly into the wall yet? No...especially when you have a device like I do that supports fast charging (Galaxy S6 Edge+). But for those times when you just place your phone down, man is it EVER a sweet convenience.The charger itself is pretty compact. It measures about 4"" in diameter and another great plus is that when you set your phone down, a tiny, soft light encircling the charger lights up to tell you that its charging. Its a small--but VERY welcome convenience I must say. Setting it up was genuinely as simple as you can get. Take the included Micro USB charger, plug it into your computer (or wall charger) and then set your phone down. The should have an entire ad campaign surrounding me, ""So easy even JEFF can do it!"". Trust me, that ought to carry more weight than you realize. All in all, its small, ridiculously simple and works like a charm.

"My granddaughter loves Sponge Bob. Just loves him. This gift was a no-brainer for those little toddlers who enjoy and love Mr Square Pants as my little princess does. Playing was second nature for her when she saw what it was, she didn't even want help setting it up. We opened up the packaging and kind of left her to do what she wanted and within hardly any time at all she had it all set up as though she had read instructions. I must say she's a bright little girl, but it helps that its all pretty self explanatory.The toy is really simple and that is also part of its appeal. No need to complicate a child's imagination by forcing them to follow a specific plan of this or that, just set up the stuff and let the child's imagination go wild--which is exactly what happened here.

"I must admit, I do not own a GoPro, so I was reluctant to order this, but I was wrong--you don't need a GoPro in order to fully appreciate this incredibly diverse backpack, TRUST me.First off, the product is manufactured really well. In fact, impressively so. You could tell right away this was made to last. The additional smaller package was a nice touch, too and I must admit I wasn't expecting it. If you are one to bring gadgets of virtually ANY kind along with you places, you need to seriously consider the Lowepro backpack. It offers more nooks & crannies and small and large places to store almost anything you can possibly think of. Now I feel compelled to point out that there are scores of small to medium-sized places to store your gear, but no really large space as you might find in a typical backpack. This is specifically designed for smaller items to store, not bigger ones. I wouldn't buy this for your kid for school, but if they enjoy using a GoPro or maybe photography in general, you will be utterly amazed at how convenient this particular case will be.I use mine for hiking minor trips that don't require much gear, but what I DO pack, it handles quite well.

"More like 3 1/2 stars...truth is, there is a lot to like with these bluetooth earbuds. Seriously. Their range exceeds several more expensive models I've tried. The style is pretty much second to none. The charging port is on the speaker stem a few inches below the bud that fits into your left ear (which I personally believe is MUCH better than charging these earbuds via a port located ON the actual earbud itself. Oh, and the built-in magnet feature? Now that is something I wish all bluetooth earbuds came with.So, with all of that said, why am I shorting this a star and a half? Quite simply the audio quality. They were better than an earlier pair which included the magnet feature that I reviewed a few months back, but the honest truth is the audio quality was just so so. It got loud, plenty loud, but the bass, while present, was just simply nowhere near what it needs to be. I understand that fitting all of that into a small package is easier said than done, but it CAN be done.I found that they never fit into my ear canal very well either. I tried multiple different sized plugs that came included, which was nice, but they all seemed to slowly fall out after walking a block or less. Trust me, that became insufferably difficult after my 4th mile and just plain annoying. My ears certainly aren't the same as everyone else's, so these very well may fit you perfectly.In short, there is a lot to like about these earbuds. Everything from the packaging (which really was first rate) on down was done very well, and better in fact than I've seen in quite some time. I just had a difficult time with the decent, but essentially not quite up to par audio quality. That was my biggest concern, as it is for many. If having superior sound quality isn't your top priority, these could very well be the earbuds for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDNIKPECLFOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01434SXCU#wasThisHelpful","R2SDNIKPECLFOX","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I owned (briefly) the original Galaxy Note several years back when I worked in between gigs for an AT&T authorized retailer. At first I wasn't sure if I'd like such a large phone, but man did I ever come around. I haven't purchased a phone with less than a 5"" screen since. I'm not going back. As phones become more and more capable, the reasons for larger screens become more apparent, and nobody makes screens better than Samsung. NOBODY.First off, I went back and forth over whether or not I wanted the Note 5 vs the Edge + for quite some time. I finally settled on the Edge simply for the ""wow"" factor, for which this phone has LOADS. The gold edition is just wicked cool. The build quality equals anything iPhones have ever manufactured. I'll stipulate that iPhones have always done a great job of build quality. But I don't dislike plastics on a phone either. What I want more than a super sleek device which ""looks"" nice is one that will actually do what I want it to do. While working for AT&T, almost daily we had iPhone 4 and 4S phones come in with cracked screens. It seemed to be the most prone to those types of issues of any device ever manufactured at that point (the Nexus 4 wasn't far behind for ease of breaking, too). I'm sure the Edge is better manufactured than either of those, but still, it isn't impervious to accidents, so a case is absolutely critical no matter WHICH smart phone you buy. I went with the Tech 21 case that is a dirty, almost see-thru, which covers up the majority of the gold, but you gotta sacrifice a little if you want to protect your new product from the eventual spills it will take at some point no matter how careful you may be.No phone is perfect, and the Edge + is no different. Picking it up with the super slim bezels on the side can be tricky, but you get used to it. Those who have a major issue with this need to get over it. You bought a phone that has a pretty nifty feature that allows for just this kind of thing, deal with it. Coming from the LG G3 this phone is about the same width, but noticeably taller. I became rather adept at learning to use it one-handed after some initial period of figuring it out, so it isn't that big of a deal for me, after all, I knew what I was getting into. However, if you are coming from a phone with a screen smaller than 5"" you're going to want to go into a store and handle one in person FIRST, because if you have tiny hands, this is going to be akin to operate a 7"" tablet for many. Be aware of what you are getting first so you don't have any surprises after you get home and become frustrated that your new purchase is too damn big.The screen is magnificent. That's all there is to it. I've heard and watched all the YouTube videos touting this or that and how the iPhone 6+ has a higher brightness scale or whatnot, but in the end, what matters is what you SEE with your own eyes. This screen is amazing, pure and simple. Over 100 pixels per inch MORE than the iPhone 6+, and you can tell. That isn't to say that the iPhone screen isn't great as well, it just doesn't have the ""wow"" factor that this one does I don't care WHAT anyone says.Let me say I have been disappointed in the battery life right up front. The G3 had impressive battery consumption, especially compared to my older Nexus 4 which had abysmal battery life from the get-go. With all of Samsung's claims about optimization and whatnot with its newer and faster processor, I expected the battery life to be at the very least as good as the older G3. I'm sorry to say it does not. I'd say that the Edge+ is a good 10-15% worse (that isn't scientific mind you, just a guess, but it IS worse I can assure you). On the flip side the quick charging and ability to use wireless charging IS a nice way to side step this issue, but clearly Samsung focused on form over function when it came to this particular model of phone. I keep hearing that Samsung is ""possibly"" going with a 4K screen within the next year...please, PLEASE don't! You honestly don't NEED a screen with any more than the QHD displays we already have...especially with the battery life we currently have. I haven't spoken with ANYONE who'd sacrifice battery life for screen quality, and I sure hope Samsung is listening. Unless and until they can dramatically increase battery life, going with anything above and beyond QHD is utterly a waste of time IMO.With Samsung's newest chips, I expected the Edge+ to be screamingly fast. In most ways, it is. However when I checked the RAM usage, I was shocked to see that 81% of the RAM--which is 4 freakin' gigs by the way--was being taxed. This is Androids BIGGEST problem in my opinion. How can they NOT make a phone that doesn't automatically turn on apps without you asking it to after all these years? When I close off the apps, I would dearly love them to not use up precious RAM from that point forward til I want to use that app again. I know some apps run in the background for obvious reasons like G-Mail, but I don't need my game of Solitaire to be open and ready at a moments notice now do I? If Android could figure this problem out, no iPhone could ever catch it. But unfortunately that isn't today.In most ways I love the phone. The speaker phone on the bottom is a noticeable improvement over the one on the back of my old G3, and not that it wasn't good, but the placement left a lot to be desired. Front facing is almost ideal, except for the times you have your phone set down face first. On the bottom is about as perfect as you can get without it being covered accidentally because of how you place it down. They copied apple in this, and I agree it was a copy worth making.I'm not a huge fan of TouchWhiz, and I seriously considered not going with this phone specifically for this reason. Yes, I know that since the introduction of the GS6 and the GS6 Edge that its been toned way down, but in my opinion, not nearly enough. Samsung, for all its cool and nifty things that their phones can do that others cannot (and lets be honest, NO phone comes with as many bells and whistles as Samsung crams into theirs, but unfortunately, the vast majority of which are entirely gimmicky at best) still hasn't figured out how to optimize their own OS so their incredible processors have to be so much more powerful than apple's simply to make up for all the glitches it tends to foster. Come ON guys, figure it out. If you optimized your devices even HALF as well as apple does, your phones would slaughter theirs on every conceivable scale known to man. With that said, I'm much happier with this version of TouchWhiz than what I experienced when I had the original Note. Some things are great and intuitive, some are buried so deep in the settings menu's that you almost have to Google How To video's in order to discover what your phone is capable of.One thing I saw before I bought my phone was that the Edge+ had an Auto Restart feature (FINALLY!). Something my 9 year old Blackberry used to have and I used regularly. Unfortunately, the version I have didn't come with it (T-Mobile) and I'm wondering why? Its a feature that Android really ought to put in as standard as it helps to make your device run smoother when you restart your phone on at least a semi regular basis. I gotta say I'm a bit disappointed it was left out of the software on my phone.The Camera is nothing short of stellar. Before I bought my phone I did a ton of research, and it was down to the LG G4 and the Note 5/Edge+ for best Camera on a mobile device...until I saw a quick look at the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, and they bumped their Camera's up to 13MP and without even TESTING them, the horribly biased reviewer automatically claimed them to be the best new Camera's on the market today. Now I'm not going to say they are or not, but I just find it interesting that without even getting to test one this reviewer online chose the iPhone as the new champ. Sheesh. How stupid. Let's get some hands on experience and THEN make your claims, okay? Until then, the Camera on this phone is wicked fast, takes unbelievable pictures as well as video. I just wish the OIS feature was also there for 4K recording. Since I don't have anything to watch the video on in 4K, I don't even use that feature. I'm big on taking lots of photos, so this was another HUGE selling point for me. Love the new features, too. I'm interested to really try out the Pro and Raw photo abilities to see how it stacks up. VERY excited to see my photos from here on out take a noticeable bump in quality.The fingerprint scanner works--at least so far--flawlessly. I was worried that it would have the glitches of the S5, but I'm happy to say it works, and does so reliably so. I must say it takes a bit to scan your finger into the phone--at first. But TRUST me, the reason why is so you can hold your finger even at odd angles or as I've discovered, even sideways and it will still work. Unlike the S5 where you had to slide your finger across, this one you simply hold it in place and it very quickly unlocks the phone. I have seen it open faster, and sometimes slower than the iPhone--but I have also seen this same reaction from the iPhone. But the truth is it always unlocks pretty quickly.One of my few gripes with my old G3 was that you would unlock the phone, but couldn't do a single thing until the Android on-screen keys appeared  FIRST. It didn't bother me--at first--but it just slowly ate at me until the last several months it bugged me horribly. I have since tested the G4 and noticed that the keys appeared much quicker, almost immediately, compared with the G3, which sometimes took as long as 3 seconds. Yes, I know 3 seconds isn't long, but it seemed like an eternity on occasion trust me. The Edge+ has NONE of that lag, though if I'm being honest, I imagine it will show up eventually as I fill up the memory more and more. However, so far I am also happy to report that its as snappy as the first moment I turned it on.Some have made a big deal out of the phone missing the ability to add memory or include a removable battery, and this is either going to be a deal-breaker for some or it won't. While I'm still a bit surprised at the amount of battery consumption for what Samsung claimed was especially optimized to give users as good if not better battery performance as the Note 4--that simply hasn't turned out to be the case. My original Note 1 I personally believe had seriously better battery life. Say what you want, but after nearly 4 years, I expect MORE life, not less out of a flagship device such as this. But with that all aside, iPhones have proven that you don't need a removable battery in order to get through the day. If you're going to go to the trouble of buying a separate battery for some devices, why not just get a couple of decent portable charger/batteries (which cost much less, btw). This way you won't have to power down your device to swap out, and you'll have all the power you need. With the cloud based services available these days, some argue the need for additional memory is moot--but I submit that no matter how convenient that might be, it certainly isn't faster to have to link up to a cloud-based storage location to find a photo, or song then it is when you have it ON your phone already. Plus, what happens if you are in an area with spotty to no service, what then? Too many variables. I just don't see why they couldn't add another drawer on the side or top similarly to where you place the SIM card where you could also add an expansion card. That's my .02. I really think that if Samsung wants to lure a lot of those who stayed away from these new devices simply for those reasons to consider some kind of workaround on the next model if they want to get back to being the market leader like they were a couple years back. Come on, nobody can tell me it can't be done rather simply given what they did to redesign these phones in the first place.Oh yeah, if you so desire, you can actually use your phone as an actual PHONE, which is tremendously convenient to be honest. The ear speaker works great, sounds great and the call quality I found to be good to excellent. The loud speaker was fantastic, but at higher volume sounded a bit scratchy--but that's to be expected from such a smaller speaker no matter what anyone says. Sure, the iPhone's might be clearer at higher volume, which IS a strong selling point if I'm being honest, but I don't use my speaker for anything other than phone conversations, so if you plan on using yours to listen to music, I would strongly reconsider. These phones really shouldn't replace an actual stereo speaker to listen to music on. Your experience may vary however.I think that basically covers it all. I'm sure over the next few weeks I'll come up with a few additional things that will pop into my mind to share, and if they are worthy of note, I'll come and add them on an as needed basis. Otherwise, my summary is this: is the phone perfect? No. Is it great? Absolutely. I love it MUCH more than the G3, which I also loved. If you happen to be an apple fan, stick with what you know and love. Just because I prefer Android doesn't mean iPhone's don't perform admirably. I just prefer Android--issues and all--to what apple does...and their phones are by no means trouble free either. Both have strong points, both have weaknesses. It'll be a long time before a perfect phone comes along, so until then, I personally believe you cannot go wrong if you do your research and buy accordingly. Happy computing!***UPDATE***I must hand it to Samsung for a couple of things, despite the battery issue I talked about earlier, at least the phone has two major--and I DO mean MAJOR advantages over the latest apple devices: fast charging and wireless charging. If you order the special Samsung wireless fast charger it will charge even faster than the typical wireless dock, but honestly, I'm not THAT concerned about it. I'd rather buy 2 or 3 fast charging cables which would save me a bundle. But the point is, the choice is yours...AND its a choice you simply don't get to make, as with so many other things, with the iPhone. The fast charging, I must say, WOW. It really charges quite rapidly. I knew that going into this, but I was still amazed and thrilled with how quick you can boost your battery--but again, ONLY if you use the cord which comes with the Edge+ or if you purchase another cord online, and thankfully, they ARE available. I got a 3rd party wireless charging dock and it works brilliantly with my Edge+. Yes, its darned slow (as almost ALL wireless chargers are) but freakin' convenient I must say.I have noticed that while in a car, answering a call has a distinct disadvantage so far: the ear speaker just doesn't get all that loud in my opinion. I found a way around that by using my ear buds or just placing it on speaker phone. That bottom speaker is mighty impressive I must say. Easily the loudest I've experienced in a mobile phone personally (I'd bet the boom speakers on the HTC models and the newest Nexus probably out perform it handily). VERY impressed with that.I am still super impressed with the screen. And no matter what anyone says, the curved edges garner more attention than the iPhone, period.  Everywhere I go I get comments, many by die hard apple fans, which is no small victory as far as I'm concerned. I just showed a coworker how the camera takes much better pics than his iPhone and even HE admitted they were better--which I didn't think I'd ever hear.One tiny--but significant complaint I have is that on previous androids I had the option of creating a shortcut to dial or text a group of people. All I had to do was tap on their face and voila! I'd go directly into the texting app. For some reason they eliminated this feature with the S6, the S6 Edge and the Edge+. Not sure but I suspect they did away with it on the Note 5, too. So now, it takes an additional 2-3 extra taps to text where it used to only take one. I understand that I can download a 3rd party Launcher and get that feature right back--at least I THINK I could--but doing so would take away all the edge features that admittedly I bought this phone for in the first place. Yes, its minor, but I thought I'd pass that along anyway. I just wish Samsung would give us that option back and let us decide if we want to use it or not.The camera is just unbelievably well made. It takes exceptional low-light photos that I've never seen the equal to--at least not on a cell phone anyways. The zoom feature is great, even from far away its ability to focus with the OIS ability is nothing short of phenomenal, MUCH better than my LG G3 camera. If you zoomed in too much, the laser focus simply couldn't handle it. I never took a pic that was zoomed in all the way that came out anything but blurry on my G3. NOT so with the Edge+. Impressed is all I have to say. I WILL add that some features that the phone is capable of using you have to download and are not immediately available ON the device right away, like snapping a photo or video taping with the front & back camera's at the same time. Keep in mind when you touch the 'More' button down by the shutter button, if you see a circle with an arrow pointing downward, that is what you press to access other features that you can download that the phone doesn't come with natively when you first turn it on. FYI.All in all I am not only STILL impressed, but very happy that I went with the Edge+.***UPDATE #2***I mentioned in my initial review how the GS6 Edge+ had a built-in feature that I used to have with my Blackberry which allowed the phone to auto re-start at a pre-determined time but for some reason the T-Mobile version didn't have it...I received an update a couple days ago and on a whim I decided to go check again and VOILA! It was there! It won't allow you to auto re-start it more than once a week, but at least its there. Just one more thing I thought I'd point out that I now love about the Edge+. I wish, however, that this device had the productivity on the Edge feature like the original Note Edge came with, and I must say that I'm a little mystified as to why it didn't come available right out of the box like that, but I'm still unlocking new and improved features of my phone almost daily. If/when I come up with any that are truly ground breaking I'll try and remember to update this review accordingly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RD19KWQJ1QJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0147EVKCQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RD19KWQJ1QJJ","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, these are not Noise Cancelling. I looked all over the box they came with and inspected the earbuds closely and they just aren't. They might be Noise Isolating, which is similar, but NOT the same, but certainly they aren't Noise Cancelling, so please be aware of that up front.Range and charging was convenient. The charging port was located on the mini volume rocker located several inches away from the actual earbuds themselves, which I thought was novel and way more convenient than the sweat resistant bluetooth earbuds I've reviewed of late which has the charging port on the actual earbud itself and is slightly a pain to pull out the rubber stopper in order to charge. You take the good with the bad, right? These fit well and comfortable too, which was a nice touch, too. I noticed not everyone felt the same way, but I have to say they fit me quite well, and even had the correct size rubber ear buds attached so I didn't have to remove them and try a different size.My only major concern was the sound quality. It was decent, but was mostly the highs and mids with very little bass to speak of. Now I'm not looking for a bass-driving pair of earbuds that artificially enhance the bass of everything I listen to (beats does this), but I DO like there to be great range of lows to compliment the mids and highs. Unfortunately these didn't have that in my opinion. 25 years in radio has shown me what that really sounds like, so I'm not speaking entirely from a position of no experience. I KNOW what good sound is, and this was okay at best. Sorry. I really wanted to like them more, too. Oh well. I was asked to give a fair and honest review, and this is what I personally think and believe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X2LFUUX38J34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141GTO0A#wasThisHelpful","R2X2LFUUX38J34","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like to protect my investment. There is probably nothing I use daily more than my phone--and the same is probably true of most people. Since you generally buy them at a discount in exchange for signing a contract or something similar, its hard to remember sometimes that to buy them brand new would run you north of $600 in most circumstances (especially for flagship model cell phones). It stands to reason that no matter how careful you are, sooner or later you're going to drop your device. Its not really a question of IF, but WHEN. Doesn't it make sense to protect your phone  as best as you can?The case for my LG G3 is stylish and fairly thin considering its durability. The back is a mass of raised bulbs which act as shock absorbers for that eventual tumble it will most likely take at some point. The back feels a bit rough in your hand I must admit, but it isn't so annoying that I cannot see the advantages far outweigh any disadvantages. I think it'd be great if those raised bulbs had been much softer, but I'm not sure if that is more of a wish or in doing so it would make the case less capable or not. In particular I like the built-in stand that comes with this one. I've always thought that was a fantastic idea, and especially when watching media/videos and whatnot. Very convenient and they did it without adding too much bulk, too. I have noticed however that because of the case, the charging port is not as easily accessible as it used to be with the previous case I had. This may or may not be a deal breaker for you, so I recommend you make your choice wisely and with the most information possible so you wont' be surprised once you pop it onto your G3.Over all I am very satisfied and happy with my case, but is it perfect? No. Not yet.

"I have been fortunate to have been given access to several different styles and kinds of bluetooth earbuds in the last 6-9 months and most were very good--especially considering what they cost, a couple were okay, and one in particular was abysmal. This came as a bit of a surprise since almost all of these I tested were quite economically priced, proving once and for all you don't have to fork over large sums of money to get a quality, well-made and most importantly, great-sounding set of earbuds that also happen to be wireless. So, for those of you in the market for good quality but with limited budgets, the good news is you CAN find great bluetooth earbuds if you're willing to do your research.I'm happy to point out now that the QCY earbuds are now my favorite of all that I have tested so far. In all fairness, they are slightly larger than the previous models, but don't let that bother you. They pair easy. They are comfortable to wear as they come with additional ear plugs to adjust to your size ear etc and another piece of good news: they stay put quite well. The cord isn't too long or too short as some seem to be one or the other as of late. They hold a great charge for many hours (although I couldn't tell you if the claim of continuous playback of close to 9 hours is accurate or not since I've only used mine for just over 2 hours straight) and are even sweatproof, making that yet another wonderful selling point for those who plan to use them while actively exercising.However...best of all: they sound GREAT. I found that while they aren't Noise Cancelling, they certainly worked incredibly well to almost eliminate the vast majority of outside interference by fitting in my ear SO well that 98% of everything I heard was what I wanted to hear. In my book that is a downright miracle for a product that is only Noise Isolating and not Noise Cancelling (they are entirely 2 different--but similar things). Great highs, wonderful bass--but not too much. Fantastic volume and I particularly like when turning it on you can hear a voice say, ""Power On"" or ""Power Off"" when turning on/off respectively. Yet another fantastic point is that you can also use it to answer calls on your phone. Talk about ultra convenient. Simply put, I cannot recommend the QCY earbuds enough--ESPECIALLY when you factor how little they cost. I would put their quality, sound and convenience on par with bluetooth earbuds which cost 3 times the price easy. If you're looking for a winner, my top pick for those on a budget would be these hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OQ03UO864JC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HYM0KE#wasThisHelpful","R2OQ03UO864JC4","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my grandson who turned 3, and he is ALL boy. The look on his face when he saw this was beyond priceless. The big task was trying to keep him off it while it was assembled--which goes together rather well and pretty easy. As another reviewer noted, the seat doesn't lock into place as well as I would have liked, but for the price, I must say, this is an exceptional buy.The track appears to be rather sturdy, but as with most things, only time will tell whether it can weather the storm of a 3 year old little boy, right? It doesn't go quite as fast as a bigger toddler may like, but for my little 3 year old, it is plenty, and maybe even slightly too fast if that makes any sense? He's such a thrill-a-minute little stinker that I doubt he has any clue to his own mortality, so the top speed is plenty for this little tyke.Let me just add the one major thing which makes presenting a toy such as this to a child: the look on their face when they see it is worth it all, trust me. His pure joy was something to behold, and is the major reason why I would not only encourage you to buy this, but happily so. I sincerely doubt you'll be disappointed.

"I've been waiting for a mighty long time for Jack DuBrul to come back to Phillip Mercer, a character I would put up with Dirk Pitt or most other action adventure characters you can find in print. It was nice when Jack took over writing some of the Oregon Files novels with Cussler, but I always wanted him to get back to writing his own original novels. My wait seemed forever--but oh so worth it.Mercer Is Back, baby! And better than ever. His geologic background is in prime focus as he witnesses the murder of a good friend and some colleagues and immediately sets out on revenge to put things right. Along the way we find out more about the Lightning Stones, and their connection to one of the most famous pilots of all-time (appearing in a wonderful prologue). Along the way we have a healthy dose of amazing action, adventure and loads of information about everything from geology to weapons. Its a wealth of information that proves that not only is Phillip back where he belongs, DuBrul has honed his exceptional writing style and talent and has only become better...and The Lightning Stones only serves to prove that.Welcome back Phil.

"I love all things audio--always have. Its one of the reasons I've been in the broadcasting business for the last 25 years (and counting). The honest truth is, I know what sounds good and what doesn't. But, I have also come to realize that with most things in life, there are many opposing opinions regarding earbuds, headphones and whatnot--else, why would people continue to pay outrageously stupid high prices for Beats headphones despite the fact that they are mediocre--at BEST? I have a couple theories: first, they don't really know what great sound really is, and only bought them because its the ""IN"" thing to do and wanted to fit in with the crowd, or second, people talk up the great sound simply because they feel the desperate need justify having spent so much on what clearly are about the most overrated headphones available on the market today...and possibly 3, they genuinely believe that they are good and worth the money (I can assure you, along with the incredible number of studies done and available on the web which prove beyond a doubt they most certainly are not).With that long-winded statement over and done with, let me promise you I have a HUGE amount of experience wearing devices to listen to music...and I DO mean a lot. I wear headphones on average 4-5 HOURS each work day. Most people don't wear them that much in a week. This alone does not make me better at understanding decent sound than anyone else if I'm being honest, but I'd like to THINK it does since audio quality is essentially my life. You can either take my word for it or not--its totally up to you.While lately I've been using mostly bluetooth earbuds (some of which have been exceptional to be honest) but I always fall back on my old tried-and-true plug-in earbuds when I want the absolute best sound possible. My favorites (especially for the money) are the Sony X-Tra bass models, man do they sound great. But if I had to choose a runner-up pair at this point, I'd go with the Panasonic Drops 360. Yesterday I decided to put them through my own personal test: I wore them on a hike in 99 degree temps around traffic. The sound was honestly impressive--very much so considering the price. I've had many earbuds which sounded great, but couldn't play music very loud (which I prefer, especially on hikes & runs) which tended to allow way too much traffic sounds to sneak into the listening experience, thus spoiling it. The Drops were exceptional in this department. Great highs, great lows and impressive bass (again, especially considering their price). Can you find better? Of course, but I doubt you can for cheaper.They also stayed put--which is another extremely important factor for me and I would venture to guess, most of us who wear earbuds. I have tested many earbuds which were great, but ultimately I couldn't recommend simply because they wouldn't stay put when I wore them. Honestly, what good is the audio quality if you are constantly having to adjust them from falling out of your ear? I am thrilled to say the Drops stayed put and never gave me issue on my nearly 4 mile hike.I can honestly say without reservation that these are some of the all-around best earbuds I have ever tested and they are so much more worth what they cost, in short, I am VERY impressed and have zero hesitation recommending them to all. These are simply put: a GREAT BUY PERIOD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QJXJ933SKC8D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLHIIQY#wasThisHelpful","R2QJXJ933SKC8D","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I am a fan of Ted Bell and Alex Hawke in particular since his first novel, I must say after finishing up ""Patriot"" I found it to be my least favorite of Alex's exploits so far...and I feel the need to explain that Bell at his worst is still better than most at their best. So yes, its a criticism, but still high praise indeed.ALL of Ted Bell's Hawke novels have, for better or worse, a ring of James Bond to them (and for good reason), but this one was almost a bit too much in my opinion, and by that I mean over-the-top. One of the things I have enjoyed about Hawke's adventures is that while unbelievable, they still had a certain ring of probability that made it all the more realistic while reading. This one? Not so much (again, IMO).Taking on Putin directly certainly paints yet another very current picture as Bell typically does as his novels seem to generally be very 'ripped from the headlines' in its realism--and in some instances, almost prophetic. Does anyone really not believe that Putin isn't much more than a big bully with the power of nuclear arms? Bell captures much of this bravado in fine, adventuristic form and made me excited for what would come next. The results: another winning entry into the Hawke series which are ALL genuinely fun, entertaining techno-thrillers absolutely over-flowing with tremendous action. If you are a big fan of Ted Bell's previous novels, come ON, you KNOW you're gonna read it, the only question is whether or not you get it now or wait til later? My recommendation: go ahead and splurge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1680R7TF1OB8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062279416#wasThisHelpful","R1680R7TF1OB8T","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been interested in bluetooth earbuds for several years now, and I still recall the very first time I saw a pair of earbuds that had this particular style (which are not unique to SoundPEATS by any stretch). I had never seen anything quite so different and instantly thought, I need to get some of those! Well, it took me longer than I expected, but I finally got some. My experience? Read on...They were simple to set up, charge and pair with my mp3 player & my phone. Honestly, it was super simple. I really appreciated the easy way to pull out the charging plug and get it all powered up. I own several other pair of bluetooth earbuds that are water resistant, and the charging port can be somewhat of a nightmare to pull out just to charge, so this was a great feature I believe. Point SoundPEATS.They fit around my neck comfortably. The actual ear buds themselves have a relatively short cords, but that is by design. On occasion they get caught underneath the frame and it seems like every time I turned my head I felt it pulling against the actual frame around my neck. Easy enough to correct, but keep it in mind. the upper portion of the connecting stem is made of soft rubberized material, and doesn't irritate whatsoever, and as I mentioned above, is comfortable, so another point for SoundPEATS.Quality sound-wise...let's face it: without decent sound what's the point, right? I'm happy to say these delivered pretty good to great audio quality. They don't provide the highest of volume I have seen and experienced before, but thought for the audio quality, it was very sufficient. I also have to remember how affordable these are. Sure you can go much more expensive, but in my opinion (and please note that I work with audio for a living in the broadcasting industry for 25 years), you'd have to pay not just a little, but a LOT more in order to drastically improve the audio quality--again, an important thing to remember.Battery life is rather impressive, too. This is where the Q800 really excels. The frame that fits around your neck automatically can hold (I believe) a larger rechargeable battery, allowing it to hold bigger, longer charges giving you more time in between having to plug it back in. Another point for SoundPEATS.Now you might wonder why I gave it just 4 stars? The truth is this: I prefer the smaller models where they just hang from your ear and the cord goes around your neck, and not to a frame that fits around your neck. Strange, but that is just MY particular preference. For you, it definitely might be different. If that isn't a factor, I say pick these up asap. I am really happy with mine and use them quite frequently, but tend to stick to my other SoundPEATS bluetooth for when I do exercising.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30TH4DBAHLJNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z56JVI6#wasThisHelpful","R30TH4DBAHLJNR","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After seeing a preview to the film several weeks back, I instantly figured this would be a movie I was going to see for sure. The entire premise just struck me as utterly compelling. I was unaware of the novel at that time. Saw it at the book store a few days later and picked it up. I read quite a bit that first night. I must say I haven't read a novel this compelling in quite a few years.First off, kudos to Andy Weir for doing his homework. I'm sure preparations to write this was exhaustive and you can tell. The science--at least to me anyway--seems about as real as it gets. There may be a few things discussed that haven't come about just yet--but I would venture to say they are all based in GENUINE science, which is one of the core reasons the novel was so fantastic. Being stranded on Mars, literally and entirely alone, with essentially zero hope of survival, no way to communicate with earth to speak of and supplies that simply cannot last until the next Mars mission (some 4 years away) arrives, how in the WORLD do you overcome this kind of herculean obstacle? In the same way that NASA came together to bring the men of Apollo 13 home safely (seriously, bringing them home after what had happened to their ship was easily a bigger miracle than landing Neil and Buzz on the moon and bringing them back), the world comes together to bring astronaut Mark Watney home from Mars.About 100 pages into the book, I got to wondering how the author was going to handle the day-to-day business of surviving, based on the situation and how many close brushes with death he endures and make it all not just readable, but thoroughly entertaining? I can tell you this: Andy Weir pulls it off in style. Part of that was his careful plotting. Face it, unless you are familiar with the in's and out's of literally going to another planet and what it would take in order to REALLY pull that off, you might be a bit confused at how someone can make all of those sordid details interesting, but boy is it. Everything from making water out of incredibly dangerous hydrazine rocket propellant, how to grow potatoes on Mars when technically it should be entirely impossible to do so and how to traverse great distances on the surface in order to ensure your survival, its all here. As the novel progresses towards the climax, I can say that Mr. Weir notched up the thrills by making it all sound amazingly realistic. Does everything go as planned? Heck no. In fact, Mark Watney nearly kills himself many, many times--some due to his own mistakes, some beyond his control, and it all makes for an incredibly GENUINE experience. Plenty of times I felt like I was reading what actually HAD happened versus a true-to-life sci-fi novel. Yes, the science IS real--even if you don't understand it, the author does a great job of ""dumbing it down"" in order to better process what is happening and why. At its core, The Martian is a story of incredible tenacity, determination and an amazing will to live by someone who--by all rights--should have died on the lonely surface of another planet. His triumphs as well as his failures all ring true and that is part of what makes this book simply incredible.In short: I LOVED THIS BOOK. I was interested in seeing the movie before, but now I'm downright excited. My only worry now is whether or not they screw it up--as Hollywood does 99 out of a 100 times they adapt an excellent novel into a film. Just FOLLOW the damn story folks, the closer the better. Its what makes the book amazing in the first place. Don't mess with it unless absolutely necessary. In this particular case, the closer they adhere to the story, the more compelling it will be on the big screen, especially the very last 15-20 minutes. Please, PLEASE don't screw it up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIBW9DQC57VE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553418025#wasThisHelpful","R2OIBW9DQC57VE","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to like this product--badly. For one, I'm a tech kinda guy, and I collect watches and the like. I used to work (briefly in between jobs) for AT&T and I've been in radio broadcasting for almost 25 years.

I don't care who you are, every company manufactures a lemon every now and then, and this is quite possibly what I received--however, since I can only review what I actually DID receive and not what I had HOPED it would be, I will do just that.On the surface, the iHealth Edge looks a lot like the Motorola Moto 360 smart watch, just smaller and slightly thinner. The device came with a second band (gray) along with the original (black) and the clasping mechanism isn't exactly my favorite, but it works rather well for what it was designed to do. The screen is, well I'm not entirely certain. I'm getting a bit ahead of myself here. Let me just say that I was never able to get my device to work at all. Not even in the slightest. I read plenty of reviews of the Edge and pretty much expected that I was going to have to figure out on my own how to get it up and running--and this is where my tech experience I mentioned earlier comes into play. Its the only reason I mentioned it to be honest. Thankfully however, a few kind reviewers had actually been able to figure it out long before mine arrived and detailed exactly how to get mine up and running seeing as the included instruction manual--which LOOKS thorough enough, just isn't. I charged my watch until it showed battery was full. I downloaded the free app from the Google Play Store--oh, and by the way, there are TWO iHealth apps to choose from, and nowhere could I see which one I was supposed to download, so I did both on the off chance that one wasn't correct. I think a simple explanation to which you should use with the device you purchase isn't too much to ask now is it? I was able to figure out which one went with the iHealth Edge by the way (no thanks to the instructions that it should have come with), and followed the instructions TO THE LETTER mind you...which is kind of a joke since the instructions don't really explain a heck of a lot. I followed the online instructions that were left by the kind reviewer I mentioned earlier. I KNOW I followed them properly because everything they mentioned happened just as explained, except that my device never once paired with my phone thus enabling me to see ANYTHING but the following on the screen: ""Launch App Ver 1.0.1""...well, that isn't entirely true. It showed the code to write down in order to get the watch paired with the app on my phone. Other than that, I got nowhere after 45 minutes of trying over and over and over and...well you get the idea. I visited their official website to troubleshoot the issue. No luck. I googled how to fix my known situation. No luck. So, whether or not the iHealth Edge can do literally ANYTHING it says it can do, I have no clue whatsoever. All I know is I couldn't get the device I had to work properly even in the slightest. And that bugs me, because I really wanted it to work. Dang it!","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTNO86NPFNNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUEWD2#wasThisHelpful","RPTNO86NPFNNL","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that I grew up with the author. Henry and I go back to--oh, I'm not entirely certain to be honest when we first met--just that it was a long time ago. Aside from one High School reunion, I haven't seen Henry since high school graduation...and if you had asked me all these years later which student I went to school with would eventually self-publish a book about teenage girls playing volleyball--I'm not sure if I would have put Henry at the bottom of the list, but he'd for sure be close.One thing I CAN say is that he is endlessly inventive and this story took me entirely by surprise...and not just the story line--which certainly did I must say. Henry can actually WRITE. His working knowledge of volleyball is pretty obvious, even to a novice such as myself. But it goes much further than that. We get INTO the game, the players, the action and definitely the excitement surrounding this explosive and fast-paced sport. It all goes into the book. The up's, the downs and even the heartache.Year of the Phenoms is a classic feel-good tale that gives you the same excitement you got from watching films like the Karate Kid and the original Rocky. Almost everyone can identify with their school's ________ program and how it didn't necessarily live up to another sports success. In my high school we had a stellar wrestling program year after year, but everything else? Well, we'd be good in football one or two years and then not so much for a couple years and soforth. But what if your school suddenly has not one, but several legitimately talented players all at once in a volleyball program that has, well, struggled to say the least for a VERY long time...? You now have the recipe for excitement as only someone like Henry could bring to the pages.A year ago if you had told me I would read a Young Adult story about a girls volleyball team--and on top of that genuinely LIKE it, hmmm, I really, REALLY doubt that I would've believed you...but that is exactly what happened. I was not just surprised, but thoroughly thrilled that my friend managed to self-publish Year of the Phenoms and I can proudly say that it wasn't just decent, and good but it was downright FUN. What's more is the end promises a sequel! Congrats Henry on putting in the hard work necessary to publish a great read that deserves a spot on the shelves with Harry Potter no less. I've always been happy to say I know you, but now comes my opportunity to brag a little bit, as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPCQ98XRKASO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5BF17S#wasThisHelpful","R1SPCQ98XRKASO","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot stress enough how impressed I am with this little package. I must admit I was quite skeptical--especially after reading several reviews claiming it was crazy loud, especially for its size. Well, let me say this: those who made that claim were absolutely right on. First off, let me start off by my impressions with MPow packaging...its pretty sparse--but well done. No gigantic packaging for such a small speaker with a lot of unnecessary wasted space in the box. Hardly any as a matter of fact. I've seen worse packaging done by much better, well-known electronics. So kudos for a job well done.This is my second MPow device (previously I reviewed my pair of bluetooth earbuds which also were exceptional BTW) and I have to say that this little package kicks some serious hind quarters. Small, water-resistant and with a shocking amount of bass--especially for how small it is. This is my 3rd bluetooth wireless speaker and by far the smallest--but also the best sounding. Not only is the audio pretty crisp and very well balanced (again, VERY impressive considering its tiny size) but it can get crazy loud. This was my impression before I even realized I had it sitting on one of the two built-in speakers. Let me just say if you are looking for a game-changing little unit without forking out the stupid-crazy high prices being charged by beats (all but a colossal waste of money), JBL, BOSE and many others (a lot of which are good, but also much more expensive), I recommend you do some research and see what this little baby can offer you.One more small--but critical and essential thing to mention is that this is also dust and water resistant. Meaning you can bring it into the shower with you, but don't let it get submerged. It isn't water PROOF, just resistant--a minor but very important distinction.In a pinch, not only will this provide audio for you when you need or want it most, but will also substitute for an emergency power bank for your smartphone when you are out of range of your vehicle or a wall socket. It may not get you all the way to full charge, but if you need a little extra juice before you can get to someplace to fully charge your phone, this will do in a pinch. Another pretty nifty little advantage if you ask me. It also comes with a very convenient cord to plug your mp3 player directly in so you can listen to that (or your cell phone) in case you have a device you'd like to listen to but it may not come with bluetooth capabilities like many smaller players these days.The list of reasons to buy this are long and I can't think of any compelling reasons not to--unless you are against buying anything that doesn't come with a well-known brand name on the side and you just absolutely, positively MUST part with way more money than necessary...I say you owe it to yourself to seriously consider the Armor Portable Speaker.

"I must say, I did quite a bit of research before making my purchase, so there was very little to surprise me upon opening up my 360 upon its delivery. In fact, the only real surprise was how much more convenient the newest update was after it downloaded than I expected.First off, packaging: very well done, Motorola. I found it to be very well done, inside and out. Nice touch. The device was nowhere as big as I initially expected it to be, even though I had handled the display model at Best Buy multiple times, its entirely different actually strapping it to your wrist. I like big watches, so this did not feel huge, bulky and it certainly wasn't heavy. I own several ABC watches that are significantly larger, so I was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable it felt.Craftsmanship was exactly what I expected. The watch itself looks great. The screen, while not as pixel-dense as some of the competitors out there (including the apple watch), still looks great. It was bright, and in fact, I wish the settings allowed me to turn it even further down than it does. I'm sure it was help battery life considerably...speaking of which, the battery will be a problem IF you don't turn on Theater Mode (new setting which came with the latest update) and turn off the screen after each time you receive an update or when you look at the screen face. I was surprised at the number of texts, emails and facebook updates I received during the course of the day and yet I still had 60% battery life when I left for home from work. I literally look at my watch when and ONLY when I felt necessary, and shut off the screen as quickly as I could after reading or dismissing each notification. For those who let the watch turn off after reaching its time-out limit will see a dramatically different percentage at the end of their work day. I recommend trying this for those who are worried about how quickly the battery can go down. Since my model had the update from the get-go I cannot compare it to how it performed before, but I hear its noticeably better.Some of the things I wish the watch did that it does not include being able to read more of each message I receive, if not all of it. I appreciate how I can dismiss an email on my 360 and it will follow suit on my phone. I had to download a different texting app in order to be able to dismiss those on my watch and have it also be dismissed on my phone. (I use Textra for that in case you were wondering). I also downloaded Light Flow in order to have my watch receive patterned vibrations when receiving texts and emails. I must say the free version works pretty good, too. Not for all messages mind you, but for free, it was more than worth the time setting it up. As I mentioned above, I wish there was a feature that allowed me to turn the brightness up or down however I wanted. I think that alone could add an additional 20% more battery life. Oh, one more thing: I wish that the screen when off the moment I pressed the button instead of staying on an extra second and a half. Minor complaint yes I know, but the more juice I can get out of the battery, the better IMO.When it comes to what it can do? I was both surprised and mildly disappointed. I liked the collection of watch faces, but I quickly found several 3rd party apps which allowed me to increase my watch faces by quite a bit (I even have one that makes my watch look like a round apple watch). The flat-tire at the bottom of the screen is a royal pain, let's be honest. Its a major pain that they went with a light sensor in this manner when I believe pretty much anyone who buys a round faced smart watch would rather have a full screen. However, the watch faces that have black backgrounds mask the flat tire much better than anything with a white or lighter background. When not displaying the actual watch face, I find that I didn't care about it being there at all. Some of the weather updates arrive a bit more often than I would prefer, but I'm pretty sure that changing that is nothing more than a setting I'm just forgetting to search for.I like how I can say ""OK Google"" and send a text message--however I have noticed that it is much less accurate than using my phone. As in, I use it much less than I probably would were it to work better. Even so, the times I have demonstrated it to UBER Apple fans who I work with, it did (thankfully) work flawlessly and boy were they impressed. They also thought the style and overall look was more impressive than the apple watch telling me specifically they were very disappointed in how cheap the apple watch looked in general. I think that however is in the eye of the beholder. Those who are apple fans will more than likely think their watch is better and soforth. I don't think the apple watch looks bad at all, and the screen is really well done IMO.After the initial set-up and time frame of getting used to what the watch can and cannot do, I must say that it has become much less important than I expected it would become after owning it for several weeks. It IS a conversation starter with many people, and the majority all say it looks great. I happen to use the Matrix screen at the moment and that has never failed to garner a positive comment or two from almost everyone who see's it. But overall, is it more convenient to have it than to not? Well, that is debatable. I genuinely LIKE my Moto 360. It looks nice, it works great and I appreciate all it can do. I can definitely see further and more practical ways in future updates where its usefulness will become much more of a ""must have"" type of gadget. I DO know that I have caught more text messages that I normally would have missed (some were very important, too) because I take my phone out of my pocket and have to have the volume shut off for work purposes. In this I have been very grateful. But so far, it hasn't become the all-important Must Have product that I thought it would be initially.If Motorola improves just the battery, screen resolution (although increasing the resolution will also adversely affect the battery life as well, and the honest truth is--at least for me anyway--the screen resolution is adequate), improves speech recognition, better vibration--in fact, if it gave vibration patterns to choose from right there would be an improvement, and the ability to read more of the messages received, I believe this will be easily a 5 star device that I would deem a ""must have"" gadget.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BUCJSTB0NHR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC8PMUK#wasThisHelpful","R3BUCJSTB0NHR8","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have struggled to find a convenient, workable phone mount for my car for quite some time that wasn't outrageously expensive, but also capable of holding something slightly larger than a small iPhone. The last several I have purchased came with a sticky substance that would 'secure' my device in place and was supposed to NOT leave a sticky residue. First off, only one relied entirely on the sticky substance...and it worked great--until it got hot one day and suddenly the sticky substance began to adhere to the phone in very inconvenient ways which became VERY difficult to remove. The second simply wouldn't expand beyond the width of a smaller iPhone and the sticky crap started doing the same thing on hot days (I have since discovered they ALL will do this when the temperature becomes very warm to hot). I live in a very warm city--especially in the summer--so these have become literally garbage to me.When the opportunity to review this model became available I jumped at it. FINALLY! A Universal Car Mount that will expand more than enough to fit my phone (or even a Note 4 for that matter) and requires NO sticky crap whatsoever! It fit together easily and simply. I thought for a bit that it might adhere to my dash, but the texture made the seal a bit difficult to achieve, so I just stuck with the window. It worked. PERFECTLY. The two edges are coated in a rubbery substance which closes on the sides of your phone and holds it carefully without the danger of scratching, another added bonus in my opinion. There is a small section which pulls down so you can rest the bottom of your phone for added safety, but I find that I don't use it because the hole underneath doesn't line up with my charging cable, and I find that the sides capture it more than sufficiently, including on un-even surfaces.The adjustability (is that even a word?) is another convenience. It can be manipulated in so many different ways there is certainly one that will work best for your viewing angle.All in all, I am not just satisfied, but I am THRILLED with my Multi-Angle Universal Car Mount. It is manufactured well and convenient to work with and adjust. It is more than capable of handling larger phones, so if you have found difficulty as I have finding a decent mount that will also be able to handle something other than a phone with a miniature screen, this is definitely the car mount for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQGZ60EBRQ5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XJE2YHQ#wasThisHelpful","RXQGZ60EBRQ5V","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I must admit, the very first time I saw a 'Selfie Stick' I laughed. Hard. I thought, how silly can you be? I mean REALLY?? But after a few days using my LG G3 phone to make videos for my radio stations facebook page, it suddenly--and shockingly--became apparent that I not only could use one, but they could actually serve a purpose more than what I had initially thought.As I was approached to review this particular selfie stick, I noticed that they were available at the check out counter at a local convenience store, if that gives you any indication of how popular they've become. Set up for the Kinzd was pretty straight forward and simple. It came with a micro USB cord to charge the bluetooth enabled stick and since my phone can take pictures via just saying, ""Cheese"" or by making a hand gesture, I find that I haven't used the bluetooth ability at all--however, for those who have phones different than mine, I can see where that particular feature would be immensely convenient at the very least.The adjustability (is that even a word?) of the device is also very simple. My phone has a 5.5"" screen and it has no problem whatsoever opening up to fit snugly. It will handle even larger and of course, smaller smartphones, too. The articulation of the telescopic end is simple, strong and easy to manipulate under a number of circumstances and will provide a long time of use. The button to operate the bluetooth feature is of course placed conveniently on the handle and makes operation a breeze.All in all, if you're looking for a genuinely simple and versatile selfie stick, look no further, the Kinzd IS the model for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LE3C30BQV0HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0PTMVG#wasThisHelpful","R1LE3C30BQV0HU","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When bluetooth speakers first hit store shelves, I was skeptical--at best--that they would turn out to be anything but a small blip in popularity followed quickly by them disappearing. As usual, my ability to predict the future was off only by 99.99%. Based on current technology, bluetooth and NFC powered speakers have become not only the norm, but incredibly popular. This particular model is my second.Let's start off with the Pro's: It lives up to its billing as a rugged little speaker...and it IS smaller than I expected it to be. It's about a third as small as the other model I own. Range is pretty good, too. A lot depends on what you currently use to transmit the audio. I tested it using just my little MotoActv sport watch and it performed flawlessly and had impressive reach. The speaker gets a bit louder than I expected as well, but I noticed at high volume it seemed to be taxing the audio quality a bit too much, so I wouldn't recommend it. I have yet to attempt to use it in the shower, but from what I can tell, it certainly *looks* as thought it would be water resistant enough to use daily. It charges fairly quickly, too and maintains that charge rather well from my real-world experience.Cons: Not a whole lot. My biggest was very little bass registers. The highs are almost too high and tinny, especially at higher volumes, and the lows were virtually nil unless you had the volume somewhere in the middle. Turning the volume up as I mentioned above, tended to show the very real limits of the audio quality.Some have expressed opinions regarding difficulty using the buttons, but I personally did not find that to be an issue. All things considered, if you want a rugged speaker that also can be used in a rather wet environment should expect that some compromises need to be made in order to achieve this. Honestly I didn't think it was a big deal.So in conclusion, for the money--and you can spend your money in a LOT of ways, especially with the expansive number of bluetooth speakers available nowadays, it is very hard to beat what the SE90 offers. I enjoy mine very much and I am considering buying one for my oldest son to use. Think long and hard before spending a lot simply to get a logo on the side of your speaker, and good luck!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTINABTY5EZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7N0MK0#wasThisHelpful","RSTINABTY5EZZ","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price--WELL worth it. I have a nice collection of bluetooth earbuds, and the more expensive models don't necessarily sound better or work better than the cheaper ones, so its important to do your research. I have several things I like to judge my earbuds by, namely:Comfort. Do they fit comfortably? Do they stay PUT easily?Sound. Let's be honest, if they don't sound good, comfort is kind of a moot point.Durability. I wear earbuds and headphones (due to my career in radio) arguably more than most people. I like the products I use to last, especially if I like them.I can tell you that the Q2's deliver comfort, they sound pretty good and seem to be very well manufactured. The lows aren't quite as well defined as I would personally like, but then again for what they cost, I am definitely NOT complaining.Can you find better sound for the money? I doubt it. Can you find better earbuds overall? Absolutely--but you'll pay a great deal more, too. For those on a budge who want quality sound, comfort AND durability, the Q2's really should be right up your alley. The carrying case was a very nice touch, too. I also particularly like how they fold up so compactly when not in use. I highly recommend the Q2's as a great way to get the convenience of bluetooth earbuds without having to break the bank. Oh yeah, you can also use them to make calls! Talk about versatility! (although in total honesty, I don't use mine for that).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R50IBIB1Z9RUL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUMPF1O#wasThisHelpful","R50IBIB1Z9RUL","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I never thought about owning a bluetooth speaker before. I own currently 3 pairs of bluetooth earbuds however, and they are of varying quality (the Solememo earbuds are spectacular, though). I had the opportunity to pick this speaker up and haven't looked back. Not only is it relatively small, but charges rather quickly, and what I found impressive was the range of the bluetooth. I haven't tried to see how far it'll reach, but was impressed with the distance I found purely by accident.It can get rather loud, too--especially considering its compact size. I have yet to put it to this particular test, but it claims to have a 10 hour battery when volume is on setting 10. I used it for several hours and the battery was still pumping out at full volume and it only took a very short amount of time to charge back up to full.It was very simple to pair with my phone and my Motoactv Smart Watch (which is where all my music is for bluetooth). It also comes with a handy cord that allows you to play anything off of a mp3 player that doesn't have bluetooth, which I also find VERY convenient.The build-quality is impressive, too. I love the fake leather strip at the top with the volume controls. It just LOOKS cool. The speakers work on both from and back and the sides, so it doesn't matter where you point it, you'll get great sound. I must point out that the bass doesn't seem to be super, over-inflated, so if that is what you're looking for, you might be a little disappointed. I like just regular bass, and for me this little baby ROCKS, literally.I couldn't be happier with my speaker and I think for the money especially, you will be too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MV11BIMAO27P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF8IHHG#wasThisHelpful","R2MV11BIMAO27P","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the money, the Clip Sport is a great little device. There are some things I wish were different compared to my old Sansa Clip, but I'm not complaining. I have a great little mp3 player that holds a lot of music, is easy to add more memory to and plays what I want it to. Honestly, I'm not sure what else I'd want, except for a better, more intuitive equalizer. Other than that, I think I'm pretty much thrilled with what this little baby gives me.If you want dozens of additional options, you can get them, but at a cost in different devices. These days if you buy a device like this and don't read up on it (like here on amazon) and it doesn't have a particular feature you were desperate to have, honestly I think the fault is your own. Mine works great. I'm very satisfied.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHELKQQUCOEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCMZ19Y#wasThisHelpful","R2MHELKQQUCOEH","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bluetooth wireless earbuds have come a LONG way in a relatively short amount of time, and for the second time in a week, I'm writing a review of bluetooth earbuds that have impressed me on a HUGE level. I work in radio and I have been associated with audio for 23+ years now and I know what good sound is (not that you wouldn't), and I know the difference between ""good"" and ""exceptional"" audio quality. I've used a TON of different brands over the years and some tend to always give great quality (Sony, Sennheiser, Bose) and some are hit and miss (Phillips, Sanyo, Beats, JBL). If you type in bluetooth earbuds at amazon your choices are seemingly endless--meaning competition is incredibly fierce, which I honestly think is a great thing for the consumers. The only real problem is weeding through the so-so products to get to the decent stuff actually worth the price tag.If you're looking for wireless convenience in an earbud, and want to enjoy great sound without breaking your bank, look no further than the Mpow Swift earbuds. Seriously. Before a couple weeks ago I had never even heard of the company, 'Mpow' and yet here I am singing their praises. Let me explain why...PACKAGING--pretty minimalist here, but that doesn't mean cheap. I was impressed that it didn't take a gigantic box to pack what I received. I got what I ordered and nothing more. It was packaged nicely and professionally. I like that. I am not a fan of opening up a package and leaflets for virtually every product the company has ever produced in history also comes falling out.INITIAL IMPRESSION--Great. The earbuds look even better in person in my opinion. They also come with an impressive number of attachments to help insure that they not only fit comfortably, but securely so. Once again, I'm impressed--especially considering how small the overall package is.PAIRING--as technology improves, so does this particular issue which used to be a serious problem with so many bluetooth devices I've used in the past. The Swift paired quickly, and simply with my Motoactv Smartwatch. Within less than a minute I was linked and listening to music.SOUND--now this is a tricky area which is up for some major debates. Again, having been in broadcasting for more than 2 decades, I'm pretty familiar with poor, good, great and exceptional audio quality. Personally I enjoy good bass--but not at the expense of decent mid's and highs. The Swift provides I believe between good and great audio without much bass whatsoever. Yes, I missed the additional bass, but again, when you factor in the price of these earbuds, honestly, you simply cannot beat the audio quality.COMFORT--as others have noted, the inclusion of so many attachments to help with the comfort means it may take a bit in order to add the one which works best for you, but I encourage you to take the time to find the one that works best as you'll be immeasurably grateful later on. Wearing devices such as these for long periods of time can either be a pain or a pleasure. The Swifts can be both--depending on what you're willing to do. Its pretty much up to you.BUILD QUALITY--I was VERY impressed with how well the Swift not only looks, but how well it was manufactured. They are actually made very well indeed and seem on par with some rather expensive earbuds I've worn over the years. They don't seem like they're going to fall apart at any given moment (my previous Sanyo's) and feel every bit as quality made as my Sony's and the Beats earbuds (the only thing with the letter 'b' on the side I'll endorse).CONCLUSION--for the price, seriously, you cannot find better in the world of wireless bluetooth earbuds. The sound quality was pretty good, too--not exceptional mind you and virtually no real major bass, but then again if you know what to expect, you may find them even more impressive than I do--and I found them to be very much worth every penny.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS2E6NBEA75TZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PW3B194#wasThisHelpful","RS2E6NBEA75TZ","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great product all around. These bluetooth earbuds/phones (not sure what you would classify these since they fit around your ears and not just IN them, earphones...?) are remarkably simple to operate, and paired quickly to my bluetooth Motorola Motoactv GPS mp3 sportwatch. I haven't had any issues with how far the devices will work since I wear both at the same time.The packaging was straightforward. I'll admit upon examining the earpieces, I was a bit skeptical that they would fit as well as they did. The actual part that goes into your ear seemed bent too far backwards to fit naturally, but I am happy to say they fit rather well and most notably, comfortable too. I also know that each persons ears are slightly different than everyone else's, so your experience may vary. The portion which fits around your ears to hold them onto your ear is flexible and will mold easily without worry of going back to the original shape, at least in my experience. The charging cords were simple and easy to figure out even without the owners manual which explained everything rather well. I like how the charging cable (provided) has two separate cords to charge both earpieces simultaneously.Okay...sound. Is it any good? Well, yes & no. Again, keep in mind what these cost and you'll be truly amazed. If you're looking to compare them with Bose, Sony, JVC, Sennheiser etc. The convenience of bluetooth 4.0 (which really DOES make a difference) and a strong connection which allows for the music to flow much better without the occasional song getting clipped due to poor reception truly IS very nice. The fact that you can buy these for UNDER $40 makes all of that convenience even more remarkable in my opinion. The Solememo earphones delivers fair sound quality without a ton of bass or treble. If you are a fierce audiophile looking for deeper low's, mid's and high's you'll probably want to skip these. If you are happy with the earbuds that come with your mp3 player, then you'll be ecstatic over what these can and do deliver.I haven't as yet had the chance to test the length at which the charge lasts, so I cannot yet comment on how long you can listen without needing to recharge, but hopefully I'll be able to come back soon and add that to my review.All in all what I CAN say is that these wireless earphones work--they work really well and even though sound quality isn't what you can get for $100, it IS about the best you can expect, especially for how economical the price is. Would I recommend them? Absolutely without question.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZQ26NWOY6QYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8SSL6M#wasThisHelpful","R2ZQ26NWOY6QYU","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, I'm impressed. Seriously. For the cost, I don't think you can do better than the Tudia protective case for the LG G3. It fits great, it feels good in my hand and like it says, is relatively thin, considering how tiny the G3 is (especially comparing it to similar sized smartphones). One thing I was worried about was how the case would actually ""feel"" and by that I mean whether it would be like similar cases made from silicone that are SO rubbery, that pulling it out of your pocket many times pulled your entire pocket inside out because of how the texture tended to adhere itself to your clothing. I am thrilled to say the Tudia is a more cleaner finish and smooth to the touch compared to what I just mentioned. No issues there at all.All in all I am VERY satisfied--again, especially for what this product cost. Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong. My previous Tech21 case was great and worked wonderful, but it attracted dirt like nothing I've ever seen before. I tried to clean it many times, a few using a hard bristled brush I typically use to clean my dishes with and had ZERO success. Once that baby is dirty, its not ever gettin' clean I'm afraid.Oh, and one more thing: this is my first white finished phone and I always felt sad that the only other case I found at the phone store where I purchased it (also, for more than 3 TIMES the price of the Tudia) was blue and it covered up the color of my phones natural cool white color. This model is a cool whitish-clear color which still shows off how great the phone looks. Again--VERY happy.Kudos to Tudia for a great case that is incredibly inexpensive, too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1J9KKNVPZUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KFV3I4Y#wasThisHelpful","R3L1J9KKNVPZUR","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that I work in broadcasting (radio) and I am an avid collector of headphones and earbuds. I've used expensive and the cheap, and by and large, aside from death and taxes, what I've found to be pretty much an absolute is that Sony makes fantastic products. Period.My professional studio monitor headphones are Sony's (MDR-7506's) and they are pretty much the industry standard. I've used Power Beats earbuds (which are the ONLY things by beats that I will actually endorse) and I've used fairly cheap Phillips earbuds and been remarkably surprised at their quality vs actual cost. I currently have 2 pairs of Sony earbuds, one pair was relatively inexpensive ($29.99) and provide great quality and audio as well as being great for use on my cell phone for calls. I've owned several noise cancelling earbuds (my personal fav being a Phillips pair that were rather impressive considering how little they cost). However, I have discovered after initially jumping on the Noise Cancelling bandwagon how they simply are not worth the additional cost unless you really do travel a lot on planes (which is why they were created in the first place). Noise Cancellation does NOT make the audio sound better. AT ALL. Let me say that again for those considering buying some: they do NOT make music sound ANY better. ALL they do is help isolate the music when you have a lot of ambient background noise surrounding you (such as on an airplane). Some are better at it than others (see anything with ""Bose"") but Phillips actually makes some good ones too.All things considered though, you can buy expensive and great sounding earbuds (such as the Power Beats or Bose, Klipsch, Sennheiser etc) or you can get JUST as great audio quality without breaking the bank and buy something like the Sony MDRXB50AP Extra Bass earbuds. It took very little time wearing these to determine they gave me Power Beats audio quality for less than HALF the cost. They were great at noise isolation (not noise cancelling) and boosting the audio levels on my mp3 player  by a pretty hefty amount over even my regular Sony earbuds--which was very gratifying considering some of the songs I have were recorded at pretty weak levels. They impressively gave a boost to the bass, which I expected, but also were great at the mid's and highs as well--which I did Not expect.I was going to mention how I wish the cords were flat, when it hit me that they ARE flat, just very narrow. Basically this means they won't tangle like many of the cords on earbuds available today. They still CAN tangle, just not as easily. A nice touch by Sony, and for someone who has dealt with tangled cords like I have, I was VERY happy to see this feature. It'll make a difference for you whether you realize it or not.Long story short, if you want exceptional audio quality with added bass (but not TOO much), great highs AND lows with punchy mid's too--look NO further than these. As I mentioned above, they give you truly incredible sound at less than HALF the cost of some other brands which we all know well enough. In other words, why pay more?","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JZHJRWQEBKCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE08H8O#wasThisHelpful","R1JZHJRWQEBKCZ","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a different novel from an author who is best known for riveting courtroom thrillers. Some authors make the switch between genres and manage to pull it off (Greg Iles comes to mind as one who has done it with incredible finesse), but while Phillip has branched out before, this one is still different than what we've come to expect...and that isn't a bad thing to be sure.If you've read Margolin previously, you're already familiar with his intricate plotting of his mysteries, and this is again on display here as well...just in a much different manner. For one, this is a period piece thriller which takes us back quite a ways. An author sees a photograph appropriately called, 'Woman With A Gun' and becomes quite transfixed with what he sees. It becomes somewhat of an obsession for her. As it turns out, the woman in the photo was a suspect in a murder investigation. Somehow our intrepid author, (Stacey Kim) becomes convinced that either the women's guilt or innocence is somehow connected to the photograph. The resulting investigation opens up much more than Stacey thought possible and unlocks a mystery that is at the core of this tale.Was it as compelling as previous Margolin courtroom dramas? No, not in my opinion. However, it WAS very well told and I deducted a star simply because I wasn't expecting this tale to be anything like it ended up being--which was MY fault entirely to be certain, but hey, this is MY review and I chose to hold Phillip responsible anyway. Call me petty, I don't care. Knowing this in advance may somehow make the story more enjoyable for YOU however, and I hope you rate it accordingly.I must admit however, that I look forward to Mr. Margolin's next thriller in the courtroom, because it is in that environment which he excels at, in fact more so than most writers in this same genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JFH66YPFK25I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062266527#wasThisHelpful","R3JFH66YPFK25I","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What can you say about Jeremy Robinson's Jack Sigler/Chess Team novels...other than they freakin' ROCK. Savage not only helps to put an exclamation point behind that statement, but does so with as creative a story as I've seen come from Mr. Robinson--and that, my friends, is saying a LOT. Let's face it, I look for creative as well as entertaining stories to read, and few--and I DO mean VERY few authors have the seemingly endless well of shockingly awesome ideas that comes out time and again by this guy. Clive Cussler had it (I dare say he's all but lost it in the last ten years or so), so did Tom Clancy once upon a time, but we saw his writing go steadily downhill at a progressively rapid pace and yet over and over Jeremy seems to discover new and even MORE creative ways to propel a story forward at a dizzingly rapid pace.The Chess Team novels are an amazing triumph of that never-ending well of creativity attached to the back of a hyperdrive running at 110% capacity. Each novel is great and absolutely LOADED with action and adventure--and again, I don't say that lightly. I think of all the action/adventure authors I read regularly, only Matthew Reilly exceeds the action level of Robinson--that's pretty much it. And by the way that includes James Rollins, Cussler, Crichton and others. Trust me, he is in fine company if not a class by himself. Plus, he does it without sounding all cartoonish like Reilly's action sometimes tends to be.Savage has got it ALL. Nuclear weapons, ancient mysteries, and more action than you'll find it ALL the James Bond movies COMBINED. I won't rehash the plot as so many others have done already. I'll just give you my impressions of yet another adventure that is the reading equivalent of being launched off the deck of an aircraft carrier: Yet ANOTHER Winner from the mind of Robinson and Ellis. I don't know how much of the writing was one or the other, but the end result is the same: a sure fire entertaining juggernaut which can satisfy the action thirsts of any ten adventure enthusiasts--and THEN some.If you have yet to pick up a Chess Team/Jack Sigler novel--first of all, what the HECK are you waiting for??? I WILL say this though, if you plan to do so--and why wouldn't you, either start here, or at the very beginning. Savage is actually a good place to begin if you have never read any previous Sigler novels, but honestly, you're going to end up doing so anyway, so you may as well BUY this one, but then immediately go get ALL of the previous books and sit back, relax, enjoy and repeat. You can thank me later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UN3ZMRMW1LF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0R1F96#wasThisHelpful","R3UN3ZMRMW1LF2","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about a great case! I did some research before I purchased my phone, and doing research on which case to buy is equally as important. I read a LOT of good things about the Tech21 cases in general, and then I went INTO a store and talked to the representatives there and asked them about it. Several there SWORE by the protective power of this product. But then again, they work off commission, so I was pretty skeptical up front. Then one of them put his own phone in one of the cases and proceeded to throw it against the floor as hard as he could. This he did without warning. I was entirely unprepared for what he was going to do. Needless to say he shocked me was an understatement. However, the end result was a perfectly protected Samsung GS5 which had ZERO nicks or scrapes or any sign of damage whatsoever.With all that said, I think what he did was just shy of irresponsible--but after the fact, I clearly learned a real-world fact about this case by seeing in action, and THAT my friends was the major selling factor in my eyes. A sales person can talk all they want about how a product performs in the real world, but rarely do you get the chance to test drive something like this before buying. I learned that Tech21 is the real deal and whether or not the mumbo-jumbo talk about the space-age special absorbing material used on the inner lining means anything other than just a funny talking point to make it sound more sophisticated than it really is, I don't much care. It worked and protected the phone and did so without what looked like a single bit of damage whatsoever. Now THAT was a great job selling the product.If you're looking to protect YOUR investment--and let's be honest, you should--look no further. The Tech21 LG G3 case is really thin and barely adds any bulk to an already skinny and light device. This I appreciated VERY much. You will, too. All I can say is this, I am glad I bought one. And also, one more thing: unlike some rubbery-type phone cases which are SO rubbery (mainly the silicone kind) that every time you pull your phone out of your pocket it seems to pull the whole pocket out with it, this one is slick enough to NOT catch on the lining of my pockets--and yet maintained enough of a grip in my hand that I didn't feel as though it would be in danger of slipping out any any time.I hope this helps!****UPDATE****Just a quick note to tell you that after a while, the textured surface of the case tends to get dirty--like REALLY dirty...and if you don't clean it daily, good luck getting that dirt to come off. I waited a bit too long and even used a brush normally reserved for cleaning tough, cooked on stains from my dishes, and it made absolutely ZERO difference. I recommend cleaning your case every other day or so, otherwise you'll find some unsightly stains that ain't gonna come off. Just an FYI. Everything else I still love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C8QTDEL4XW0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O81IB1C#wasThisHelpful","R2C8QTDEL4XW0U","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SO glad I went with the G3. To be totally honest, I worked (albeit very briefly) with AT&T, and during that time the one thing I figured out aside from the fact that Windows phones were simply unreliable was that LG made the most issue and bug-prone Android phones I had seen. So many came back with serious problems that I vowed that (at least at that time) I probably wouldn't be trying an LG phone out anytime soon.Jump ahead a couple years when I have the chance to buy a Nexus 4. Imagine my surprise when I realize it was made by none other than LG. I very nearly went with something else. I did my research however and made a decision to buy it anyway. Easily the most stable phone I've ever owned--aside from the asinine freakishly easily broken rear panel. Jump ahead 2 years and I'm seriously considering the Galaxy S5, the Galaxy Note 4 or the LG G3. Then I saw the price and availability of the Note 4 and immediately ruled that out. Then I noticed that the Note 3 went down in price with the Note 4 coming out and immediately thought that I would more than likely go with that instead. I did a great deal of additional research and as I went in to buy my new phone, I was pretty much convinced that I'd get the Note 3 specifically because of the cheaper price. When I realized that the G3 was only a few dollars more AND happened to be the 32GB version, with 3GB's of RAM, that sealed my decision right then and there.First off, plastic or not, this phone LOOKS premium all the way, baby. If anyone says otherwise, they simply are not viewing the same phone I am. LG insists that underneath the back brushed metal looking surface IS in fact a layer of metal (I haven't been able to confirm or deny this BTW) but nevertheless it really does look quite stunning. I went with white, mostly because I have never owned one that color before. I couldn't be more happy with the build quality regardless of what any reviewers say. Don't go off of what you have read, if you are on the fence, I urge you to go INTO a store and handle one yourself and see before making up your mind.The screen is stunning. I won't say its Super Amoled stunning like the Note 4, but even so it IS gorgeous. The colors are reproduced beautifully and, I might add, a bit more realistically than I would say the typical Samsung screen renders--but that doesn't mean I prefer it to the rival smartphone. I think the Note 4 easily has the greatest looking screen manufactured as I write this--hands down. But despite the brightness issue that some have problems with on the G3, I think its still awesome and nothing I could see with my own eyes looked pixelated one tiny bit. Crisp and clear, which is why I wanted it partially in the first place. One note about the default setting when you first turn it on is to switch it from Auto Brightness to manual. The standard Auto dims the screen as to make that amazing device impossible to tell the difference between it and a much less inferior screen. Turn it up to about 65% or so and you'll begin to see the genius of how awesome it really looks.The back buttons are an interesting design choice. From what I read based on those who have this phone is you either love them or you will almost wish you had bought a different device because you simply could not get used to their placement. Honestly, before I even held one I thought placing the buttons on the back was a stroke of brilliance. Yes, it DOES take some getting used to, I'll admit. But what makes it all much simpler to deal with is their absolutely PERFECT Knock On feature. I think I've actually used the power button twice, the rest of the time I just tap on the screen twice and it comes to life. A similar double tap turns it off. Gosh what an unbelievably awesome feature, especially coming from the Nexus 4 which had the power button exactly on the opposite side of the power buttons. I can't tell you the number of times I went to turn off my screen only to turn ON the volume instead. That came back to haunt me a few times in Church I assure you. Knock On, no matter WHAT you hear otherwise is probably my favorite feature of the G3 aside from the screen.Battery life so far seems to be noticeably better than my N4 which admittedly was on the sour side of horrible. It is nowhere as long lasting as my original Note, which I was rather impressed with several years ago. But again, with all those additional pixels powering that QHD display, comes a downside of less battery life. It's a trade-off I'm willing to make, especially knowing I can buy a separate battery which was not even possible with the N4. But regardless, each of us use different priorities when buying a phone and this one may very well be a deal breaker for you, so judge and plan accordingly.The Speaker on the back is a whopping 1 watt power-plant. Now for those not familiar with speakers, that may sound on the surface to be kind of laughable, but I assure you that little speaker pumps out some serious volume. It isn't something I'll be choosing to listen to Pandora with mind you, but it is far and away the loudest speaker I have personally used on any smartphone. From what I gather as I write this only the HTC One's speaker can truly beat it for quality and loudness overall, but that too is in the eye of the beholder--or in this case, ear.I've found some neat little tricks that are built-in via helpful YouTube videos which I encourage you to look up if/when you make the decision to purchase the G3 because it will make owning the phone a much bigger pleasure after you have figured out some of the really cool and helpful tricks it is capable of. Some may be a bit gimmicky like with the Samsung phones, but some truly are valuable and come in handy.Reception was a BIG issue for me as I just moved a couple days before I bought my phone and my new area had some pretty poor reception with my Nexus 4. Granted, it was only capable of HSPA+ and even then only in certain areas, but I figured that since 4G LTE was still brand new to my area with T-Mobile (the service I currently have) I would possibly have even less coverage than before. Boy was I wrong. Not only does it have a fantastic signal even in the basement, but its also LTE. So at least from my personal perspective, the reception is significantly better than with my N4, which was a VERY welcome surprise.The camera was another area where I labored my decision making before buying the phone. It lacked less megapixels than either Samsung phones I was considering, but yet it was considerably more than my previous device. In most of the camera tests I have viewed either on YouTube or through other written comparisons, the G3 was consistently ranked ahead of the Note 3 as well as the GS5 but lagged slightly behind the Note 4. Several comparisons rated it better than the iPhone 6 and the equal of the 6Plus. All of that means nothing if it doesn't work for you in the real world. What ultimately won me over were two significant things that the G3 had that many other phones didn't. First was OIS, or Optical Image Stabilization (in fairness, a few other phones DO have this, but again, not very many). It helps to take clearer photos and video without the shakiness and the other, which as I write this NO other smartphone has (at least that I am aware of) is laser focusing. There simply isn't a phone available that can focus faster than this one. There just isn't. At first I was worried that it may be a bit of a gimmick, but no, its the real deal. It really works. The photos are much, MUCH better than my N4 and I'm happy to say they are every bit as good as the iPhone 6's. Nuff said.The ability to multi-task on this device is really pretty awesome. I'm not sure why I would need to answer an email WHILE watching a YouTube video, but by golly, I could if I wanted to. Running two apps at the same time is an amazing ability--one that apple simply cannot even attempt regardless of which model phone you may have. It falls short of what the Note 4's capability is, but then again its a much older device, too. I would recommend getting the 32GB model with 3Gigs of RAM if you plan on using Dual Window multi-tasking regularly, but that is just my opinion. That extra gig however really makes a difference, trust me.Call quality has been excellent thus far, and one other thing is I was quite surprised at how much I really love the LG keyboard right out of the box. I fully expected to want to use SwiftKey Flow, the regular--but incredibly accurate Google keyboard or my old standby, Swype but I find that I have been alternating between SwiftKey and the LG keyboard exclusively. Bravo to LG for making their keyboard SO user-friendly and customizable right away. That makes a HUGE difference for those of us who not only want, but demand the ability to switch things up and customize to our hearts content.The ability to customize your phone has just gone up a HUGE notch with the G3 in general--which again, for those of us who love to really make our phones truly UNIQUE is not only a plus, but one I have grown to really love on my G3 the more I use it.Not every phone is perfect for every person, but I CAN say this: I am more than pleased with this phone, and while it no longer sports the quickest chipset and processor on the market like it did when it was released, I don't really much care. What REALLY mattes is this phone WORKS, and works really well--especially coming from my 2 year old Nexus 4. I truly find that the G3 is simply amazing. I could NOT be happier with my choice to buy it.***UPDATE***I've had additional time to play with my phone and if its possible, I love it even MORE. For me, part of the fun of getting a new phone is getting to know the in's and out's of what its capable of doing, and I have literally been falling in love more and more with it. I am STILL in awe of the screen. I have read additional reviews which basically say that because the display is LCD and not Super Amoled, the colors don't render as well, or they aren't as sharp as they expected it to be and whatnot. I gotta say that they couldn't be more wrong. The color saturation may not be as much as on a Samsung, but that means they tend to be more true-to-life. I think they pop PLENTY. Much more and it'd look simply cartoonishly odd in my opinion. The sharpness is just amazing, as you'd expect from a QHD display. If anyone says otherwise, either their screen is broke or they're simply not telling the truth. LG didn't only hit a homer with this phone, but they knocked it out of the park with a Grand Slam.I didn't use any other previous LG branded phone other than the Nexus 4, so I don't have any experience with their former UI which pretty much everybody universally slammed as just shy of incredibly annoying. Personally, I am finding LG's UI with the G3 to be a pure joy to work with thus far. The amount of customizing you can do is nothing short of amazing. SO much more than any previous phone I have owned. I've found some cool built-in features that I had to download via 3rd party apps in my other devices, such as flash alerts when a text or call is made using the camera flash. I had to use a different app in the past but the G3 has it built IN. Before if I wanted the LED indicator light to flash different colors based on who texted me, I had to download yet another app, but not here. The more I delve into the capabilities, the more impressed I am--and that is not as simple as you may think. Having sold phones in the past, I am more aware of smartphones and what they can and can't do than the average power-user, in fact I knew more than the folks at the T-Mobile store I bought my phone at--but in all honesty, not much more though. Once again, I love my phone.About the only thing I haven't really gotten into is the camera. Which is unusual, I tend to go full-bore into my devices from the moment I unbox them. But I've been so dang busy that I haven't been able to just yet. One thing I have noticed was of the few pics I have taken, the laser focus is like freaky fast and definitely NOT a gimmick. It really does assist in getting the pic unnaturally quick. Plus, I've zoomed in on photos that on older phones would have looked stupidly pixelated, but was still SUPER clear with the additional 5 megapixels. You can seriously see the difference. I don't take a lot of video, but if/when I finally do, I'll make sure and do another update.I understand to a degree why the apple fanboys dislike android. Part of its because androids can be customized SO much, it takes a LOT more time to set up your device to do what you want it to do. But in so doing you make the entire experience so much more enjoyable and fun. Face it apple folks, android simply can DO A LOT MORE, but that comes at a price. It is nowhere as simple to use out of the box as OiS is. I concede that. To some it is nothing shy of confusing to the max--trust me, I GET that. BUT, the overall experience works, but you've got to be willing to put in the time to learn it in order to get the most out of it. For those who do, the experience is nothing shy of magical in my opinion.***UPDATE #2***Can't believe I forgot to bring this up earlier, but while this is without a doubt the MOST compact 5.5"" screen device available (at least as I write this), it IS a fairly decent sized smartphone. For those with big hands you'll love it--however, if yours tends to be smaller, I recommend going INTO a store and physically handling this before you commit to buying it. I know that sounds almost redundantly obvious, but you may be surprised how many people buy stuff online without ever really knowing if it'll fit their hands etc. Even though LG has their own version of compacting the screen to make it easier to use one-handed (which Samsung did first--and still does best I might add), it just wasn't very convenient. The one-handed texting screen was better. If I could ask for one thing of the LG G4, or whatever they replace this phone with is to directly copy Samsung in this area, they did it RIGHT. So to re-cap: go to a store and physically HOLD this phone and play with a REAL one, not those stupid fake mock-up's they tend to have at a lot of stores so you can get an idea of how you would hold it yourself and use it before buying.After a few more days using the LG keyboard, I take back what I said earlier. It started out working great--unfortunately, the more I used it, the LESS accurate it became...which is supposed to be the opposite of what SHOULD happen, but that's the facts. I went in and deleted the cache in the keyboard settings and it worked great--again for a while, and began to do the same inaccurate stuff as before. I am a bit perplexed as to why, but I've gone back to SwiftKey Flow and Swype and the trusty and VERY accurate Google keyboard (now if only Google would clean it up to make it LOOK a bit better and more customizable, honestly its the best keyboard for direct accuracy I've used, but it just LOOKS so dang boring and blah). Oh well.***UPDATE #3***Wanted to bring up a couple things now that I've had the phone for a while now. First is battery life. I've gotta say how impressed I am considering the amount of pixels that screen is powering--especially coming from the Nexus 4. Now, with that said had I come from something else with known decent or even great battery life, I may be singing a different tune. Keep in mind the Nexus 4 had well-known HORRIBLE battery life. So almost ANYTHING I went to was going to be better than what I had before. But I cannot compare it with the LG G2 or the Droid Maxx or Galaxy Note 3 etc just what I had before, so please keep that in mind--but so far I think the battery life is pretty darned good.The camera is absolutely AMAZING. The camera default setting is on 10 MP resolution, and those alone are fantastic. The color has been incredibly vivid and crisp, especially in bright conditions. I've only used the flash once, and was rather impressed with how that turned out as well. The one thing I wish they had done different is when you switch to full resolution of 13 MP you also lose full screen photos. I wish that they had kept it the same for all the different resolutions you could choose from. In that way I kinda feel a bit cheated...but I just have to say this thing takes wicked good pics so far. I am VERY happy with that camera. I can only imagine what the next LG phone camera will be capable of next year...one thing is for sure though, it'll take GREAT pics.***UPDATE #4***One thing I had done with my Nexus 4 was change settings so I could access Developer Options and switched the Runtime from Dalvik to ART (Android Run Time). While typically this is MUCH more efficient, not all apps and/or phones have updates which are compatible with switching to ART--that is until they receive the Android 'L' update. I did this with my N4 and it worked pretty well, but not long after doing the same to my G3, I began to notice my phone freezing up. It frustrated me to no end, and in fact I performed a full-on hard reset--which I later determined was unnecessary (gosh do I wish I had known this first). The LG G3 hasn't received an update which will allow its core adaptation of Android to run on ART just yet, and as a result, when it ran into incompatibility issues, it simply froze up--which as you all know is incredibly frustrating. Not once did my N4 freeze on me, so after it happened 3 times within a couple hours, I knew something was seriously wrong. After the reset, it naturally went back to running Dalvik and absolutely ZERO issues since. While I cannot say with 100% certainty that this was in fact the problem to begin with, the fact that it only began freezing up shortly AFTER switching and has since stopped the moment I corrected this is a bit of an obvious giveaway if you ask me. I have since found several detailed blogs talking about this exact problem. Again, I WISH I had seen that before performing the reset, but at least I'm letting YOU know so you can hopefully opt to NOT make the same mistake as I did. The honest truth is I did not see any significant difference in performance after switching to ART anyway. Since the G3 hasn't been optimized to run on it just yet, I am only assuming that is the main reason why I haven't seen any noticeable difference since having it revert back to Dalvik.Can I just say once again how much I LOVE the Knock On feature? This is seriously one major awesome ability that I have found immensely helpful from literally the beginning. I find it JUST as useful now as I did when I purchased the device. Honestly, who needs a fingerprint scanner when a knock code is JUST as reliable and every bit as secure? While technically it isn't, I'm just trying to imagine the absolute NEED to have security THAT deep that a knock code couldn't suffice? I imagine for some this may be a supreme feature and necessity, but not for me. But everyone is of course, different. Besides, I hear that one thing the iPhone definitely has on Android is a real world RELIABLE finger print scanner with their home button, unlike Samsung whose scanner seems to work sporadically--if at all--and don't get me wrong, I am a BIG Samsung fan. I came THIS close to getting the Note 4... If I'm being honest, apple has one major leg up on the Android community and that is the reliability of their home button finger print scanner. Kudos to them for that ONE thing. I still prefer Android by an unbelievable margin.I am (again) still impressed with my phone, its capabilities and pretty much everything all told. It's VERY thin, maybe not iPhone thin, but in the grand scheme of things, its hardly noticeable, and at least mine isn't known for bending. It FEELS comfortable in my hand, and STILL takes killer photos, even in low light thanks to the OIS capability minimizing your movements in order to take some clearly awesome pics in the dark. It won't replace your full camera just yet, but it honestly takes some fantastic photos which I would normally hesitate to even attempt with previous phones--and leaps & bounds ahead of the N4.I read this week that LG has not only claimed that they were committed to timely updates, but actually are releasing Android Lollipop in Poland THIS week, which is ahead of the announced release of Android 'L' to even the Nexus 4 and 5. Word has it we won't see it here in the states for a few more weeks, but this certainly is a great sign considering last year LG was ranked dead last for releasing updates to their devices. Talk about a gigantic about face. While I haven't received it just yet, I still think this is a great sign and one which helps me to know I made the right choice in buying the G3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DVCKKBXXMLTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9OVC94#wasThisHelpful","R1DVCKKBXXMLTW","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fun, but I have to say that after about 15 minutes, my son (all 3 of my young sons) got rather tired of the train.For the most part, it LOOKS impressive. All set up its rather large, which for a child is a big thing actually. Unfortunately the instructions to piece it together were essentially so poor that it was easier to just look at the box and go from there. Unfortunately that made us have to experiment with several pieces being in the wrong place before figuring it out properly--but we DID get it together after a few minutes of frustration.Some of the pieces fit together better than others, but all in all I have to admit that the train works just as promised, and the little moving portion of the bridge really does work pretty well, even though leading up to it, if I were a betting man, would have bet money that it wasn't going to work at all. I would've been wrong.The only real downside is that since the train only does exactly what you see on the front of the box (admittedly, it does it well) it gets rather boring to watch again and again after say 5 minutes. Plus after it does everything, you've kind of got to readjust a few of them in order for it to do it the next time around--and that gets rather tedious after a few times as well. All in all, it works as promised, but gets super boring VERY quickly...and for my boys who have attention spans the size of a gnat, that makes me wonder whether or not it is entirely worth it to make this purchase. If your child can watch the same boring train go round and round again and again without any complaints, then maybe this is the set for you. If your children have much shorter attention spans (such as mine) you may want to reconsider.Hope this helps.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R319UI5VQNWRW1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQ8MTIY#wasThisHelpful","R319UI5VQNWRW1","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially I bought these because I thought they looked cool and they were comfortable. After 8+ years of wear & tear (mile after mile of plenty of usage) the only reason I still don't have them is because I forgot to take them out of my van when I sold it.Hands down the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever worn--and I've owned my fair share. My son keeps trying to convince me to buy a pair that he has which are supposedly guaranteed for life (Choco's or something along those lines). Sure they LOOK good, but the sole directly under your feet are akin to walking on concrete (NOW I know why they last forever, they're darned near made of stone). They are amazingly uncomfortable (at least for me) and so I'll stick with what works for me.So comfort is important to me, but I had NO idea just how durable these sandals would be as well, especially considering how much I've put them through for easily close to 8 years. Now THAT'S a quality pair of sandals if you ask me. I have tried to find a replacement pair for the one's I stupidly lost, but to no avail. I need to just break down and order a new pair online because I have absolutely GOT to buy another pair.In my opinion, BEST pair of sandals I've ever purchased. Hands down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REEIA3K3EMADW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0CGJ8U#wasThisHelpful","REEIA3K3EMADW","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wireless charger AND built-in battery too?? Pinch me! I didn't think this would be any more than just a regular wireless charger, so imagine my surprise when I realized it also doubled as an external battery as well!Yes, its true that wireless chargers don't charge with the same speed as plugging directly into a wall outlet, but the convenience it offers far outweighs that in my personal opinion. Also, the speed is pretty standard for wireless chargers, too. I keep wondering whether or not apple will EVER move into the modern age by offering what some Android devices have had for a few years now. If apple really is the innovators as they and the incessant whining of their fanboys continue to claim, why is it this technology has yet to find itself inside an iPhone for the last 2 versions? OR NFC for that matter? But I digress, let's stick to the wireless charger.The simplicity with which you can use it right out of the box is pretty important in this day and age and I am happy to report that this charger is no exception. I plugged it into my computer and it began charging the internal battery AND wirelessly charging my phone literally right out of the box. Say what you want but that's pretty darned convenient in my book. It's easy to know your device is charging, too. You place your phone on top and make sure you can see the row of lights at the bottom right-hand corner of the top and you'll hear it when it begins. Hard to miss, actually. Bam, that's it. Oh, and it charges without having to remove my protective case, either. Yet another convenience in my opinion.The device is well-built without being overly bulky and sits rather snug on my desk. All in all this is just about the best wireless charger I think I've ever seen. VERY happy with mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R154AQJR3PFYOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJKZL40#wasThisHelpful","R154AQJR3PFYOI","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Gillette razors for quite some time now, and honestly believe they are about the best available. I have since found several razors that work pretty much just as well--all for cheaper (sometimes quite a bit cheaper) than what a typical Proglide razor will cost.Initially I just thought I was ordering a regular Fusion Proglide razor...but no, this is the model that comes with the Flexball Handle. So what does the Flexball Handle actually DO? Good question. The razors have tilted backward & forward to follow the contour of your face for literally at least a decade or more, right? The Flexball Handle essentially now allows it to curve not only up & down, but now left & right as well, giving your new razor unprecedented facial comfort and coverage. All this should translate into not only the best shave ever, but smoothest as well, right? In reality, I noticed absolutely ZERO difference in how close the razor shaved than my previous Proglide without the Flexball Handle.Now, let me be clear: I still LOVE the Proglide, and firmly believe that if I have the choice of using the Gillette versus pretty much every model of personal shaver available, I'll go with the Gillette pretty much every time (unless of course I cannot afford one, in which case I have 3 different and much cheaper models which I believe work easily 98% as good).To sum it up, I LOVE the Proglide--but don't see that the Flexball Handle works really any better than the regular model. Maybe that's because the regular Proglide works so well, that the difference is purely subjective to each user, I'm not entirely certain to be honest. All I know is it works, and works well...but if the Flexball is more expensive, I cannot endorse paying more. If they are the same price as the regular Proglides, then no problem. Otherwise, I'd stick with the regular razor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WTB8NUXE6BYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2AP9F0#wasThisHelpful","R1WTB8NUXE6BYS","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Other than that, this Micro USB charger will fit virtually all android phones and tablets and even most Windows phones as well.

"I had hoped that when I ordered this, that somehow, someway it would also be compatible with an Android tablet, but I gambled and lost. Darn it. Oh well. I gave this to a friend who uses nothing but apple products and they have nothing but enormously high marks for usability, simplicity and set up.Everything comes with the keyboard, and sets up very quick. After charging (which is via the included micro USB port, strangely enough, what almost all android phones & tablets use) its simple to turn on, pair and operate. Keys were responsive and always worked with maximum ease. I liken the quality to something actually produced BY apple, which is high praise indeed. The layout is VERY similar to apple keyboards and therefore, the more familiar you are with them, the quicker you're going to adapt.The only issue I have is that it isn't compatible with an android tablet. Now this may seem like nitpicking (and let's face it, that is exactly what I'm doing) but I've found earbuds that were initially designed for an iPhone/iPod but still work flawlessly with my Nexus 4 phone. Complete with answering calls and the buttons working to stop, start or pause the music. If THOSE can incorporate the use across different phone platforms, why can't keyboards? I don't believe I'm asking too much to have a simple keyboard be usable by two different systems. Since I received the keyboard through my amazing Vine program, I won't complain because I'm not out any money, but I'm just saying, if you do what I did hoping that it'll work across both platforms, you're gonna be sorely disappointed as I was. Again, that is my ONLY gripe, meaning otherwise, the keyboard works and works WELL.

"I didn't think I'd ever get laundry detergent using amazon but I'm actually glad I did. I must admit, I'm a penny pincher when it comes to buying detergent and usually go with the cheaper stuff available and then complain if it doesn't work well and/or smell nice afterwards. The easy way to counter that of course is to spend a little more and get ACTUAL results. This Tide really does work, doesn't require a lot in order to do the job (especially if you use a High Efficiency washer) and the smell is really good. I find that I don't even have to use dryer sheets or any type of fabric softener for it to do the job and still smell great as it comes out of the dryer. A nice feat you simply cannot recreate using the cheap stuff that I'm rather known for buying...because I'm again, cheap.Spend a little--but you'll get a LOT. Considering how much extra cheap detergent I have to use in order to get my clothes not even quite as clean as a little Tide means when all is said and done, I'm paying for right about the same amount and it all ends up smelling nice the FIRST time around. I don't really see a reason to continue getting the cheap stuff anymore. I actually believe I'm convinced now...and I really didn't think I would be when I first used it.

"I am a 23+ year radio veteran--so I KNOW what good audio sounds like. There is NOTHING that will get me to believe the beats headphones are even remotely worth the outrageous price they cost. I've worn several and owned a pair, too. Were they good? Yes...b-u-u-u-t my Sony MDR 7506's sound BETTER and they are one-third the price. I've heard ALL the arguments, TRUST me. I'm not gonna change my mind. Period.However, I was mildly impressed with the urBeats earbuds by Dre. The sound really was pretty good. But let me also say this: I have a pair of Sony earbuds that I paid a whopping $20 on that I would say sounds 95% as good--and can out-do the beats in one very crucial area: they actually stay in my ear while exercising. I really would've kept them if they had managed to just stay put. I can't seem to figure out exactly why they kept coming out, either. Style wise they are remarkably similar in shape to the Sony's, but darned if they just didn't keep falling out and I found myself about ever half-mile being forced to reach up and push them back into place. Sorry, but that alone was a deal breaker. Now--I WILL say this: I won't suggest that all urBeats will act the same for each person. They may fit your ear like a glove and provide you with remarkably great sound for years. All I can say is if they cannot stay put, I've simply got to move on to something else.I was sufficiently impressed however that I just may take a gamble and buy a pair of their sport earbuds...if that means anything.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKRKDN9P45HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CQVUZS#wasThisHelpful","RCKRKDN9P45HB","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a little torn by the new attire that seems to be sweeping the athletic apparel industry as of late. Shirts and clothing made from this smooth and comfortable material promising a cooler, more comfortable workout due to advances in material technology, sweat absorption and whatnot. They may as well promise to increase your athletic ability for all of the other claims made.The truth of the matter is this: in all my workouts wearing the Tasc Performance shirt as well as multiple others designed by many other manufacturers (from the stupidly expensive to Walmart cheap version) not once have I been able to say, ""Wow, this makes my workout more efficient or more comfortable!"" Not one single time. I liken this so-called miracle fabric to the claims Sketcher made with their shoes a few years back about how they would make you work harder because of their unique shape. Interesting, but in practical use, I could see ZERO difference all the way around.What I CAN say is that the shirt IS comfortable. I took a gamble and ordered mine without knowing what size it would arrive in, and imagine my surprise/disappointment when it showed up no less than 2 sizes smaller than what I needed. By golly, I put the darned thing on anyway and wore it like a second skin for a couple workouts (I simply must've looked like a moron to those around me) and I can say without reservation the shirt is quite comfortable. It stretches abnormally far and even though it hugged me quite clearly, it wasn't too snug that it became uncomfortable (other than to those who had to view me). After a couple wears, it stretched sufficiently that it no longer felt too small, but felt almost just right. Even so, it was still too small so I gave it to a co-worker who absolutely LOVES it.Say what you want about the fabric and what it ""claims"" it can do or not, but in my opinion, I love the shirts and the fabric, but I simply don't believe it works--nor does ANY of the similar models on the market--the way its advertised. That is THIS guys opinion, and nothing more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B1YRGNQ0S8F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VEQPTM#wasThisHelpful","R1B1YRGNQ0S8F3","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're a power Nazi like I am, I get nervous whenever I'm away from an outlet for too long (I KNOW I'm not the only one) and having the ability to power up your devices from essentially anywhere is a mighty nice option. For a person like me though, it represents a necessity. Not that I absolutely MUST have it, but it certainly keeps my worries down to a bare minimum.First off, its pretty compact, and can fit in my pocket easily. Yes, its a bit thick, but not overly so. It comes with TWO usb ports which allows the charging of more than one device at a time if need be--which is tremendously convenient. I didn't think it would be, mostly because this is the first device I've owned which has more than one port, but now that I HAVE one, I gotta say, its come in handy multiple times when I didn't even expect it to.7800 mAh is a pretty hefty amount of power, and it doesn't even take long to charge fully. I have yet to plug it into the wall, rather I use my outlet in my vehicle do it for me. ZERO issues so far. Works like a charm, literally. About the ONLY complaint I have is that I haven't been able to get my miniature light to work. I rarely would use it, but even so, it'd be nice to have on certain occasions I'm sure. So far, it hasn't been obvious to get it to work, which has only been slightly bothersome. I haven't completely read the instructions, but being a man, I like to figure some things out on my own without needing to read all the directions (wish I could shake that habit, but apparently its in my genes), but for whatever reason, I haven't figured that little on/off light thing out. Oh well. No big deal.If you're looking for extra power that'll work when you need it, is pretty compact, especially considering how much power it provides, and comes with multiple sized plug-in's to adapt to virtually any device you may have or need, you have GOT to give this little baby a try.

"I own several earbuds which have built-in microphones for conversation using smartphones...they all work pretty good. Actually ALL of them work remarkably well for having conversations using the built-in microphone. But all of them have one thing in common: they don't SOUND really good playing music. My Phillips Sport ActionFit earbuds sound absolutely awesome. I mean that. The outside noise reduction is amazing, especially for not being noise cancelling specifically. They were loud, crisp and just plain sounded great all around.However, each phone conversation I had remarked that it sounded like I was in the wind and it was difficult to hear me, even in the car with the window UP and no air blowing at all my direction. I thought it was an isolated event, but it happened with each conversation I had while using it. I knew it was too good to be true. Oh well.The included rubber earbuds (it came with 2 sets of spares) fit great, and were comfortable. I was initially worried they wouldn't stay put, but I've done some strenuous stuff while wearing them and haven't had a problem with that happening. Compared with other earbuds which cannot replicate the audio very well, but can do phone calls great, I'm still wondering when I'm going to find a decent pair of earbuds that don't cost a fortune, but can provide both phone calls AND music quality that meet up with my ridiculously high standards.I'm happy to say that the Phillips ActionFit provided me with 50% of what I was hoping for.

"Yeah, you read that right. I figured since both tablets had similarly sized screens, they'd swap easily. Let me say right up front: I was wrong. Cutting these screen protectors, especially ones that were pre-sized to fit a different tablet perfectly is no small task. I've done enough for cell phone screens to know that. It takes patience to put them on no matter how well it fits, and lets just say, I ran out of all the patience I had--plus all my reserve trying to get this one to fit properly after my semi-decent editing job.Let me just say that had I used this on a Kindle (like I should  have from the beginning) I'm sure my review would be different.

"I have fairly small fingers and hands, and therefore, thought that this keyboard would be easier to operate than it turned out. I'd say I could comfortably hit most keys, but using an apostrophe while writing simple words like DON'T or  CAN'T became a colossal pain in the keister because finding the key was inconvenient at best, and a downright challenge at other times. The key wasn't where you'd expect, and therefore if you wanted to look as thought you had finished at least 4th grade English, writing anything more than a short message was simply unpleasant for me.With that said, if you aren't big on using that kind of punctuation, and you have really small fingers and hands, you'll most likely love the Belkin Portable Bluetooth Keyboard. It really is compact and worked just as promised. It paired quickly, and I was pleasantly surprised how overall simple it was to set up and use right out of the box--which is big these days.If at ALL possible, I'd go for a keyboard at least a couple inches wider than this (minimum) or at the very least, I say try this out physically whenever possible before purchase so you'll know if it works for you before purchasing. It'll either save you the pain of returning it, or you'll be better off knowing exactly what you're buying.

"No, it isn't a surprise that this is a co-written book. Its not like the first books passed off as written by Tom Clancy and yet were penned entirely by someone else. This one clearly states Grant Blackwood's name on the front (who, interestingly enough co-wrote with Clancy, too) and this is Rollins' first Sigma Force novel which tackles a different set of main characters than the regular fare we've come to expect. Introduced not long ago, Tucker Wayne and his trusty dog are front and center in The Kill Switch.Tucker and Kane have quite a unique relationship--almost bordering on what you'd normally reserve for a close human bond. If you've ever had a pet like Kane that you've bonded with, you know it can extent to special animals as well. The storyline is quick and unravels pretty fast--and I might say a bit too fast, which sometimes I don't mind when I expect it (like with a Matthew Reilly novel) but I expect a bit more story development from a novel with Rollins' name on the front. Not a huge complaint, mind you, but one I just thought worth mentioning all the same.There was plenty of entertainment, and more than a fair share of, shall we say, difficult to swallow exploits? Sure, your average Sigma Force novel has plenty of that, but one of James Rollins' many talents is to make each story sound entirely plausible even when you KNOW it certainly couldn't be--and yet you wonder if its possible anyway. The Kill Switch didn't have any of that in my opinion.For fans of Tucker and Kane from their previous Sigma introduction will find plenty to like here. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, but along the way, there are some pretty obvious signs that I wasn't reading a book that had been penned mostly by Rollins. I can't say it any more specifically than that. If you've read enough of his books, you'll see it.

"Are you like me, do you get nervous when you see your phone battery dip below 80%? Well, that may explain why I have 3 separate portable power supplies. Now I realize not everyone is as anal about powering their devices like I am, but for those of you who happen to have a smartphone--which you totally rely on--without the ability to remove and replace the battery, you really need extra power when you need it--and you NEVER know when you'll need it. Chances are, it'll be when you least expect it. This is where the OXA Portable Power Bank really comes in handy.Another reviewer said they liked this external battery, but felt that it wasn't really for 'power users.' MY argument for that is: WHY did they get a 2600mAh battery then? My current cell phone battery is 1700mAh so I easily double my power with this device...if you really ARE a power user, then of all the different sized external batteries available, why did you settle on one so small? They have positively gargantuan batteries out there to choose from which are able to power not only your phone, but laptop and tablet and still have enough to get you through the day--so why not get one of those? I have a 3300mAh battery which works great, too--but isn't nearly as stylish as the OXA. Sure, style isn't always what you're shooting for, I get that, but as long as you're going to use extra power, why not get a battery that looks as good as it works? Just sayin'.After the initial set-up and charge, I have nothing but high praise for my Power Bank. It charges quickly, and powers my phone with all the speed of plugging it directly into a wall outlet--easily 30-40% faster than using a car charger (if not, it certainly SEEMS like it). I like the included key ring, too. While it may be a little too big for some to carry around on a keychain, it really isn't by a whole lot. Plus, I really like how the included charging cord isn't ridiculously long. One of my other chargers came with an obnoxiously long cord which seems to be always getting bunched up and tied in knots, even when I TRY to keep it from doing so. Annoying? You bet. I understand that some prefer shorter cords, and some need and even require longer charging cables, but honestly, for ME, this is just about perfect. I haven't once had to untie it from a knot which is a tremendous blessing to me--especially when I happen to be in a hurry.You have plenty of sources to choose from when it comes to external power supplies, in MY opinion, if you need an extra boost and you aren't a super-power-user, think long and hard about giving the OXA Power Bank a try. I am perfectly satisfied with mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IKDECFCINGIN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2YI052#wasThisHelpful","R1IKDECFCINGIN","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before receiving this copy of Influx, I hadn't read anything by Daniel Suarez--however, I had heard a great deal about his novel, 'Daemon' from a a close relative who had tremendous praise for the novel, and ultimately, is the sole reason for my reading this book. Was it all worth it? Ultimately? I'd have to say absolutely.The idea is as brilliant as it gets in my opinion. I've always found it interesting how 20-30 years ago we thought we would be literally leaps and bounds ahead--technology speaking--of where we are now. Well what if we actually were--but those advancements were kept OUT of the public domain for what initially seem like noble reasons, but when the dust settles, those reasons really aren't the REAL reasons. Supposedly, some advances can become a horrific disruption to the world in general, and that just isn't good--which is why the Bureau of Technology Control (BTC) searches tirelessly to find such techno-leaps and does their best to recruit the inventors into their select circle. The idea is to keep their work secret--but now and then some inventors feel the greater good is served by allowing their sacrifice to be made public--which is a Super No No to the BTC. You see, you're going to join them--OR ELSE. You either do it willingly, or they kidnap and imprison you and that usually comes with no small amount of torture.Physicist Jon Grady resists when given the opportunity to join the almighty BTC, and this is where his life takes a dramatic turn--and not necessarily for the good. Previous decades of technology hasn't disappeared, those at the head of the BTC control it and have the perverted view that only they are worthy of it, and will stop at nothing to keep it away from ordinary citizens. I have to admit, as others have noticed, some of the technology in the book certainly SEEMS plausible (I'm no scientist, but Mr. Suarez did an admirable job of at least making it all sound believable under certain circumstances) These ideas are loaded with creativity on a massive scale. Explaining the unexplainable was certainly one of Michael Crichton's major talents, and the comparisons to Suarez are certainly warranted, because he does an equally fantastic job of making a moron like me almost feel like I actually understood all the gobbledegook he was writing about--which is no small task, by the way.The BTC was created by a group who felt it was necessary--and yet over the years the agency was totally forgotten, and before long, those who used to take orders from others were now in charge of their own work, and when that happens, bad things are afoot...trust me. There is so much to like in the clever storyline of Influx and while I enjoyed it thoroughly, was it perfect? Nope. Did I enjoy it enough to recommend it to others? Yes, absolutely. If you like Michael Crichton-like technology based thrillers, its time you discovered Daniel Suarez. I certainly am glad I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PNMEJBIHCFYY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525953183#wasThisHelpful","R1PNMEJBIHCFYY","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a huge fan of submarine themed techno thrillers since reading Red October back in the mid 80's. With all the novels out there to choose from, its nice to know I was fortunate enough to at least pick this one. Full of action, thrills and compelling entertainment--even if it isn't 100% plausible.Almost immediately after leaving port in Hawaii, the USS Kentucky receives some chilling orders: launch ALL ballistic missiles at the country of Iran. Some clever techno work involved keeps the crew from receiving any actual orders rescinding the fake launch edict. As you can imagine, the end result would be the deaths of millions of innocents in Iran, and the President does exactly what they do in the Hunt For Red October, he orders the fleet to hunt down and destroy the Kentucky before it has a chance to reach optimum launching position.So WHO is responsible for sending the fake orders to nuke Iran? Despite how plausible that explanation may sound, I found other holes in the plot to be remarkably huge. Another reviewer noticed the same, so I definitely won't be the last to catch some of them. I found how the Kentucky treated coming upon other US Naval ships to be utterly without merit in the scope of what supposedly has happened in the story. Also, communication between them and other ships...? What happened to that ability, except for when it became convenient for the plot...? There are a few others, but despite all of that, I STILL found myself so totally involved with the plot to not continue forging ahead to find out what was going to happen next and how they would end up solving the problem at hand. Would a nuclear showdown be avoided, and if so, by how much? Honestly, there wasn't any real doubt that things would manage to work out--but I have to say that I kept reading because part of me wasn't quite sure.Aside from its flaws, I was able to really and fully enjoy the Trident Deception quite a bit. I recommend it if you get the chance...especially if you're a fan of fun sub thrillers like I am.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R347ORIBMPL4VO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250039010#wasThisHelpful","R347ORIBMPL4VO","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second K'Nex building set we've purchased for our son (who is 11 now). He is VERY much into building anything and everything, but he is currently going through a pretty serious 'Lego Phase' and he was kind of reluctant--at first--when he opened the box and discovered it WASN'T Legos--to show any kind of enthusiasm. It broke my heart--but only briefly. It took him quite a while to get over the initial excitement of his other birthday presents before he chose to finally begin assembling the Supersonic Swirl. What was absolutely dramatic is how he transformed--quite literally--right before our eyes as he slowly realized that the K'Nex were a lot more entertaining then he had remembered. He prides himself on being rather proficient in following directions and putting things together properly, and again, it was eye opening to see his excitement grow by leaps & bounds as it dawned on him that the building set was a bit more of a challenge then he ever considered possible for his ever-improving degree of assembling talent.It all built to a head until he couldn't contain himself further and called everyone over to watch him as he turned it on for the first time. He was quite literally overcome with thrills. He learned a lot along the way--which is one of the primary purposes of building sets such as this, and he is gradually understanding the reasons for why certain items are built the way they are in order to support other items and heavier things above and beside. His incremental learning experiences are really giving him a dream to shoot for: becoming an architect. He enjoys building things so much through Legos and now, K'Nex, that he sees the framework of homes being constructed in a totally new light. He points out structural needs of a building mid-way through being built in such a way that I can't help but be impressed with not just his comprehension, but his genuine ""thirst"" for knowledge these toys have helped build within him.Because of the very nature of the pieces needed to build these types of items, I don't feel that they are particularly durable--but then again, I don't think they are really *meant* to be, if you truly understand these types of things. This is designed to be a bare-bones building toy, and that is exactly what it is. Don't think you can cart this around all over the place without some consequences--unless of course you're very careful. I don't want to make it sound as though once you finish building it, that is all you'll ever be able to do, but keep in mind the fragile nature of the long, thin plastic pieces made to manufacture the set and you'll probably be better able to make it last as long as necessary.For children who love to build, tinker and make things work via small & tiny machines, I can't recommend K'Nex enough. Great building designs and allows for a lot more freedom in construction than I would have normally thought possible. Fantastic building set, very impressed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18CCKVXLZR0P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPNLECI#wasThisHelpful","R18CCKVXLZR0P8","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the perspective of a young boy, this toy is nothing less than a portable piece of paradise. My 9 year old's eyes nearly blew their sockets when he opened up the box and saw this guy. The packaging alone is top notch and certainly makes the toy LOOK 'beyond awesome' I believe was the term my son came up with. It also managed to  make both of his brothers (one 11 and one 6) SUPREMELY jealous--which is yet another WIN for my son. The boys debated for quite some time as they worked it out of the box whether or not it transformed as well (it kinda does, but NOT like Optimus Prime--sorry boys).I was pretty impressed at how fast it can go, too. It goes from the character to a vehicle-like machine fairly quick, and can actually shoot mini rockets which the boys pretended were everything from that to nuclear tipped laser weapons (aren't imaginations wonderful?). To control it using the remote takes a bit of practice, but my son certainly had fun with the learning curve. The Ooh's and Ahh's he and his brothers were making certainly announced to me firmly that this was not only a good gift for my child, but I had hit a home run in their eyes.I must say that removing it from the box DOES require a screwdriver (which I had left at work, so we couldn't get to immediately--so make SURE to have one handy when you unbox yours). If you have your child with you and no way to properly remove it, you're going to have a revolt and quick-like on your hands. Do yourself a favor and have it ready. It also requires plenty of batteries (8 in total I believe) so have those standing by as well.One more thing to consider: the toy alone is fine, but seems better suited to play with a second model to be operated by another child. It seems designed to 'fight' and if there really isn't anything for it to battle, well, it seems to me that you limit some of its playing ability. That isn't to say my son had a lack of stuff to do with it, but from my perspective, I thought it was something worth noting all the same.I AM a bit concerned with the durability of the robot...I can see a small tumble down a tiny flight of carpeted stairs could be enough to render it all but beyond repair--but let me stress, that is only my assumption based on observing it being used for maybe 20 minutes or so. Either way, I also believe its a valid point.***UPDATE***It's been several days and my sons enthusiasm is still running at probably near 95% of what it was when he initially opened the toy, so all in all, I am STILL very happy and satisfied that I made the right choice. Also, my other sons are still mucho desperate to not only play with it, but have their own as well. I'd have to say that in short, I think the toy is very worthwhile for young boys no less than 7 years old (much younger and I think its just a bit too technical to operate and control properly).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IDSXX0DEI5LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIUURJE#wasThisHelpful","R2IDSXX0DEI5LD","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't wait to try out these ear buds. Being in radio, I own and wear headphones and ear buds pretty much all the time, certainly more than the average person, and I'm a stickler when it comes to audio quality. Not only do I know what sounds good, I know what doesn't. When I first got them, I immediately plugged them into my board in my studio and was supremely impressed with how well it cut out the outside sound--easily better than my more expensive Phillips Noise Cancelling ear buds. It did have a tinny quality to the sound, though which concerned me. But I had to remind myself, these are ear BUDS and not studio monitors, and therefore I was stupid to believe they'd sound the same as my much more expensive headphones.I waited and tried them on my mp3 player and that's where they really shined. Again, I was on the verge of being dumbfounded at how superior its noise isolation was. Again, having been in and around professional studios for virtually all of my adult life, I've used some remarkable ear buds and headphones and these tiny little sport ear buds virtually eliminated outside sound to a degree that not only I hadn't experienced before, but wasn't even sure was possible--especially given what they cost. I was able to 'hear' a LOT of what I had just been missing with most of my other ear buds simply because the sound was actually getting TO my ear more than almost everything else I was used to. If you use ear buds while working out or jogging, your music tends to compete heavily with wind and automobiles and any number of things which interferes with the music, essentially making the music compete with all that noise--and the end results usually mean you miss out on a great deal of audio quality. Not so with the Sport-Fi's.Build quality is nothing short of exceptional. The memory wire used works really well and I was quite impressed with the comfort, too. No matter how good the sound is I'm less likely to wear anything for long if it isn't at least comfortable. I was once again impressed with this part as well. Without having worn them for hours on end, what I DID experience certainly makes me hopeful that I've finally found a pair of ear buds I can wear for long durations, which will really come in handy on my long drive to pick up my children on weekends. As for staying put while exercising, while I can't speak for everyone, it seems to me that you'd have to be doing something beyond strenuous in order for these to come loose. For one they wrap around the back of your ears and do so quite comfortably. They are so light you almost forget you're wearing them. And for two, well, I simply cannot fathom doing something that may result in them falling off, I just can't. Not that it can't be done, but honestly, I have no clue what you'd have to do in order for that to happen.I've answered a call exactly twice and I was impressed yet again. I own a Motorola Motoactv Sport Watch, which is my mp3 player and it bluetooths to my phone as well. Any time I have my ear buds in, I can answer a call via my bluetooth watch very simple. As long as the connection is good (and so far, it was great) my calls were clear, crisp and best of all, even with the window down going 75mph and the wind just screaming into the car, I could hear the caller quite well. Because of the placement of the window, the caller couldn't hear ME all that well, (the wind was hitting the mic pretty much head on) but as soon as I raised the window a little, they heard me just fine. It wasn't anything scientific, but in a real-world test, I discovered one more way in which my Sport-Fi ear buds worked really well.CONCLUSION:When it comes to devices like these, there are no small amount of choices to pick from...in fact, its hard to make an informed choice given how many are on the market to be honest. Well, here's a piece of advice: do your homework and trust those who you know won't screw you around. For me, I couldn't be happier with mine. It works, and works well. The sound it wonderful and the quality reminds me of ear buds which cost many times more than what you can purchase these for. All are great points of sale for me. Since I do wear these more than the average person, build quality is VERY important. I've had some great sounding ear buds in the past but I was less than impressed with their overall durability. Not that the average person would wear them as often or be as hard on them as I am, but isn't it nice to know that either way, you can be assured that they should last you a mighty long time? I look forward to a long time with mine. Call me one VERY satisfied customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTK1JJ8VGT0N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDPZ4FA#wasThisHelpful","RTK1JJ8VGT0N4","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I quickly gave this to my ex-wife--and she mistook it for a regular vacuum. I tried to explain to her that it was a regular floor cleaner, NO carpets, but I don't think she heard me...all she saw was something that resembled a vacuum and filled in the blanks. She opened it up and was immediately confused. When I saw her next she asked how it was that she was supposed to use it. I asked her if she had bothered to look at the owners manual--and take a WILD guess what she said? Well, no matter. I spent a couple minutes glancing at the manual and figured it out pretty quick--and I'm no Einstein by any stretch.Within a few minutes after that we had that puppy up and running and shining up her kitchen floor better than it had been since, well, probably since it had been brand new. Yes, it works really, REALLY well on linoleum. We were ALL impressed. The Hoover came with its own cleaning solution pre-packaged, which was a VERY nice surprise, too. The built-in rotating scrubbers really work--and work really well, too. Now, let me say up front that I haven't tried this on a carpeted floor, but by the looks of the scrubbers, I'd wager that if you didn't have any carpet steamer handy and wanted to try and clean something quick, this puppy would probably fill in quite nicely--but again, I haven't tried it so cannot say with any authority.As I played with it, the only downside I discovered was around corners, it was hard to suck up the cleaning solution once it had cleaned that particular area, and so had to be manually soaked up with a rag shortly afterwards, but that was only a minor gripe at best. I'd have to say that for those who really dislike mopping, give this baby a whirl and you'll be amazed at how much you may actually enjoy it now. Again, no scientific analysis here, but my children are notorious at hating virtually ALL kitchen cleaning duty's--especially mopping, and they were all chomping at the bit to get a turn. Not just that one, time either. My ex told me no less than twice they have all asked independently if it was their turn to clean the kitchen floor. Right there, that alone makes this device worth just about ANYTHING they can charge, but thankfully it won't break your bank.Kudos to Hoover for making me a believer!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BKSZ3ZJ1OA32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CM220CK#wasThisHelpful","R1BKSZ3ZJ1OA32","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly cannot remember a time when I was NOT a fan of Journey. From my earliest memories of the band, I always loved their music, and its a love which continues to this day. While no particular Greatest Hits package will please literally everybody, this certainly comes close. There are only about 3 songs I wish it had and about 3 or 4 I feel could be dropped from the lists, but again, everyone is different. What I AM trying to say is this: if you like Journey, you cannot go wrong with this collection.I have been a fan of Steve Perry's voice for it seems the bulk of my life...and while those who replaced him by and large were virtual clones of his voice and style, they all lacked one important thing: they weren't Steve Perry. Let me be clear: a couple have actually been VERY good (the current singer in particular is wonderful) but while they all ((sound)) like Steve, NONE of them sing with the passion and raw emotion that Steve brought to his music. One may argue otherwise, but success without Steve has been fleeting at best and seems to back my theory--but that may also be a factor of many other additional things I did not mention.With all of my love to Steve's vocals, you may be interested to know that my two favorite Journey songs do NOT have Perry singing lead. ""Feeling That Way/Anytime"" have always been my absolute favorite songs, and feature Steve on backing vocals, a job he didn't have very often, thankfully...but on these two songs, fits absolutely to perfection. Disc 1 seems to have the majority of their radio hits, while Disc 2 has fewer hits, but a lot of Journey love nevertheless. The really interesting thing about this band was even though they were amazingly popular, filling stadiums across the country left and right, they only charted a very small number of actual Hits. Being in the broadcasting business, it always bugged me that record sales had far less to do with a song making it up the Billboard charts than actual money. If sales were the only barometer, Journey's number of Chart-topping singles would certainly be a LOT larger.Covering from the early years to the last record recorded with Perry, this compilation ought to please most hard-core Journey fans and those new to their music alike. I am often interested in the state of radio these days as I listen to what qualifies as a 'Hit' song and I find myself constantly disappointed. Sure, there are some really catchy songs now and then, but what I simply do NOT see these days is the staying power a band like Journey has. For example, the number of radio stations that will STILL be playing 'Faithfully' and 'Don't Stop Believing' in another 20 years will dwarf the number of stations that will be playing Justin Bieber, Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus (that is if ANY stations will be suicidal enough to actually play any to begin with). Never did I think when I first heard 'Stone In Love' that I'd be rockin' out to it in my car STILL some 30 years later. Regardless of how much you love their music, there is NO doubt to their impact on the Rock 'N Roll genre...and from the popularity of their music all these years later, I don't see that diminishing any time soon.Journey fans, rejoice. Greatest Hits 1 & 2 is a collection VERY well worth having.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R123T3XPYMZOSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005N4DOJ2#wasThisHelpful","R123T3XPYMZOSG","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those who feel that unless they own the ridiculously priced vacuums which ""claim"" no loss of suction and whatnot, why not just save yourself some money and purchase a model which actually works, has all the attachments you'll need, and is easy to operate and gives you all the bang for a lot less buck. Don't get me wrong, those expensive Dyson's and Rainbows all work, and in most cases, work really well...but are they truly WORTH the outrageous prices they cost? Not in my book. I realize there are many who would argue, but for MY money, the Dirt Devil Vigor Cyclonic vacuum gives all that for a microscopic amount in comparison.The pet hair attachment is simply brilliant. I've owned some stupidly expensive vacuums over the years, some which had attachments which had a mini rotating head similar to the brush which is at the bottom of your vacuum, and they were not nearly as well made or efficient as this one. Let me also add that with those other models, the mini attachment had to have its own motor in order to rotate the mini brush. This model manages to do it all with just plain suction. And it rotates FAST, too. Again, impressed.The hose which attaches to the main body at the bottom near the height adjustment has an interesting feature, when you pull it out, a swivel cap closes the hole. I'm not entirely sure why, or whether or not it actually contributes to the efficiency of it all, but it certainly seems to work well. Actually I think it stops anything from the main brush from shooting through while it continues to spin while you use the hose for other things. All in all, a pretty nifty idea which works quite well.The suction seems rather clean cut as well. Quite a lot of suction seems to power this device and it really does SUCK--but in a good way. Plenty of power as far as that goes.The height adjustment works really well, too...no complaints.When the vacuum is full, it is quite simple to pull out the holding bin and empty it. I'd recommend doing it away from wherever it is you want to stay clean seeing as there tends to be plenty of dust which accumulates as you let it drop. Keep that in mind, especially if you have anyone nearby who is sensitive to that kind of thing.One other thing: I LOVE the idea of being able to clean the filter myself rather than having to endlessly purchase more of them again and again if I want my vacuum to continue to work at top efficiency. While this may not be a new feature to the world of house cleaning, its the first model I've personally owned with this feature and find it to be a fantastic addition.In all, I am VERY satisfied with my Dirt Devil (which is a nice change seeing as the previous model I owned many years ago was VERY cheaply manufactured and it showed) and plan to tell my friends what a great buy it is...even though I received mine through the Vine program here at amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1COWYFGUNW4D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E004MZA#wasThisHelpful","R1COWYFGUNW4D5","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been many things which have sparked acts of war, the shooting of Archduke Ferdinand is widely considered what sparked World War I and the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into the Second World War...but the reality, over the course of history, simple words have sparked more wars than any other acts. Such is the power of words, which makes Lexicon such a tremendous novel...not only entertaining, but informative at the same time.Talk about a world class 'What If' scenario: what if a school existed which taught the skills of language to be used in such a way as to actually influence virtually everything in life? The REAL power comes in knowing how to form the rather random sounds together in such a way as to control the thoughts of others. This is what is taught to a very select few. The storyline essentially is a straight-forward sci-fi adventure tale--but not just ANY tale. Either the plot connects with you (as it did with me) or it won't. It seems from reading some of the reviews that those who read it either really enjoyed it or they thought it just missed the mark a bit. What would YOU do if you understood that sound placement could bring down entire civilizations? Its a staggering thought, and one I am grateful remains in the realm of sci-fi, but one which is utterly compelling to me.While the story is quite thought provoking, I can assure you that action and violence are not left in the backseat. If anything, the story moves at a very rapid clip and I believe contains just the right amount of story AND action. It held my interest all the way through, even though at some point, you're going to NEED to adjust your 'Reality Meter' in order to accept what is going on. There are more than one story lines going on as the novel progresses, which the author has under tight control, by the way. I enjoyed learning more about how language is used, and how those who are manipulating others (called Poets) must know more than mere words and sounds but actually know the person as well. Whether you liked the book or not there is no doubting the creativity on display within Lexicon. The plot was--IMO--quite ingenious.How much did I enjoy Lexicon? Let me end by saying this: I had never read Max Barry before, but after this I plan to search out ALL his previous works. Hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NS51JU25F9PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205388#wasThisHelpful","R3NS51JU25F9PQ","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of Reboot really IS clever and pretty original in how its presented. Teens who have been resurrected shortly after death, but afterwards just aren't the same. They are kind of Government bounty hunters who listen and OBEY, without question. They no longer really live on with purpose. They do what they're told and for their hard work they are treated with virtually zero respect, or a distinct lack thereof...by almost everyone. Reboots retain less humanity the longer they were dead before being brought back. Wren was dead for 178 minutes, which reportedly makes her THE best Reboot because of her lack of emotions and efficient ability to do her job.Wren also has the job of training new Reboots. Her newest trainee Callum, wasn't dead for long before he was turned...and this shockingly disturbs Wren. But being the good little automaton she is, she continues to do her job as best she can to train the seemingly un-trainable. Before long, Callum is determined to be beyond training, and Wren is dispatched to eliminate him with extreme prejudice. Wren is a good Reboot, exceptional actually and has not once disobeyed ANY order for any reason...and yet, she feels compelled to do everything within her power to help Callum not only escape, but stay alive. Thus begins an awkward and truly original relationship--and adventure loaded with action and pure danger, not to mention plenty of terror.The obvious comparisons to The Hunger Games are plenty here and I can see why--however, let me stress that despite on the surface these books may share more than just a certain tone, there is MUCH more to Reboot than that, in fact, I'd go so far as to say I enjoyed it quite a bit more. The originality is a GREAT deal more than what The Hunger Games gave us (Come on, fighting to the death? There are literally DOZENS of stories written by tons of authors like Steven King which have VERY similar plots). Reboot is genuinely different (at least in my opinion), and aside from the quasi-uncomfortable romantic relationship, I found almost every single page one which truly made me want to continue reading...not an easy task as I believe I have ADRD (Attention Deficit Reading Disorder) and give up on novels MUCH quicker than I believe the average reader. Either you keep my interest or I simply give up and find something else to read right away. Congrats to Amy Tintera for keeping me satisfied all the way through.How much did I enjoy Reboot? I anxiously look forward to whatever Amy writes next.

"If you count yourself a fan of Clive Cussler, Michael Crichton, James Rollins or Jeremy Robinson and you haven't discovered Boyd Morrison yet, you really owe it to yourself to give him a shot. I discovered him through The Ark several years back and I've been a fan ever since. His previous novel 'The Roswell Conspiracy' wasn't even published here in the US (which really makes me disappointed in the publishers here) but thankfully I got a copy of the UK version and devoured it rather quickly.The hero for the bulk of Morrison's novels is Tyler Locke. Go ahead, get to know him, you'll be glad you did. His stories really accelerate quickly and usually has one foot in reality, despite how hard it may be to believe. This time the story centers around Loch Ness, and there is plenty to keep you on the edge of your seat. We start off in the United Kingdom and Charles Darwin formulates his famous 'theory' based in part by what he encounters in a mysterious body of water in Scotland. Next we move to a party being held ON the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which quickly turns into a terrorist attack which threatens much more than just a few lives. The technology featured is either real or very CLOSE to being real, which only helps the story flow in a more believable manner, despite all the supremely close-calls which Tyler and his former Pro Wrestling giant of a partner, Grant find themselves in.From one place on the globe to another, reading the Loch Ness Legacy is kind of like a cheap way to see the world without being hurt in the process. Bullets fly, unmanned drones attack and deadly science all play major roles in how the action continuously moves at the speed of a runaway Tomahawk missile. If you truly enjoy a few hours of pure escapism entertainment sprinkled with a healthy dose of adventure, mixed with a stellar plot which will hardly give you a chance to catch your breath, then this book really ought to be on your MUST READ list. The sooner you discover Boyd Morrison, the better. Trust me, I'm a reader...no really.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NPGG8ONRXEEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQ16M7A#wasThisHelpful","R2NPGG8ONRXEEY","A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been quite surprised at the number of reviews which are anything less than complimentary of this series and Witch Wraith in particular. Sometimes I wonder if I read the same thing, but like anything else in life, opinions vary, and nowhere is that more obvious than reading reviews of books here at amazon.Yes, I can admit that Terry borrowed heavily from his own earlier books, chief of which was Elfstones--but that can either be a good or bad thing depending on whether or not the storyline 'clicked' with you. By my giving it five stars, you can guess where my thoughts are. Since I view the Elfstones as one of Terry's all-time best books, I really enjoyed reading about the events regarding the failing of the Forbidding, the consequences of letting it grow weaker, and the penalties for those who--even accidentally--enter into the world of the Demons. We have several stories to cycle between. From inside the Forbidding, again in the Four Lands, and of course, the quest to re-establish the Ellcrys in order to wall-away the Demons to where they belong. I've always found Terry's boundless imagination one of the things which really struck me personally, and it was working overtime here.What will the Ohmsfords legacy be by the end? What does the Ilse Witch have to do with helping the seemingly hopeless situation that faces our heroes? I believe if you think about it a little, you can wager a good guess and more than likely be right. Again, while others have regarded the inclusion of partial plotting from previous novels to be a mistake, here I found the familiar mixed with fresh storylines simply kept me turning the pages. I understand that not everyone will see my point of view as one which they share, and that's okay. What matters is what I personally think and feel, and in truth, that is ALL that matters, right? Read the reviews, but form your OWN opinion regardless of what I may believe--and don't let anyone tell you differently.I'll admit, the first book in this series was my favorite, but I still really enjoyed the two sequels. Being brought into the world of Shannara has always been a place where I feel welcome and happy, and I've discovered that things haven't changed much. I still love visiting. While I look forward to the time when Terry writes a stand-alone Epic Fantasy novel in the vein of the original three Shannara novels, I love his stuff enough that I'll accept it any way I can get it.In short, I love visiting even a portion of the world which Terry Brooks gives to us, and found this conclusion to have been satisfying and entirely worthwhile. Either way, I hope you get out of it what you are hoping for. Terry, you STILL amaze me after all these years.

"We have been really pleased with this set of headphones.  Our grandson comes over a lot and wants to play games either on my phone or my laptop and the noise and music gets to me after awhile... I mean you can only listen to so much Angry Birds music, right?  They are very comfortable and fit on my head as well as my grandson's.  I was amazed considering the very reasonable price, how good the sound is with these headphones.  They also help to block out sound.  I used them one night while I was working on my laptop late at night, listening to music while my husband slept soundly in the bed next to me.  It was wonderful that I could listen to music without bothering him.So far we have not had any trouble with the ear padding coming off.  The size is adjustable, the microphone is convenient and it comes in a very neat travel/protective bag so the kids can put it in their backpack without tearing them up.  The only slight problem I had was trying to adjust the volume with the button located on the wire... it took a few tries before I could get the volume down, but you can also adjust the volume on whatever device you've got it hooked to.  If you are listening to music through your phone and the phone rings, the music automatically shuts off while you answer the phone thru the mike.  My husband said he had no trouble hearing me when I used the mic.  So far we are impressed with this set of headphones.

"This was my first Richard Paul Evans book and all I can say is he has a new fan!  What a treat this book was...  although I had a pretty good idea where this story was going, it was still a great trip getting there.  Kim has not had a lot of luck in the romance department, yet her dream is to get her romance book published.  So she attends a romance writer's conference where she makes two new friends... Samantha and Zeke... one will entertain her and make her laugh and the other will cause her to look at herself and how she views her life in a totally different way. Kim also has a very close and loving relationship with her father who is key in helping Kim take those difficult steps towards the healing she so desperately needs. The ending pulls out every emotion and the writing is not only riveting but heartfelt and beautifully done.  The characters are well drawn and the revelations that Kim experiences, both from her time with Zeke at the writer's conference and the tender moments with her father, allow her to finally face her demons from the past. Zeke is a wonderfully drawn character and a man very easy to like, especially since he helps Kim to understand that she is indeed worthy of being loved. Also for those aspiring authors out there, since the story takes place primarily at a writer's conference, it will give you a peek at what it's like to try and get your book published!Engaging, moving, funny, tender, informative and with two great supporting characters in Kim's new friend Samantha and Kim's father Rob,  this book is a treat from start to finish and it might just help you believe that sometimes good things really do happen to good people, especially at Christmastime.

"I love Lindsay McKenna's normally action packed romance and have read quite a few of them.  But this one was a bit of a disappointment.  The prequel was fast paced and gritty and I expected the same from this first book in the new series.  It was not to be.  There is so much inner monologing that it was a distraction and slowed the pace of the story.  There was very little action and only one bedroom scene at the end.  Too much of the story focused on Lia's scars and Cav's childhood.  Basically this was an action romance with too little action and not enough romance.  Also there were quite a few mistakes in the Kindle version...missing words, etc.  Hopefully the rest of this new series will pick up... if not then I guess I will just reread the books from her Shadow Warrior series!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBYI6O0JH2SNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LW14N2#wasThisHelpful","RBYI6O0JH2SNP","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But at least with this product you have a fighting chance to protect yourself when you are the most vulnerable.

"This is a really cool little wireless device that will make your home BBQing a little bit easier.  There are two little units... one has the probe attached to it that you stick in the meat you are grilling to keep track of the temperature.  It is attached to the unit by a heat resistant cord and the unit has a little stand on it so you can set it up by your grill.  The other unit is wireless and really cool and is the half that you keep with you in the house so you don't have to get up so many times during the football game which is especially nice if it's 110* in the shade or when your wife decides she has to have something done on the grill and there is a foot of snow on the ground.  (Hey... I've done that to my husband...)  The second unit will tell you what the temperature should be for whatever meat you select... ground beef, ground poultry, beef, veal, chicken, pork, poultry, lamb, fish, etc and you can indicate whether you want it well done, medium or rare and everything in between.  It comes with a timer (in case you really get caught up in the game) that will remind you to check it and/or let you know when your meat has hit the temperature you and this handy little gadget have decided is exactly the temp you want!Of course you can use this to test meat from the oven too... you just open up the oven door, stick the probe in your meatloaf, or what have you and you get a nice clear digital readout of the meat's internal temp.  It's easy to use, takes batteries and will help you in your quest to be the best outdoor chef in the neighborhood!

"This is a great backseat organizer.  The material is sturdy and it can be attached to the back of a car seat two different ways... you can tie it on or there are two hooks that will fit over the seat.  It's adjustable so you can make it fit your particular car seat back. One of the nicest things about it is the clear compartment that fits my ipad perfectly.  I can slip it in there and put on a cartoon for my little grandson and he is thrilled.  It's also convenient with several handy pockets that allow you to keep your car a little more organized.  It's also easy to clean off with a wet towel.  A great addition to the supplies in my car and my grandchildren love being able to reach the books, wipes and bottled water I keep in the car for them.

"Pros:Looks coolCord is sturdyHas a light inside that changes colors (could be seen as a con since you can't really turn it off at all)Very sensitive to precise movement - I had to turn the speed down on my computer because it moved so much quicker than the mouse I usually use.Nice shapeExtra buttons - I didn't use them, but their placement on the mouse seemed like it would make fast-paced gaming a little easierCons: The cord isn't very long - - its a USB plug in, and you have to stay close to your computer's USB port.It is very strictly right-handed.

"Emily March has struck gold with her Eternity Springs series and Heartsong Cottage is one of the most moving and heart wrenching stories to date. Dealing with child abduction and abuse is a very difficult topic and March handles it honestly which means at times the book is difficult to read.  Daniel is for the most part a sympathetic character and you feel for him and the loss of his family but it's obvious even ten years after the fact that he still has some major healing to do.The heroine of the story, Shannon, has some baggage of her own and is hiding in Eternity Springs, hoping to elude her stalker.  When she and Daniel meet at Gabi and Flynn's wedding, sparks fly and before you know it, they are both looking back on their one night stand with mixed emotions.  But Eternity Springs is a place of love and healing so these two are exactly where they need to be, surrounded by all the people we have come to know and love from past books.  This story will make you sad, make you laugh and make you believe in love and second chances.  March's next book in the Eternity Springs series Reunion Pass comes out in April and it looks like two more of the town's special people will find love and I have no doubt we will enjoy the ride!  Five stars for Emily March and Heartsong Cottage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YRPMU94VWVEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072964#wasThisHelpful","R2YRPMU94VWVEE","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hallelujah! Finally I have a way to keep my grandchildren out of the cabinets where I keep all my cleaning supplies.  These straps are very effective... especially on the refrigerator.  They did not come with directions, so it took us a minute to figure out exactly how they work, but after that it was  breeze.  I like that they are size adjustable too.  Now I can keep them out of my fridge too since they have discovered exactly where Nana keeps all the snacks and Capri Suns! One word of warning... my daughter used these on some cabinets that she had refinished and painted and when she pulled them off the paint came with it!

"I was asked to use this bra but since I don't exercise as much as my daughter does, I asked her to try it for me and she loves it.

(Why she likes to sleep in her bra is beyond me, but I guess some women do).  She wears a size 36C bra and this M fit her comfortably.

"I LOVE this diffuser and here's why.  It's a great size, it gives off a nice soft glow or you have the option to turn the light off which is convenient, the water reservior is a good size and the thing I like best... it will shut off by itself so you can fall asleep knowing that it won't run dry and burn itself out.  It makes a very soft humming noise and a little bit of a gurgling sound... almost like water going over some pebbles... both very soothing and not at all irritating... and this is if the room has absolutely no other sound in it.  If you have it in a room with other noises... kids, tv. etc you won't even hear it.  I put three drops of lavender oil in it and it was heavenly.  I'm already thinking ahead to using cinnamon closer to the holidays and I know as the weather gets colder we will appreciate the added moisture to the dry air in our bedroom.

"First released in 2004 under the title When Christmas Comes,  Trading Christmas is a humorous and touching story about four different people who are unexpectedly thrown together for Christmas.  It's typical Debbie Macomber fare with all the trappings of the season in a simple modern day romance.Widow Emily Springer is disappointed when she learns that her daughter Heather has decided she isn't coming home for Christmas.  Sad at the thought of being alone, Emily decides to trade her home in the little town of Leavenworth, WA for a condo in Boston and surprise Heather with a visit over Christmas.  But it's Emily who gets the surprise when she arrives to find that Heather has made plans of her own which include roaring off to Florida with a questionable biker and his less than stellar friends.  Emily is shocked and disappointed when she realizes she will be alone in a strange condo in a strange town for the holiday and things look bleak... that is until the door bell rings and the owner's brother Ray shows up.Charles Brewster is a Harvard professor who is desperately seeking a place to hide over Christmas since he has no desire to do anything but work on writing his history textbook over the holidays.  Thinking a town called Leavenworth would offer peace and quiet, he has no idea that he has just agreed to spend two weeks in a house swap in a place that appears to be Christmas Central... complete with snow, lights, sleigh rides and happy children building snowmen.  In short... it's his version of hell.  That is until Emily's friend Faith Kerrigan arrives to surprise her for the holidays and instead finds a very Scrooge like professor has taken over her friend's house.It's an entertaining scenario as these four people stumble upon each other and are forced to spend the holiday together.  None of them have had any type of relationship for awhile so all four are surprised to find how much they begin to enjoy their unexpected roommates and suddenly it becomes more about enjoying everything the Christmas season has to offer rather than facing it all alone.  While the main theme of the story surrounds these four mature adults, Emily's daughter has some growing up and soul searching to do too and it isn't long before she realizes that the traditions of Christmas mean more to her than she thought!Also included is a story Macomber published back in 1991 about a man and woman who reconnect after eighteen years and find that the pretend marriage they had when she was 8 and he was 10 might have been a prelude to the best Christmas either one has ever had.  While Cait is sure she's in love with her boss (even if he doesn't know she's alive), it's old friend and construction worker Joe who gets her heart pounding with kisses that are a whole lot more enjoyable than the little peck Joe gave her all those years ago.  But he is sooo not the type Catlin has in mind for her future... or is he?Two simple, warm hearted and humorous romances by Macomber plus the first chapter of Sheila Roberts' upcoming holiday romance entitled Christmas on Candy Cane Lane from her Life In Icicle Falls series due out in November makes this book a sure bet!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFNI8EYKRYTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831829X#wasThisHelpful","REFNI8EYKRYTW","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who are environmentally conscientious, these jumbo plastic reusable K-cups will help you sleep better at night and will be waiting to help you wake up in the morning!  I love my Keurig and I love my K-cups and the variety and ease of popping in whatever I'm in the mood for when I get up every morning... whether it's tea, hot apple cider or hot chocolate.  I do realize that sadly it's a bit wasteful and my husband has found that he doesn't mind using these reusable K cups.  They seem to be fairly well made and if you like to play around with the strength of your coffee and don't mind the mess of cleaning out the cups after you use them, then these are a great invention and they are dishwasher safe.  For me, I like the ease and convenience of the pre made K cups and I can't do cider or hot chocolate with these things, but for my coffee drinking husband... its works.

"It was a bit difficult to figure this bike light out because it didn't come with directions.  My husband and I sat down and looked at it together and came to the conclusion that it would probably work better on the bike than on your head or helmet.  If you placed the light on your head, the easiest place to strap the battery pack on was your wrist which was a little awkward.  It does come with a way to charge the light and it is nice that you can put it on the bike or the on your head or helmet but overall the product is just so so and not quite as good as other bicycle lights I have seen.**I was asked to use this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review which I have given in an effort to help consumers make a more informed purchase decision.

"I don't smoke and I don't drink coffee but I do drink hot and iced tea and that combined with natural aging has caused my teeth to be less white than they could be.  My dentist charges roughly  $400.00 for a whitening treatment (with a $200.00 special he runs every January) but that's still more than I am willing to pay.  So when I was asked to use this product for an honest review, I was happy to do it.  I started using them and hoped for the best.They are definitely easier to put on if you haven't just brushed your teeth, in fact, I dried my teeth with a paper towel before I applied them.  You leave them on for roughly 20 - 30 minutes but that part is easy... I just watched tv or read a book in bed and let these little strips do their job!  I was able to tell a difference after a few days and at this price you can't go wrong.  Now if you have really badly stained teeth or continue to drink strong coffee and smoke in between using the strips, you may not get the best results but that makes sense.  But if you want to try something that's easy to use in the privacy of your home, then these Harmony Life Teeth Whitening Strips are worth a try!**I was asked to use this product then write an honest and unbiased review in an effort to help consumers make a more informed purchase decision.

"Another Christmas winner by one of my favorite authors, Linda Lael Miller, Christmas in Mustang Creek is a fun, whimsical romance about the next (possibly the last?) Brides of Bliss County.  This time around we find Charlotte Morgan (affectionately called Charlie) home from her fast paced job in New York City.  She returns to Mustang Creek and the beautiful old, large and little bit drafty, home she grew up in with her beloved great aunt Geneva.  Charlie knows that her aunt Geneva is having trouble with her memory due to the early stages of dementia, so she thinks she is prepared for this new stage of her life.  What she isn't prepared for is the two unexpected house guests that seem determined to turn her world upside down, or maybe right side up...she can't quite decide.Jaxon Locke arrives in Mustang Creek to start a new job as a Veterinarian.  Glad to be out of New York, the only things Jax misses is the woman he loves... Charlie Morgan.  When he finds himself with the opportunity to move to Charlie's home town, it seems like fate is giving them another chance and when a little white haired lady conveniently named Millicent Klozz offers him room and board in Charlie's huge home... how can he refuse?  Mrs. Klozz is heaven sent and cooks like an angel.  She also seems to be aware of exactly what everyone is thinking and just exactly what it is they need to  be happy.  So between Jaxon, her Aunt Geneva and the mysterious Mrs. Klozz, Charlie might just be in for the best Christmas of her life... if she'll only take a chance on love.It's a warm and simple holiday romance with all the things that make Christmas stories such a pleasure to curl up with... a beautiful setting, snow, adorable animals... of course... this is LL Miller after all... hot chocolate and romance with a handsome guy who seems heaven sent and a woman who has to decide if she wants to risk it all for love.

"This is a great mini lantern that was VERY useful on our last camp out.  It's wonderful that if the light starts to dim, you can just crank the handle to recharge it.  It compresses small enough to carry comfortably in your pocket so it's available when you need it.  You simply press the button if you want a flashlight type spot light, or it will expand to a lantern shape like you see in the picture and it puts out a decent amount of light in two different levels, high or low.  We set it on our picnic table and actually played a board game solely by the light of this little lantern.  It also has a very handy handle if you want to carry it around in it's lantern state.  I also comes with a USB charger although ours came fully charged and we have not had to recharge it yet.  Just a great little lantern for camping, home emergencies, your kids' room or anywhere else where you might need a quick bit of light that you can carry around and recharge with a simple turn of the crank if you are without power.

"Read on Kindle this book seemed a little long to me but none the less it grabbed my attention and kept it throughout.  That's one of the nice things about the way McKenna writes, you never know when you are going to suddenly be in the middle of a tense life or death scene that has your characters using all their wits and talents to stay alive.  The heroine Cathy was put through so much it's hard to believe that she didn't have a nervous breakdown... she comes close but I never would have been able to withstand everything she did from her commanding officers and clearly defined bad guys Major Louise Lane and her XO Kate Ingram.  The hero Jim Boland is everything you want a hero to be... handsome, strong and dedicated to his men... and to Cathy.Used as pawns in a political tug of war that reaches all the way to Washington DC, Cathy and Jim find themselves fighting to stay alive and stay true to their core values as they are forced to choose between what's right and what's expedient.  Both are sympathetic characters who have suffered in the past and you find yourself hoping that circumstances beyond their limited control won't keep them apart.  McKenna has a few inaccuracies when using military jargon and protocol which can be distracting at times, but the plot is solid, the action tense and believable and the romance heartfelt and touching.  Basically it's everything you are looking for in a military romance and sets the stage for her Shadow Warrior series, again about a group of women who are determined to prove that women can be successful in front line combat roles.  The book that follows this one is about Cathy and Jim's daughter Morgan and her life as a Marine Corps Captain and sniper searching out the bad guys in the Hindu Kush.  Note:  This book was first released under the title Valkyrie in the year 2000.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EQMWW8YQE7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6IY6BQ#wasThisHelpful","R23EQMWW8YQE7H","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very useful, user friendly pitcher that I love making iced tea in.  The core is very convenient to use... either by filling it with water and then sticking it in the freezer (you have to attach the lid so the water won't spill) or simply putting ice cubes into it.  It's nice that you don't have to worry about the melting ice diluting your beverage. In a moderately temped room the frozen core kept the tea cool for roughly an hour.  It's also nice to be able to insert the infuser core with lemon wedges or any other fruit that you want to slowing and continually flavor your drink.  It would be awesome for Sangria... all the taste without chasing the fruit around in your glass or pitcher.  There were only basic instructions printed on the outside of the box but like I said it's pretty easy to figure out.  You can probably put it in the dishwasher, but I wash it by hand.

"Fans of Mary Balogh and the historical romance genre are sure to want to add this book to their collection.  In the time honored tradition, the author brings us a love story that will touch your heart. The heroine Imogene lives a shadow of a life, chained to the belief that due to events in her past she is not deserving of the kind of happiness that love can bring.  A widow for the past 8 years, Imogene has no idea that the new Earl of Hardford is about to descend on her quiet corner of the world and make her wish for things she has long denied herself.Percy Hayes is bored with the perfect life he has been blessed with and decides on a whim to visit his newly acquired (two years ago) estate in the remote region of Cornwall, England.  A tall, dark, handsome and intelligent man, he has lived a life of relative ease with every comfort imaginable... yet an emptiness remains,  until he meets a woman who has seen horrors he can only imagine.  Percy and Imogene's relationship at times is an exercise in frustration and it seems to take an extraordinarily long amount of time before they recognize their relationship for what it truly is. Their passion is worth the wait though. The dialogue is realistic and takes you to another time and place and you find yourself hoping that this lone female of the survivors club will finally lay down her burden of guilt and embrace a life worth living.Strong characters, a variety of interesting family members, a smuggling side plot and a few too many animals to keep track of, Only A Kiss is a satisfying journey for anyone who loves historical romance at its best.

"It's a Wonderful Wife is a strange title that doesn't roll easily off the tongue and although I am a big Janet Chapman fan... this book was not her usual satisfying read.  Having said that however, I realized that the book held my interest even though I could not relate to the two lead characters... Cadi and Jesse as easily as I usually do with Chapman's novels.  The heroine Cadi is just a bit too naive (she is amazed that the hero's assistant is black when she meets him since he didn't ""sound"" black on the phone... Jesse forgives the insensitive remark since Cadi has never actually talked with a black person before!)  I'm all for having a sheltered heroine if the story calls for it but that was a stretch.  The plot itself seemed a little off kilter as did some of the reactions of the players.  People familiar with the first two Sinclair stories in this trilogy will have an easier time following things than I did.Quick synopsis... billionaire Sinclair brother Jesse decides to build a beautiful home on the island he has purchased in Maine but when he arrives he finds himself attracted to the daughter of the deceased owner who is gifted in making models of home designs.  Mayhem and misunderstandings arise when Cadi's fake boyfriend is caught in a compromising situation opening the door for Jesse to make his moves on the lovely and innocent Cadi... who does have a strong will though and a mind of her own along with the strange habit of talking to her body parts.  When a loan shark thug sets his sights on Cadi, Jesse decides it will be his job to protect her since he is fairly certain she is the Mrs. Right he has been looking for.The dialogue between Cadi and Jesse had me smiling more than once... I always enjoy the snappy come backs as two people begin a relationship and begin learning about each other.  It's just the plot and lack of chemistry between Cadi and Jesse until almost the end that kept this story from being a truly engaging read.  Chapman is still one of the best in the art of romance storytelling, but this one just lacked her usual bit of magic... both literally and figuratively.  Four Stars for Janet Chapman and It's A Wonderful Wife.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R105HA4GDONNSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0515155152#wasThisHelpful","R105HA4GDONNSL","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a sad, introspective look at one young man's journey through the horrors of WWII and how it affected him for the rest of his life.  Written through letters to his son Harold from later in his life, it's clear that the 17 year old country boy had no idea what would be in store for him when he illegally enlisted in the Navy.  Forced to endure conditions that would test even the strongest of full grown men, J.P. found himself in a constant fight to stay alive during the two years of his enlistment.  When freedom and a return to home beckoned, J.P. finds that he is not the same person who left home and he brought a most unwelcome  companion home with him...PTSD in the form of raging alcoholism.  Unable to hold a job, control his temper or maintain relationships, J.P. struggles through a life of addiction that is directly related to his time as a ""Sailor Man"".A bit uneven at times, yet non the less interesting and thought provoking, Sailor Man will make you think twice about the sacrifices so many of our young men made when they felt the call to leave home and make their mark on the world by defending their country.  Unfortunately the price so many of them like J.P. Nunnally paid can be measured in the heartache and troubled lives that dogged them for the rest of their days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQSV4D6YCLJ9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555718167#wasThisHelpful","RQSV4D6YCLJ9E","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice alternative to carrying a thick leather wallet.  Because of its material it's very lightweight and has places in it for roughly six credit cards and some folded bills.  It's very slim and attractive looking and would fit perfectly in a man's suit coat pocket if he wants to avoid the back pocket bulge in his suit pants.  My husband uses it while he is out running and wants to have ID on him but doesn't want to lug his entire wallet while he exercises.  We also found it very convenient when we went to Disney World.  He slipped it in the pocket of his cargo shorts, closed the button on the shorts and hardly new it was there all day.  He didn't have to worry about pick pockets or about it accidentally slipping out of his pocket while he's climbing in and out of rides or lugging strollers on and off the bus.  And it was the perfect size to carry his essential cards and some cash.  It could also be used to carry business cards and would fit easily into any briefcase or computer bag.  The outside is shiny and will leave fingerprints, but it would also be pretty with initials carved onto it.

"This is a wonderful, well written yet simple account of one family's journey through the disaster that was Katrina.  This author has a very clean, clear way of writing that makes you feel like you are sitting down talking to a friend.  The chapters are dated so you can follow the progression of the event along with Karlin's family and you can feel the frustration right along with her as you read of their endless hours in the car on a highway going nowhere, their inability to get the most basic of necessities like food and water for their children and coping with the ever present question... what do we do now... where do we go from here?All of us probably remember the horrible scenes from New Orleans but within a week or two, our thoughts drift to other news but for the millions of people like the Karlins whose lives were forever impacted by the ravishes of this monster storm, the nightmare continued not just for days, weeks or even months, but for years. At first their needs are basic and immediate... get out of the path of the storm... along with the millions of other people on the Gulf Coast... but where to go and how to get there?  There's no power, no water, no stores, no gas, no ATMs... what about her husband's job... where will the kids go to school... is the house still standing?  Is it flooded?  We need the valuables from the safety deposit box... the bank...?  underwater.  Their medical records... underwater... the kids school records... underwater.  And so it goes as family after family try to pick up what's left of their lives in what's left of New Orleans.Humorous, touching, heartfelt, amazing, sad and at times astonishing, Below the Water Line:  Getting Out and Going Back by Lisa Karlin is a fascinating read about how vulnerable we are to mother nature and how strong the individual spirit can be in times of crisis.  An outstanding read you won't soon forget.  Five Stars!**I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review which I have given.

"Without a doubt this is the hit toy of the summer!  It's a durable child's megaphone that they can speak into and includes a very LOUD horn like you might hear on a firetruck.  When I agreed to use these megaphones and write a review, I had no idea how much my grandchildren were going to love this toy... but they do.  Their parents, the neighbors and Granddad.... not so much.  But it's all in the name of fun and it's a much better outside toy than inside (did I mention that it's loud?)  It has a great fold up handle and a strap that allows them to carry it over their shoulder.  Do be aware though as with any toy that has a longish strap that it could be a  strangulation hazard for younger children (under three).  Our one year old decided to slip the strap around her neck and then roll around on our bed... not a good combination but luckily I was right there and no harm was done.  It's no different than any other toy that's inappropriate for younger children and the older kids (three and older) really love it.  We have both the fire and police megaphone and they love both but they think the siren on the police one is better than the straight horn sound on the fire megaphone but they happily trade back and forth and I can recommend both for hours of fun.  When you pick up the four double A batteries each require, I'd also grab some earplugs...","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WABUJ1QDQBMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8C6I1W#wasThisHelpful","R2WABUJ1QDQBMU","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a grandparent and you think back on the days when your kids made so much noise you thought you were going to lose your mind... then you will appreciate these kids megaphones for your grandchildren.  The kids will LOVE them... the parents... not so much.  We solved the problem in our house by making them an outside toy only and that seemed to work.  The necessity of this is because this thing is LOUD which is exactly what the kids are wanting and expecting when they are playing policeman/woman and want their playmates to HALT!  It's made of a very sturdy plastic with a fold down handle to grip and the siren sounds very authentic... and LOUD.  You will always know where your child is when they are playing with this toy.  My grandchildren really love them... we have the fireman megaphone too so you will definitely get your money's worth.  Do be careful with very young children though... our one year old slipped the strap around her neck and started rolling around on the bed... it was an accident waiting to happen but it just calls for due diligence like any other toy not meant for younger children.  Ages three and up will be safe with this toy.

"The Love Inspired Suspense series is a treat for anyone who wants a heart thumping mystery romance without all the questionable language and love scenes so in depth you find yourself blushing while you read.  It takes a talented author to deliver a compelling story without those trappings and Carol J.Post does a great job in Hidden Identity.Meagan is a likeable character who is hiding from her past and the man who would like to see her dead.  Hunter Kingston is a handsome cop and a man of faith with his own ghosts from the past who is determined to help Meagan stay safe after her cover is accidentally blown by a high profile rescue she is involved with.  As Hunter and Meagan circle each other, both are wary of becoming too involved but when Meagan's life is threatened time and again, it brings them closer together as they fight not only their growing attraction to one another, but the unknown person who appears to be stalking Meagan's every move.Fast paced with a few twists and turns and a tender romance between two injured people who really deserve a break when it comes to issues of the heart,  Hidden Identity is a satisfying read and a welcome addition to the Love Inspired Suspense by Harlequin.**I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion which I have given.

"This metal patriotic star is made to be put out in your yard, but since the colors matched the decor of my guest room, I ordered it to go inside and it looks great.  It comes in two halves that you have to line up together and then insert the little flaps to keep them connected.  When it first arrived I could not get the holes and the flaps to align no matter how hard I tried which is the reason why I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5.  My husband was able to get it together though and after that I was pleased with how it looked.  It comes with two poles that can be inserted into the tips of the two bottom points of the star to be placed in the ground or it also has a twine loop at the top which is what I used to hang it on the wall above my guest room bed.  It's very light and was fine on a standard size nail.  With the kinds of wind we have around my house, I can see this thing taking off to Kansas during a storm if it was placed outside so I guess you will have to judge for yourself according to the kind of weather you get if the star will stay secure in your yard.  Without measuring I would say that the sticks you place in the ground are around 6-8 inches long.It's an attractive Americana decor piece at a decent price that can be used inside or outside of your home.  Would I recommend it to a friend... yes.  Would I order it again... yes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIMLS0ZN0V4WA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JHCN7AC#wasThisHelpful","RIMLS0ZN0V4WA","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a cute book and the first one I have ever read that was written by a sweater.  I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to relate to Sophie since our lives are so different... I mean she is a sweater and I am a middle aged mother and grandmother who loves to read and write and play with my grandchildren.  But it seems that Sophie and I have a lot in common and as I read about her fascinating story from the factory to the warehouse, to the store and then finally to her special person's house, I realized that a lot of the feelings this beautiful little sweater has are ones that we all feel at one time or another.Sophie has a lot to learn as she goes through life trying to make sense of the world around her and how she fits in.  She is basically a happy sweater but finds herself sad, lonely and even a little depressed at times, especially when she finds out that she is an UGLY sweater!  With the help of her friends, Sophie learns that she is in all the ways that matter a beautiful sweater and it's up to her to look at the bright side of life.A delightful story appropriate for children, teens and adults,  Diary of an Ugly Sweater is author Cassie Eubank's way of reminding readers that the power of living a truly happy life lies within each of us and the attitudes we do or do not embrace every day and she does it with creativity, style and humor.  An upbeat little book sure to make every reader feel empowered by the idea that we can create our own happiness.

"I guess it's just going to take greater literary minds than mine to figure this book out.  I'm with reviewer J.C. on this one... I just could not wrap my mind around the point of this story.  I'm sure that some will find great symbolism and meaning in this book, but I am not one of them.  The scenes jump around and circumstances change with little to no warning which is confusing.  One minute Mary/Maria is at home, the next minute... poof she's gone... on to another life.  One minute Linda is home cooking, the next thing we know she's hanging out having sex with a bunch of hippies! First Tony hates having Linda there... then with no explanation he suddenly looks upon her as a daughter!  Where is the transition here?  Why was Linda's character even prehistoric.... it had no bearing on the story one way or the other and wouldn't her appearance have caused some attention as they walked down the street?  And I'm totally not getting the description of this book as humorous.  Not only did I not laugh once ( and I have a good sense of humor) but I don't think I even smiled while reading this story.I wish I had better news to report about this book.

"I was given a copy of this book to read  for my honest and unbiased opinion and since  I am a teacher for the visually impaired I looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately the reality was something a little less than what I hoped for.  The premise of the book is a good one, but the simplistic writing makes it very difficult to enjoy the story.  The characters are flat and impossible to identify with, the plot is weak and the general flow is very choppy.  The sentences are written almost as if by a person whose first language is not English.  For example:  ""I do not understand what you are saying"" instead of  ""I don't understand what you're saying"".  It makes the sentences very stilted and unnatural sounding.I wish I could give this book a better rating and it was interesting when Gloria tried to teach Anna to use her other senses beyond her vision but as a whole the book was a disappointment.

"We've come a long way in terms of self care in the privacy of our homes and this easy and convenient way to find out if the stork is circling is a perfect example how our lives have changed in the last 50 plus years.  It's simple (you pee in a cup), easy (you put the strip into the pee cup as opposed to peeing all over your hand while you desperately try to make sure strip meets stream), convenient (you can do this in the privacy of your home and keep the strips in your bathroom), economical (with 20 strips to a box at this price you don't have to feel guilty about checking AGAIN... just in case), accurate (without keeping a log, I have to assume their claims of accuracy are correct), safe (I'm not sure how you can injure yourself in this process except maybe to lean over too far while you're filling your pee cup and fall on your head) and it tells you what you want to know... when you want to know it... as in right now!

"My daughter-in-law has been using these and has been pleased with the  results.  She said the cost is very reasonable and there are 20 strips in the pack which is convenient.

"This is a cute, fun little kit that I enjoyed using with my grandchildren.  This kit is exactly as it appears in the picture.  We had a little bit of trouble scraping the clear seal off each section of paint, but once we got past that we had a great time being ""artistic""  and drawing on each others faces!  There are some sample pictures of animal faces you can draw located on the back of the box, but I looked some more up on line so we had some other ideas of ways to paint your face! The child should be old enough to be able to hold the little paint brush and foam applicators but they can always use their fingers if that proves too difficult.  It is soft on the skin and cleans up easily.  The kit comes with one paintbrush, two round sponges and two little foam applicator wands.  You just add a little water and start creating.  Obviously the paint is non toxic.  The kit is a little smaller than I thought it would be but it was certainly big enough for an afternoon of fun!  Five stars for Beetastic's  Kids Face Paint Kit.**I was asked to use this product then give my honest and unbiased opinion in an effort to provide consumers with information that will help in their purchase decision.

"Against the Tide is a good addition to author Kat Martin's long standing and successful Against the.... series and I always look forward to the next story in line about these tough, rugged and honest alpha males and the smart, feisty women they get tangled up with.  This book is no exception and has the beautiful setting of Alaska that has a charm all its own.The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is that it moves a little slowly and there is not a lot of action til toward the end, even though the entire novel starts off with the murder of hero Rafe Brodie's first mate.  Rafe and the beautiful but intensely private Olivia Chandler circle each other for awhile then finally decide the attraction is too strong to deny and begin a relationship that has some obstacles to overcome... the biggest of which is that Olivia is not who she claims to be.  The sex scenes are hot and well written... like all of Martin's novels and you can count on characters that are easy to like and a story that will keep your interest.  I've read all of Kat Martin's books and this one isn't bad by any means, but it's still not as good as some of the others she's written that had me on the edge of my seat with one action scene after another... like Against the Night... my favorite one.

"We love Minnie Mouse in our house so this was a perfect find for our littlest granddaughter.  Since we are always traveling to each others houses for meals and I babysit quite a bit, this is a perfect solution to keeping our little one safe, happy and contained while she is eating and the convenience can't be beat.  It will fit on almost any standard dining room or desk chair.  The tray is removable and easy to clean and our one year old likes to set her bottle or sippy cup in the drink holder.  There is a belt across and between the legs to keep her seated and it's just so easy to pack it up and take it anywhere!  We have been very pleased with this chair and it's the perfect solution if you're short on space or need something that's easy to take with you... our baby girl loves it ... so 5 stars it is for Disney's First Years Minnie Booster Seat!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMOQ8YRHUTDZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DDT1GOO#wasThisHelpful","RMOQ8YRHUTDZG","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My four year old granddaughter has inherited her mother's American Girl Doll and is just now taking interest in changing the doll's clothes every five minutes so when I needed a gift for her birthday, I found these outfits on Amazon and ordered four different sets.  This set is especially cute... it has a white shirt, jean type leggings, rain boots, a rain coat and hat and a very cute little umbrella with a kitty face on it. My granddaughter was very excited and didn't waste a second putting all this on ""her baby"".  It was especially cute since it rained all day yesterday and they made quite a pair.  I want to stress that these are NOT clothes made by the American Girl company and as such they are much less expensive than what you would pay for an actual American Girl outfit.  The quality may not be quite as good, but it's definitely not bad either and since my granddaughter tends to be a bit rough on her toys, I'd rather pay more reasonable prices while she is still young and doesn't know the difference.  The selection was nice too... I also ordered her a cute swimsuit with cap and goggles, a ballerina dress with ballet slippers and a blue sparkly dress that looks very much like Elsa's from Frozen.  She was thrilled with each and every outfit... so it's a win win for everyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVDD53M06JF8N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KICK8TI#wasThisHelpful","RVDD53M06JF8N","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little picnic table for the kids.  It can seat six small kids, the construction is sturdy and it's easy to put together with helpful instructions including photos(All you need is a Phillips head screwdriver).  It's attractive and my grandchildren love the umbrella which easily shades the entire table.  This table can be used indoor as well as outdoors, wipes up easily with a wet towel and can be used for playtime, art time or snack time and there is room for everyone!  My grandchildren are ages 6, 4, 2 and 1 and the six and four and two year old fit very comfortably with plenty of room between them and the one year old is able to sit at the table too.

"I have always loved Lindsay McKenna's action romances based on members of the US military, most of whom in recent books have all been SEALS stationed in Afghanistan.  She is ex-military herself so she knows the lingo and she is skilled at setting up tense survival situations where these men and women have to fight the enemy at every turn.  McKenna is also very adept at taking the reader through the intense emotions of these romances that develop in the heat of the battle.  The characters in Running Fire are appealing, especially the hero Kell.  Physically he is an exceptional specimen of a man and he has the courage, bravery, insight and wisdom needed to help the shattered and broken Leah survive not only a horrifying helicopter crash, but the scars of her past abusive marriage that continue to threaten her.  Never expecting to fall in love, Kell and Leah find themselves growing closer and hoping with each passing day that they can make it back to camp BRAVO before the Taliban close in on them.  And since Leah's vengeful ex-husband will be waiting for her when they get back, it's going to take a whole lot of skill to keep their budding relationship under wraps and keep Leah safe at the same time.A fast paced, sensitive story about two people who find each other and fall in love in the most unlikely of circumstances and are determined to triumph over their current dangerous predicament as well as demons from the past that threaten their life together.  Another great addition to the Shadow Warrior series of military action romances that McKenna is so good at.  Five stars for Running Fire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CO4NGM6X8W1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373788932#wasThisHelpful","R1CO4NGM6X8W1U","A3K0S346DLN9JM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K0S346DLN9JM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There is a lot to be said for being a woman.  We get to primp and play dress up, we get to know the singular pain and joy of giving birth, we get to appreciate the uniqueness of our bodies and the comforts it can provide for us and the people we love.  We can experience the satisfaction of staying home to nurture our children, or the thrill of success in the business world.  We can even decide to do both at once or neither at all and be brilliant in the doing! But just as it is with men, there are downsides to being a woman too and authors Douglas Ginter and Dr. Jason Sachman wants to make sure that you are armed with the knowledge of what being a woman really means especially in terms of your sexual health... an area that is a big part of our lives but gets very little attention when it comes to how to make what you know work for you.Let's face it, we have our fair share of annoyances associated with being a woman... cramps, PMS, mood swings, tender breasts, pregnancy issues, postpartum depression, birth control, increase/decrease in our sex drive, painful intercourse as we age, sagging, drooping and that one stubborn hair that continues to appear on our chin when our hormones go wonky! And that's just to name a few!  As the old saying goes, knowledge is power and this book aims to help you understand your health as a woman, especially your sexual health which is probably one of the hardest things we have to discuss with our doctor.  Whatever problems you may be experiencing, this book reminds you that you are not alone and while it's not meant to take the place of a consultation with your own physician, it can help steer you in the right direction and give you the basis of knowledge you need to better understand your own body and why it's doing what it's doing. Just like its companion book, Total Male, Total Female is a book worth having and reading if you want to enjoy all that life has to offer you as a woman, no matter what age or stage you may currently be in and I have no problem recommending it as a worthwhile read for women of all ages.**I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review which I have given.

"You have to admire the dedication it took for author Kathryn J. Kappler to pursue this project for so many years, determined to see it through to its completion.  It's a very interesting and enlightening telling about her relatives and their involvement in the beginnings of the Mormon Church (Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints).  No matter your feelings about Joseph Smith and the Mormon Church, My Own Pioneers makes for interesting reading and while the author's version is certain to be slanted toward presenting her relatives in a flattering light, there is no denying the tremendous hardships these early believers of this new religion were subjected to.  The pictures and formatting of the book make it all the richer and Mormon philosophies aside, it is a fascinating look at the history of the birth of Mormonism whose followers were willing to endure an endless variety of deprivations in their quest to give life to Joseph Smith's vision.  Was this man a delusional heretic or The Chosen One?  Members of the Mormon Church (whose numbers are easily in the millions) such as the author would say it was the latter, but when all is said and done it's up to the reader to decide.  Four stars for Kathryn J. Kappler and Volume I of My Own Pioneers.**I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review which I have given.  I do not know Kathryn J.

"I put off writing this review because the book bummed me out so much.  I like real romances, romances where people act like people and have real flaws.  But this is the story of how a woman puts up with abuse and mistreatment from virtually every man that she encounters, including the two men who claim to love her.  Scratch that.  ESPECIALLY the two men who claim to love her.  And instead of finding some way through to and building a better life, a life including respect, for herself and her children, she learns to embrace it, like she shouldn't expect anything better.  It's truly disheartening to see how much she is willing to endure to gain such a dubious prize, the affection of a petty criminal who thinks nothing of calling her names and is willing to physically assult people whose children misbehave (he knocks out a man's tooth after the man's son misbehaves in nursery school).When the book begins, Meadow is a young teenager. She befriends classmates Jared and Justin (who are identical twins).  Over the years, she is romantically involved with both of them.  They're completely immeshed in a dysfunctional and ridiculously melodramatic love triangle.  As a result, by the time the three reach adulthood, the brothers cannot be in the same room without physically assaulting each other.  Add to this cringeworthy song lyrics (Meadow is a lyricist), a refusal to ever practice safe sex, and a cartoonishly over-the-top bad guy.  Meadow values herself so little, it's hard to imagine a HEA for her that doesn't involve years of therapy and cutting these men out of her life.  Instead, she embraces being treated like a human trash bag.  Jared's biker buddies joke about passing her around?  No, don't worry.  Jared says that aren't that bad.  Jared explodes with verbal abuse whenever there is a misunderstanding?  Oh, but he got a tattoo for you, so it must be love.Note to author:  identical twins are identical because they have the same DNA.  Paternity tests determine paternity by comparing the DNA of the potential father to that of the child.  A paternity test would be useless for determining which identical twin fathered someone's children.  Yet another reason why Meadow should buy some condoms already.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LU484C1CEA1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KY8G61A#wasThisHelpful","R2LU484C1CEA1M","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the most complex mysteries that Ive ever read.  I reached a point, relatively early, where I stopped trying to figure out what was going to happen and just enjoyed the story.  Once you get past the rough beginning (were dropped into the middle of a complex story), youre sucked into the story and Pattison excels in bringing the cultural alienation his colonial characters feel to complete life.  We may take elements of Native American culture for granted due to their familiarity, but this wouldnt have been the case for them.  Everything becomes fresh and fascinating  even sometimes frightening  as his characters experience it.I wish the book had started earlier  before the characters were on the ship.  That Duncan, the main character, spends so much time confused doesnt mean that we should necessarily replicate his condition.  As a mystery, the book does leave something to be desired.

Bailey, one of the sisters, is the chef/owner of a restaurant in a resort area.  Shes had her eye on Trace, a local farmer, for a while, but his hang-ups about love have kept their relationship platonic.  This isnt an elaborately plotted book and I did feel like the ending was extremely rushed.  But overall, it was a sweet and entertaining romance with some real heat between the two main characters.

"Authors are told to write what they know and Young has obviously taken this advice to heart.  His exploration of the world of crack addicts is vivid and often harrowing.  Unfortunately, the rest of the novel doesnt live up to the power of those scenes.Herby and Kerby are identical twin brothers.  At one point, they were both police officers.  But Kerby is now addicted to crack and working as a security guard.  When Young is writing about Kerbys world, the story is at its most powerful.  But when he tries to expand the story, he too often gets caught in distracting factual errors (like those involving police work or legal procedures) or stumbles over his confusing timelines (the brothers are clearly middle aged  one of them has teenaged children  but the story often makes it seem like Kerby began using crack right after their parents died, when they were in high school).  As a secular reader, having actions and thoughts attributed to God was often confusing.  I found myself wondering why God would single Kerby out for special treatment and favor while letting others in the story suffer and die.The editing is very rough.  It's difficult, in some scenes, to tell exactly who is talking or what is happening.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GZG4USY0IA2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005J52RXY#wasThisHelpful","R2GZG4USY0IA2U","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rebecca (or Bex) is a struggling actress who pays the bills by being a pretend nurse (she breezily tells us she is trained by her employer  a long-term care facilityto perform the duties of a nurse, something that is both illegal and represents a substantial opportunity for a civil lawsuit).  One morning she runs into a handsome and apparently wealthy man on the street.  Shes instantly attracted to him.  Soon afterwards, she is hired to be eye candy at a swanky society party.  Somewhat inexplicably, she decides to tell a group of guests that she is dating the host.  Unsurprisingly, the host turns out to be the man from earlier in the book.  Marcus (or Markus, the author goes back and forth on the spelling) is a billionaire playboy.  Hes famous enough to be on the cover of Time and subjected to constant photographer attention, but  despite the fact that they live in the same city --Bex somehow has no idea who he is (although within a few days, shes confident enough to provide analysis of his business and personality to others).  Its weird and it makes the book feel like it never gets established in reality.  Rose cant decide if Marcus/Markus is truly famous or not  hes only famous, it seems, when it suits the plot.  At other times, he can get in a confrontation outside a coffee shop and nobody in a crowd has an idea who he is.Anyway, when Marcus/Markus finds out that a struggling actress is pretending to be his girlfriend so she can tell off his party guests, he decides to go along with the act.  And then he decides to offer her a bunch of money to continue the act.  Why?  Some business reasons that make little sense.Rose is vague on how Marcus/Markus actually maintains his fortune (which he initially inherited from his father).  When Bex describes his business to others, she makes him sound like some sort of middle management asset manager.  Its another example of how the book struggles to depict reality.  The plot is artificially drawn out by the main characters refusing to face reality or apply common sense (there are multiple scenes where Bex wonders why Marcus/Markus is being romantic or sexual with her even when there is nobody to witness it  uh, maybe he likes you?).Sometimes waiting for character to realize theyre attracted to each other adds to the fun of the book, but I found Bexs obtuseness more annoying than engaging, especially given that there is nothing else in the plot to pay attention to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O35H9RSOLTZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01691UD4G#wasThisHelpful","R3O35H9RSOLTZW","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book was a fast read, although I was surprised  at the end  how little medicine had to do with the thrillers in this so-called medical thriller.  Its kind of like Fatal Attraction mixed with the plot from a 1980s Robin Cook thriller, but it moves quickly enough that you dont notice any of the seams until the end.Jemma Sands is a busy, but content, wife, mother, and doctor until a surgery goes wrong.  Although she did everything that she could, the patients baby was stillborn and the patient lost her uterus, impacting her future fertility.  This sets a somewhat far-fetched revenge plot into motion, one that is heavily reliant on some unlikely connections between the patient and Jemmas husband.With all this, Adler is a graceful writer and the flow of the book is strong, especially in the suspenseful final scenes.  There were a couple of false notes (a single sex scene that seemed unnecessarily explicit given the overall tone of the book -- I'm a fan of explicit scenes, but this just seemed completely incongruous; a reference to 9/11 at the end that seemed to come completely out of left field), but I would consider checking out more books by this author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKEW73GCX6JF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITNVT32#wasThisHelpful","RKEW73GCX6JF5","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrea is a young culinary student who is tricked by her grandmother (her only surviving relative) into travelling to Alaska and taking over as caretaker for a giant mansion.  Andreas grandmother doesnt give a thought to what this might mean for Andreas career, studies, and life in Chicago.  As it turns out, this is the beginning of a trend where nobody in the book cares about Andrea, what she wants, and what dreams she has for her own life.  The grandmothers goal:  to get Andrea knocked up by one of the two handsome hotties inhabiting the mansion, hotties who happen to be werewolf-style creatures from another realm who visit Earth from time to time.The world-building in this novel is actually pretty good.

He thinks nothing of taking Andrea from her home, friends, career, and planet without even discussing it with her.  He binds her  forever  to a symbiotic creature.  He knows that his mating standards (once you do it, youre mated forever) vary from hers, but it doesnt seem like he was ever going to let her know (someone else lets it slip).  And despite abundant evidence that breeding between their species can be dangerous, he doesnt take any precautions once they do become intimate.  Hes one of the biggest Alphaholes Ive ever encountered.  That Andrea takes this treatment for love casts a pall over the entire book.  That her grandmother, the only mother figure left in her lift, thinks this is cute underscores that she doesnt value her for anything besides her ability to reproduce.  Its deeply saddening.Id love to think were past this sort of thinking, but here it is.  Nothing in your life is as important as the sexual attention of a almost-stranger.  And nothing you could ever accomplish in other areas is as important as the child you will bear for him.  Given the heavily domestic bent of all the women in this story, I wonder if this is just a series about women being broken down.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4822RO8LJVPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043M4NJ0#wasThisHelpful","R4822RO8LJVPO","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is awkwardly written.  The dialogue is wooden, the POV is confusing (part of the book is in first person, but the narrator has knowledge that he couldnt possibly have, and part is delivered by an omniscient narrator who withholds key facts to enhance the mystery), the editing is rough, and the author doesnt appear to know anything at all about police procedures.Marcella is less an actual character than a stock grizzled detective type.  Donovan doesnt spend much time at all developing the character or sharing details about him  hes just a vehicle to share the story, nothing more.  He frequently crosses the line into clich, even when it doesnt make sense.  For example, he refuses to use a computer at all.  So does his police department not require the filing of reports or even reading routine emails (let alone doing the internet research that modern detective work requires)?  This disregard for character and ignorance of how detective work is actually carried out compromises the entire novel.The idea of a decidedly non-supernatural detective investigating a supernatural crime is an interesting one, but the execution is so poor I cant recommend this book to anyone.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XKMNPXLKCPJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004UI6DKO#wasThisHelpful","R22XKMNPXLKCPJ","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She catches the eye of James, a wealthy museum benefactor and he invites her to indulge with him . . . and eventually with his friend.

Adams begins to set up an interesting conflict between the threesome and the increasing emotional connection between Kate and James, as well as the mystery of what happened to the last woman who indulged with the two men.

"Taylor is a sweet, but completely ordinary, college student.  Kyle is a raging jerk of a heir, a substance-abusing and emotionally stunted child of privilege whose deepest thoughts involve who he plans to bang next and how to keep daddys money flowing.  In a genre that is increasingly delving into unappealing male main characters, hes easily one of the least appealing Ive encountered for a while.When Kyle accidently hits Taylors car, he is inexplicably attracted to her.  This instant attraction is never really explained or justified by anything in his character or hers  it seems to happen simply because it needs to happen for the plot to progress.

It was a bit annoying that it was never really told in the moment  its told by alternating Kyle and Taylors POV and theyre both prone to lots of foreshadowing, making it clear the story is being recounted from some future vantage point.

"This book is very slow moving.  After opening with a scene of a character in peril, we then go years earlier in the life of another character -- Peter.  Before we can find out what is happening in the first scene, we must go through years of Peter's life, often in tedious detail.  His life as a school teacher is mostly made up of random scenes with occasional moments of high drama (sometimes these moments are disturbing, like when another character describes a puppy being stomped to death in vivid detail).There is something very odd about the construction of this book, as if Tennant had trouble deciding exactly whose story he wanted to tell.  He chooses Peter as the main character, but the drama only involves him somewhat -- as a result the climatic events of the novel (when they finally arrive) never really seem clear and key events are often recounted in a rush of clumsy exposition.

"This was a difficult novel for me to get into.  There's a supernatural/ghost angle that never gets fully developed, a prickly lead detective who is hard to root for (she's doesn't have the essential ""great detective quality"" that allows a reader to spend a book with a less pleasant main, she just seems to stumble through the investigation), and a plot that basically involves bad guys pouring out of the woodwork (and in some cases revealing themselves as serial killers despite seeming normal for the vast majority of the story).Laura Cardinal is a Tucson-based detective investigating the murder of a teenage girl.  Laura has a lot going on in her life and, unfortunately, the author doesn't always do the best job of making it clear what exactly is going on.  I am not a reader who usually needs a lot of handholding, but I spent far too long in this book wondering exactly what was going on or trying to remember who certain characters were.The plot develops slowly -- Laura's investigation involves a lot of waiting.

"Somewhere around the fifteenth or twentieth time we're told how tiny Abby and her body parts looked against her older stepbrother's massive parts, I got a little bit weirded out.  Maybe it's because they constantly called each other ""brother"" and ""sister.""  Or maybe it's because their love apparently began when she was way underage and he . .  wasn't (although when the book takes place, Abby is legal -- barely).  Maybe it's because despite her age, Abby still seems so much younger than Kaiden -- immature, childish, naive.  She doesn't even seem to understand how babies are made.  This isn't a story about step-siblings who meet and fall for each other.  This is a story about two people raised as siblings and consider themselves to be brother and sister falling in love.  Know that before you download.That aside, this story has major gaps.  Abby has to move in with Kaiden after their parents die (yeah, I know they're step-siblings, but they're essentially siblings and no mention is ever made of the parents except as their JOINT parents) and she finds out her college money was blown on bail for him years earlier.  Kaiden supposedly wants to keep her out of his trashy life, but instead of helping her brainstorm ways to actually go to college, he lets her move in, incessantly abuses her verbally, and does nothing to help her escape the orbit of his criminal set.  This made no sense, especially when we find out later that he actually loved her all along.  Is he dumb?  Or is he just selfish?An somewhat incoherent thriller plot emerges, but it's just a backdrop for their budding romance.

"Maddy is a young police officer who lives in the in-law quarters of her father and step-mother's home.  In one day, she receives a new roommate -- her stepbrother, Brock, who has returned from a mysterious absence -- and a new assignment.  The assignment -- to find out what Brock and his tough street racing buddies are really up to.  Maddy is keen to prove herself, but she's also keen for Brock -- despite their history of animosity.This book was . . . okay.  There were things that kept jarring me out of the story.  Example:  the story is apparently set in the San Francisco Bay area and Maddy is supposedly a native.  But the writer delivers her internal dialogue in what I believe is Australian English, which means we're hearing about car ""bonnets"" and her bum.  It's distracting.  The author also seems a bit vague on police procedures and audio surveillance (the police can't just decide to turn on your cell phone and record all your activities for the day, even if you are an undercover police officer).  And the actions of characters just didn't make sense sometimes -- at one point, we find out that Maddy's father hid key information from her for years -- information that impacted her personal safety and her relationship with her stepbrother.  Why?  Because he just didn't care for his step-son?  It didn't make sense.If you're craving a bad boy stepbrother fix, this could probably do the job.

"This book is a downer!  That isn't a point against it.  Many great works of literature are downers.  But great downers are great because they typically reveal something, they allow us to connect to the human condition in a way we hadn't before.  This book, despite throwing virtually everything at us, never really connects or feels real.As the book begins, Afton is the beautiful and carefree young daughter of an English villein.  When her innocent mistake kills the family ewe, they are unable to pay their rent and Afton is given to the lord and lady to raise as a lark (Lady Endeline, a ridiculously over-the-top villainess, craves beautiful peasant children to raise as her own).  Although she has moments of happiness, Hunt basically spends the next few hundred pages making Afton endure every type of awfulness.  The sheer misery of the book isn't the real problem (although I can see how some readers may be put off by it).  What got me was how constructed and anachronistic everything felt.  The thoughts and words of these people just aren't in keeping with their times (like when Afton's father muses to Afton's mother -- when they face giving up their child -- that although they have been poor all their lives, this is the first time that he actually *feels* poor).

"This book was kind of confusing.  Elizabeth (Bennett, ugh, why  the author never provides any details to explain WHY the female mains parents decided to give her such a cutesy name) has suddenly been fired rom her job when she encounters handsome billionaire dominant Alexander Fairhaven.  Alexander talks like a Brit out of Central Casting (including outdated slang like bird) despite the fact that he went to college in the US.  He immediately falls for Elizabeth but she  despite being raised by wealthy drug company millionaires (who have since disowned her)  is convinced she could never fit into his world.  Im not sure why Elizabeth  Harvard educated, raised in the 1%, independently wealthy thanks to family stocks  is so convinced she is an outsider to Alexanders circle.  Its the most enduring mystery of the book and far more mysterious than the mystery the author would like for us to focus on.Another potential problem:  despite the instant attraction they feel for each other, Elizabeth has never been dominated and shes pretty sure that she doesnt want to be.  But Alexander has magic domdar and he is just positive that she is a natural submissive.  He wants her in his silks, a phrase that he will repeat at least once per scene for a few hundred pages.  Elizabeth agrees to try and their relationship begins.But there is a cloud hanging over Elizabeths head.  Despite her widely reported status as a whistleblower (on her parents, no less!), Elizabeths job at a high powered accounting firm involved  unbeknownst to her  significant tax fraud.  Why, you might ask, would criminals hire a woman who famously narced on her own parents for business misconduct?  I dunno, cause it seems like a terrible plan to me.  And then, to top it off, they systematically underpay her ($60,000 a year, in Boston, for a senior account manager for multiple big ticket clients) and fire her on a pretext after she gets just enough evidence to implicate them . . . its almost like the plot required it or something.  Well, now they just have to try to kill her, dont they?Despite the ridiculous set-up, the thriller part of the plot does work a little better than the romance (maybe because it gets Alexander to take a break from murmuring poshly about his silks).  This isnt a bad book, really.  Its just a bit silly, like the early ideas and plot points werent revisited and revised as the book progressed.  That Elizabeth, an Ivy League graduate raised in the type of wealth most of us can only imagine,thinks she couldnt possibly fit into Alexanders world makes no sense no matter how you squint at it.  If you have a favorite English tea that you picked out on your vacation to London, you arent exactly slumming.  And if your first instinct when facing legal trouble is to fly to Seattle to visit your familys long-time personal lawyer (a visit that requires a retainer of several thousand dollars, a fee you pay easily by selling some of the stock you hold in the family company), then you arent exactly from the wrong side of the tracks.

He should say What are you talking about?","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29S6B3GFJZHVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSNRZFC#wasThisHelpful","R29S6B3GFJZHVC","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book boasts one of the faster moving plots in the series -- although the author still has a tendency to go over details more than once and include repetitive scenes, usually featuring JP's slowish investigations.  There is a sub-plot involving domestic abuse that keeps things moving fairly quickly.  And although the characters sometimes seem absurdly sheltered (it just strains credulity that JP isn't sure what is going on when he encounters a house full of Asian women working on sewing machines that an antagonist wants to keep hidden), this is one of the better books in the series due to the pace and the author's improved skills in writing dialogue.Note:  Given that Sabre is such a straight arrow that she wouldn't even entertain the idea of having an ex parte conversation with a judge, it's hard to believe that she was so cavalier when, later in the book, she receives a confession about the assassination of a judge.

"There is a germ of a good medical thriller here, compromised by a clunky narrative structure (the story is told in flashback format, a man telling his daughter about things that happened hundreds of years earlier) and a general lack of realism.  The main character, after some false starts highlighting other characters, is scientist Jason Roy.  After his wife dies, their daughter Lily becomes the center of his world.  Lily has Down Syndrome.  As I have a close family member with Down Syndrome, I was intrigued by this part of the plot and hoped it would add some interest to the novel.  Unfortunately, Lily's character just isn't written very well.  It wasn't realistic based on my experience with my family member and her friends with Down Syndrome.  Her dialogue and actions didn't ring true.  Maybe Lily is based on someone the author knows, but it seems as if she (and the other character in the book with Down Syndrome) were written as precocious sweet children rather than pre-adolescents/adolescents with intellectual disabilities.  In the quest to humanize Down Syndrome (something I completely support), it seems like their genuine differences were erased.  And that's a shame, because I would love to see more accurate and true-to-life renderings of people with intellectual disabilities in literature -- that is what is truly humanizing.Setting all that aside, the plot doesn't really work and the execution is frequently uneven.  The evil big pharma angle is stretched to the breaking point and the book dedicates too much time to a cross-country chase that never really means anything.  Roy's research, the cornerstone of the story, is rushed over and hardly described.  If you think everything will be explained by the end of the story, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  It's never clear how we get from the present-day to the future where Roy's story was being told (or how the narrator knows the thoughts and actions of the main characters).As a raw story this has potential.

After beginning with a completely improbable event (during a deadly accident, a woman experiences physical death while her mind is transferred into her daughters body), it never afterward feels anything less than realistic.The translation seems . . . competent.  I can't read Japanese, but I suspect that the original flows much better than this translation.  The dialogue occasionally comes across as slightly stilted or unlike the speech of actual people.

"Dr Bill Brocktons latest case is one of his most complicated yet . . . and his life continues to be even more complicated that the mystery.  Old grudges  both personal and political  are stirred up when Brockton is called to consult on the mysterious death of a retired nuclear physicist.  The tangle of his death leads all the way back to World War II, but has dramatic and dangerous consequences for Brockton and those closest to him.These books shine at delivering a regional flavor and careful research.  I like that these books arent totally self-contained, but new readers should be aware that while the plot of the book stands alone, the personal relationships draw quite a bit on what has come in previous books and parts of this story will continue into the next book.  Although the pacing can sometimes be uneven (I found myself getting impatient during some of the lengthy flashbacks told from one characters POV), this is a solid installment in an interesting and developed series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22UPUKKGMZL1P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061284742#wasThisHelpful","R22UPUKKGMZL1P","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The implausibility of the plot was a major obstacle to the success of the author's first novel in this series (The Advocate (Volume 1).  While parts of this have improved, there are still some really unlikely events in this book that will jar the reader out of the story.  There is also lots of repetition.Sabre, the intrepid child advocate lawyer, is convinced that there is a trend of ritual abuse emerging in her area.  Or she isn't convinced -- her stance seems to flip from chapter-to-chapter.  With the help of her buddy, Bob, and their PI, JP, she launches an investigation.  The truth winds up being more complicated and almost as unlikely as ritual abuse.  When I finished the book, major portions of the plot were still unclear to me.  Why would you invite someone who was blackmailing you to commit further crimes with you?  Why would a criminal start a ritual abuse panic that might draw attention to their activities?  When you're in the middle of the story, you keep hoping that the ending will tie it all together, but I had as many questions when I finished as I did halfway through the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30B8SPEIJY2E5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00876SQN2#wasThisHelpful","R30B8SPEIJY2E5","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book features some of Jessica's nastiest and most selfish behavior as she and her sorority pals gang up on overweight Robin, a girl who wants to join their clique.  Elizabeth tries to help Robin, but her plan may backfire because it relies on help from notoriously self-absorbed Bruce Patman.Looking at Jessica's nastiness through 21st century eyes is illuminating -- when I read this book as a girl, bullying didn't have nearly the attention that it does today.  As a result, the casual treatment of Jessica's cruelty is sometimes jarring.  Despite the subject matter, this is still a fun and light read that doesn't go too deep.  At the end of the day, even Robin doesn't seem too upset by what happened.Some of the reviews of the paperback version note changes to the text.  As far as I can tell, the Kindle version duplicates what I read when I was young (that is, the Wakefield twins are described as size 6, not size 2).

"Nelson Rockefeller crammed so much into one life -- politician, heir, reformer, father, policy wonk, art lover and patron, ladies man -- and Smith does an admirable job of bringing him to life.  His life was so much more interesting and complex than I had realized.  Smith does an excellent job with the more dramatic events of Rockefeller's life -- his divorce, his runs for the presidency, the death of his son, Attica -- but he also manages to handle the less intrinsically exciting details of his political life in a way that is interesting even for those of us who don't get excited about state budgets and urban renewal.  It would have been easy for large sections of this book to sink into tedium, a less skilled author couldn't have managed to make this full account of Rockefeller's life as readable as it is.  The clear-eyed fairness of this book really makes the man come alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QC8VW49GPKB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAFX9IU#wasThisHelpful","R2QC8VW49GPKB2","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is an odd mixture of hero worship (Sex's regular character, Andre, the wise therapist who can never do anything wrong), a tale of redemptions, and some clunky moralizing about sexual standards.  The stories rarely get a chance to flourish without being thrown off by scenes of implausible therapy sessions, paeans to Andre's wonderfulness from multiple characters, or sermons about sexual standards or the proper way to respond to abuse.  Despite Andre's supposed greatness, I questioned how ethical it was for him to sleep with a young woman placed in his care or how appropriate it was for the young woman to begin work as a sexual surrogate under his direction (despite the fact that she has completed no in-person training, only online psychology courses).  That this young woman goes on to make a patient think she may marry him and tells another patient that she loves him on during their second sessions makes me question the reality of this book.  There's a lot that doesn't seem right here.Sex is so intent on the point she's trying to make (abused people aren't at fault for being abuse and sex doesn't need to be attached to commitment) that the story never gets a chance to truly develop.  These people are vehicles, not characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QMLCDI3EP4SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBU7PVE#wasThisHelpful","R3QMLCDI3EP4SS","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easily the worst book yet in this decayed wreck of a once solid series.  It's hard to escape the impression that Cornwell just doesn't care any more.The loathsome entitlement and self-pity of Scarpetta's character have never been more apparent.  The book begins with her plans for a vacation with Benton, her husband, and bemoaning that they hardly get to spend time together.  Never mind that this is the result of their professional choices.  That these choices are freely made doesn't seem to register with her.  Nor does it occur to her that her subordinates could act as more than glorified assistants to her genius, allowing her to take a day off (most of these subordinates will, over the course of the book, be revealed as venal or incompetent or even venally incompetent -- maybe Scarpetta should spend some time examining her recruitment and talent evaluation processes?).Scarpetta is called to a crime scene by Marino and the tedious dance of their relationship, explored to death over the past few books, is renewed.  She can't stand him, but is unable to contemplate a life without him.  Her contempt for him is wearying.  I actually think most of the first half of the book is just the two of them conversing in the car or at the crime scene.  I am now convinced that the Marino/Scarpetta/Benton triangle is more about Cornwell exploring her own issues than anything else.  This clearly resonates deeply with her -- there is no way that any reader can be as fascinated by the trio and their murky aggressions and complusions as she is.  She has an endless appetite for scenes where Marino and Scarpetta talk around their bizarre connection, scenes where Marino pulsates with rage while Benton flexes his cold, WASPy, cryptically phrased disdain.  What is wrong with these three?  I can't even begin to imagine a legitimate explanation for their profound dysfunction.  As Benton grows increasingly bloodless and Scarpetta increasingly icy, Marino has become the locus of the trio's emotions -- and, in the world of this series, emotions are never anything but negative.  Rage, jealousy, crude joy, pride -- Marino is a vessel for all of these so Benton and Scarpetta can live in a zone where risotto and chilled white wine is a substitute for authentic emotion.  Lucy also continues devolving into an emotion-free state -- a more violent version of Scarpetta's super-achieving ice princess persona, but with more expensive cars.I was shocked to see the beginnings of an intriguing plot emerge in the first half of the book and thought we may have the rare treat of a bad guy who wasn't a super-genius with no motivation beyond hurting Scarpetta (the most famous and obsessed over medical examiner in the history of medicine or examining).  Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed more quickly than Kay and Benton's vacation plans.  Cornwell has never been particularly insightful about why people choose to hurt others, but the muddled motivations in this book were a low point even for her.  She loves Scarpetta and her associates, therefore bad people must hate them and want to hurt them.  It truly goes no deeper than that for Cornwell.After the train wreck of the previous book, I didn't think it was possible for things to get worse.  Oh, I was wrong.  Scarpetta spends less time than ever actually doing her job.  Her contempt for everyone except for Benton and Lucy grows thicker with every book and it's unclear what is driving it since there is no true insight into her as a character on display in these pages.  It's important, I think, for Cornwell to build these people up.  Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to do that without tearing down the characters that surround them, sometimes for reasons that are utterly trivial or even unclear.  Example:  she judges her subordinates for learning more about the crimes they are investigating, thinking this will cloud their findings.  But she is unable to apply that to herself, when she spends the day interviewing suspects or discussing theories of the case with Marino.  Foregrounding the relationship between Marino, Scarpetta, and Benton was the worst thing to ever happen to this series.  At this rate, the next book will consist of someone getting shot, Benton and Marino having a fight, and then 300 pages of Kay and Marino driving to the scene while Kay frets about why Benton isn't answering his cell phone.This series was much more fun when Scarpetta was human.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VE4RI8B4XW3O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062325345#wasThisHelpful","R2VE4RI8B4XW3O","A3A7FF87LEVCQ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3A7FF87LEVCQ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued by the unusual setting of this book (child advocacy legal system) and the focus on a non-cookie cutter main character.  Sabre is a smart and independent lawyer.  Unfortunately, the plot and execution of this debut novel leave a great deal to be desired.Too much of the plot involves implausibilities (characters who are inexplicably virtually identical, people stalking people on the flimsiest of pretexts, etc) and there is an inexcusable amount of repetition (seriously, if I had to read about Sabre's red notebook one more time, I was going to scream).

"This book reads as if it was written by a twelve-year-old -- the simplistic characters, the unrealistic setting, the stilted dialogue. Katelynn, the daughter of a former US Senator -- has just gotten her Master's degree in political science. But she hates politics and doesn't want anything to do with it (why didn't she realize this at any point while getting her degree?). Instead of getting a job that draws on her advanced degree in any way, she moves back home and decides to apply for minimum wage jobs. She's hired at a local discount superstore as a manager trainee (apparently the company doesn't want managers to have any relevant experience) and, instead of being trained by another manager, Nate, the billionaire son of the CEO, comes to handle her training personally.Now, being a CEO requires a very specific set of skills that have little to do with running day-to-day operations of the company -- recruiting top talent, inspiring investors, maintaining investor returns, managing relationships with the board of directors, high level financial planning -- so why would a CEO who wanted his son to be the future CEO have him doing inventory reports, coaching tardy cashiers, and stocking shelves? Like so much of the novel, it seems like the author just doesn't get it.Of course, Nate and Katelynn fall for each other. They don't have much chemistry. They frequently think about how attractive the other one is, but you never get a sense of any heat. Their connection has to be resolutely non-sexual because they're both committed to remaining virgins until marriage. This book wasn't listed as a Christian romance, so it was a bit frustrating to get this bait-and-switch.It's a cliffhanger, so the book ends on a note of uncertainty. I'm not sure if the author is extremely naive or just trying to reach an audience that is, but the simplistic nature of this book and the lack of chemistry between the two main characters will make it unsatisfying to most adults.Edit:  Upon further consideration, I think this author's body of work may be some kind of social experiment.  Her author bio is written like an obvious attempt to capture a certain demographic and as of today (10/27/15), a search of her author photo actually links to a stock photo tagged with -- I kid you not -- ""normal woman.""  She loves Starbucks!  And yoga!  All we need is a picture of her crunching through fall leaves in her Uggs.

"I cant compare these to other models in the Steelseries, but the Siberia 200 headset fits snugly, and the material is of a high enough quality that I doubt it will start peeling (like some cheap models Ive used) from wear and tear and sweat. I dont much care about how they look (Im not using them for a fashion show) but the self-adjusting over the ear design  keeps you immersed in what youre doing (listening, gaming, editing, recording) without having to pause and adjust them once you feel comfortable with wearing them.  Dont expect them to be equivalent to have noise cancelling features of expensive, pro models. The name SteelSeries is a bit of a marketing tool. They arent THAT sturdy.  I edit sound for my videos, and these were great in selecting the best downloaded  mp3 sound effects from various sound effect sites. I use a lot of ambient sound overlays (traffic, people talking on the street, documentary sounds in foreign languages, animal calls, nature sounds, etc.,) and it helped me choose the best tracks. Dont expect these to be like Sennheiser quality, whose gaming headphones start at $250 retail.  You just cant get that for under $100.

"These gloves are extremely durable and it's obvious the manufacturer put time and effort in coming up with the right design and combination of leather and fabric: a feature that is rare on cheaper work gloves you buy in the dollar store or hardware store. The large size is a bit tight on my hands, but I'm going to assume that with use, they will stretch out.  These are definitely outdoor gloves. Wearing them indoors would be like giving your hands a sauna. Don't expect to do fine tuned work with them, however. They are too bulky for handling screws or nails, or other objects that require fine motor skills. If you don't do work (like gardening) that will eventually soil the gloves, they could be worn as everyday gloves in cold weather.

"Wilde wrote this play more like an opera than a dramatic play. Characters have long monologues in which there is much explication. This is a symbolist play, showing obvious influences from the French symbolist movement.

"I have been looking for a NYC-based mystery series now that I've read through all the L. Block Matt Scudder novels. Unfortunately, Mr. R. F. Coleman's prose lacks the taut, visceral quality of the former.  The author seems to enjoy pages of description where a couple will walk around New York City, like the scenes from the old Woody Allen movies, or those tacky 1970s 'get to know you' movie scenes with dreamy, desaturated filming to suggest romance. It just doesn't work for a mystery story. I believe this is the first novel in a long series involving cane-carrying Jewish former detective Moe Praeger, so maybe the later volumes improve, but I don't have the patience to find out. For an excellent detective series featuring a Jewish detective, try Stuart Kaminsky's series featuring Chicago-based Abe Lieberman.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UXMJDNTBFSCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6IN1OQ#wasThisHelpful","R1UXMJDNTBFSCL","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a reader to learn Spanish, these stories are OK. Calling them 'short stories' is a bit of a misnomer. They seem to be constructed mainly for language learning, and have little redeeming literary value.

I got bored really quickly while reading the adventures of a few pals in Spain getting lost while going to a restaurant.

"No bath mat is going to be durable, washable, and soft given that it's placed on the bathroom floor. But this item is a replacement for an older mat whose threads unraveled after a ride in the washing machine filled with warm water. The former was synthetic and had that artificial feel to the touch.

"You can notice the four star rating; however, that is the rating I give it for my particular circumstances. If you don't mind being 'hooked up' to the epson printer world, meaning getting updates, e-mails, cute presentation suggestions, impressive features like remote printing of images from smart phones, easy uploads to facebook, an lcd screen that emulates those of high end office printers and copy machines, with lots of instructions, icons, warning lights, etc., then this printer is a five.  However, as I am quite busy, a great printer for my purposes would be one that is 'stripped-down.'  After I installed this printer, I had the feeling Epson is trying to develop a relationship with me like a kidney dialysis patient for his/her machine.  My primary reason for selecting this printer is its 11 x 17 photo output capability. However, I come from the epson dedicated photo printer school--r1900, r2000--where the emphasis is on performance without the bells and whistles.  I guess it's been a while since these aforementioned products were released so the world of color inkjet printers is changing. The image output is excellent for photos if you take good photos (if you know what GIGO means, you should have no trouble understanding this.Even with the 11 x 17 feature, I realize I have to insert one paper at a time, which means you have to really plan ahead in terms of printer placement if you want to get up every five minutes to insert another sheet into the printer, and when considering the extensions that come with the printer, i.e., three paper trays, and a cd tray.I do think this is an impressive printer, and epson engineers are quite ingenious, but I don't know if they've studied consumer habits.  Again, if you don't mind a 300 page user guide, and are gentle with your printing (the many slots and slide out panels are a bit flimsy and won't take much abuse), you should enjoy this printer. If you have a home office, where you sometimes are in a rush to complete a project and don't have the proper finesse, I'd look elsewhere.  I think the 'Expression' in the name of the printer tells it all: it's a very nice scrap booking, consumer-oriented printer for a relaxed environment, where there isn't a lot of human 'wear and tear.' If you don't want or need 11 x 17 printing or scanning, you might do better going with an 8 x 10 printer in the same series","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0VJJHT8D7TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","R1O0VJJHT8D7TA","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Corel has finally gotten the 'kinks' out of its program, and it's not nearly as cumbersome as it was about four editions ago. it responds very quickly and has a bunch of new features that aren't just fluff. The product opens up at a pretty amazing speed. The literature says it's 50% faster than previous editions; it seems even faster than that. One of the features--apparently with a deal from Onone software - the best 'third party; add-on software company is Perfect Effects--which gives you lots of choices for trying out various image styles. It has batch processing that is much more effective than the counterpart that comes with PS elements. If you are on the more professional end of digital photography, you won't want to give up Photoshop for this program, but if you're new to image software, and haven't learned another program, you should definitely consider this one.I've used Elements since PSE 5, and know it pretty well, so my intention for using paintshop is more as a change of pace than becoming my go-to program. The only downside t is the opening layout. It looks pretty daunting, like the controls you might imagine would be on a jumbo jet. This shouldn't be an issue if you only use a few software programs, but if you're like me, and enjoy trying out lots of variations on themes, your brain might not be able to handle all the choices.I have a feeling that if you like the program, you'll stick to maybe 10 or 15 effects rather than go through the 100+ for each image, Two bargains you won't get with PS Elements is the 'lifetime' free upgrade when a new edition comes out, and a very robust tutorial system that won't make you want to hunt for the dozens of tutorial program on the web that offer advice for the Adobe products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359U9739ZR7NV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60D8#wasThisHelpful","R359U9739ZR7NV","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though I'm not a 'pop historical thriller/mystery novel' reader, I bought this book after reading the author's memoir on becoming a writer. I recommend the memoir highly. Regarding this novel, though, it was written in that typical competent (meaning the sentences are grammatically correct) uninspired way.  If you're idea of a good novelist brings to mind Robert Bolano, William Faulkner, or Garcia Marquez, or what some 'high-brow' people call 'literary fiction,' you'll probably feel the way I did reading this. Or, if your idea of a good historical novel is Graves' 'I, Claudius' or 'The March' by Doctorow, you won't find the prose easy to plod through.  I'd say it's the literary equivalent to a TV movie, circa 1985, or why I like to call literary 'muzac.'However, the author comes across as such a nice and unpretentious guy (Morrell is a former college professor), and I feel bad even panning his own literary output, but I thought I'd write it for any of the 'quality' novel lovers out there. If you find the persona of De Quincey of interest, it might keep you reading, but that still wasn't enough for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCBNSYHKFMTHR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316323934#wasThisHelpful","RCBNSYHKFMTHR","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From the reviews of the older 820, The XP-830 seems to be a minor upgrade of the former. Ive always been hesitant to use all-in-ones because if something goes wrong with one function, you end up losing all functions. But Ive decided to give in for three reasons: first,  because Ive used Epson photo printers for several years and love the color and the fact  that theyve worked flawlessly, I have a very positive attitude toward Epson products. I also dont have a whole lot of space in my home office, and this unit is nice and small. And related to the second reason, theres the weariness of having so many cables around and searching for the right one when I need to reconfigure something.My fear of wireless going wrong was allayed. I didnt have any trouble in setting up the wireless connection.  One drawback of all Epson inkjets is the cartridge price. Im planning to do what Ive been doing with my photo printer: buy generic at least for the black cartridge. The colors might be slightly off if you buy generic cartridges for other colors, but its hard to mess up with the color black.If you are the type that likes the bells and whistles, like printing from your cell phone, tablet, etc., youll like this model. I dont really care about that stuff, but it seems that soon those features will be standard. My philosophy is the more you make use of such special unnecessary features, the more you have to learn and the more things are likely to mess up.But the print speed and the output quality, the two things that REALLY matter to me plus wireless make me happy Ive chosen this one, and even though Ive gotten this through the Vine program, the real expense is  going to come in the cartridges. The bottom line is that if I didnt already use my R1900 Epson photo printer regularly, I wouldnt have been so eager to match it up with another Epson, since buying cartridges for one brand will be easier than for two. But if that doesnt matter to you, Ive seen comparable all-in-ones for $100 or so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RADTXM9T6RGU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5XSS#wasThisHelpful","RADTXM9T6RGU9","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The way to read this book is put on a white sleeveless undershirt, make your room look like an old tenement apartment (with an old rotating fan), and have a can of beer in one hand and The Girl with the Deep Blue Eyes (preferably the girl, not the novel--but the novel will have to do), while you get involved in a hard-boiled mystery featuring Doak Miller, a retired NYPD cop, now living in Florida, who has seen it all and done it all, but still has enough life in him to do some more. He drives a beat-up Monte Carlo, but knows how to surf the internet for research as a part-time P.I. He lives in a house with a dock, where he looks out on the sunset, but the idea of owning a boat or going fishing are as foreign to him as becoming an astronaut.He can get down with the local law authorities, and adapt his mood, accent, and style for whatever the occasion calls for.  He doesn't seem like a particularly slick character until about seventy pages in, when you realize he knows how to stay a step ahead of people that think they're staying a step ahead of him.There's a lot of twists and turns to the plot, and lots of semi-kinky contemporary sex scenes that wouldn't have gotten by the censor's axe 'back in the day.' But that just adds some spice to a typically hard-boiled novel (or a black and blue done steak).L. Block can  suit the action to the word, the word to the action, whether it's a serious, troubled character like Matt Scudder, or an ironic, educated one, like Bernie the Burglar.If you like the writings of Lawrence Block, you won't be disappointed. Not that it is necessarily the best novel he's written--the plot line borders on plausibility, but manages to stay within the genre's orbit.  A good novel by Mr. Block is a top-notch novel by any of the other mystery writers out there. And a four-star rating of one of his novels should translate into a 5-star one for just about anyone else.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31NVJWMY4I4TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783297506#wasThisHelpful","R31NVJWMY4I4TQ","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just happened to be scrolling through some creative writing books, when my eyes fell upon this one: I read it about ten years ago, and it's hard to believe that not only is it still being sold, but it's popular as well.Bottom line, this is a silly, self-indulgent book, and won't help you write.  It is like an inspirational book that one reads; ponders; feels good about, and a week later, one asks, ""Why did I waste my time reading that dumb book.""  You can judge a book by its title, sometimes, and the title is as pretentious as the advice provided by the author.  Do you need to know what you call that metal harness that keeps a wine bottle cork firmly attached to the bottle?  As a writer, you need to know stuff like that, so the author made a wise choice and called up a local monastery that made wine, and was informed the item in question is called a ""bonnet.""  Yes, you too can learn such profound tips about the writing life. You see, it's actually hard work.

"I have read dozens of books on creative writing, and I would place Gardner's The Art of Fiction at the top of the list, provided, that is, you already understand the basic components of fiction, and have already done some fiction writing of your own--published or otherwise.Gardner manages to dissect the soul of writing, not just the technique of writing, and that is the great strength of this book. However, without a basic education based on critical reading, and an attempt at developing your own writing talents, this book is perhaps a step too far, and I'd wait until one has mastered the basic tenets of fiction writing such as plot, character, voice, setting, descriptive writing, etc.But listing the elements of fiction is exactly what this book doesn't do. Rather, Gardner's grand plan is to review some of these elements in the service of understanding fiction writing holistically.  The book will teach you how to 'x-ray' your own writing and that of others.jNo other book has done this as far as I know.  The only persons that wouldn't benefit from this book would be those that already know the art of fiction thoroughly--but I don't suppose you'd know that until you read the book","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AKEEL8HDVYEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0679734031#wasThisHelpful","R1AKEEL8HDVYEQ","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Harold Bloom has read a huge number of books, and has a vast vocabulary, but I don't think he is a good writer. His phrasings are often awkward, and he has a difficult time expressing himself. I attribute these qualities, in part, to his feeling betrayed or terribly disappointed by the way academia has decided to make works of literature case studies in cultural bias, patriarchy, and gender/sexual orientation. Additionally, I think he over represents this influence. It just happens to be that people that get to be the avatars of academic literary studies get the most attention within the field (that really should be reworded as ""industry.""Of course, the academics he derides are full of sh_t. The humanities variety go into the field because as Jorge Amado states in his novel 'Tent of Miracle,"" they want a pleasant and easy life (I haven't met any that volunteer in homeless shelters, or go to third world countries and actually do some labor). But instead of lamenting over and over again about these myrmidons, Bloom should just ignore the academic types he seems obsessed with denouncing. He doesn't owe anyone an apology for his ""reading project."" He has tenure, after all. Why not just tell them all to go f__k  themselves and be done with it.One consequence of his obsession is his seeming need to restore literature to its traditional role as the highest form of a particular aesthetic by presenting his interpretations in a dogmatic way. At the same time, he claims that you must read literature with an open mind, so that it is meaningful for the individual: a contradiction, it seems to me.So even if we start seeing courses like ""Dwarf Literature"" featuring Aesop and Randolph Bourne, or ""Blind Studies"" featuring Milton and Borges, there's no reason to lament. Bloom's lamentations remind me of someone who religiously watches a TV show, and constantly complains how bad it is.If Bloom just turned the channel, there might not be as much noise in his head that degrades his writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIYR2IVTT7HJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0684859076#wasThisHelpful","RIYR2IVTT7HJP","A1SAZB83QFR0W2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1SAZB83QFR0W2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really wanted to like this book, and I did to some extent, but it could have been better. I think Ron Perlman is an actor that truly considers acting an art and a craft. Unfortunately, he doesn't mention much of his acting method in the book--not that he had to, or that you can really explain acting technique in words--but some mention would be nice.Ron is brutally honest in his assessments and reflections, which is good. He had to overcome a lot of obstacles to become successful.  The major obstacle is that the movie business is so 'f---d"" up that it had a hard time figuring out what ""type"" the actor was. But they complaining gets tiring after a while, since he will describe someone as ""This F----g guy had the nerve... or ""You want me to travel 500 miles for an audition for your ""f____g"" stupid movie? Are you ""f____g"" kidding me, you dumb f__k.""  It's clear that Ron has a lot of things to feel angry about, but what does he expect from a business that dresses itself up as an ""art form"" You know the old saying, ""It's called ""show business"" not ""show art"" for a reason.He's definitely correct. Lot's of the people he meets are real ""fuc....ers"" and lot of the situations he finds himself in are ""f----d up."" And worse, the ""fuc___g public"" doesn't know what the ""f__K"" is good or not good.Albeit some of the writing is actually good and articulate, but at times I got the feeling the memoir was more a therapeutic exercise than a presentation of self.I know the world that Ron Perlman is writing about, all the way back to Arrabal on Off-Broadway, and I also saw him in the original stage production of ""A few good men.""Overall, though, this memoir contributes to understanding what the 'glamorous' world of movies & TV.Ron seems to have the philosophy that ""everyone I meet is an ""A--hole"" until proven otherwise.  That's a legitimate philosophy. It's just that this ""f---king"" interesting guy who describes how ""f___d"" up things are, wrote a ""fu_king"" bad book.

"I have been using Panasonic shavers for years. In particular, I have been using a similar shaver for four years: Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head and Automatic Cleaning System for Men . Therefore, I can write a bit about durability. The old shaver still works great. It does not shave quite as closely as the new shaver (under review here) but it is still better than any shaver I know of. It is also possible that the new shaver is simply better, but I doubt it. Both shavers use the same ""Arc5"" blade system, and judging by the sound they make, both shavers have motors that operate at the same speed. Both shavers leave me free of skin irritation. The battery in the old shaver is still strong, it lasts me at least two weeks with daily use. It looks great too. One problem with the old shaver: the cleaning machine stopped working after a few years. But guess what: the new shaver does not feature a cleaning machine.Every Panasonic shaver I have owned has had a terrible pop-up trimmer, so I was not expecting much from the new shaver. But lo and behold, the trimmer on the new shaver is killer! It mowed the hair around my ears like crazy. Thanks Panasonic!I need to write a bit about the replacement blade kit. it is expensive! I replace mine once a year, and when I do, I get a faster shave. This indicates that I could replace  the blades more frequently. If the cost is an issue for you, you can consider a Panasonic shaver that uses the Arc4 or Arc3 blade system. Less expensive, and still better than the competition.The shaver is water proof. I use it dry, but I use a dilute solution of dish detergent to clean the shaver when it gets grubby. So easy! Unlike other shavers, this one is not *partially* water proof, it is simply water proof. I don't have to coddle it when I am cleaning it. I rinse it off in running water.I have included pictures of the old and new shavers in this review. Frankly, I prefer the look of the old shaver. Its plastic parts are all an honest black. The new shaver features silver colored plastic and it looks phony. I don't know if the silver color will wear off, or if it goes all the way through. The new shaver has a flashier LED display that does nothing for me. Finally, the new shaver has a new feature ""shaving sensor mode"" that varies the speed of the shaver motor in response to beard conditions. I think it is bogus. This feature can't make the motor go any faster, all it can do is slow down the motor for a while. Perhaps this improves battery life, or reduces wear, I don't know. The instruction booklet is no help. Because of the new feature, the power button has three stops ""off,"" ""sensor,"" and ""normal"" as opposed to the two stops ""off"" and ""on"" of the old shaver. Guess which arrangement I prefer. The new shaver features a modern grip-textured plastic on the back side that I like. The old shaver is made of glossy plastic throughout. Although I prefer the looks of the old shaver, the surface of the new shaver is a functional improvement.If I could find a shaver that is more durable, effective or quick than the Panasonics, I would buy it. I don't expect to find one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26WSYYEI7U12V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JWP8F3I#wasThisHelpful","R26WSYYEI7U12V","A2PR5G1680ISEY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PR5G1680ISEY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summary: very nice insulated bottle, I find little to complain about.I filled the bottle with water from my refrigerator (cold) and put the bottle in my car with me. After two hours, the water was still pleasantly cool. For the rest of the day, the bottle lay on its side and did not leak. Good.The bottle fit (barely) in my car's cup holder and so it is a perfect size. For me, anyway.The cap ""hinge"" is of a good design in that it is thick and strong, but gimbals out of the way when you are ready to take a drink.The amount of plastic that comes in contact with your liquids is small. If the bottle is upright, the amount of contact is zero. Hence, no polluted taste. The stainless steel is inert.I appreciate that the plastic bits can all be unscrewed for cleaning. I did NOT appreciate the manufacturer's advice to keep the water bottle out of my dish washer. I dish-washed the bottle anyway and I do not find any damage. I will continue to do so and if I find any damage, I will take off a star. I don't love my water bottle enough to hand-wash it. It might be better to choose the unpainted version of this bottle.

"I am going to compare this drive to SanDisk Ultra Fit CZ43 32GB USB 3.0 Low-Profile Flash Drive Up To 130MB/s Read- SDCZ43-032G-G46, to which it bears a strong resemblance.

The Samsung drive has some holes in the plastic which might be for an LED. However my drive did not light up at all.I have attached Crystal disk reports for both drives. The Samsung is faster in some categories, the Sandisk is faster in others.One advantage that the Samsung drive has is that it does NOT become blazingly hot during use. The Sandisk drive certainly does.I cannot find a flaw or potential failure point on either of these tiny devices.The Samsung drive actually looks nicer. The metal USB part of the Sandisk drive has a soldered seam on it, which is almost universal to USB connectors on cables and flash drives.

At the other extreme, you could use this one: rooCase Apple MacBook Air MC234LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop Carrying Case - Dark Blue / Black Deluxe Bag . It will carry your power supply, mouse, spare cables, and lots of other stuff. It also has a handle and a shoulder strap.This Case Logic sleeve fits right in the middle. If you only carry your notebook computer and some flat items, it will look great. My attached photos show how it looks holding HP's reasonably small power supply. Lumpy, but it works.I really like this sleeve. The main zipper wraps around a corner and that makes putting your computer in and out more graceful.

"This review is a joint effort with my wife.The main function of this gadget is depilation and that is no laughing matter. Talk about pain! But this gadget does it very well. Using it with liquid soap adds a small amount of comfort, but we tested this both wet and dry. In spite of the pain, we never experienced any bloodshed. Impressive. To be sure, we experienced red skin galore. But that went away. Quite effective, but we did resort to tweezers to finish off a few surviving hairs.The gadget includes a shaver head that you can swap in. It is a joke. It is vastly inferior to Panasonic shavers for men. I would recommend this one: Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Nanotech Blades for Men. Both the epilator and the shaver have a pop-up trimmer feature. They are both awful. Be aware, Panasonic shavers are mostly great, but their pop-up trimmers are all terrible.I am a bit concerned about the drive mechanism of this gadget. It is visible when swapping out the epilator head and the shaver head. The mechanism is plastic and it does not look robust at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCCZJZGKT7Z9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PQIE#wasThisHelpful","RCCZJZGKT7Z9C","A2PR5G1680ISEY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PR5G1680ISEY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My owl has been using a dense, white lotion on her skin for many years. This is a task that repeats at least once a day, every day. We tried this product in the hope that the spray applicator would save time.It worked. Spraying this directly on the skin and rubbing it in is faster than scooping the white lotion from a jar and spreading it. A disadvantage: you really should not use this spray near your carpets. The sprayer is decent, but mistakes happen.We found this oil to be pleasant. It makes my owl's skin look and feel nice. We also found the scent to be too strong for us. It is not an unusually strong scent, but it interferes with a cologne that my owl likes very much.Ultimately, the white lotion won out over this oil.

"The 11"" model is a good fit for an 11"" Macbook Air. The hooks and straps that secure the Macbook in place do a good job. There is no interference with keyboard, trackpad, or display. When the sleeve is zipped up, the Macbook does not rattle around inside.Quality appears to be good: zippers work. Handles are securely attached. The stiff body of the sleeve provides protection, as advertised.Be aware that there is absolutely no space to store a power cord or a mouse. Zero.I did encounter a problem. The idea of this sleeve is that you can unzip it, unfold your computer, and go to work. I find that the weight of the sleeve pulls my Macbook open more than I would like. I could solve this problem by detaching the upper half of the sleeve from my Macbook. But that rather defeats the purpose of the sleeve, doesn't it?

"I don't believe that it would be possible to make this cleaner any easier to use. That's really important for me. I have a two-piece rug cleaner that has sat undisturbed for TEN YEARS. Too much trouble to use. By contrast, the Hoover invites use.Initial assembly was easy. If you follow the instructions, you can extract the machine from its shipping box without lifting it. Rather, you turn the box sideways and slide everything out. Two large pieces needed to be fit together and secured with two bolts and two nuts. If you have a philips screwdriver handy, you can have it done in five minutes.The input and output tanks are both removable. You carry them to a sink or bathtub for filling and emptying. I found that I was able to do this without spillage. I did use a rag to wipe the tanks in my bathroom. That helped. There is a measuring cup for detergent, and you won't lose it. It is also the cap to the input tank. Both tanks have lids, which prevents spills during filling and emptying.The machine is a bit larger than an upright vacuum cleaner. Because it is itself an upright, storage is convenient. The power cord is long enough. You will run out of cleaning solution before you run out of cord.In use, the machine is rather good. I quickly settled into the rhythm of wet and dry strokes. The machine is somewhat heavy, so the best approach is to push and pull slowly. No sense in tiring yourself out. If you watch your posture, you can clean a lot of rug without hurting your back. It would be nice if Hoover included a steering mechanism. Turning the machine to start a stroke on a new piece of rug is a bit of work.I went for two tankfuls and got my dining area and living room clean. These are small rooms, you might need a tank and a half for a nice living room. I did not do a clean water rinse because I am lazy. I got a lot of filth out, and the rug does not feel at all sticky from the detergent. Perhaps rinsing is not necessary.Now I need to talk about durability. I don't have the luxury of waiting six months or a year to write this review, so take this with a grain of salt. This is an all plastic machine. The visible parts are thick plastic, including the crucial input and output tanks. If you are gentle with the machine, you might get a long service life. I am not impressed with the controls. The control for brush speed is especially suspicious. It is cheap, sloppy, and awful. The power switch and the spray trigger are not awful, but they do not inspire confidence. I am concerned.Overall, I like this machine. It is maximally easy to set up, use, and stow afterwards. It is about as lightweight as it could be. It might not last forever, but the price I saw today is still a good value. I surprised my owl by cleaning some rugs while she was out. She was appreciative, and when I promised to do some more rooms she was pleased. Go for it, and make your bird happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1697SSTO6C6RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I9X4#wasThisHelpful","R1697SSTO6C6RN","A2PR5G1680ISEY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PR5G1680ISEY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use this device on a 5 GHz network that provides a strong signal. Mostly, I have used Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon. In my testing, video delivery is very good. If you have a fast enough internet connection, you can see some really beautiful video with this device.The user interface is OK, it took me about an hour to get used to it. The software has been completely stable in my testing. The remote is small, but very easy to use. Using the remote and watching Roku on my TV, I experience good response time and no quirks and bugs, with one exception that I will detail below. In spite of the exception, this is a huge step forward for living room network gear. Thank you Roku!The Roku does a bit of power management. There is no on/off switch. The device is always ready to serve. There is a power-saving feature though. The device goes to sleep after a period of non-use. The sleep/wake state is indicated by an LED on the front panel, so you know what's going on. The box stays warm when it is in the sleep state, which means that it is still using a fair amount of power.Sometimes the Roku becomes unresponsive when I am watching a movie. I push buttons on the remote, and the LED on the box blinks its acknowledgement. But nothing happens. This problem might be correlated with high bitrate movies. I get this problem while watching the Netflix series _Marco Polo_. I get this problem 100% of the time when I launch the Go-Pro channel, which displays high quality video immediately on launch.This problem is annoying. It is unacceptable in a living room device. On a peecee, maybe. But not in the living room.I find issues with the web browser interface, the IOS (iPhone) app, and the Android app. These items are potentially very useful. Entering text with a remote is very unpleasant, and sometimes it has to be done. Think: passwords, searching, and so forth. Wouldn't it be sweet to use a peecee or iPhone for typing?The web browser interface starts off great. This is the easiest way to enter PINs and add channels to Roku's home screen. But guess what. After I effortlessly performed these steps, there was no result on the Roku! The web browser interface is fake.The IOS app has potential, but it loses contact with Roku, constantly. The Android app has the same problem. These are both simply unusable.Finally, I am not happy about providing a credit card number to Roku. I believe that it is a security risk.

I tried to pair with two computers that only have Bluetooth 2.0. No dice. I did pair the mouse with two new-ish computers, and that went smoothly.This mouse is *thin*. Great for traveling with your elegantly thin notebook computer. On the other hand, a thin mouse is not ergonomic.

It looks great to me, and it does not feel slippery.The battery door is cool too. It secures with (hidden) magnets. You push down on one side (marked) and it tilts off the mouse, effortlessly.I am a bit miffed that Bluetooth 2.0 is not supported. I do not perceive any advantage to Bluetooth 4.0 in this mouse.

I have attached CrystalDiskMark scores for this drive, and another drive ""Silicon Power 32GB Jewel J80 USB 3.0 Flash Drive, Titanium (SP032GBUF3J80V1T)"" that costs the same, as of this writing.

"Works well but has a slight audible buzz, especially when lights are dimmed. Does not require a neutral wire and remains energized when switched off by running a a few milliamps through the load. This current running through the load while switched off can cause an LED bulb to be dimly lit while the switch is off--not enough to make a good night light but enough to see that the bulb is lit. If you have a number of LED type bulbs in parallel such as recessed ceiling lights, probably only one will be dimly lit. This doesn't harm anything but it can be confusing if you are not expecting it.Big plus: You can manually turn off lights by pressing the button--so unit could be used, for example, in bedroom.Holding the button allows dimming/brightening. The dimming works well with LED bulbs labelled as dimmable.If used with a 3-way switch then you have to wire the 3-way in a particular way so that the IPVD6 feeds the line to the load and the the 3-way works as a trigger for the IPDV6. The 3-way switch can turn lights on but won't always manually turn lights off.

"If you go through the reviews on this site and others you will find that all clips get complaints that they are too tight for some and too loose for others. That's how steel clips are, the range of material thickness with which they work well is relatively narrow.You can easily double the range by folding a smaller number of bills in half before you put them in the clip and for a larger number of bills, fold them in half after you insert them in the clip. If that doesn't work for you, then money clips probably are not for you, consider alternatives.folding them afterwards .  the ledovi sc15 works well with about five to up to ten layers of money--ten bills folded before inserting (twenty bills if folded after.)the sc25 works better for 20(40) bills.the SC15 is a thicker metal stock and I can't see this thing ever wearing out. It helps to loosen it it up a tad by spreading with a screwdriver blade....careful, a little spreading can make a big diff.If you have about 15 or so bills, they are hard to slide in or out. If you get down to say, four bills, they won't hold very well and tend to fall out. So if you plan to always carry about ten bills, then this clip works great.The finish on the metal is done well and the cuts and bends are even.For me it ended up being inexpensive but a disappointment. Other clips I've tried also had the tension issue except  for one. Pardon the ""ad"" but I don't work for or have any connection to the company. I'm just impressed with the product:Although very expensive, the Viper Titanium and mini-Viper Titanium clips have adequate tension yet can be expanded to hold up to a 1/4 or so of materials--the large size can hold 3/4 inch and then still hold a just a single piece of paper. Bills slide in and out easily -- best clip I've found--it does exactly what you want a clip to to-- hold varying amounts of bills and always slide money in/out easily while holding bills together in your pocket. They hold their shape and don't need an excessive amount of tension to do so.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSEK4BOR5DQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV5YT5G#wasThisHelpful","R3FSEK4BOR5DQ5","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a scalled donw in size version of the well known Redwing 50. This is possibly a best in class for this size bag. Compared to the 50-, it has all the same features except the load adjuster straps on top of the shorlder straps -- they would not be as useful on this smaller bag.32 litres is large enough for small trips, an overnight, or commuting with lots of items. I was able to compare to  Thule's meager choices and North Face's ReCon (29 litres). The Recon is slightly smaller and has a few less features but is equally well made and fairly priced and worth considering.In bags this size I would like a PADDED section for electronic tablets/laptops--this and most backpacks have non-padded or barely padded sections fro laptops or tablets. I would also like a zip-in-place or snap-in-place flap inside the bag to help divide/organize items -- most bags don't have that feature unless they are specifically for commuting and not hiking, camping, etc.The stitiching is even with no dropped stiches that I could find; very nice work compared to some of the commercial sewing done these days. Flat felt seaming along zippers is done evenly on tight seam margins. The fabrics are sturdy.  The maker warns that soaking in water can damage fabric coatings and wet wiping is the recommended cleaning method. No machine washing for this bag.If you never had a bag with a carry handle before, once you use one you won't buy a bag without one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSE00073M6551/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6KUADK#wasThisHelpful","RSE00073M6551","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on price get the bundle for the body, lenses, and filters; the rest of the stuff is serviceable but cheap stuff you would never choose to buy individually. This is the case with most of these camera bundles.Shop around, this bundle can be a bargain despite all the throwaway items.The bag works but is small and the stitching cockeyed and uneven. The flash is bottom of the line but comes with a mounting bar that's useful.The macro and telephoto ""lenses"" are really adapters you put on front of your regular lens. They work but add a lot of distortion. You're better off just digitally zooming a pic than using the telephoto adapter.Mem card is rated 40mbp, (that's read speed--write speed is always slower); it's about half the speed you want for HD video. OK for photos if you don't mind a bit of a lag between shots.And so it is much the same for the rest..So forget all the stuff and buy based on the price for the body, AF/STM lenses and the filters.The t6s is Canon's best Rebel so far. Not the fastest, or sharpest but a relatively easy to use camera that is functionally robust. It has very good reviews of digi cam web sites. And for the money, it's one to consider for DSLR.The 18-135mm lens is a very good canon lens. quiet, reasonably fast and good re distortion when not at the extremes. Early rebels came with a narrower range lens and you'll find this one versatile enough that you will use this lens most if not all of the time.The longer range telephoto is lightly lower in quality but still very useful when you need to pull in a shot that's just too far away for the 10-135mm lens.

"These cables a reasonably good for the money. If you want to step up from the $1.89 cables at RadioShack because you find the resistance too high, the insulation too thin, or the wire too thin, the these are the next step up before you start paying I-don't-care-what-it-costs prices.These have a woven sheath that makes the cable thick and very stiff. IF the temperature of above 70 degrees F, the cables are midly stiff and get more flexible ans the temperature rises. If the temp gets lower, they become very stiff. At 50 degrees or so, they are annoyingly if not unworkably stiff. They are suitable for use, therefore, indoors but not in a car.  It's rare to find cables this stiff. Otoh, they appear to be quite durable, the sheath offering a lot of protection against abrasions and minor sharp edges.The plugs unscrew easily and you would be wise to open them and apply a tiny bit of Loctite blue.  This is not an uncommon issue with Monstercable plugs.The outer ring on the plugs can be tight, but there are sufficient slits to allow for some slight flexibility.

"This has some ferrite rings with coils on them to filter out certain frequencies, some metal oxide varistors to provide surge protection ( they short out the circuit to ground if there is a voltage surge above a certain level--the are sacrificial parts), and a transformer with multiple taps to provide voltage regulation. Basically, if the voltage is too low or high, a relay changes to a transformer tap that boosts or lowers the output voltage relative to the input. This does not give 120V at every input voltage. The output voltages are shown below as a function of input voltages for the rated input range of the device. The values shown are nominal +/- 3 volts so actual out can range from 100 Volt to 130 volts.The sacrificial MOVs are an inexpensive way to provide surge protection. Non-sacrificial method would be to dump the surge voltage through a massive coil, which costs much more than MOVs. Unfortunately you can't tell when the MOVs are shot show you should replace the unit every year or so.Input______OutputVoltage____Voltage87_______103.35688_______104.54489_______105.73290_______106.9291_______108.10892_______109.29693_______110.48494_______111.67295_______112.8696_______114.04897_______115.23698_______116.42499_______117.612100______118.8101______119.988102______111.078103______112.167104______113.256105______114.345106______115.434107______116.523108______117.612109______118.701110______119.79111______120.879112______121.968113______113114______114115______115116______116117______117118______118119______119120______120121______121122______122.0123______123.0124______124.0125______125.0126______126.0127______127.0128______128.0129______116.6130______117.5131______118.4132______119.3133______120.2134______121.1135______122.0136______122.9137______123.8138______124.8139______125.7140______126.6These values are nominal +/- 3 volts so actual out can range from 100 Volt to 130 volts.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11ORP48989A3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000512LA#wasThisHelpful","R11ORP48989A3I","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This item is slow to charge yet it depletes quickly.With the Maxboost Electron Plus starting at 100% charged and the IPad 4 at 28% charged, after 6 hours, the IPad was at 56% charged and the Maxboost was at 7%.To return the Maxboost to 100% charge on a 2amp output charger took over 10 hours.A good rule of thumb is that a charger made of batteries will charge another device that is rated for half as many mAH (milliamp hours). If the device to be charged is rated at 100 mAHs, then you need an external battery of at least 200 mAHs. The Maxboost Electron Plus more or less fits within that rule. I wouldn't expect it to fully charge an IPad 4 battery, which is rated at about 11500 mAHs. But I would expect it to do a little better than charging it form 28% to 57% before being itself nearly depleted.

"Okay for the money. A number of people have said that this feels solid. It could be they are feeling the heft of the several pairs of transformers inside the box. Transformers balance impedance and allow attenuating volume. The volume control knobs click in steps--each step is a diffrent tap on a transformer. So far, so good. I wouldn't overload this unit or you will saturate the transformers and get distortion to beat the band.The output connectors are kind of cheaply awful--lugs or larger crimp connectors would have been better. Each connector  has a small set screw to hold a bare wire stub, or better yet, one tinned with solder. Each wire connection is very close to one or two others (8 on each 2"" connector strip), so be careful no bare wire is sticking out or you can short your receiver/amplifier outputs. A short would likely turn your revceiver/amp into a brick.The output connectors are attached directly to the single circuit board in the box and, if you nudge the box much, then the weight and stiffness of the speaker wires can pull on the connectors enough to disconnect the connector strip from the board inside the box. You can pop it back in place but it's not something you will want to mess with. So, once you are all set up, don't move the box around or you can suddenly lose sound in one or more channels.This isn't a bad box for the money.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R222QPBBGRNGIZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007N43T5Y#wasThisHelpful","R222QPBBGRNGIZ","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very nicely, accurately sized and shaped glass screen cover. The cutouts are placed accurately. It does not interfere with use of the phone and, if it does get scratched, it's much easier and cheaper to replace the glass cover than to get a new phone screen.Installation is very easy. The cover comes with a backing film on it that has two ears or tabs sticking out on either side. You can hold the cover by holding the tabs and not have to touch the glass -- so no fingerprints when you install.You position the cover by holding the tabs of a backing film that removes easily when the cover is in place. Just follow the directions steps by step.Cleaner fluid, cleaning clot, and clear and simple instructions are provided to ease installation.The feel of the tempered glass cover is the same as the original screen and doesn't add friction the way plastic covers do. Plus the glass cover is much harder to scratch. I used to replace plastic covers about once per month. Glass screens have no visible wear after months of use.The vendor provide the unit to me for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HKF2MCJQW21X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ99YB4#wasThisHelpful","R1HKF2MCJQW21X","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good quality. This hose has qood quality fittings made of brass. The tubing inside the metal wrapping is not the expanding, stretchable type that some similar showers hoses have. This has a stiffer vinyl tubing. I find the stretchable hoses, with the rubber tubing tend to break sooner, usually rupturing at the points of stress, near the fittings.The fitting on showerhead end of the hose is a standard depth but might be too deep for a few showerheads that  don't have a long enough threaded end. In that case use an extra washer, not Teflon tape.I recommend against using Teflon tape with hose fittings. Hose fittings don't seal at the threads; they seal at the mating surfaces that that face the washer. If you don't have a good seal, these surfaces are not parallel and securely pressed against each other. Adding Teflon tape will cause the threads to bind and they might bind before the sealing surfaces are brought fully together--this can keep the washer from sealing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394TXCFVYZHYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004M4336I#wasThisHelpful","R394TXCFVYZHYU","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very good product at a good price. There are lots of portable USB chargers on the market. Some you can buy in convenience stores for a few bucks.  But I wouldn't trust the cheap chargers. A good charger is one you can use confident that it will not start a fire or cause your battery to explode.  The New Trent is a good charger.A USB charger has to handshake with the device to be charged. That is, they trade some info back and forth and the charging rate is established. Charging a lithium battery too quickly or too much, then the battery can explode. Lithium battery devices contain circuits to prevent overcharging. I trust the New Trent not to overcharge.Some batteries will charge more quickly than others because some will accept the higher amperage offered by the New Trent, some will not. Because some batteries are designed not to accept the higher amperage, they will not charge faster than with a standard USB 2 or USB 3 charger (.5 amps and .9 amps respectively). There is nothing you can do about thatits the batteries, not the charger. But most will charge faster. Those that accept the higher amperage will cause the charger to get warmer, but I haven't found it to get hot. This is a sign that it is well designed to handle the heat it develops.It is somewhat larger than other portable USB chargers but I suspect this is partly how it handles heat better than other 2.4 amp chargers. It contains two ports, so it ends up using less space than two chargers on a power strip. It appears solidly constructed, with neat, even seams, no molding cast outs, or loose parts. The plug snaps firmly into open and closed position --a weakness on many other retractable plugs.Bad points: The labeling of the ports is tiny and the ink is faint gray, so it is hard to read except in very good lighting conditions. If you buy one of these, get a sharpee oil paint (mark on anything marker -- http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SYVP50?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) and mark the outlets so they are readable.There is no pilot light to indicate charging or that the unit is conect to power, which might matter to some folks, especlially with a twenty dollar charger..The vendor provided the unit to me for reivew.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OGEDAU2BKIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7F15QO#wasThisHelpful","R25OGEDAU2BKIV","A3E3EQ39FZTZEK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E3EQ39FZTZEK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the Amazon vendor the hat arrived well crushed and creased but direct for Tilley, stuffed with tissue, carefully padded and then wrapped again in tiussue and in a properly szed box,a it arrives somewhat crushed and creased.  It's not for formal wear but you can get the worst bends and creases out using a steamer or steam iron, after which the hat looks liek casual comfort. To steam, stuff the crown with a large towel, the helps to hold shape and give you something to hold onto while steaming.  A few minutes is all it takes.I found the fit slightly small so order a 1/8 up from your usual size--the hat should not be a tight fit--it shouldn't squeeze your head. Tilley says be able to fit two fingers between the hat band and your forehead. I expect it to wear very well like Tilley's do.The flaps are helpful but not as good as ear muffs or a knit wool cap pulled over your ears.

"I give this a 5 star! Dr. Christianson was kind enough to send me an advanced copy prior to a podcast we did this past fall. I found The Adrenal Reset Diet to be the biggest breakthrough in adrenal and hormone health yet. Dr. Christianson shares shocking science that many people may not know: imbalanced cortisol rhythms are a strong predictor of an early death (even more so than obesity and smoking).Thankfully, Dr. C provides step-by-step lifestyle tools that help you reclaim the health of your adrenals, metabolism, and cortisol rhythms.You'll learn advanced tactics for nutrition and meal timing, carbohydrate cycling, stress reduction, exercise programming, and how to get the best sleep ever.Dr. C cuts through the noise when it comes to nutritionally supporting the adrenal glands with dietary supplements and real food. (Many companies provide kitchen sink adrenal formulas with herbs and glandular products that counteract one another.)The biggest discoveries for me were the progressive muscle relaxation strategies and bedroom light tips discussed in the book; they have really helped my wife and me to luxuriate in deeper and more restful sleep.If you implement the concepts in this book you'll lose weight, increase daytime energy, strengthen mental focus, open up sexual drive, and sleep better!

"I really resonate with Brenda's overall message: digestive health and the type of bacteria in our intestines must be addressed if we're going to successfully lose weight and keep it off. Even more, the ""gut factor,"" as Brenda has tagged it, is honestly the foundation for whole-body health. This is no longer a proposition; it is an essential understanding of the functionality of the human body, backed by a vast amount of reliable quantitative and qualitative research.Brenda shares personal lessons that she learned from the experience of restoring her digestion and gut health after long-term exposure to antibiotics and medications. She includes charts and diagrams that will help you evaluate the state of your own gut health (and ""inner ecosystem""), and she supplies ample success stories along the way to support you in your quest to reclaim your health.Each chapter has a summary and action steps that you can implement right away to reclaim control of your gut and, ultimately, your health.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23XZ95P5NKOEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KAFXA5C#wasThisHelpful","R23XZ95P5NKOEP","A2TKX1EU5IT5P2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TKX1EU5IT5P2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although our family eats a diet rich in nuts/seeds, lean protein, and locally grown vegetables and fruits, we found Dr. Perlmutter's recipe book to be very informative. I gained a lot of new ideas from the many soup, sauted greens, and grilled vegetable recipes that we've already started to make in our kitchen. (It's easy to get in a rut in the kitchen and eat the same old stuff, but this book will help anyone, at any culinary level, clean up AND spice up their diet with some fresh recipe concepts.)While many recipe books can be intimating due to the amount of shopping time, prep, pre-cooking, and heating, The Grain Brain Cookbook: More Than 150 Life-Changing Gluten-Free Recipes to Transform Your Health calls for a minimum of fresh ingredients and preparation. Another great aspect is that each recipe includes the nutritional profile (calories, fats, carbs, fiber, and protein, etc) of each ingredient.I tend to cook fish the same way every time (butter, garlic, and lemon juice), but thankfully I now have tons of options to choose from. The same goes for meats.I think families will resonate with the chapter about snacks. We gathered a bunch of great ideas from that chapter as well.Last but not least, Dr. Perlmutter reminds us about the key takeaways from his bestselling book, Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth about Wheat, Carbs,  and Sugar--Your Brain's Silent Killers inflammation is the root cause of all dis-ease, and the processed foods so pervasive in our diet today ignite a smoldering fire in our bodies and brains. When this low-grade fire starts in the brain, it may go unnoticed until it's too late. As such, Dr. Perlmutter reminds us that everyone, including children, need to start making better food choices right now.Thankfully we now have the practical tools to do so, and the recipes are congruent with this anti-inflammatory theme: rich in healthy fats and inflammation-busting herbs, spices, and vegetables.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJN5625DD6X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ2N0DE#wasThisHelpful","R3BJN5625DD6X4","A2TKX1EU5IT5P2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2TKX1EU5IT5P2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dr. Raphael Kellman does a great job exploring the importance of the forgotten metabolic organ inside our body: the microbiome. He provides the science that will convince you to stop the calorie, carb, and fat counting!Instead, Dr. Kellman suggests a better approach: a diet that is healthy for your gut AND gut microbiome. I couldn't agree more! He also discusses how eating Western foods (sugar, grains, soy, gluten, processed fats, and dairy) can activate the immune system and lead to cravings, inflammation, and fat storage.I really like how Dr. Kellman reveals simple strategies and food choices that we can all incorporate to improve the health of our microbiome, including herbs, spices, and lesser-known foods that have prebiotics to feed our good bacteria.Last but not least, I found chapters 7 and 8 to be most informative about stress.

"Im so impressed by this author! What a fresh writing style. Unfortunate Souls (Book 1) by Jade M. Phillips, starts with a breathless description of death that is both riveting and disturbing. Do you know what dying feels like? I do. And believe me, it is not something I would recommend. And she goes on to describe the coldness of it that actually made me reach for a sweatshirt. It unfolds into an incredible paranormal story. The author writes in such a way that everything seems real, everything as if you were there . . . really amazing. Cant wait to read more.

"Warning these books are addicting  fortunately, she has written at least a dozen of them! Murder At The Bed & Breakfast: A Liz Lucas Cozy Mystery, by Dianne Harman, is one of the best! The first paragraph of the prologue ends with the line. . . . a person wearing a ski mask dressed entirely in black barged into the room. Ive adored all these books. The author takes us to so many wonderful locations. Relaxing and warmly described filled with ordinary and friendly people we feel like we know  the occasional rogue and, of course the killer, too. She sets up the perfect atmosphere for us to want to figure out who did it. Clever and crafty. Everyone who has read her other books will be happy for this new addition and anyone who likes cozy mysteries or a great story will enjoy this and any of Harmans book. Highly recommended.

"This is one of those books that is so engrossing you just want it to keep going, so I was very happy to see its a series of four books  and I plan to read them all. The CULL - Bloodline, by Eric J.

"Heavy issues handled with care and humor. Abbie, with her authentic been around the block tender-toughness, immediately enders herself to the reader. Beyond the Pale by C Michelle McCarty, is a more than a family saga, its a finally woven story filled with true characters that touches you. I particularly liked the cast of characters from the trailer park. Some make you laugh, (Russell) and some annoy you (Doug) but they all make for a very entertaining read. My favorite dynamic was the relationship between Abbie and her son, Mick. This is a wonderful story. Highly recommended.

If circumstances were different, hed rank amongst the most prolific serial killers of the twenty-first century. He grabs you from the first line and never lets you catch your breath. Full Disclosure by Eric J. Gates, is another masterful thriller. Great scene of a frustrated US President really gives us the stakes.

"I so loved the first book in the series, The Clay Lion and Tin Men (The Clay Lion Series Book 2) by Amalie Jahn, is equally as wonderful. Charlie is a skillfully drawn character and his story is captivating. The author has created an intriguing time travel romance that engages the reader. She uses mystery and emotional threads in her telling of what really is a beautiful story with plenty of suspense:  When I snooped, I found only locked doors and empty files. My parents kept a secret from me my entire life. And it was finally time to find out the truth.I like how the author creates tension even when explaining the issues with time travel: It was at that point the real dangers became apparent, especially with regard to making changes in the past. As more and more people were traveling back to relive wonderful moments in their lives, some of those infinitesimally small changes began to affect not only the travelers life , but also the lives of innocent bystanders.As Brooke helps Charlie to find what he is looking for, their own love story makes an excellent parallel to his fathers life. The questions presented to the protagonist make this one of those stirring books that stay with you, that makes you think. Themes of love and trust run deep in this story. I highly recommend this book and the whole series. Well done.

"I last purchased this in December of 2014 and paid $21.95. For comparison sake, at the time of this review the same system is being sold at Walmart for $28.89.  There are reviews posted here talking about how much kids enjoy this game but it's good for big kids too - college age kids and beyond.This is a great alternative to spending hundreds of dollars on Gameboy, tablets, and other gaming system and one of the games is very similar to Mario. Drawback:  the device doesn't save the level of the game, so the games will start at the lowest level after turning it on.Most people probably don't know that you can no longer send electronics containing lithium batteries to military APO/FPO addresses. That's not a special military requirement, it's a USPS requirement as lithium batteries are apparently potentially dangerous when being transported in airplane cargo holds. The down side to that is that it limits your choices in electronics you can send to soldiers as most newer products have rechargeable lithium batteries inside.This handheld gaming device runs on alkaline batteries, can be sent to military addresses and this is about as good as it gets for handheld electronic games that run on alkaline batteries. It has a large color LCD screen, the games are entertaining and it has decent battery life even running on alkaline batteries, but I suggest you include a package of alkaline batteries in your order for uninterrupted game play.This game is very popular and a great distraction.

"I have two best friends. One walks on four legs, the other rides on four wheels and the tricky part is combining the two without either one doing damage to the other. Lately I've been trying out various products to find an option that works well for both.I decided to give this hammock sling a try in hopes of keeping my pooch from falling into the footwell/wall on particularly rough and bouncy expeditions.

"My review is not of Hulu itself, but of this Hulu Plus app.  Specifically, the performance of the Hulu Plus app on the Fire TV.The app installed easily and it was easy to link to my Hulu account.  As with all connected devices, to watch videos in HD on Hulu, you need at least an Internet download speed of 3 megabits per second, or Mbps, though for SD, or standard definition, you only need 1.5 Mbps. Note that HD videos are only available for Hulu Plus members; other memberships only have access to videos in SD.I have previously encountered streaming issues with Hulu on devices despite having met these minimum speed requirements.  In visiting with Hulu support I discovered that in addition to these minimum speed requirements, they also want your to have a Ping (latency) score of less than 50 milliseconds (the lower the better).  Your Ping score is included with a speed test and I use speedtest(dot)net to check my scores.  The Ping test determines whether your computer can communicate with another computer over the network. Then, if network communication is established, ping tests also determine the connection latency (technical term for delay) between the two computers.My speed requirements and Ping score are all within the requirements for buffer free streaming of Hulu Plus and this application is working great on my Amazon Fire TV over my home Wi-Fi.  I have not encountered any problems after over a month of use, but if you should, Hulu recommends the following steps for the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick:If you continue to experience issues with Hulu Plus on your Fire TV after general troubleshooting, please try these suggestions:  Clear all temporary files from Hulu Plus. From the main menu sidebar, go to Settings > Applications > Hulu Plus. Then, select both Clear Cache, and Clear Data.  Uninstall the Hulu Plus application. (From the main menu sidebar: Settings > Applications > Hulu Plus > Uninstall). Once complete, re-download the application: Search > Enter ""Hulu Plus"" > Select the Hulu Plus App > Download.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFAF6F0XO1KJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0066TUXU6#wasThisHelpful","RFAF6F0XO1KJW","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I last purchased these in January of 2015 and paid $7.00.  I think these do a good job of keeping rust stains in check and probably do a better job of eliminating them altogether if you catch them early.I did have a bad experience using these in one of my toilet tanks and that's the reason for my three star rating.  The toilet in question had a Fluidmaster 400CR Toilet Fill Valve and Flapper Repair Kit fill valve.  Shortly after placing this Whink Rust Guard in this particular tank the valve started to malfunction.  I suspect that ""flotsam and jetsam"" from this tablet dissolving got kicked up in the tank and some of this entered the valve and caused the problems.  What happened is the tank began refilling very, very slowly.  It would take a good hour for the tank to refill for the next flush and I ended up having to replace the valve altogether.In all fairness it could be a coincidence.  It's just I've never had something like this happen before and the fact that it presented itself within two days of adding a Whink tablet to the tank leads me to this conclusion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDGDTUH1TNHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EIRX9M#wasThisHelpful","R2LDGDTUH1TNHQ","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This battery is the top-rated alkaline in Consumer Reports most recent AA battery ratings scoring 57 out of 100 possible.

"I appreciate that this 4-pack is available through Amazon's ""Add-on program"" and that the free Prime shipping extends to military APO/FPO addresses.  I like the head/bristle design on this toothbrush and the integrated tongue cleaner.  If you don't share a bathroom and you're buying these to use for yourself the blue handle theme works fine.  The same is true if you're having these shipped to a military address and they are going to be distributed to a group that isn't keeping them in the same toothbrush holder.  However, if you're intending to use these in a common shared bathroom toothbrush holder you might want to consider if the slight color variations on the toothbrush heads are enough to help you identify whose is whose.  I am much less likely to pick up a toothbrush that isn't mine if the handles are different colors. If you are sharing a toothbrush holder with a guy like me you're probably going to want that guy to have a toothbrush color that stands out and is distinctly different than the others.

"This is the first syringe-type water blaster under the Nerf Super Soaker brand, but is akin to the old Power Soaker Jr. Cannon (1993) and Power Soaker Water Cannon.  It is good for use near lakes and/or pools where the water source is abundant and offers good performance for a syringe-type water blaster.  Use is limited due to its lack of internal water storage.Pros - Nice styling, comfortable to hold even for its small size.

I guess I'm not one of those guys because I'm just fine with having beans in chili and the convenience of canned chili complements my lifestyle. Maybe someday I'll learn to appreciate the nuances, but for now tasty, hearty, convenient, fast and easy meets my criteria and this chili makes the grade.I usually cube a little cheddar and add some Oyster crackers for a filling meal. I've also tried this chili poured over white rice and for me that makes a fine meal as well. I'm sure it would also be good as the chili for a chili dog meal if that's what you're looking for.

"This company also makes Fresh Balls Lotion The Solution for Men - 5 oz tube and this Fresh Feet Lotion seems like pretty much the same formulation.  Both go on as a lotion and dry to a powder.  Both products work for their intended purpose, but both are messier than powder (leaves white residue on hands) and not my favorite for use right before I get dressed because the lotion takes some time to completely dry on the application site.  Sometimes I don't have the time or patience to wait before putting on my underwear or socks (depending on which ""Fresh"" product I'm using), and I find that if I put on my underwear/socks before the product is completely dry I left feeling damp and uncomfortable.

"We needed a relatively inexpensive pant we could buy multiples of for several guys that would be working a trade show booth.  All the guys needed to be wearing the same ""uniform"" but the trouble was finding a pant style that was available in a variety of sizes and that would look good on a variety of body types.  This is the pant we settled on and it was a good choice.  The cotton/poly blend kept the pants looking crisp throughout the duration of the show.  The flat front styling is an up-to-date look and the comfort waist-band helped assure that any ""spread"" between true and stated waist sizes was covered.  I would absolutely buy these again.We went with the ""Ancient Stone"" color but ""Castlerock"" was a close second.  There was only one in our group who had the white pocket material showing as some have complained.  However, to be fair, I am going to guess that particular guy understated his true waist size by a good four inches when we turned in the order.  It seems the pants needed to be really tight on a guy in order for the white of the pocket to show in our 10-man sample.  The guy who had this issue was probably a 44 waist and had a 40 waist ordered for himself.  They looked uncomfortably tight on him.I last ordered these in March of 2015 and paid $34.99.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIMXPBOGWH7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9SES70#wasThisHelpful","RJIMXPBOGWH7R","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two best friends.  One walks on four legs, the other rides on four wheels and the tricky part is combining the two without either one doing damage to the other.  Lately I've been trying out various products to find an option that works well for both.This was the Center for Pet Safety's 2013 highest-rated safety restraint and is essentially a padded vest with three possible anchor points to distribute crash forces evenly over a dog's body.  Options for securing include a single lockdown for riding in the cargo area to two LATCH child-seat anchors with a human three-point seatbelt looped through the harness.I recently tried this out for the first time with my Labradane.  He seemed mildly confused when I put the harness on him and outright annoyed when fully buckled to the seat.  It makes sense that dogs unaccustomed to this type of restraint, like mine, are going to feel constricted and uncomfortable at first.  Still, this is going to take some time and I'm wondering if I can teach my old dog this new trick.I ordered mine from the manufacture's web site and there it asks for your pet's exact measurement in inches and provides instructions for accurate measuring.

"This is a stripped-down design with a single-compartment bag, roll-top closure and a rope strap that let's you pile on extra gear. It's got small mesh pouches on the shoulder straps that work well for lip balm and sunscreen. Six straps lock the load tight against the spine. The shoulder straps are densely padded and provide adequate support for 15-20 lbs, but anything more than that is probably not going to be comfortable and will overwhelm this frameless design. It has a hip-belt to stabilize the load. My one dislike is that this pack spoons the back so closely that it really limits airflow and tends to get hot.  On the positive side, this bag material is tough enough that I'm not worried that it's going to shred when I'm scooching down a rocky section of a steep descent.I like this piece of gear.

I'm sure her fans would point out that she wasn't given much to work with in this movie and I have no doubt that's true.  Still, I suggest you skip this one even If you're a Rebecca De Mornay fan (especially if you're a fan).","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYGJ7N3P13EGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYTDQJA#wasThisHelpful","RYGJ7N3P13EGW","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased the four pack in November of 2014 and paid $7.99.  They arrived with non-retail plastic packaging that looked professional and in no way diminished my confidence in the product.  The expiration date on the side of the batteries indicated they were best before March of 2018.  Some reviewers have indicated that the bottom of these batteries show a different date.  That information stamped on Duracell battery bottoms deals with the date of manufacture, not the date of expiration.  The bottom of my batteries had a stamp mark of  ""4090 A967"".  I imagine I could find a web site that could help me decode this information if that's something I wanted to pursue.  Knowing that I have a good three years of shelf life as shown on the battery side is enough for me.Some smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors require manufacturer-specified battery brands.  I always thought this was just an endorsement made for some monetary compensation provided from the battery manufacturer.  However, I put a generic 9 volt battery in a First Alert Carbon Monoxide Detector and it malfunctioned.  When I replaced the generic battery with one of these Duracell batteries the detector resumed normal monitoring status.  The generic 9 volt battery worked fine when I used it as a battery back-up for a digital alarm clock (the only other use I know of for a 9 volt battery).  It was only in my carbon monoxide detector that the generic battery caused a problem.  This has convinced me that I should use the recommended replacement battery brands and model numbers, especially on something as important as a carbon monoxide or smoke detector.On the back of my carbon monoxide detector it lists three acceptable replacement batteries: Duracell (MN1604), Goldpeak (1604A), Ray O Vac (A1604).  This listing is for the correct Duracell model.  The Goldpeak model is available here on Amazon 4pcs GP 1604A 9V Alkaline Battery Gold as is the Ray O Vac RAYOVAC A1604-4CF Alkaline Batteries (9V; 4 pk; Reclosable).  However, at the time of this review this listing for the Duracell 4 pack is still the better deal.Duracell Coppertop Alkaline Batteries (9 Volt) from my local grocer are $5.00 each.  These came to $2.00 each here on Amazon at my date of purchase.  Premium batteries at a great price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R319MTNHOCD330/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004DE54AA#wasThisHelpful","R319MTNHOCD330","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The description for this scent on the Unstopables web site reads, ""Add a capful or a shake and prepare to luxurify. For this is a luxuriful laundry experience that leaves your laundered with a sweet, flowery exuberance that exubers for up to 12 weeks*. So much so, that you'll start making up new words.""  I think they're exubberating.I like the concept of the pellets and that the product weighs so much less than the liquid.  I don't think this Glow scent smells bad or anything like that, but to me it doesn't smell as nice as my favorite Downy liquid, which is Downy Ultra Liquid Fabric Softener, Clean Breeze, 103 Oz.  I believe the liquid version of this scent is Downy Ultra Infusions Liquid Fabric Softener 48 Loads, Cashmere Glow, 41 fl oz.Glad I tried it but this was a one-time purchase for me.

"I purchased these here on Amazon in October of 2014 and paid $16.60.  Shipping was free with Amazon Prime.  I've waited to review these timers because I wanted to have some experience with them first.  I've used them now for almost five months and so far they have been dependable.This was the first time I purchased a digital timer and have used Intermatic TN111K 15-Amp Lamp and Appliance Timer or similar timers exclusively for decades.  These mechanical timers are okay, and I have several still in service in my home, but it seems like they eventually start loosing time and require adjustments.These Woods digital timers have not required any adjustments and are keeping perfect time.  I haven't encountered any power failures since I installed these so I can't speak to the effectiveness of the built-in battery back-up, but I've never had a battery back-up in the other timers I linked to above so I guess anything in this regard is an improvement.I would give these five stars if they were easier to set up.  Others have made mention of this as well in their reviews.  This is one of those items that I know I'll have trouble with in the future if I ever misplace the instructions as programming these, in my opinion, is not intuitive.Despite this, I'm not unhappy with this purchase and when my mechanical timers eventually wear out I'll purchase more of these Woods models.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGX0HYHMPTUWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005WQIDHY#wasThisHelpful","RGX0HYHMPTUWT","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wasn't sure what this App did and because of the name I mistakenly assumed that it was an email client of some sort.  I realize that this must sound naive to those who are familiar with this App and the U.K. Daily Mail newspaper.  For others who may also be confused, MailOnline is the website of the ""Daily Mail"", a newspaper in the United Kingdom, and of its sister paper ""The Mail on Sunday"".  According to Wikipedia, MailOnline is the most visited English-language newspaper website in the world with over 11.34m visitors daily in August 2014.  That pleasantly surprised me as I assumed the New York Times held that distinction.I have become a fan of this App for the most part.  It is customizable for U.S. or U.K news and includes categories you can select to sync.  The categories apparently equate to sections of the newspaper.  Taping sections in the app syncs the stories to your device.The news homepage can be set for either the U.K. or U.S. and that's also true of a section they have called ""Showbiz"".  For some reason the sports section is just called ""Sport"", as if there were only one.There are other sections one typically expects to find, such as Health, Money, Science & Technology, Travel and Motoring.  There is a section called ""Femail"" which is apparently a lifestyle section intended for female readers.  I guess that play on words/paper's name works well in the U.K. but it looks strange to my eye.  There's also what I would call a Huffington Post-type section named ""RightMinds"" as well.This app and its content loads quickly on my Kindle Fire HD.  There is apparently also MailOnline Tablet Apps for the iPad, iPad Mini, Android Tablets and Blackberry platforms but I have no experience with any of these variations.  I am surprised when I hear Blackberry anything these days and don't think I know of one person who still has one of those device.I would give this app five stars if there were a way to customize the presentation such that it wasn't necessary to scroll through empty sections to find the section one has chosen to sync.  If you haven't installed this app I know that must not make much sense.  As an example, if you have chosen to sync the Money and Travel sections only, you are still going to have to scroll through Home, Showbiz, Femail, Sport, World News, Science&Tech, Health and RightMinds before you can get to the information you've chosen to sync to your device.  If that is altered in future releases I will give this app five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S47YGR2M6C6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARI9CDQ#wasThisHelpful","R3S47YGR2M6C6A","A29WZU106L5RI8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A29WZU106L5RI8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The scratching post is the best I've seen and I'm really happy about that purchase.  I got mine at PetCo and I didn't event know this perch existed.  I wouldn't have bought it except I noticed that my cats were jumping up and sitting on the top of the post without the perch so I went on to Amazon to see if there was a perch accessory.  There was, and I figured if they liked it up there that much I'd spring for this perch.Installation of this perch on to the post was easy.  It went on smoothly and attached securely.  The entire installation took under a minute.Some reviewers have complained about the size of the perch and suggested it should be larger.  I believe the manufacturer's made the perch as large as they could given the size of the base.  Any larger and the entire post probably becomes unstable.My two cats both just jump up onto the perch and either don't need or don't want to claw their way up the post to the perch.  As a result I haven't seen or encountered any of the perch pad durability issues that some of the others have pointed out.  But I really think my cats would be just as happy even if it didn't have the pad on the perch at all.  They have lots of padded beds and softer sleep options so this is really more for entertainment and distraction option than a long term resting place.Bottom line - the cats like it a lot.  I think it is durable and that installation was easy.  I can't give this anything but five stars and I'm glad I made the purchase.  I purchased mine here on Amazon in March of 2015 and paid $16.99.

"3.5 CocktailsThere are some great things about this book and some issues; first let me tell you about the story.Dorrie Applegate is on her way to London to write her first biography on the most famous male model  Grant Maxwell.  This is her first assignment and her company sets her up in first class and in one of the best hotels in London.  Of course sitting next to her is a gorgeous Brit who takes a liking to Dorrie and who Dorrie accidentally falls asleep on.  The get to London spend the evening together and one thing leads to another and spend the night together  the next day Dorrie goes to meet the handsome Grant Maxwell and of course standing there was the man she just spent the evening with  of course he gave her a fake name and the story kicks off from there.  After a lot of misunderstandings and some time apart they find each other again and live HEA.What worked for me  I love the idea of a great looking man falling for a real women with curves who is not afraid of taking what she wants and both Grant and Dorrie fit this bill.  Overall I loved Grant  he is funny, shy doesnt date much and is a loner.  He would rather read non fiction than go out to and that is very different than what you sometimes finding in stories like these.  Dorrie is curvy and not shy.  She takes what she wants and gives with her whole heart  loved that about her.  They are opposites but fit so well together and I believed they belonged together.What didnt work for me  I didnt get the choices both Dorrie and Grant made throughout the story.  For Dorrie I know she is young and inexperienced but what she did with Luke came completely out of the blue for me  the reasons why didnt make sense within the context of her relationship with Grant.  I know there needs to be conflict but this was harsh.  Though her remorse and realizing that what she thought she wanted was not true to her heart was well done.  I felt her pain.For Grant after he and Dorrie break up  within 24 hours he is already with another women and Dorries cousin no less.  Again out of context for me  didnt understand it.  Also the reasons why he chooses to continue that relationship rather than go back to Dorrie who clearly loves did not resonant with me.  Grant is a gentleman and I loved that about him it just took a little long to get to the next part of the book for me.Getting past what didnt work I thought Julia Harlows writing was well done  she is very descriptive and I loved that.  I did think the characters banter back and forth was a lot of fun and I loved how Grant was able to show Dorrie a different life.  If you are looking for a good summer read this is a great book for you.Reviewed by Felicia for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R302WSTG85RHJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6ACYYC#wasThisHelpful","R302WSTG85RHJ3","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 CocktailsAnother great book by Ms. Opal Carew. Loved the storyline, the characters and just plain loved it.

"Shannon's ThoughtsCOME TO ME RECKLESSLY was another AL Jackson book that sent me on an emotional rollercoaster, which is something AL Jackson is really, really good at doing.Christopher Moore was a character we were introduced to in the first 2 books in this series.  He was a bit of a manwhore, but you figured he was young and sowing his wild oats.  But in COME TO ME RECKLESSLY we discovered there is so much more to Christopher than we ever imagined.  He was broken and using whatever means he could:  alcohol, women or both, to numb his feelings and to not remember his 'light'.Samantha Schultz was Christopher's high school sweetheart.  She owned him completely, but her inexperience and faith were constantly at war with the intense feelings she had for Christopher.  And when they were tested, by her parents forced separation and his foundation shattered, Samantha's trust in Christopher and herself was severely broken.  So when she comes face to face with part of her past in Target, everything Samantha had been running from for seven years became the same things she found herself running towards...no matter the outcome.There was no doubt in my mind these two characters were meant to be together.  The sheer depth of Samantha's terror and Christopher's 'hate' (because he never really hated her, even though he said he did) meant they had big feelings for each other.  But I had to wonder how AL Jackson was going to get these two past all the hurt, the lies and Ben for them to be together.  She definitely didn't make it easy on the two of them.  They each harbored their own set of hurts over what happened to them, but once Christopher put that stake in the ground and said he was going to stop hurting Samantha, you could tell things would be OK....eventually.I loved the chemistry between these two.  Despite some of the harsh things he had said to her early in the book, Christopher was careful with Samantha.  He knew she was fragile and needed him to hold back, even if it was killing him.  It was a testament to just how much he felt for her, that he was there to praise her when she needed it or just to make her smile.  And with Christopher, Samantha grew.  She shed the timid girl who did as she was told and became the woman who could do whatever she wanted, be who she wanted, with the right kind of support.AL Jackson's couples never have an easy road, but she always brings them out the other side with a solid foundation and a knowledge they can get through anything together.  Samantha and Christopher were no different.  You knew their faith in themselves and each other would get them through whatever storm they faced and they would always be together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PF2VOT2VZ2P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG5Y6W#wasThisHelpful","R2PF2VOT2VZ2P5","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 CocktailsI've read the first two books in this series and they were great. The last better than the first, the story distinct from each other even with the same setting but Brody's story. it was good but it kind of fell short to expectations. Brody goes away leaves the love of his life behind but comes back when his job doesn't work out. Madilyn the woman who refused to go with him feels slighted even though it was her own fault. But everything works out, quicker than the norm but I was glad for that. I really don't like it when guys apologies when the woman is at fault.Then a horror from Brody's past is introduced and even that ends quicker than normal. I guess what I'm saying is I wasn't given time to get immersed in the story and the characters because it all went by too fast. Maybe if the reconciliation and the threat were concurrent, plus a litle back story it would have been more engaging. It felt more like a rest stop before the real story in the subsequent stories.But I still love this series and I'm looking forward to the next books especially Sam's and Wyatt's stories.Reviewed by Rina for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDN7D0IKZRRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9T8V76#wasThisHelpful","R2PDN7D0IKZRRA","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a set of two shorter novels about the Masters brothers, Chance and Lucky, who had a horrible childhood and work to overcome those issues to be with the women they love.Second Chance Cowboy is the story of Chance and Kenzie. They have known each other since she was a little girl and he was a teenager/early 20 something bull rider/hand on her fathers ranch. She has been in love with him since high school and hes been fighting his attraction to her just as long. After not seeing each other for 10 years, hes back and they discover that their feelings havent really changed.I really wish this story had been a little longer. The author does an excellent job of letting us catch glimpses of the history between these two and letting us know why Chance feels the way he does, but there were several places that felt rushed. We also went from Chance staking his claim and explaining his childhood to Kenzie to them instantly being engaged. It seemed that we missed out on several key relationship steps that would have really added to the story.Lucky in Love is a companion to Second Chance Cowboy and really wouldnt work as a stand-alone. It is the story of Chances younger brother, Lucky, and Kenzies best friend, Cammie. Again, we have a younger woman who has loved her Masters brother since high school, but he really didnt pay too much attention to her.Where Second Chance Cowboy was too short, Lucky in Love was just right in length. Neither Lucky nor Cammie really struck me as characters that I could spend a lot of time with and not want to crack their heads together. I enjoyed Luckys story, but it could have become repetitive if it had continued too much longer.Overall, Cook County Cowboys was a sweet anthology and I wouldnt mind coming back to meet some of the neighbors.Reviewed by Elizabeth for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D5VNTWDK42UR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0G27PG#wasThisHelpful","R1D5VNTWDK42UR","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gigi is starting her first real adult job, at the Vampire Headquarters, and of course things dont go as smoothly as they should. Ive read other books in this series, but it had been awhile so I was a bit confused at times, yet Gigi drew me into her world and I was entranced. Throw in Nik, a vampire who kisses her one second, attempts to kill her the next, yet remembers none of it.Gigi was definitely meant for a dark and brooding vampire, and of course Nik is probably all the more mysterious and enticing because all of the over protective vampires in her life want to keep them apart.There is villain that keeps causing hijinks and it really works for the story. This is a first person story, and while thats not always a favorite of mine, Molly Harper always has such interesting characters that I easily enjoy their inner monologues.I definitely recommend this one, its a fantastic story that does a decent job of introducing new readers to the series world.Reviewed by Sheri for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCYKBHQAIZNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1RZTY#wasThisHelpful","R2BCYKBHQAIZNV","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lady Serena of Talisand has already lost so much.  She lost her father to war.  She lost her brother when he left to join the rebellion.  She lost the only place shes ever called home, Talisand, when King William gave the land and her hand  in marriage to one of his knights Renaud de Pierrepont The Red Wolf.  The only recourse that will allow her to have some independence is to escape before The Red Wolf arrives.  However, Serena doesnt realize that escaping from her destiny is going to much harder than she ever imagined.Lady Serena is loyal, loving, independent, fearless, and determined to protect the people of Talisand from The Red Wolf.  I loved her character, and I immediately became vested in her happiness.  She was more concerned about others than herself.  She didnt consider herself above the people, and she wasnt afraid to work and/or walk among them.  The Red Wolf was not what Serena feared. He was loyal, caring, humble, and fierce in battle.  He dealt with Serena in a very sympathetic but firm manner.  He was wise in the way he handled King William, but he protected his wife and their people from harm.  I loved him as a hero in this story.  He had a difficult job, but he readily accepted his lot and made the best of it.  The chemistry between the two of them was off the charts.  It was definitely a passionate union.The storyline kept me engaged and entertained.  I followed every twist and turn in the plot with great interest.  I cheered Serena on as she blended in with the other women and spurned The Red Wolfs advances.  I felt her trepidation when it was obvious that there was no way to get away from The Red Wolf.  I felt conflicted as Serena fell more in love with her husband and sought to protect the interests of her family and the people of Talisand.  I literally held my breath as I read the battlefield scene.  Each time The Red Wolf showed himself to be the consummate gentleman and warrior.  The secondary characters also won my heart.  I cant wait to read their stories.I love Regan Walkers work.  She is author in a class by herself.  She goes to great length to remain true to the medieval period an even includes actual historical information.  She goes into even more detail at the conclusion of the novel.  Im not a history lover, but Walkers weaving of history leaves the reader panting for more.  Her character development is unparalleled.  I enjoyed every aspect of this book, and I hope that the remaining stories are of the same superior quality as this one.Reviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C31RCFQW6WIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRF8WVA#wasThisHelpful","R1C31RCFQW6WIU","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the second book in The Nelsons Tea series.  I did read the first book, and I enjoyed it.  This book is easily read on its own.Captain Henry Guffald meets his match in Lady Adele Seaton.  Both have something to prove and will stop at nothing to accomplish their goal.  Lady Adele masterfully takes control of Captain Guffalds ship.  That happens fairly early in the story and it goes downhill from there.  The characters are unrealistic and poorly developed.  Lady Adele the pirate turns into a spoiled brat.  She throws tantrums and has to be locked in her room by her father.  I just kept thinking how old is she supposed to be.  It just killed the whole image of her character being independent and fearless.  I think the author just went too far in an attempt to show that Adele was feisty and had a temper.  I liked Henrys character in the previous book.  I felt sorry for him, and I had high hopes for him in this book.  His character seemed bitter and never seemed to find happiness in this book.  I never felt vested in any of the characters, and I never bought into them being a coupe.  There was no real chemistry between the two of them.The storyline has a few bright spots but ends up being bogged down with details and very little action.  I felt like there were details that left you hanging.  The author never really clarified that Adele and Henry were after the same goal.  So there was no point where they came together and decided to work together to free Adeles brother.  It just all sort of happened at the end of the book and then the story was basically over.It was a struggle to stay engaged in the story, and I hope the next book is better.Reviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDV7K57A233LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QPCYOMW#wasThisHelpful","RDV7K57A233LU","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The hero is John Dalkington-Smythe. He wanted to escape his role as just in case heir to the title. He goes into the military and moves to Canada following the war.  Unfortunately tragedy strikes and he must return to claim the title and produce an heir with his assumed wife.  The assumed wife is Faith Smith.  She is the real widow of John Smith.  As John Smiths widow Faith would have been destitute, but John Dalkington-Smythes widow would receive widows benefits.  So she pretends to be the widow of John Dalkington-Smythe not knowing that her husband is still alive.  This was a great storyline that just never took off.  The characters were just sort of blah.  I was never vested in the characters or the storyline.  I did like that they had great chemistry and genuinely seemed to respect each other.  Each wanted to do the right thing and worked together to resolve their plight.There was no excitement to the storyline.  The rejection from society seemed overblown even for a historical novel.  Each plot twist fizzled even what I thought would be the main twist which was the man that wanted to blackmail Faith.  He ended up being killed and that was that.  The embezzlement from the estate was also easily solved.  There wasnt enough intrigue to keep you interested in the storyline.There wasnt anything spectacular or memorable about the book.  The characters were just average and the pace of the storyline was slowReviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RBK4PAS89LLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKEG30E#wasThisHelpful","R3RBK4PAS89LLW","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are certain authors on my auto-buy list. By that I mean authors whose new releases I purchase sight unseen.  Christine Feehan happens to be one of those authors. That being said, this was not one of my favorite books by Feehan. The Ghost Walkers series is a long running one and its pretty fantastic if I do say so myself. So of course I expected nothing less in this the 11th book in the series.Although filled with action and great characters, I found it a bit slow to really get started. The story just seemed to drag on far longer than I felt was necessary. That being said, eventually the story did pick up. However, I still I found a lot of the dialogue to be redundant and unnecessary. At times, even the main character comes across as a real jerk and not likable.Perhaps it was wrong timing for me. I just couldnt seem to get in to the story. Do I give up on it entirely and call it a day? Im thinking no. On the off chance that maybe it was a fluke and I was just not in the right frame of mind for it, Ive decided to wait a couple of months and try rereading it. Feehan had never let me down before Viper Game so I see no reason why this time would be different. So my current recommendation is Read at your own risk.Reviewed by Iris for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T48E32TL5XPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LMGM0CC#wasThisHelpful","R3T48E32TL5XPE","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 CocktailsOh, I loved this book!  Erin Leaf is a favorite of mine, and she's never disappointed me...never.  ""Rock Star Baby"" is another win for me!This is the love story of Ryan, a rock singer, and Bardulf, the Alpha Heir to his pack of wolf shifters.  They meet through a hilarious series of events, and the sparks fly right away...I mean REALLY fly.  I don't want to give too much away, but what happens when the two of them are together for the first time is so primal and HOT that I had to take a break for a few minutes after I read it.  After their...er...lovemaking (ok, so it was some really great and insane sex), something is unleashed in Ryan that he'd never thought possible.  The love story between Ryan and Bardulf isn't all smooth sailing.  There are misunderstandings, occasions where both of them act like fools, but still their relationship continues to grow.  Our guys are also trying to deal with the distance between them.  Ryan is on tour with his band, and Bardulf is left to tend to pack business.  To me, that felt like the most difficult part of all.  I really felt for them, but they work it all out when they are presented with a wonderful surprise.  Once again, no spoilers, but it DID make me smile a mile wide, and once again, I really could feel their emotions.  That is one of the things that Ms. Leaf is best at.  She writes so well that the reader can really connect with the characters in her stories.""Rock Star Baby"" has a really great underlying plot.  It's a real mystery, and it's an interesting one at that.  It was an important part of the story without detracting from the romance.  I was completely enthralled, and when I found out what was happening, I was gobsmacked.  Also, there are some background characters who have some awesome personalities, and I can't wait for the sequels that are bound to come because I'd really like to get to know these guys better.All in all, as you can see, I really enjoyed this book.  It's romantic, sweet, HOT, and very sexy.  If you like your MM stories filled with shifters, miracles, and suspense, this is definitely for you.  If you're new to Erin Leaf, this is a good starter novel (although she writes about all sorts of things).  You need to pick this one up.Reviewed by Kenna for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UKPGF9SVXLDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UF54YKM#wasThisHelpful","R3UKPGF9SVXLDV","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 CocktailsI have to say that, ""Apples and Gin"" from Jenna Jones is one of the sweetest romances I've ever read.  I mean it, and I'm not just talking about just in a male/male story, but in ANY category.  I was so pleasantly surprised by it!  Sure, the blurb looked interesting, but I was just amazed and how much I enjoyed reading it.Sawyer is an up and coming country music star, and he meets Noah, a well known celebrity photographer, when the record label sent him to have his picture taken for his first album.  There's obvious chemistry between the two of them, but they don't become a couple right away...and their journey begins.  I don't want to give anything away, but I do want to say that I really liked Ms. James's writing style.  She started the book in the present, then went back ten years, then back to the present, then back nine years, and so on.  I know that may sound a bit convoluted, but it really wasn't.  It was very easy to follow and also quite smooth.  We got to meet Sawyer and Noah and get to know them as men, watch them grow, and look into their lives together AND apart.I smiled A LOT as I read.  Of course, there were a few moments when I started to tear up.  There was just enough angst to move the plot along.  There weren't many sex scenes, Sawyer and Noah certainly made them count!  They were hot, but they were tender and romantic as well.  These men just fit together so perfectly, and I fell in love with both of them as the story progressed.This isn't a very long book.  In fact, I read it in one sitting in about an hour, but it was a fantastic hour.  It's been a long time since a short read has been so satisfying to me.  I loved everything about it, and I can't gush about it enough.  Please, please, please get yourself a copy of ""Apples and Gin"".  You won't be disappointed.Reviewed by Kenna for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33P69CSBIW1MV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U02VA6Q#wasThisHelpful","R33P69CSBIW1MV","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, I just finished ""We Need Him"" part two.  I am so tense right now, I feel like I could snap.I read ""We Need Him"" part one and liked it very much.  Sure, there was a cliffhanger, but I was satisfied thinking that all would be well at the end of part two.  When I find a new author whose work I enjoy, I like to look them up on Amazon or Goodreads to see if they've got any other books out there that I might like to pick up.  Anyway, long story short, I discovered that part two was NOT going to be the end.  Turns out that Sage Mattison (who is very talented, by the way) has a lengthy series planned for our lovely triade...plus holiday shorts.  I was taken aback and did a little freak out when I realized that I wasn't going to get an HEA at the end of this one.  So, I had to step away for a few days.  It's not that I was angry.  I wasn't, but in book one, I'd become emtionally attached to Brett, Jake, and Jamie.  I wanted everything to neatly wrap up for them.  I think that they're one of the best triads I've come across in a long time.With a series, I like to wait until all of the books are available before I read it.  I am a big fan of instant gratification.  I've got zero patience when I'm excited about a story.  I want everything...NOW!  As I mentioned in my review of part one, the three main characters have incredible chemistry.  Seriously...lightning shot out of my Kindle.  They have extremely hot sex...whether it's just Jake and Jamie, or when Brett joins in.  It's not just sex for sex's sake, though.  Those scenes bring the whole thing together.  This is a fledgling relationship, and each of the three have some issues that need to be dealt with...especially Brett.  I feel really connected to him, and my heart goes out to him when he finally comes clean, and here is what I love.  Jake and Jamie have absolutely no trouble accepting him for what he is.  It's angsty.  It's heartwarming.  It's just so damn loving!Now that I'm fully invested, I feel like I'm going to tear my hair out.  Book three became available two days ago, but now I'm not sure if I'm going to one click quite yet.  I'm sure if I do, my stomach will be in knots at the end of that because I won't be able to jump into a part four right away.  I'm giving serious consideration to waiting until the series is complete.  It would probably save my sanity.  Still...I'm not quite married to that decision.Do I recommend this book?  Yes!  From what I've read so far, I can tell you that this will be a great series.  If you have an iron constitution and can relax between waits, give Brett, Jake, and Jamie a chance.  They won't let you down.Reviewed by Kenna for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342GC37L5KYNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR3DSFI#wasThisHelpful","R342GC37L5KYNO","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay... there was just entirely too much going on in this book for me.  I read the first book in the series a while ago and truly enjoyed it.  But as the series has progressed, I've liked it less and less.  Glory used to be a character that I admired.  I loved that she was a ""heavier set"" lady (even though I'd HARDLY call a size 12 heavy).  But as time has gone on, she annoyingly harps on herself.*Slight soap box moment*Nothing irritates me more than when an author writes a female character as a heavy set woman and sucks all of the self-confidence and self-worth out of her. They always write them to have self-doubt and low self-esteem and spend chapters of an otherwise worthy story using it as an excuse to constantly drone on with fat shaming jokes and comments.  Is it truly so hard to believe that a ""fat"" woman can't just be happy with who she is?  It is inconceivable to believe that she can live a normal life like anyone else regardless of her size?  Sorry for the rant, but it's so infuriating!Aside from that, the book was okay.  It had a lot going on in it, which was at times a little overwhelming, but the core of the story was solid.  The author created a lot of scenarios that kept me wanting to read on, and I did enjoy that aspect of the book.Overall, I think that the author should spend less time making her main character someone I don't want to spend time with, and more time on expanding on this creative world she's built.Reviewed by Marie for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28DLI6X4VUH2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ODEPE4#wasThisHelpful","R28DLI6X4VUH2P","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 Cocktails.In the emotional and somewhat nerve-wrecking ending to Liz and Sam's story, I found myself incredibly torn about whether or not these two could overcome all the obstacles in their way.  You can feel the love these two characters had for each other.  It was almost as if their love was a secondary character in the story.  It was always there, peeking around a corner, waving a flag, saying ""here I am, but I don't think I want to get mixed up in that,"" pointing at the mess that always seemed to be between Sam and Liz.  The mess was epic, was a result of some disturbed individuals, but also because of Liz and Sam themselves.Liz and Sam are perfect for each other, but they have in incredibly annoying knack of letting others determine what they should do and they both can't quite seem to bring up things that are important in a relationship.  They're both quick to believe the worst in the other and then beg for forgiveness when they realize they were wrong.  And as heartbreaking as it was to follow these two and their inability to get it together, it was also frustrating.  I often found myself yelling at my kindle, telling Liz to stop being a freaking doormat or demanding Sam grow some freaking balls and stop the insanity.  The eventually get it right, but it's a roller coaster of an emotional ride that had me making all sorts of deals with my kindle hoping it would end as I want.Another fabulous book revolving around the characters of New Hope.  Lexi Ryan, knows how to write a story that can drive me over the edge and then just when I'm about to give up all hope, make me believe in the hero and heroine again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UGPF5IXH2EZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R40ON3Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UGPF5IXH2EZQ","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Dusty a retired Navy Seal and April a Nurse new to the area each coming from different family backgrounds and trying to understand each other.

"CRASHING THE NET is the perfect blend of wonderfully written hockey romance, with realistic characters and sizzling chemistry.  Izzy has always had a tough life and learns at an early age she must make sacrifices for her family.  She and her sisters start a business called Party Crashers and while working at one of the parties she meets Cooper, a professional hockey player with the Sockeyes.  They are attracted to one another, but they are cautious and stubborn and fight their feelings for each other.  I admire Izzy and all she has accomplished. She has practically raised her sisters herself.  She hasnt had an easy life, but she never gives up and always has an optimistic attitude.  Izzy is an independent woman and doesnt allow Cooper to overwhelm her with his macho, overprotective ways and I love how she stands up to him.  He is not used to a woman like Izzy and isnt sure how to deal with her smart mouth, which he finds both aggravating and sexy.  Cooper is jealous and protective of Izzy and it drives her crazy that he doesnt trust her, but he cant help how he feels, his past has taught him not to trust women.  Cooper is easy to like.  On the outside he is a big, tough hockey player, with a loud bark but he is also a nice guy with a big heart.Jami Davenport writes a captivating story about a sexy hockey player who is macho and sensitive and a sassy woman who gives him a run for his money.  This is the third book in the Game On in Settle series and each one is a stand-alone.

In the end, Gavin flips anyway and they have to do the whole fight, apologize and make up thing.  But we expect this, because Lily was the loose cannon.  But in WHEN FATE ISN'T ENOUGH, Gavin also becomes a bit of a loose cannon.  He's moody, hiding things and spend more time trying to make it up to Lily.  He explains why and I could understand his temporary mood swings.  But there can only be one loose cannon in this series and I think Lily firmly owns that.I'm on pins and needles waiting for the next book.  Fate can't be as cruel as it appears to be, so I'll put my faith in Isabelle Richards that there will be a happily ever after.

Her father was also a Psyker and tried to teach her to harness and control her abilities before he was murdered before Arias eyes. One of the last things her father said to her was to stay away from other Psykers.

Shes working an abduction and murder case of a 7-year-old boy. The boy turns out to be a shifter and fingers are pointed at the vampire coven as the ones responsible. When a second shifter is murdered along with a vampire, both shifters and vampires begin preparing for war. Are one or both factions responsible or is there another deadlier threat on the horizon? Chaos ensues and lines are drawn. Aria wants no part of the upcoming war but she may not have a choice as every faction plots to woo herand her invaluable powersto their side. The action is just starting to heat up in this brilliantly crafted dog-eat-dog world where trust is deceptive and safety is a faade.Oh my GOODNESS! I completely devoured this book in one siting it was THAT GOOD! I loved the reading about the new reality after the Awakening and about all the paranormal beings. I also loved Aria. Her strength was admirable and her constant struggles with self-control made her easily relatable. I liked how the story is told from first person point-of-view but I would have loved to have had other POVs from James, a wolf shifter whos a friend of Arias, Mike, Arias boss and father-figure and other characters in the story. On the other hand, being told from first person leaves more of a mystery and its one Im completely hooked on!Im not sure what genre this book falls under but while reading it, it did feel a bit like a New Adult fantasy. There wasnt any romance in the book but theres certainly promise of one and I could see the possibility of a love triangle but there have been no love/lust feelings developed between Aria and any character in the book, yet. The story was solely focused on the suspense/mystery aspect as well as the threat of war.I thought the story was amazing and I loved every word of it. The prologue gives us a little taste of whats awaiting Aria in the next book and I cannot wait to find out what happens next!Reviewed by Elizabeth for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6X6RJEJMY8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKYB57M#wasThisHelpful","RB6X6RJEJMY8O","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5 CocktailsFalling for Jillian by Kristen Proby is the conclusion of the Love under the Big Sky trilogy and tells the story of Zach and Jillian. The main characters are connected to the previous two books in the series and I would recommend reading the other two books, but it can be read as a standalone.Kristen Proby is one of my must reads, and Falling for Jillian doesnt disappoint. Zach is an amazing father to his son, Seth, and has such a caring nature that is just looking for someone to share his life with. I wanted him to get together with Jillian, had been rooting for them from the short snippet I got from the first book in the series, and it was nice to see them get their HEA. Jillian is a tough as nails, take no prisoner woman who knows what she wants and isnt scared to go after it. Another five star read for Mrs. Proby, and I cant wait to see what else she has in store for us.Reviewed by Lucy for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26RA7XV5HCGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1ORIG#wasThisHelpful","R26RA7XV5HCGX","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Becoming Rain is the continuation of the Burying Water series.  I would recommend reading these two books in order.  In Burying Water, we met Luke Boone briefly.  He is Jesse's best friend and shares an apartment with him.  To be honest, I didn't remember too much of him and went back to Burying Water to see what was said about him.  I remembered I wasn't impressed with him.  He seemed materialistic, self involved and not terribly smart in Burying Water.  His uncle Rust owned the garage where Jesse worked.  Luke's one redeeming quality in Burying Water was he wanted to help Alex (Water).  He seemed sympathetic to her situation.As I began Becoming Rain, I was worried that I wouldn't connect with Luke and honestly, it took awhile for me to really like him.  Luke is a nice guy and is a product of his circumstances and environment.  He was raised by his Uncle Rust who has a legitmate business with the garage but also runs a car theft ring. He has been handed his condo, cars, jewelry without really working for it.  He assumes he will just take over the garage for Rust but he knows there is more to his business then just the garage.  Once Luke begins down the illegitimate side of things, he begins to question if this is a good choice for him.Clara/Rain is an undercover officer with aspirations of making it into the FBI.  She hopes this case with land her application at the top of the pile when she finishes.  Her target....Luke.  They need him to turn on his uncle.  The complication....Clara/Rain begins to fall for Luke.  The story of an undercover agent falling for her target has so many possibilities.  If I am honest, it took 3/4 of the book for me to buy in to their attraction and affection for her other.  Tucker is usually brilliant at romance but the tension and lines drawn between these two characters sometimes did not pull you in.  Ultimately, this is a well written story.  I would call this lightweight romantic suspense.  This story was not my favorite KA Tucker but it definitely is worth a read.Reviewed by Candace for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ROFD7G4J8O6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OOTI#wasThisHelpful","R1ROFD7G4J8O6R","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jami Davenport writes an exciting hockey romance with sizzling chemistry and just the right amount of tension.  Ethan Williams has always been obsessed with hockey and his dream has been to buy a professional hockey team.  Ethan comes to gather information about the Giants a professional hockey team while they are in the playoffs and he is keeping his real identity a secret from everyone.  While he is there, Ethan doesnt count on meeting Lauren.  Lauren is assigned to help Ethan and answer any questions he may have about the team.  Lauren loves hockey and knows everything about it.  She works in a clerical position for the Giants and is hard working, independent and speaks her mind.  She finds it frustrating working in this male dominated world because she isnt taken her seriously. Ethan admires everything about Lauren and he cant stop thinking about her.  She knows hockey plus she is sexy as hell.  They work closely together and although Lauren doesnt trust Ethan, she is attracted to him.  Ethan knows he should keep things professional and impersonal but he has a hard time fighting his growing attraction to Lauren. Even though Ethan is wealthy, he is a nice guy.  He always tries to do the right thing and is never condescending. He is hardworking, fair, and nice to everyone.  No one on the Giants team trusts Ethan, but they grudgingly start to respect him. I especially like how Ethan treats Lauren, he never tries to take advantage of her and he is impressed with her knowledge about hockey.This is the first book in the Game On in Settle series. I enjoyed everything about this story, the writing, characters and the passion between Ethan and Lauren. Jami Davenports writes an intoxicating story with realistic characters who are struggling to do the right thing under tough circumstances.  I like both Ethan and Lauren and wanted them to work through their problems so they could find a way to be together.Reviewed by Karen for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7SQRMZP5HV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQDHRFA#wasThisHelpful","RL7SQRMZP5HV5","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Lucas seems to go along with the flow.Aidan Sinclair is a Dom at the local BDSM club.  My biggest issue with Aidan is while he is a Dom he seems to forget how to be a real Dom.  He pushes Lucas almost to the point past actual consent.  He also seems to take issue with Lucas being straight and wants to change him.  Aidan seems to have a good heart under it all.

"Victoria Hockley flees her brother-in-law by seeking sanctuary at a church.  As she is walking the outside of the church she wanders from holy ground and is abruptly taken by Iain McPherson.  Iain is acting on an old edict that allows taking someone if they are not on holy ground.  This sounded so romantic to me when I read the blurb for the book, but there was no buildup to the relationship between Victoria and Iain before or after she was taken.  Their relationship was awkward and choppy.  It never seemed to be a flow from meeting to actually developing a love for each other.  Even when Iain finally told Victoria that he loved her it was at the very end and everything had already been resolved by then.  I never felt that there was chemistry between the two of them.  I never felt like I was drawn into their story and became vested in their happiness.  I just muddled through it.The female lead character, Victoria Hockley, was independent and wickedly smart.  I loved that the author allowed this woman in a historic romance to be well versed in math and science.  Better still the character was able to solve an engineering dilemma that evaded the men.  However, I just didnt follow the development of this character.  One moment she was fighting a former mistress, and the next she was playing childish games by withholding her name.  Her actions were so disjointed I just couldnt get vested in this character.The male lead character, Iain McPherson, had a boat load of issues.  He had daddy issues in every way possible.  Unfortunately, the way the author unfolded the issues was so repetitive and convoluted that I lost interest.  I dont know how many times Iains character rehearsed the lines that amounted to I dont want to be like my father.  It made him seem whiny.  He was an otherwise good guy, but this killed the alpha male thing for me.I love Tarah Scotts romance novels, but this one is not her best.  The story was choppy and didnt flow well.  The characters werent well developed and bordered on irritating.  I have read previous works, and I am still a Tarah Scott fan.  I will continue to read her novels.  She is a great novelist.Reviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSXRTXCLKONP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GHJLLU#wasThisHelpful","ROSXRTXCLKONP","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must bow to the greatness that is Shayla Black! His to Take the 9th book in the Wicked Lovers series is one of my favorites of the series. Shayla pulled me into the book from the start and there was no turning back and no sleep until the book was devoured.  She pulls you into the world by updating you on previous characters and couples lives who you have grown to love if you are a follower of this series. The world of Wicked Lovers comes alive as she keeps all the amazing characters to life by showing you how their lives have changed and progressed since last reading about them. This book is thrilling and you FINALLY get to meet the elusive Joaquin Munoz and introduced to Baily Benson a beautiful ballerina who captivates your heart with her strength, her courage, her talent and her beauty.Joaquin has a good heart but starts out on the wrong foot with Bailey. To save her life and keep everyone they know that is involved safe is an adventure and page turner in itself.  You cant help but want to throttle Joaquin and tell him what an idiot he is and several times I had odd looks from friends or family as I am griping about how Joaquin is being an idiot. I did not feel like I was reading this book I felt like I was in the world of the Wicked Lovers and couldnt stop reading because I had to know what was going to happen. I loved that the Club Dominion and the characters from there are back and you are also included in how they have been doing and what is in store for them as well.I was completely absorbed by this book it was so well written that I cried, laughed and shared in the happiness of the characters as well as their fears. I would sometimes even forget that I was reading a fictional book and was feared for those that I loved. This book has a great plot that continues to unravel and engage you. The only complaint that I can say is that I was sad when I finished the book. I wasnt ready to leave the Wicked Lovers world that Shayla Black has so vividly brought to life!Reviewed by Gwen for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSN9V9CZLDZ5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9B7SZE#wasThisHelpful","RSN9V9CZLDZ5P","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Thomas is a divorced father of three who is helping Sophie renovate her new home.While Sophie and Thomas are developing their relationship, we also see Sophie dealing with other strained relationships, specifically with her mother and sister. This is a sweet story, but very short. After finishing the book, I almost felt like I had read a really fun proposal for a book versus a completed work.

And she takes some characters that you used to love and shows you what was lovable as a kid is not so lovable as an adult.  The author makes it very hard to put this book down.

"3.5 CocktailsI really wish I could rate parts of this book separately; the second half is easily a 4 cocktail read, but the first half of the book was a struggle for me.Eleanor is the oldest of 3 girls adopted by a country vicar. As her father marries, she is losing her place in his household and discovers that she really longs for adventure. Her younger sisters conspire to have her take a journey to find their biological parents with the assistance of Taliesin, a longtime family friend and Gypsy turned gentleman.I had a hard time with the first part of the book. Neither Eleanor nor Taliesin really struck a chord with me and I could not really relate to either of them as they both seemed to run hot and cold with each other and the reasons why werent clear. As the story progressed and we learned more about both characters and their history together, Eleanors feelings and motivations started to make more sense to me and I started to like her. I never really got a good feel for Taliesin, so while I was intrigued by him, I cant say that I ever really liked him.As Eleanors journey continues, there are several times when Taliesin tries to go his separate way but for some reason he comes back. After an adventure where he risks everything for her, Taliesin slips away supposedly for good and Eleanor wises up and goes after what she wants. There was a sense of Finally when Eleanor stopped waiting and started acting.The second half of the book was packed with romance, intrigue, and adventure.

"4.5 CocktailsCloser than you think by Karen Rose, is another perfect combination of romance and suspense from the first page. It features psychologist Faith Sullivan and FBI Agent Deacon Novak. We met Deacon earlier in her series, but this book is definitely a standalone, although the rest of the series is pretty amazing as well.The opportunity to get to know Deacon was one of the best parts about this book. He was such an enigma, and it was interesting getting to see what made this fierce protector and police officer tick. Faith was a woman still haunted by her past, but I liked the way she was willing to open herself up to this man she did know too well. As always, the mystery and suspense leaves you guessing until the very end, and Karen Rose weaves an interconnected story as only she can. The only issue I had with the book was the sheer length, oftentimes with minute details that made it hard to follow along.

From the moment Paxton meets Sophia, theres no doubt in his mind shes the one and he continually tries to prove much how he cares for her.  Paxtons sweet, down to earth and even though hes one of the best pitchers in the league, it hasnt gone to his head.  Theres a lot of passion and heat whenever Paxton and Sophia are together.  This is the second book in this series and each one is a stand-alone.  Ella Jade writes an intoxicating story and I cant wait to read more in the Kingston Heat series.Reviewed by Karen for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZONVPLTO870/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J0ZRBQM#wasThisHelpful","R3DZONVPLTO870","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't sure how Heather Leigh was going to make me like Adam.  Giving some of the things he'd done in the Famous series, I had my doubts.  But Heather Leigh took a somewhat questionable character and made me love him.  Made me understand some of his really poor choice.  And made me hope that he could find a way to hold onto his HEA.ADAM was absolutely fabulous.  As with any other Leigh book, it's full of emotion and angst, with a storyline that makes the book hard to put down.  This is definitely one to pick up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8LRRFA0WH81V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8TJXU0#wasThisHelpful","R8LRRFA0WH81V","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"HERO BY NIGHT was one of those books that took me totally by surprise.  The storyline was one that grabbed you right away and then there was the hero.  Sweet, charming, dirty talking Chad.  I <3'd Chad.Lena Clark was struggling to find her ""normal"" as she adjusts to civilian life and how to manage her PTSD.  After walking away from her old life, she and her trusty service dog, Hero, start building their life Independence Falls.  She never expected the town playboy to be the one that helps her put her life back together.  But when he offers her a deal she couldn't refuse, she finds there is much more to Chad and herself...all they needed was someone to believe in them.It was hard not to love both of these characters from the moment you met them.  After their somewhat memorable introduction to one another, you couldn't help but like them together.  Lena needed someone to see her as normal and know that when she has an attack so doesn't want someone to fuss over her or make her feel like she's broken.  Chad does that for her.  He shows her that she's a beautiful woman who has a lot to offer, despite having trouble dealing with what she went through during her deployment.  It's Chad's faith in her, his understanding of what she needs when she needs it, that helps Lena move forward.Lena helps Chad too.  Without realizing it, she helps him understand that loving someone doesn't make you weak.  That you'd do just about anything to make that person happy.  Chad was gun shy about love and led a serial playboy lifestyle as he vowed not to be like his father.  But all it took was the right woman for Chad to willingly give all that up.This was my first Sara Jane Stone book and it definitely won't be my last.  She had the perfect mix of humor, emotion and smexiness and introduced me to a set of characters I can't wait to read more of.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14XX079OFU99V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMG19QE#wasThisHelpful","R14XX079OFU99V","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"FIGHTING SILENCE brought forth these reactions from me as I read the book. It's a testament to the craftsmanship of Aly Martinez that she can take a reader on an emotional journey in a book to evoke these kinds of responses.In the first book of the On the Ropes series, we're introduced to the Page brothers. Oldest brother Till has taken on the responsibility of making sure his younger brothers are taken care of, all while fighting to scrap along. His one bit of lightness is Eliza Reynolds. She helps ground Till and make him understand he's providing something for his brothers that he didn't have. And then, when boxing champ Slate Andrews opens a gym in Till's neighborhood he finds something else that makes his life better.So many things happen as we chronicle the relationship between Till and Eliza from the age of thirteen to their early twenties. From best friends to lovers, we watch both of these characters struggle with their circumstances, what their future is going to look like and how to keep their little unconventional family together. You couldn't help but hope they figured out how to get their HEA. It took them awhile to get it, but as they matured and realized there are some things more important than money, you knew they'd find it.I loved the dynamics between the Page brothers and Eliza. They may have pushed each other and sometimes rubbed each other the wrong way, but there was never any doubt they had each other's backs. They would do anything for each, actually proving that towards the end, which proved just how special this group was. They all rose above their situation to build a life they could be proud of.I look forward to hopefully seeing Flint and Quarry's stories. Both of them have huge demons to overcome and I just know Aly Martinez will give them spectacular stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWCRZDOYR3L0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPY1TBQ#wasThisHelpful","RWCRZDOYR3L0I","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh my goodness!!  ""Kidnapped By a Warrior"" was awesome!!  Really.  I totally mean that.  I don't tell lies when it comes to my hot alien men.The whole alien thing is relatively new for me.  It took me a while to actually sit down and read one of these books.  I confess that some of the blurbs scared me a bit.  Two penises?  Red skin that changed colors?  Horns?  However, when I actually read one?  GAH!!  It opened a whole new world for me.  Literally.  Now, I snap up alien books every chance I get.  Especially when the word ""Warrior"" is in the title.  Oh how I love warriors.  Strong, passionate alphas who can fight as hard as they love.  Sigh...In ""Kidnapped By a Warrior"" we meet Callie who is innocently walking down the street when...well, the title tells you what you need to know.  The story really takes off from there.  Jakara is out doing his job...collecting Earth women.  I'm not going to tell you why because you should really read this book for yourself.  They find themselves drawn together no matter how they meet, and it's so SEXY! Ravenna Tate writes with exquisite detail.  I was able to form a movie in my head...how they look, how they touch, how they fit together.  Perfection.  The sex scenes are scorching but tender and sweet as well.  Seriously, I'm talking stars in my eyes and goofy smiles.Along with the romance and sex, there is a great plot with intrigue and action. Once again, even though I'm dying to tell you, I won't give away any spoilers.  Jakara has to continue to do what he does, but is he being watched?  Can he trust anyone?  There are a few surprises to be had, and some nicely written action.  I thorougly enjoyed this book, and I'm going to scream from the rooftops about how fantastic it is.  It's the first in the ""Voyeur Moon"" series, and I can't wait to read the next one.  Treat yourself to this gem.  You won't be sorry.Reviewed by Kenna for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QH0AL10XPJKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TADKMCE#wasThisHelpful","R2QH0AL10XPJKI","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This final edition of the ""Doms of Sybaris Cove"" series was immensely satisfying, and I'm a happy woman right now.  I'm not happy that the series is ending, because I truly loved it, but because I knew that the end was coming, and I was almost worried about how it would all tie together.  Would it be up to my expectation?  Would it do the ongoing story justice?  I needn't have worried.  ""Midnight Fantasy"" was the perfect way to end the series.  Tara Rose really came through here, and she gave me exactly what I wanted.I'm not a spoiler kind of person, so I'm going to leave most of the plot to the blurb.  Let me just say that Javier, Garrett, and Renata make a wonderful triad.  They fit together like a glove...or three gloves.  They have chemistry to spare.  They knew each other (and both men dated Renata as well) from high school, and when she returned to Dybaris Cove, they were able to find their way back to each other.  It happens rather quickly, but it doesn't feel very rushed.  They have a history, so the early intimacy isn't a surprise.  I loved reading the sex scenes.  They were intense, but they were also very tender.  I have to admit that I read them all three times each, hehe.  I fell hard for Javier and Garrett.  With the exception of my husband, I don't think that men like them don't really exist...only in fantasy and fiction.Along with the romance, there is that ongoing mystery that has been plaguing Sybaris Cove since the beginning.  The Raleighs and the Durantes were cursed, and there have been clues as to who placed it and how it may be lifted.  It's just so good, and Tara wrote it so smoothly, and I want to tell you all about it SO BAD, but I don't want to ruin it for you.  As I said, I'm very satisfied.  Everything wrapped up so well.  I wasn't sure how she was going to do it, but wow!  I didn't see it coming at all, and it gave me goosebumps and made me cry.  The supernatural elements mixed with the ""real life"" of every triad...and resident of Sybaris Cove came together to make an explosive climax (hehe...I said climax...hehe) that I was absolutely thrilled with.Please, please read ""Midnight Fantasy"".  Remember it is the ninth story of the series, so you really need to start at the beginning.  If you try to read it as a stand alone, you'll probably be lost and confused.  However, the series is incredible, so you won't be sorry if you start at the first.  Tara Rose never disappoints.Reviewed by Kenna for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NNDL1N1RVOUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXV746K#wasThisHelpful","R1NNDL1N1RVOUE","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While the ending was a little predictable, the journey the book takes the reader is gripping with several unanticipated twists and turns. I had a hard time putting this book down.

"2.5 CocktailsThis book was not my favorite of the series. I normally love the snarky dialogue and saucy heroines but the storyline fell flat for me.

"Ember is Book 5 in the Eagle Elite Series and you must read them in order.  This happens to be one of my favorite series out there and through each and every book I wondered how I would like the next one because I swore the character of the current book was my favorite.  Clearly, Rachel Van Dyken has a way of making you love each and every character in the Eagle Elite Series.Ember is Phoenix DeLange's story and if you have read the other books, you know Phoenix is in desperate need of redemption.  I absolutely hated him in the first few books.  It seemed Rachel had written a character that would leave a bad taste in your mouth every time you read his name.  His past is filled with horrible violent acts against women.  He doesn't think he is capable of good or being happy.  It is what he has been taught by his father over and over again.However, in Book 4, Phoenix was given a second chance by his friends and family.  Part of that second chance includes Bianka (Bee) Campisi (Tex's little sister). They are both extremely lonely and damaged individuals but together they find away to chase away both of their demons.  Phoenix doesn't want to hurt Bee but he can't stay away from her because she removes the numbness he constantly feels.""I don't do warm fuzzies....I do scorching blazes...That sear you alive.""For someone with her past, Bee is extremely warm, snarky and truly see the good in people.  She wants friends and normal and most importantly, she wants Phoenix.  She feels safe with him.  She sees the good in him.  Phoenix wants her to have everything and he thinks he can't give it to her.  He struggles with believing that he deserves happiness but Bee pushes him to the edge.  She tries to bring light to his dark.By the end of the book, I was rooting hard for Phoenix.  He deserved a happy ending too.  Ember not only redeemed Phoenix but it had its normal bloodshed, comedy between the guys and girls, suspense and drama.  I love how Rachel develops the next book in the background of the main storyline. I can't wait to hear Sergio's story.  The best part of this series is the characters: Nixon and Trace, Chase and Mil, Tex and Mo, and the other family members Frank and Sergio. You root for them, love them, hate them...and the story gets better and better each time.  You really can't ask for more in a series.  Good job Rachel....you took a character that no one liked and you had all of us rooting for him in the end.

"Ive been waiting for this book, since Ms. Singh first introduced Ash and Janvier, and she didnt disappoint. The mystery and intrigue in this story left me very satisfied.I loved that Ash still has her tough side, but that we finally learn more about her past and see what makes and shapes her today. I definitely grew to appreciate her character and the way Ms. Singh builds a character profile through her description of Ashs past. Janvier loves Ash, there is no way that doesnt immediately show through, he loves her through it all, and that makes him a fantastic hero.Full of action and lots of past characters popping up, this is a great book for fans of the series. I wouldnt recommend it to new readers, since I feel like all the previous stories has built up to this, or at least I know I enjoyed it more because I was already acquainted with the world.I recommend it because Ms. Singh brings a world of action and passion to life with this Guild Hunter book, and its a great thrill ride.Reviewed by Sheri for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BQQIMS3HRDOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJXTP64#wasThisHelpful","R2BQQIMS3HRDOZ","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5 CocktailsI have thoroughly enjoyed Lauren Blakely's Seductive Nights series.  First with Clay and Jack and now with Nate Harper.  He is the guy we all want: sexy, successful, charming, and funny as hell.  He totally has the hots for his best friend Casey Sullivan, who is Jack's sister.  They have been best freinds for a long time and he was burned badly in the past so intimacy is not something he is ok with.

"Oh my goodness! I think my kindle was smoking during parts of this book!We begin by meeting Miranda, a successful ghost writer who decided to branch out and try her hand at erotica. A simple mistake has her emailing her completed manuscript to her younger sister, Lindy, instead of her editor, Linda. Lindy takes it from there and the manuscript ends up in the hands of Robert, a billionaire publisher.That e-mail mistake leads Miranda and Robert down an interesting road. Early on, it seems like they will have smooth sailing then Roberts past rears up and makes him suspect Mirandas motives. The process he puts her through to prove she is being honest is difficult for her, but it also leads to him opening up to her. Just as it looks like Miranda and Robert may get their happy ever after we get hit with a major cliffhanger.I struggled with my feelings towards both Miranda and Robert. The story is written from Mirandas point of view, so we see more of what she is thinking. I went from liking her spunky attitude to wishing she would stand up for herself to hoping she could get what she wanted. I never really warmed up to Robert, but I was intrigued by him.There is a LOT of sexy time in the book and most of it is of the BDSM variety. The author does a great job of creating the environment, but without repeating scenes and experiences. It was fascinating to watch Mirandas reactions to what Robert asked of her.I normally dont like cliffhangers, they are actually a pet peeve for me. This is book one in a trilogy, so we go in knowing that the story wont be complete at the end of the book, but I feel like it could have been handled a little more smoothly. The way this cliffhanger is set up, I couldnt help but be a little frustrated.

"Have you ever picked up a book and utterly been at a loss for words?! Well, this is how I feel after reading Verum, the second book in the Nocte Trilogy. I enjoy Courtney Cole's books but this series has blown my mind. This review will be spoiler free because quite honestly, I don't have answers. All the questions I had in Nocte and Verum are answered in riddles or with more questions.  Both books leave you with a severe book hangover.Verum starts directly after the ending of Nocte which leaves Calla asking Dare to answer her one burning question but Dare can't answer it. Dare tells her, ""You have to help me, Calla. Help me save you."" Dare takes Caall back to Whitley, their family estate for the answers. Whitley is full of secrets, beyond eerie and causes Calla to question everything in her life including her relationship with Dare.Reading this book was absolutely exhausting in the best possible way. I would catch myself going back and rereading to make sure I didn't miss anything or taking a minute to try to figure out the riddles Courtney Cole spun in her character's dialogue. You go through the book feeling a bit lost because you so desperately want to help Calla. I found myself having anxiety, confusion and fear which seems to be the norm for Calla.There would be a moment or two when you thought you were going to get all of the answers and then you found yourself being pushed in a different direction in the story. I felt like I was lost in a complex maze and I'm a little fearful to see how this series is going to end. Courtney Cole's writing is brilliant and haunting. You feel like you are deep inside the mind of a person who is only holding onto their sanity by a thread and at times seems downright insane.All I can say for Verum and this series is that it is not for the faint of heart.enter at your own risk!Reviewed by Candace for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CTZFH73WGIUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P6LDHXU#wasThisHelpful","R3CTZFH73WGIUI","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5 CocktailsI was intrigued by the idea of this book, people from two different cultures being intensely drawn to each other even though one culture might object. The fact that the cultures in question happen to be werewolf and human added a touch of flare.After a somewhat confusing and rough start, we got to know Lucien and Lanie a little bit. I say confusing because the book opens with Lanie walking into a restaurant then being spotted and immediately pursued by Lucien. The lack of lead in and the way he approaches her seemed very rushed to me. Their whole romance seemed very rushed as they took very little time getting to know each other. Luciens falling in love so fast almost made sense when factoring in the animal side of his nature. Lanies reactions to him didnt ring as true for me.I also struggled with the lack of resolution to issues raised by the author. At one point Lanies sister-in-law discusses the werewolf curiosity about human women and that makes Lanie cautious of Lucien, but she never discusses this with him. There were several other instances like that. They may not have been crucial to the plot, but I wish they had been resolved.Once our hero and heroine are together, there seems to be more plot development and the book gets better. I really think the author would have been better served by expanding the length of the book to create more of a plot in the first half and to expand the plot in the second half. The sudden ending that leads to the next installment of the series was also off-putting.The biggest thing to recommend this book is the amount and quality of sexy time between Lucien and Lanie. If the rest of the book was written to the same standard, this would have been a book/series that I would have wanted to invest more time in.Reviewed by Elizabeth for Cocktails and Books","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O37LDPMFDJ6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FP43PP8#wasThisHelpful","R2O37LDPMFDJ6D","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 CocktailsWhat do you do when you have loved someone most of your life and dont believe they will love you back? For Sarah Cass heroine, Eve, the answer is to be his best friend until it hurts so much you cant stand it.Eves New Year is part of the Holiday in Lake Point series, but reads very well as a stand-alone story. The book centers on Eve and Jake who have been friends since they grew up next door to each other and now work together. To say they have baggage would be a huge understatement. Most of the baggage belongs to Eve and was caused by a completely clueless Jake. I liked both characters, but was really frustrated by how two people who have been friends for so long could not manage to communicate better.We meet these two when they are at a cross roads. Eve is offered an opportunity that she cant turn down, but that means she will be moving three hours away. Jake has finally been getting a clue and realizing that he wants more with Eve than to be her friend and boss. What follows is a series of missteps and misunderstandings that make it hard to imagine these two ever getting their HEA.One of the issues I struggled with early in the book was Eves lack of self-confidence. She seemed to think that the crumbs of affection she received from Jake in friend mode were all she deserved. We learn more about Eves background later in the story and that made me revise my opinion and start to like her more.Overall, I enjoyed Eves New Year; it was an interesting take on a friends to lovers story that was easy to relate too. The book was also just right in terms of length. We got to see Eve and Jake struggle with their own issues and with each other without revisiting the same arguments repeatedly. The author did a great job with presenting an opportunity for our hero and heroine to resolve things that left me feeling the story was complete. I wouldnt mind coming back to Lake Point for another holiday to see what some of Eve and Jakes friends are up to.Reviewed by Elizabeth B for Cocktails and Books","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10PBEU72NYMC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSDNVCW#wasThisHelpful","R10PBEU72NYMC5","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In this conclusion to the Hot Blooded serial, an epic showdown has saved the day once again and in this case, the secret doorway to Dregan for now. Seems as if their hidden enemy is biding his time but for what we dont know. Is the enemy Ulrich? Has Deidre somehow figured out a way to come back from the dead? After all she managed it once before. Or is it a still unknown mystery enemy that we will meet later on? Is there yet another Dragon King on this plain those those at Dregan are unaware of? These are the questions that plague me and make me anxious for the next story in the Dragon King series.Rhys has made an irreversible decision, which if I am to be honest, broke my heart. Of course we all hope that Grant is magnanimous and the decision can be reversed somehow once Rhys gets his own story. Rhi is firmly in the Dragon King world again however unwillingly it seems. By process of elimination I can determine that Rhis Dragon King lover is one of two Dragon Kings and to be honest now I am dying for that book. Although I would definitely not categories this as a cliffhanger, after all, our main characters, Laith and Iona do face adversity, over come it and have their happily ever after, I must mention that in the end there are still so many questions unanswered. Questions that we will have to wait until the next book to hopefully get answers to. Overall, I absolutely loved Hot Blooded and would recommend it to romance and paranormal lovers a like.Reviewed by Iris for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7QK6BDOGCPV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRXCGYM#wasThisHelpful","R7QK6BDOGCPV2","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am thoroughly enjoying the glimpses Grant is giving us of the previously mated Kings and their mates. Although this makes it difficult for someone who has not read the previous books or who is not familiar with the series to follow along the many intricate interweaved stories, seeing where they are at this point in time is like having an added epilogue to their books. Fans of Grants other series will be happy to note that the Warriors also make an appearance several times.As with life, it looks as if nothing will ever come easy to the Kings. We still have an unknown enemy threatening them and in turn mankind. The Dragon mates and anyone they care about being targeted, it looks as if a war will be inevitable. The only question remains is who is the enemy that they will be fighting.I, like any other avid reader of the Dragon King series have been keeping mental notes on different characters. In my case, none more so than Rhi and her mysterious Dragon King lover. The more glimpses and hints we get the more eager I am to know who it is. With Laith now firmly focuses on Iona, we can eliminate him from the running. I cant wait to read more!Reviewed by Iris for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCI5LJ18980MR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRXCGPG#wasThisHelpful","RCI5LJ18980MR","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So many things happening in this second installment Im not sure where to begin. In this second installment to Hot Blooded, we see a letter from her deceased father; answer some of Ionas questions. However, just as some of the questions she has are answered, many more crop up to take their place.Laith is finally coming to terms with the fact that Iona means something more than any other mortal does to him. Why is it that the Dragon Kings act as if theyre being hit by a semi when they realize what is obvious to everyone around them? Regardless, I think its high time for each of the Dragon Kings to find love.In this installment we get to see Rhi sort of rejoin the thick of things. Its good to see that although Rhi has changed due to the ordeal she suffered in the previous book, she still retains the part of herself that makes her care about the Kings and the women that surround them. As someone who has read the previous books, it saddens me to see Rhi suffer, but I know that Grant must have a grand plan for Rhi somewhere down the line.Herein lays another reason why it is imperative that the previous books be read, Rhys situation has only gotten worse. Due to his injury suffered during Rhis rescue attempt in the previous book, he has to go through so much. I cant wait for his book and hope that its the next one Grant will write for us.That being said... on to part 3!Reviewed by Iris for Cocktails and Books","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H8JFLX59TL3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LRXCGPQ#wasThisHelpful","R3H8JFLX59TL3M","A3TGY3ANGBNK7C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TGY3ANGBNK7C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Two things to note. First, I received this product for free with the promise I would offer an honest review. Second, I don't own Apple products, so this review is based entirely on how well it works with my Windows tablet and Android phones.When I received the Skiva 10000mAh device, it showed a 40 percent charge. The very first thing I did was plug it in to charge it. It does come with a USB/mini USB cable, but I have plenty of wall charger adapters here. It was at 100 percent within a couple of hours.Once fully charged, I started playing with it. It charged my cell phone (the cell phone battery was completely drained) in about an hour and showed that 85 percent of the battery life to the Skiva remained. That was pretty impressive. I was also able to charge my son's old cell phone (we use it as an MP3 player now) and my Windows tablet before the Skiva needed recharging. My Windows tablet is a battery hog that takes far longer to charge back up than I think it should, so I think with a better tablet, you could get more out of the Skiva. To get things straight, plugged into the wall, the Windows tablet takes six hours to charge.It comes well packaged in a box and contains a brief guide into the usage. I found the tri-fold sheet of paper contained enough information to understand how to use it. The only thing thing I think some people will find it lacking is the wall charger. If you do not have a USB plug in on your power bar or have wall adapters, you're going to be stuck charging the Skiva on your laptop or something else like that.Key Features:Two USB ports for charging. One is 1A while the other is 2.1A.Does not get hot or warm (I have some chargers that get pretty warm to the touch, so I like how cool the Skiva remains)Built-in LED flashlightClear digital display to show how much charge is left.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12N4ALIIWO8NX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUMEQKS#wasThisHelpful","R12N4ALIIWO8NX","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DII's trio of machine washable heavy-duty bags is really handy if you're trying to cut back on your use of paper or plastic shopping bags. The canvas material is incredibly thick and durable, and the straps are sewn on well, so even after use lugging around books and a laptop they're not showing any sign of wear or tear.Size and CapacityThe size of these bags, 15-inches high by 14-inches across is pretty large, but they're not very wide the other way. When you flatten the bottom, they're only about 4 inches across, so fitting all of your grocery shopping into the three bags isn't likely to work. Especially if, like me, you live in a more rural area where you have to drive a number of miles to get to a store, so grocery shopping is a weekly thing. Instead, I'm finding them to be much handier for trips to the library when I'm bringing my laptop with me.ColorsOne thing I do really like is the trio of colors. One is a simple cream canvas. The next is a violet purple. The last is a mix of the two with the old fashioned floral pattern.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30ECT46XA6DPG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QGQAAPM#wasThisHelpful","R30ECT46XA6DPG","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Essentially, the size and shape of the Pantene Pro-V Weekly Rehab Creme brings to mind the conditioner you get with a hair dye kit. That said, some of those conditioners are the best around, and I've been saying for a long time that they should sell those conditioners separately.My hair is dry from a long, bitterly cod winter. Having a pellet stove for heat hasn't helped. Now that spring is here, we had some gorgeous weather, lots of sun, but the past couple of days have jumped right into the 80s with humidity kicking in. Medium-to-long naturally curly/wavy hair and humidity do not usually go together. It becomes a case of frizz central.I will say that Pantene Pro-V impressed me. I conditioned my hair with the cream on Friday, the hottest of the days, let my hair dry naturally without any other product, and I got comments on how smooth and shiny my curls were. Even yesterday when the humidity was at its worst, I still didn't have the frizz I expected.The only reason I haven't given this five stars is the size of the tube. It's only going to last a month most likely. If I use it once a week for four weeks, with the length and thickness of my hair, I'll get a month from it at most. I can't find it in local stores yet, so I'm limited to paying for it and adding on shipping costs. I do wish since it looks like I have to order it online that it came in a larger tube.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBFXQ20T994YR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GM9XTQ0#wasThisHelpful","RBFXQ20T994YR","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a high schooler, college student, husband, and myself all carrying water, coffee, or tea when we're on the go, we've tried out an awful lot of water bottles over the years. Some have failed miserably, and others have left an impression. Contigo Glacier Stainless Steel Water Bottle is one that leaves a huge, positive impression.Features:Start with the carrying ring. The top dark blue ring flips up and becomes a comfortable carrying handle when you're on the go. When you're storing it, the ring flips back down and becomes part of the lid.One simple push button is all it takes to open the lid for drinking. One of the biggest problems we've had with water bottles is that they accidentally get bumped while in a backpack and open and leak. With a locking mechanism on this push button, that eliminates any issues. Simply slide the push button to the left and it's locked and leak-proof.I put some ice cubes and water in this water bottle at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, and it's almost 11:00 a.m. here and the water in the bottle is still very cold. That's 21 hours and certainly impressive.The Only Thing I Don't LikeI've seen some of my husband's water bottles develop a nasty algae-like slime after weeks of use. His work invests in Vermont Pure spring water coolers, so I don't think water quality is the issue here. Even if we leave them soaking and shake them vigorously before using a bottle brush, there seems to be the nasty slime builds up in corners or at the bottom. As a result, I prefer water bottles that I can fit my hand down. That's not possible with this one. The opening is only about 2 - 2.5 inches.There's a crease down the inside and a ridge at the bottom that does prove hard to clean thoroughly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVZKC7TX4IERV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNX8JM#wasThisHelpful","RVZKC7TX4IERV","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've hit 45 and all of the sudden, I'm starting to see crows feet. I don't particularly want them, so my hopes was that the Phyto 5 Ageless Eye Serum might help ease their appearance. After a day's use, I'm not really sure I can see much. The lines are still there, but they have reduced very slightly, leaving me to wonder what things will be like after a week.The scent had me thinking back. I knew the scent. It took a while, but it smells just like a DEET-free mosquito repellent I used to use. I would guess that is mostly from the citronella and essential oils.My one concern involves one of the ingredients. Apparently, based on the research I've done, it is used to neutralize PH levels. I can understand that in an eye cream, but putting what is essentially lye around my eyes is very frightening. I've read a few sites now, and while this is used in many restorative eye creams, the bottom line is that it is a caustic substance that must be used with care as it has been linked with extensive exposure to cancer of the esophagus. This is after extensive exposure, so I doubt there is much risk. My bigger concern comes from using lye around the eyes. My grandmother always made soap with lye, so I'm not a newbie to the ingredient. However, it would be nice to know the concentration that's being used in this eye serum.Ingredients:Rose flower water (Skin conditioning and protecting)Glycerin (Humectant)Acacia senegal gum (Produces a film over the skin)Tara gum (Skin conditioner)Acacia senegal gum extract (Produces a film over the skin)Hydrolyzed rhizobian gum (Produces a film over the skin)WaterApricot kernel oil (Anti-aging moisturizer)Polyglyceryl-6 esters (Surfactant)Benzyl alcohol (Preservative)Beech bud extract (Reduces lines and increases oxygen flow to cells)Sorbitol (Skin conditioner)Sucrose dilaurate (Skin conditioner)Sucrose laurate (Skin conditioner)Sucrose trilaurate (Solubilizer)Xanthan gum (Thickener/stabilizer)Dehydroacetic acid (Fungicide)Geraniol (Geranium oil)Limonene (Scent)Sodium hydroxide (Lye/caustic acid used to balance PH levels)Citronellol (Citronella)Linalool (Scent)Eugenol (Essential oil)Farnesol (Essential oil/insect repellent)","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WBAKY0BU6GFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB865F8#wasThisHelpful","R2WBAKY0BU6GFG","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using the Nature Babycare Eco Fragrance-Free Wipes as eyelid wipes at the end of the day. I have ocular rosacea, which has a tendency to make it feel like you have sand or an eyelash in your eye when there is nothing there. Oil-based eye drops a few times a day, warm compresses twice a day, and keeping the eyelids clean is essential. So far, I haven't found a gentle eye lid wipe that I like, so I gave these fragrance-free wipes a chance.I have to say they're great. I am not fond of the smell. While they are fragrance-free, they do have a slightly chemical-like smell. It's not quite the smell of alcohol, of which there is none in Naty SE's wipes, but it's reminiscent of that kind of smell. Ingredients, however, may concern some parents. I, personally, think only a trace amount might get into a child through the act of wiping their body, but that some of the ingredients have been found to be problematic is something to consider. It really all depends on a parents' personal opinions. Given that, here is the information that I think parents really need.Within the wipes are:WaterGlycerinSorbitan caprylate, which is apparently a preservativeDecyl glucoside (Surfactant)Propanediol (Preservative/Humectant)Benzoic acid (Disinfectant)Aloe extractChamomile extractCitric acid (Preservative)Sodium benzoate (Preservative)Potassium sorbate (Preservative)Sodium citrate (Preservative)I have not found these wipes to dry out my skin, but I also put on an eye cream after wiping the eyelids, so that may counteract any dryness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAM4SJP0T8VOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGTUILK#wasThisHelpful","RAM4SJP0T8VOL","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fekkai PRX is meant to improve the quality of your hair in three days. It's been a cold, windy winter and even though I know it's horrible for my hair, mornings tend to be a rush with me walking the dog in the bitter cold with damp hair. My hair has really been dry and frizzy, and conditioners that usually work for me haven't helped. I do have one spray bottle of Argan Oil that has helped with the frizz, so that's my basis for comparison in this review.The InstructionsIt's pretty easy to overlook the instructions. They are in very small print on the back of the package. If you're like me and getting older is making it harder to read tiny print without magnifying glasses, you're going to need to grab a pair for this kit.Basically, you shake one of the spray tubes, spray half of it onto your damp hair, put the activation cap (it's included and from all I can see is just a shower cap) on your head, and then wait 5 to 10 minutes.Remove the activation cap, rinse it out for the next day's use, and dry/style your hair as desired.ResultsI did not condition my hair on the days I used Fekkai. The first day, the improvements were noticeable. My curls were manageable and there was no frizz. I did not see any noticeable improvements beyond that first day, however. I've actually kept using it for five days now and find that my hair looks best on days when I both condition it and use the Fekkai.With that in mind, I'm not convinced that this product is any better than the bottle of One 'N Only Argan Oil Spray I already have. In fact, I found that when washing my hair the next day, the Fekkai left in my hair felt slick and greasy. I could feel the coating on my hair. I'm not sure I love that aspect. To put it in perspective, it felt like getting out of a tub that had a bath oil bead in it, I could feel the water beading up and sliding right off. To me, that's not ideal. It made me feel like I needed to wash my hair twice to get the oil out of it.I've noticed since that the Amazon page for Fekkai says a little goes a long way and to use sparingly, while the instructions on the back of the box said to use a full tube on long, thick hair, which is what I have. I've been using half a tube, but given the ""use sparingly comment,"" I'm confused now with if I'm really using the right amount.At no point did my hair look greasy, but it certainly feels that way when I wet it down in the shower. When dry, it simply feels soft and manageable. However, the difference in price between the One 'N Only that I am currently using vs. the Fekkai is a big factor for me. One 'N Only is half the price for six ounces compared to 1.5 ounces with the Fekkai.Scent & IngredientsI do like the scent. It's barely noticeable, though I have a cold so it may be stronger than I'm picking up, but it's a mild vanilla scent. My kids and husband said they can't smell much either, so I don't think it's just my cold impacting me.Ingredients are:WaterCyclopentasiloxane (Conditioner/Silicon-based)Denatured Alcohol (From what I can find, it is used to prevent foaming or improve viscosity)Dimethicone (Anti-foaming agent)Pentylene Glycol (Humectant)C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (Emollient)Argan Oil  (Conditioner)FragrancePanthenol (Conditioner)Cetrimonium Chloride (Conditioner)Hydroxypropyltrimonium Honey (Conditioner)Sodium Benzoate (Preservative)Tetrasodium EDTA (Preservative)Tocopheryl Acetate (Conditioner)Benzophenone-4 (Sunscreen)Phenoxyethanol (Preservative)Citric Acid (Anti-static/frizz agent)Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Sunscreen)Colorings - Violet and Blue (Product is a cornflower blue, so clearly that's what the dyes are for.

I really wish Purina would start getting their meats here in the U.S.My dog loves jerky. It's his favorite treat. Given that, I had high hopes for the simple, two-ingredient Waggin' Train Chicken Jerky. He does love it, I won't deny that, but that the packaging clearly states the product is made in China, I am not as comfortable feeding it to him. Purina does say that safety measures are taken from egg to final product, and I hope that's true, but given all of the tragic outcomes from a few years ago, as much as my dog loves these treats, I can't get past being uncomfortable feeding them to him.Given that, I can only give them a two. If my dog's opinion is the only thing that matters, he'd go for a five.-----------------------------------Purina left a comment and I want to respond to it.I appreciate that Purina assures me the treats are safe. This article goes a step further into discussing changes that were made. http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/nestl-purina-reviving-waggin-train-after-withdrawal/article_ffe8919d-fff5-5b5b-b14b-92c89eec9ec7.html. That said, I'm still iffy on feeding any of my pets foods that come from places where the regulations differ to what I would want. They may be safe, they may not. I just know that our three-year-old cat died a number of years ago. His kidneys shut down and our vet couldn't find a cause and figured it might have just been a kidney issue that was present from birth. We didn't have the money to keep having more and more tests completed and I hated seeing him worsen while new theories were investigated. It's enough to make me extra cautious about what I give my pets..","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OY3G0WLAMBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ROZAL0I#wasThisHelpful","R39OY3G0WLAMBY","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a cat who is smaller than she should be. Our vet said to feed her extra, but she hates dry food and the only canned foods she's ever been enthusiastic about seem to have been discontinued. Short of raw meat she'll eat when I'm preparing dinner, she's never been big on eating much. She came from a home where Dad's was the food of choice, and I simply will not feed my cats food of that poor quality.While she's no longer a kitten, after talking to her vet, he said the kitten food's higher fat content may help get to her ideal weight. These are the biggest problems we face, if a canned food has liver in it, she hates it, and if it is pate, she's not touching it. Most canned foods have liver and many more are pate vs. flakes, chunks, or mince.Nutro's Kitten Salmon Entree is a mince. I'd seen it in stores, but avoided it because of the liver. I wish now I'd given it a chance. She loves this food. Two days into it and she'll happily eat it. She comes running as soon as I open a can.Top Five Ingredients:SalmonChicken BrothPork BrothChickenChicken LiverFrom what I can tell from the can, all ingredients are sourced in the United States, and the food is made in the United States.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9V33CCWODJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TI6X0UO#wasThisHelpful","RF9V33CCWODJ8","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog and cats do much better drinking from a fountain than they do a bowl. My dog, however, refuses to drink if it is a waterfall effect. When I noticed he loved my friend's cats' fountain, I opted to get him the dog version. It holds about a gallon and a half, which is way more than he needs, but it at about seven-inches high, it is the ideal height for him.Setting It UpI went to wash it before use, and it took a bit to get the center blue cover off so that I could remove the shipping plastic. I had to force it, and the instructions were of no use. In the end, the force didn't hurt anything, but it felt wrong having to force the clips that were not giving at all. The entire blue top removed easily, but you need that center piece out to access the filter.Once I'd gotten the filter out and rinsed and the shipping plastic removed, the rest was easy. I washed and dried all of the parts, put the pump in place, filled it up, put the lids in place, and then filled it to the line on the blue cover. Plugged it in from there, and water started flowing. My dog hesitantly began drinking the water, so I think the size threw him off a bit. Since then, he's been drinking far more from this unit than he ever did with his Drinkwell fountain.My friend says she has to replace the pump yearly. It will fill up with hairs and food particles, so I use a baby bottle brush to remove things that my fingers or the scrub pad cannot reach. Part of the pump does snap off to make it easier to clean the filter. After a couple weeks though, this fountain has been much better at getting my dog to drink enough water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CR12J1FZLA4K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OHQUUY#wasThisHelpful","R3CR12J1FZLA4K","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The GForce Universal Stand is ideal for anyone who brings their tablet into the kitchen, as I do. I don't like leaving the tablet on the counter where I might splash or spill an ingredient. At the same time, I need it nearby to look at the next measurement or step in a recipe. This stand holds my Galaxy (7-inch) perfectly, at just the right angle, and the metal frame is high enough that the tablet is protected from any liquid that might get spilled.The frame itself is impressive. As previously mentioned, it is made of metal, though there are plastic parts, too. Everything is durable and will not bend or crack if it is misused. In fact, I think to damage this in any way, you would need a sledgehammer and a lot of force, it's that strong.

"I usually love Pocky. We have a local store that sells the chocolate and strawberry variety. I love green tea, so I expected the Pocky Matcha Green Tea biscuit sticks to be another unique, yet tasty treat. Sadly, I could not get even one stick of Pocky down.The biscuit itself is yummy. It's cracker-like, not overly sweet, and I love that in a cookie/biscuit. I do not like overly sweet items, and that's one of the reasons I do love Pocky so much. That said, the cream coating is what turned this flavor of Pocky into a big miss. The coating has the consistency of white chocolate, but to me the tea flavor tasted far more like spinach than green tea, and there was a grassy smell I couldn't get past. I am one of the few out there who hates the smell of freshly cut grass, and I found these were slightly reminiscent of that. Now, I love spinach, but not in a sweetened cream white chocolate form. In the end, I found the Matcha Green Tea flavoring came off as a mix of spinach, herbs, grass and some sweetness.

"Keep Kleenex on hand while you read Paper Things. Geared towards readers age 10 or older, this book certainly held my attention.Ari's mom died when she was in 2nd grade. Now at the age of 11, Ari and her older brother, Gage, have been living with their guardian. Gage and the guardian are not getting along, but their mother made them promise that they would always stay together. When 19-year-old Gage decides to move out, he takes Ari with them. What their guardian doesn't know is that the apartment Gage has lined up doesn't really exist. To get an apartment, you must have a steady income. To get a job and steady income, you must have an address. Without either of those things, Gage and Ari are about to face some of the biggest challenges they've ever faced.Paper Things broaches a few topics that I think are good to mention. Ari and Gage bounce from home to home, staying with Gage's friends and coworkers, sometimes having to stay in shelters. The things Ari sees, all while trying to maintain decent grades in school and hide her current state of homelessness from her peers, it makes for very emotional reading.You'll find yourself rooting for Ari and even Gage. As a result, I couldn't put the book down until I knew if they would actually achieve their goals. I can see both middle school and high school boys and girls really enjoying this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IAMQ7FBAX5FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0763663239#wasThisHelpful","R3IAMQ7FBAX5FH","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While my cats are indoor cats only, they have picked up fleas. Our last infestation occurred when my son's friend came over and his parents do not believe in treating pets with flea preventative. They also do not take care of the fleas that are in their home. They put down lemon oil in hopes of driving them away. It doesn't work effectively. So, two years ago, middle of December, and we suddenly found our pets scratching and found our worst nightmare - fleas.Since then, I treat all three pets year-round. Frontline Plus is one my veterinarian recommended due to the product's effectiveness in our area. Sentry Fiproguard Plus contains the same ingredients as Frontline - I checked - and is less expensive.So far, my cats have had no reaction to the topical preventative. I didn't expect they would, but I was still on alert. It went on easily, dried within a couple hours, and now more than a day later, they still have had no unusual side effects. I can't say for certain how the flea protections works as it is still winter, but if it works as well as Frontline (which it should since the ingredients and percentages are the same), this will be an excellent alternative to the more expensive Frontline. As a result, I'm sold.I will be back with an update if Sentry should fail to keep the fleas away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WC6ZCL59447C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CNXU#wasThisHelpful","R2WC6ZCL59447C","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought I'd say I like a nutritional shake mix, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I'm impressed. This has to be the weirdest combination - pea protein, hemp protein, veggies like broccoli and spinach, flax seed, maca, and then fruits like apples, pomegranate, etc. In the past, any nutritional shake I've tried has been too grainy for my liking. That was definitely not the case here.The PreparationI've been using cashew milk to make this. The unsweetened one that Silk offers. My first attempt yesterday afternoon was to mix it in with a spoon and that was an epic fail. I tried shaking it next and that still left some clumps. This morning, I used the food processor (no blender in this house) and that ended up being the smartest way to mix it and remove all the clumps.The TasteThe taste is where things get weird. I didn't hate it. The color is clearly off-putting. It came out an almost split pea soup green when mixed with the cashew milk. But, color doesn't bother me. I also don't mind the taste of stevia, though the rest of my household hates it. In this shake, it's there, but the vanilla balances it. The weird thing is that it ended up tasting like I would imagine a French Vanilla sugar cookie made with ground ramen noodles in place of flour would taste. There was the aftertaste that reminded me of ramen noodles. It's not horribly unpleasant - kind of nutty and wheat-y at the same time. I'm sure the nutty taste comes from the cashew milk, the ramen noodles I'm not sure though. Maybe that's what Maca tastes like or maybe it came from the flax or hemp.What mattered most is that I drank the entire glass and didn't struggle to do so. I'm not a fussy eater by any means, but I've yet to find a nutritional shake that was good for me and didn't have an objectionable taste or texture. This one didn't.Given initial impressions, I would be eager to try the other flavors and see what I think of them. I work from home, but usually that means 12 hour days managing a team. I have a bad tendency to skip meals because it takes too long to prepare something. This shake took seconds and is something I could sip while working, making it a double win!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRU0DO7T4MKGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y12SS#wasThisHelpful","RRU0DO7T4MKGZ","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's still below zero at night, but the days are at least in the 20s, so we pulled out the grill this week and put the Cuisinart grilling thermometer to the test. I did grilled chicken, something that does take time and attention to the temperature to prevent eating uncooked chicken. We currently own a Bradley Smoker grilling thermometer, so that's my basis for the comparison.UsageMy Bradley thermometer works well, but the instructions were lacking and it took a bit to figure out how to use all of its function. That's not the case with the Cuisinart. The product guide is easy to follow and covered everything without any confusion. I could have used this thermometer without having to rely on instructions, it's that good.TemperaturesBoth accurately give the temperature of the meat. I tested with both and used my instant digital thermometer as a back up and all three matched within a couple tenths of a degree. They also both have magnets, though I did find the magnet on the Bradley Smoker unit is a little stronger, but the Cuisinart still stuck to the grill's lid. Now, the Cuisinart does say you can leave the thermometer on your grill permanently. I won't do that given the weather extremes. Maybe in a warmer, drier climate I'd be more willing to do that.Need BatteriesThe one thing that you should note is that the Cuisinart thermometer does not come with the required batteries. You'll need 2 AAA batteries. My other came with the one AA battery. Make sure you have batteries on hand and this won't be a problem.Final NotesThere is ample wire for the Cuisinart, so you have the meat on the grill and have plenty of length for the probe, even with the lid shut. I found the length of this wire was pretty similar to the Bradley that is 30 inches.That said, given that this Cuisinart is more expensive, I'm not sure it would be my first choice. It's good, but sometimes the brand name alone isn't enough to justify a higher price.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXZ27DWNDY5O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0GX6B0#wasThisHelpful","R3QXZ27DWNDY5O","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This two pair set is ideal for any wiring project you might have around your home. We've been replacing light fixtures and electrical outlets and the wire strippers/cutters my husband has have not been ideal for some of these fixtures. The nose of the cutters he has are too wide. The narrower nose on the darker pair has been extremely helpful.Four-in-One With the Two Pair SetOTC's Crimpro set contains the two tools. First, each cutters/stripper has strippers/crimpers for different gauges. The smallest these handle is 12 gauge while the largest is 20 gauge, and they work with both insulated and non-insulated wires. The tools themselves are solid, not too heavy, and right now it seems that they will stand up to regular use without wearing out.Both tools have teeth that make it easy to grip the wire. With the solid grip, pulling or bending/twisting the wire is a breeze. The handles are comfortable, and as previously stated, the narrower head has been great for working in tight areas, such as wall outlets.My Husband's POVMy husband works with cable on a daily basis. He works for a company that manufactures the wiring you find in cars, computers, planes, military equipment, solar panels, etc. I think his statement sums up OTC Crimpro's wire service set perfectly. ""I wish my company would invest in a set of these for each of the workers. These are superior to the wire strippers/cutters we're expected to use. They're more comfortable, cut much more cleanly, and have the strippers for the different gauges, making them the best tool for what I do every day.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2K9AV3CQAJS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K7VK5EI#wasThisHelpful","R1W2K9AV3CQAJS","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's the publisher's line stating ""Recalling the wit and emotion of Maeve Binchy"" that caught my attention. I love her novels and have been excited to find an author who writes with her panache.Her Name is Rose introduces widow Iris Bowen. Since her husband died of cancer, Iris has been a single mom to teen Rose. Rose is currently away in London having been accepted into London's Royal Academy of Music. When Iris receives news that there is something troubling in her mammogram results, she begins to consider her husband's request. Find Rose's birth mom so that Rose always has family.Thus begins Iris's quest to uncover the truth of what happened to Rose's birth mom. This brings Iris to Boston where her quest will uncover some surprising truths about the past and the present.I liked the premise for Her Name is Rose, but the fluidity of the book ended up being my downfall. Rose has her own issues going on at school and they seemed thrown in. I didn't get the importance, but I kept reading. As Iris headed to Boston and started meeting characters, I started really losing track of the who is who aspect and had to stop and take notes to keep the characters straight. Any time I have to stop and take notes, it starts to bog down the story. Then there were the switches back and forth between these characters and that also detracted from a Iris's story for me.Once I had the characters straight, the story did pick back up and interest me, but by that point, I felt it was almost too late. I never felt overwhelmed with emotion, as I'd expected, and what could have been a marvelous read turned into just an okay one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BCKGOR4X1OVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250054214#wasThisHelpful","R1BCKGOR4X1OVP","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never thought I would need to protect my pets against fleas and ticks in the winter, especially given Vermont's proclivity to have below zero nights in a row in January. However, I learned quickly a few years ago when all of our pets became infested with fleas in December. It turned out that one of our son's friends has multiple dogs and the parents do not believe in flea treatments, so their dogs and their cat are infested. He came to visit and with him came at least one flea that went forth and multiplied. We got rid of the fleas here and options became treat our pets year-round or ban this kid from our house. As much as I'd like to ban him (I really hate fleas), it's not fair to him. He cannot control his parents' beliefs.Active IngredientsSentry Fiproguard Plus has the same ingredients as Frontline Plus: 9.8% Fipronil and 8.8% s-methoprene. Frontline Plus is what we used to get rid of the flea infestation. It worked effectively, and since using it we haven't had deer ticks get on our dog anymore either, which is an added plus because I cannot stand deer ticks. I find them repulsive and hate pulling them off our pets.ApplicationThis is my first time using Sentry Fiproguard Plus. It went on easily. Cut the tip off the tube and then separate the pets fur and squirt the liquid in the vial in a strip between the dog's shoulder blades. Be sure you don't touch the area for about a day while it dries. Though my experience is that the liquid is usually dry within a few hours. If you forget, wash your hands with soap and water.The CostThe price for the 6-count package of Sentry Fiproguard is much more affordable than Frontline Plus. My vet sells it for $60 a three pack. I don't buy it from our vet. You can get it at Petco, Petsmart for $53/cat and $56/dog for a three pack. Walmart is generally best and sells it for $39 here, again a three-pack. The price for the six-pack of Sentry Fiproguard becomes a much better deal.OverallThe price puts Sentry in the lead. I'll need to use this for the long-term (through Spring and Summer) to really decide if it is as effective as I hope it will be. At that point, I'll update the review. For now, however, we still haven't seen any fleas, it didn't affect my dog's skin, and given the price, I give it a thumbs up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10OAN7VKU6MLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QO2CN8A#wasThisHelpful","R10OAN7VKU6MLL","A32RYIYZOQDBQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32RYIYZOQDBQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I can't find fault with this movie. Beautifully shot, nuanced yet powerful acting, and complex characters and story-line. It made me tear up a bit actually at one point which happens once in a blue moon while watching movies. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Not just because it based on an important historical event (that spurred me to do further reading). Not just because it was restrained yet commanding art. Not just because it was simply a pleasure to watch and riveting entertainment. But because Belle's struggles are not unique to herself, they are felt by anyone who ever feels the odd man out. Her dignity, class, intelligence and courage was frankly an inspiration. Exceptional art.**After reading a few negative reviews, I feel compelled to add that it's true that Belle is nowhere near as gritty or as ""edgy"" as it could be considering its serious subject matter. It could have easily added much more explicit content. The thing is--it didn't need to. I think it told the story it was trying to tell without needing explicit content. It frankly would have been an entirely different movie if they did. One I would probably watch and enjoy--but a different movie.

"The second season of Da Vinci's Demons finds Da Vinci pretty much exactly where the first season left off. The main plot of the second season revolves around Da Vinci traveling to the New World (the Americas) in quest of the Book of Leaves (a super mystical book of great value) and in search of more information about his missing Mother. While Da Vinci's two sidekicks and frenemy Riario do in fact come on the trip with him--I couldn't help but keep wishing Da Vinci was back in Florence interacting with the ever cunning Lucrezia and the Medici family. Simply, my favorite characters spent very little time together for almost the entire season so I was constantly sorta disappointed. I wanted the trip to the Americas to last maybe three episodes, and instead it lasted practically the entire season.That said, this season did push things in the right direction not to mention was suspenseful and exciting in its own right. Da Vinci's back story is more fleshed out. The minor plotlines were deserving of attention and I can't wait till they collide with the main plot (especially the whole real Pope/fake Pope story). I have no doubt the intrigue and frankly sensuality of the first season will be back in season three now that the main cast is all back together on the same continent. For fans of Game of Thrones, Tudors, Borgias and even Sherlock Holmes.

"My mother is an extremely talented musician, and used to play the guitar frequently when she was younger. However, her hands are a bit older now, and she's discovered that playing the ukulele is simply much softer and less abrasive on her fingers than her guitar. I bought her this one as Christmas present about four years ago when she was just starting to play around with the ukulele. Though she has since moved on to a higher quality uke, she actually still plays this one regularly about once a week to a group of 3 year old children--who she occasionally lets play it as well. For all of the negative comments about quality or build, this thing has stood up to these weekly sessions with those kids and still is in just about the same condition from when I bought it four years ago.Also, while I imagine a more serious musician could tell the sound isn't quite as full bodied as it should be, most people literally won't be able to tell the difference between the sound from this ukulele and a much more expensive one. And if you're just playing it as a one off, breaking it out occasionally at parties, or like my mother and playing it for children---then I would completely recommend going with this option instead of something more expensive. For most uses, it gets the job done and is solid construction on top of that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R187G4VZAHP07L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00172UV6S#wasThisHelpful","R187G4VZAHP07L","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To preface this review: reviewing things like this on Amazon is a little weird for me. I'm definitely from a family where you just don't talk about underwear in public. But I've come to realize that if nobody ever talks about things like underwear or a favorite brand of tampons--then this just makes things pointlessly difficult for all women when we should all be learning from each other instead.So what was the occasion for needing something backless and strapless? An evening out at a friend's birthday dinner in an LBD.What I liked about these? First, they were great in not letting anything hang out/show through (my personal need from every bra, the ones that are too thin to do this annoy me), and they stuck on and stayed on all night in the same place. No dancing though, so basically minimal activity, but they felt secure enough that I doubt they would have moved even if I had been breaking it down. If you were wearing a structured top, or something with support below like a sash, I think it's a good bet that these would stay on for basically any normal or mildly exerting activity. Also, unlike other options, these actually provided lift as well as put in a bit extra (since they are kind of gel-ish packs) thus creating enhanced cleavage.What bothered me? It felt like my chest was being held by jelly hands for most of the night. It was cold and they weren't at body temperature so I could always feel that they were there on my chest. This wasn't an awful feeling, but just something to consider if wearing them on a cold night. Also, If you were dancing/sweating majorly/doing something acrobatic--I'm not sure the adhesive would be strong enough to hold them on securely.In my case though, they did what they needed to do for the night--and I will definitely be bringing them back out when it's a little warmer. As for being able to use more than once, they definitely retained their stick and shape well enough for me to foresee being able to get several uses out of them. Probably best to wear with a structured, backless dress and not go crazy with them though. Also, I was grateful for the very discreet packaging.Note: Sample bra provided by Nudwear. This review is my honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10RVB22D22EB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DO9ZHVG#wasThisHelpful","R10RVB22D22EB2","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To say that I was excited about this album release is an understatement. Much like Nicki did in the years leading up to dropping ""Pink Friday"", Angel has been generating a tremendous buzz by featuring on countless singles as well as releasing several critically acclaimed mixtapes (like ""Reservation"") over the past four years. However, with much buzz comes much scrutiny and a high potential for dashed hopes. After several full playthroughs though, I'm actually quite satisfied with the approach Angel took with taking her talent to the mainstream music world on this major label debut. ""Dirty Gold"" has its fair share of ""softer"" more  pop songs, yet Angel manages to mix them with hardcore rapping and deeply personal lyrics to make for one of the most exciting albums of 2013.""A Tribe Called Red"" is some of the hardest flo from any rapper in 2013--female or male. ""Black Synagogue"" is a similarly intense track with heavy religious imagery and philosophical life questions. Angel's family was involved with a cult like offshoot of the Pentecostal church for most of her childhood and you can really hear how she's struggled to intelligently and emotionally come to grips with this. ""Angels & Airwaves"" achieves a near perfect rap/pop balance of strait hard emotional rapping and beautiful ethereal hooks. ""Battle Cry"" featuring Sia is another standout that rightfully draws comparisons to ""Love the Way you Lie"".The one thing about this album that has really stayed with me though is how heartbreakingly authentic and real Angel sounds. Despite normally disliking talking bits mixed in with actual tracks, I actually really like some of the spoken intros to several songs. Angel certainly has her bragging moments, but by in large is focused on real life issues including her childhood, sexual abuse, insecurities, expectations and religion.  So often I feel like female rappers are pandering heavily to their male audience by being excessively sensual or ditzy. And despite Angel being like model status pretty, her lyrics focus not on her body but on life which I find refreshing and empowering. This combined with the genuine technical skill and catchy music already make ""Dirty Gold"" head and shoulders above most debut albums.Now is this album perfect--of course not. There are some duds and Angel clearly needs to continue evolving a unique musical perspective. But there is much here to be excited about. The least of which is Angel's commitment to her music which led her to leak her album herself after her label kept pushing it back--forcing the label to honor the earlier release dates.This is an album that has staying power for me--emotionally and musically, and Angel just firmly established herself a heavyweight in the rap world. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPUEXNQ2RFW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLAH6GI#wasThisHelpful","R3PPUEXNQ2RFW6","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You"" is certainly a mouthful of a title, yet is actually a very succinct indication of what headspace and direction Neko went for with this album. Neko primarily wrote this album during a period of unexpected dark depression stemming from the deaths of several family members. In songs like ""Where Did I Leave the Fire"", you can hear the disconnect and isolation in her voice and lyrics. Neko is simply too fine of a songwriter to fall back on cliched tropes like ""I'm feeling lost"" though. Instead she paints sensual stories that are visual representations of more abstract and complicated feelings like not feeling bad about a parent's death and not knowing how to process that or what that says about her as a person.Bracing for Sunday"" is a particular favorite. It's a modern interpretation of a traditional Celtic murder ballad with Neko's alternative rock/country twist. ""Nearly Midnight, Honolulu"" is all acapella and is a positively heartbreaking look into Neko's relationship with her (now dead) abusive and manipulative mother. ""Ragtime"" is an inspiring end to the main album, as it is Neko's ode to the one music genre that was able to give her joy in the midst of her depression. The horns are a great touch that I hope Neko experiments more with in the future.In many ways, this album doesn't stray that far musically from what people have come to expect from Neko (fantastic vocals, effective alternative country/rock), but this is hands down some of her most gutsy and naked songwriting. And recognizing what an achievement that is when one is already one of the most respected modern songwriters, that makes this album a must listen as well as another cornerstone in Neko's lasting musical legacy.Very enjoyable, with plenty of musical range. Would definitely recommend to fans to add this album to the collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEW1BUU976VG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENIBJE6#wasThisHelpful","RXEW1BUU976VG","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit to not actually loving Bobby's past two studio albums, and yet I've happily bought both of them as well as this one without even listening to a single track. Sound pretty dumb come to think of it--but it's my way of supporting/saying thank you for his numerous mixtapes which he releases for free and are just as high production quality as his studio albums with the added benefit of stronger music as well. And to be honest, I feel about the same about this album as the past two studio ventures--decent yet not that exciting and certainly not as powerful as some of his mixtapes.I really do hate to be that person who goes on about the mixtapes and disses the studio albums, and yet I've always felt the more experimental and real side of Bobby is lacking on his studio efforts. That's not to say this album is bad though. Bobby writes catchy rap music that relies on his wide range of experience with rock and pop to create very current and unique music. He can rap, sing, write, play multiple instruments and is simply much more a musician and artist than almost all other mainstream rappers.Bobby has always been able to pick collaborators that compliment him well, and this album is no exception. The always welcome Ester Dean appears on ""Wide Open"", but it's the addition of another favorite of mine, Priscilla Renea, on ""John Doe"" that is really standout. Priscilla is a great match up for Bobby as she also is another very talented musician who dabbles in hip hop and R&B from time to time, yet can sing over anything from rock to adult contemporary pop. ""Cranberry Moonwalk"" with Mike Fresh is also another great collaboration.""One Day"" has a short interview clip at the end regarding Bobby's childhood, and his positive attitude on his rough upbringing is really admirable. My favorite song though is probably still ""We in This...""  which he actually released on an old 2012 mixtape so it's not exactly new for me. That song though should indicate the general direction of many of the songs here though. This album is much more ""gangsta rap"" heavy than his previous ones.Still, I'm glad I can support Bobby and several songs (mainly his collaborations) will definitely make it into my ""work commute"" playlist. I would check out the singles to see what appeals. For fans of Chiddy Bang, Tinie Tempah, Labrinth and Wale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R305KBHV8VXW8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4EXO4K#wasThisHelpful","R305KBHV8VXW8A","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be honest, I'm generally extremely wary of shows like ""Top of the Lake."" In the past I've found them to be boring, pretentious, poorly done not to mention often needlessly depressing. I just kept seeing such great reviews for it though, and eventually thought, ""why not, watching the first episode can't hurt."" Reader be warned. You won't be able to just watch the first episode. About a day later, you will find yourself with bleary eyes and the realization that you just watched one of the finest  contributions to film of the year.To start off, it's not boring in the slightest which really makes no sense as a basic read of the plot would indicate that it should be. The essentials are that a young girl becomes pregnant, goes missing, and then the main character who is a detective spends the rest of the series talking to people trying to figure out what happened to the girl. However, writer and director Jane Campion has a brilliant ability to really draw out the major events and sustain the tension throughout long periods without big action sequences. She uses atmosphere and psychology to keep things riveting even when it's just two people talking to each other. Despite much of the major plot twists happening off-screen actually, Campion frames these events through the people who they affect and in turn these events take on a deeper meaning than if you saw them on-screen.As far as atmosphere and cinematography, ""Top of the Lake"" is positively stunning. Filmed in entirely on location in New Zealand, Campion doesn't need CGI or tricks for high impact--she let's the scenery speak for itself. This is no low budget production either. The quality of picture and color rivals that of any summer blockbuster.Now, this series does deal with some very heavy topics. Obviously, pedophilia is discussed--but so are a host of other things. Cancer, a parent's lies, incest, rape, sexism, misogyny, mental illness, clinical depression and organized crime all get the full treatment. Herein lies Campion's true gift. She somehow is able to craft the story and characters in such a way as to not drown the watcher in such a bleak and awful world and yet doesn't hold back from her subject matter either. Campion is also able to present these topics in a way that seems natural and integral to the story, instead of esoteric and pretentious.Holly Hunter's ""GJ"" character who is sort of a therapist/hippie/con artist/cult leader, did sometimes come across as a little over the top for me. Yet I could see how important her character was to the story and even the plot in spurring others to action.In short, this miniseries is gorgeous with stunning acting and a plot that is very dark yet won't overwhelm either. It should be obvious that this is most certainly not something for kids, but I would imagine almost all other age groups would find something to both enjoy as well as really contemplate. To often I find film to be used as a method for simply communication or entertainment, but it's the rare film that is all those things as well as art. And this is in fact one of those rare films that is both entertaining and provoking as well as exquisitely crafted art. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5TRGYALZ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMT0HHQ#wasThisHelpful","R5TRGYALZ7K","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my friends is from Hawaii and is always posting about local Poly bands. Sometime last year she started raving about this song, and I was immediately hooked. It steals a musical foundation of more traditional Poly music, but overlays tight R&B vocals to make a really standout song. It's just so chill and the lead singer has a fantastic range.

"Buying relatively expensive items (like over $10) online always makes me wary. You just can't be sure of what exactly you're going to receive. I'm so grateful to every single person who wrote great reviews of these frames though, as it was the reviews that convinced me. And now I have a gorgeous frame that I know will be be loved when I give it as part of  Christmas present in a month.If you're expecting museum or high end art gallery framing, then these aren't for you. The ""glass"" is a thin sheet of plastic-ish material that works fine, but doesn't have quite the same reflection that a piece of high end glass would. But for most personal or home use, I can't imagine that anyone would be disappointed with these frames. My frame is sturdy yet surprisingly light given the how large it is (24x36 large and shipping info said it was about 14 lbs). The finish on the borders is quite detailed and the aged gold texture looks almost real. Simply, the frame looks and feels expensive.I bought the ""Aged Ornate Gold"" frame, which has a leather like border between the two wrought gold outer borders. I was impressed at how the middle section does genuinely look like leather from a distance, as the entire frame is all wood. I haven't used the back ""hook"" feature (and won't because this is a present for someone else), but I can tell that all the appropriate pieces are there and it looks sound in principal.Great purchase, and would recommend for anyone wanting a classy frame without wanting to pay hundreds of dollars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHT48ZZURNQZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQT9B2A#wasThisHelpful","RHT48ZZURNQZS","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***I just want to clarify something: I am not vested in any particular party and am speaking simply as a voracious reader and intelligent human being.  I have quite strong feelings about this, and want to be clear though that I am an ""outside third party.""***After chancing upon Rebecca Musser's ""The Witness Wore Red: The 19th Wife Who Brought Polygamous Cult Leaders to Justice"", I read it in a few hours and was intrigued to do further research in the FLDS world. After reading her little sister's book and a few other books, I chanced upon this one. As  Rebecca's book was actually quite similar to that of other ex members of the FLDS cult--I was intrigued in what exactly this alleged ""brother Cole"" was calling her out on as much of her story is public record and the rest has been attested to from several sources. Despite Cole hiding behind an alias, it does in fact seem as if this is the real Cole that Rebecca refers to throughout her book.However, after reading his ""book"" (really just a few pages of rambling and not a book at all)--I've come to several conclusions. Most importantly is that Cole doesn't call into question any major events from happening, simply the perspective of those events. As in, he doesn't say that Rebecca wasn't married to the 85 year old Prophet---but that she wasn't forced into the marriage.  He does go into some details over more minor events like he says he was never planning with her to help her escape, but frankly these so called repudiations either don't make sense, could have easily been misremembered or misinterpreted, or seem like its literally just a matter of a different perspective.Alleging that the events Rebecca described in her book as ""lies"" or ""just a story"" is an incredibly serious accusation. At first, I was just going to write this review to comment on Cole's issues with Rebecca's book--but the more I think about what he wrote, the angrier I get. Here's why.* It seems Cole's biggest complaint is that he doesn't believe that 19 year old Becky was ""forced"" into her marriage at all, as well as greatly enjoyed her time there with her 85 year old husband. He concedes that she was ""brainwashed"" but did not have misgivings about the marriage. I have several problems with this. Firstly, Cole was basically out of the picture by the time Becky was married. By his own account in this book, he was soon kicked out of the church and was considered an apostate.  I find it a huge overreach for Cole to assume any firsthand knowledge of a marriage that he was not a part of or in a position to literally know anything as he wasn't even in communication with Becky for the bulk of her marriage. Cole may have left the cult, and yet you can still see its insidious belief system in his way of thinking.* Cole's proof of Rebecca being ""okay"" with the marriage boils down to a single conversation he had with her and a random insert from another sister ""Amelia"". I'm not going to question whether either conversation happened--but will merely point out that two conversations if true, cannot disprove Rebecca's side of the story. It doesn't matter in the slightest whether or not Rebecca confided to her siblings at this time the thoughts she was having or whether she put on a happy face to ""keep sweet."" Giving them the benefit of the doubt--this is how they saw things. Doesn't mean at all that this was true from Rebecca's side of things. Cole pointedly doesn't mention the other conversations Rebecca had with her parents about her fears.* Cole repeatedly calls out his sister as being essentially an egotistical princess who loved her time in the Prophet's house/enjoyed being treated like royalty.  This more than slightly blows my mind. Again--he wasn't there so has zero credibility. Also, the things he talks about as being wonderful are frankly ridiculous.  Having access to a credit card means nothing when you're being monitored and your purchases tracked. Who cares if you get to ride in a private plane from time to time if you are not in control of where it is going.* The fact that he thinks these things would matter or somehow trump being sexually assaulted by someone old enough to be one's great grandfather and having no freedom of movement is both astonishing as well as clearly shows how little he values women. Blaming him is hard as this is what he was indoctrinated with since birth, but its no excuse. And to assume that a woman would or even should be happy as long as she has the trappings of some material comforts shows a total disregard for women as real people and is essentially reducing them to whores. This incredibly dangerous and appalling thinking  is a foundational element of rape culture and should be recognized as such.* As a last thought on this, women in the FLDS world were taught to keep their emotions hidden (to ""keep sweet"") and did not have honest conversations regarding things like rape. In fact I'd be surprised if that term even existed much like ""sex"" wasn't a word that was ever taught to the FLDS children (it was called ""marital relations""). In short, even if Cole had been attune to the situation and was even in contact with Becky when this was happening (he wasn't--only got back in contact with her close to when she escaped), Becky wouldn't have been able to properly describe what she was really feeling to him anyway. And certainly wouldn't have gone into detail about the sexual abuse. This was simply a massive taboo topic.* The second big thing Cole says Becky lied about is that his father's first wife beating of him did not in fact cause his kidney to rupture. Rather, his kidney was simply infected. However, in the very next paragraph he writes: ""My dad's first wife would get into a jealous rage, and in that blinding rage was psychologically, verbally, and physically abusive. She would get in a state where she just wasn't thinking rationally. Nor  likely even remembering what she did in those states.""  He also states: ""I don't know what happened or what they did while I was under anesthesia."" I think this actually reinforces what Becky wrote, and at the very least doesn't ""disprove it"" as his knowledge of what happened actually came from others as he doesn't remember what happened. I'm not a doctor, but do know it's incredibly unusual for kids to get kidney infections unless there are extenuating circumstances.* As for the other ""big reveals"" of this book---there aren't any. Really, these are literally the only large issues that Cole has a problem with. He writes pages on how ""Becky knows what her lies are"" and ""how damaging this is to the family"" etc....  but doesn't provide any more detail or pinpoint any other major discrepancies. The things he mentions as being wrong all just so happen to paint him or other family members like his father in a much better light. Which honestly, I get. While Rebecca does give Cole plenty of credit for helping her start over, she also doesn't shy away from Cole's shortcomings. And I think that's the real issue here. He and quite probably his father who is described as both permitting grievous child abuse as well as later engaging in physical child abuse clearly did not enjoy this family history open to the public on a national scale. Thus this book simply becomes an effort to both discredit Rebecca over petty things that no one would be able to prove and salvage his and other specific family member's reputations.In short, I would seriously call into question Cole's perspective on everything--not just because he wasn't there for several events, or because he essentially is getting caught up on little details which do not in any way detract from Rebecca's story even if they are completely true (which I doubt)-but because Cole's fundamental perspective of this world and of women is vile and incredibly misogynistic. Ironically, several of the things Cole writes back up in fact as opposed to discredit Rebecca's account of what happened. To me this is obviously a case of a disgruntled family member who is simply upset at the attention that his two sisters have received and unhappy with how his and other family member's actions were portrayed. This book has a sensational title but zero substance.On a last note, Cole mentions that this book has not been edited and that it probably contains several errors. He wasn't kidding. This was a very hard book to read from both a grammatical as well as structural perspective. It doesn't flow well and reads like one long ramble.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AAZS3MZGZOE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GRFW622#wasThisHelpful","R3AAZS3MZGZOE5","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone blessed to have been able to follow Delta Rae from their beginning (they're from my hometown), I've been eagerly anticipating when they would finally drop some new music. And thankfully--it lives up to those expectations! (mostly)....First the good: ""Chasing Twisters"" and ""Run"" are seriously fun. The band is at their best when it's Brittany and Liz on the main vocals (both pictured on the album cover), and these two songs were tailor made for the girls' explosive vocals. The boys deserve a lot of the credit though in pushing the energy to the max. In concert, you can tell that the entire band needs and feeds off of each other's energy--and you can really feel it in this EP. (Speaking of concerts--if they are ever in your area--go, go, go. Their live show is insane.) Also, ""Dance in the Graveyards"" though on their debut, was given a fresh new arrangement that is much more in line with how they actually perform it live and is a serious step up. ""I Will Never Die"" is a near perfect end and a great sequel to the mind blowing ""Bottom of the River.""""If I Loved You"" was also on their debut, and this version with Lindsey Buckingham (of Fleetwood Mac fame) has been available for a single for a while, so if you're a fan you probably already have it. I dislike it when bands package their music 10 different ways. But honestly, my biggest complaint is not what's here--but what's not here. I was hoping/wishing/pleading that this would contain a studio recording of ""Cold Day in Heaven"" and ""Rain Down on Me."" I've seen them perform both songs live and they never fail to bring the house down. I want. I need. I crave. Please, seriously--if for some reason someone in the band ever reads this--please please please record them and put them on an album!Overall though--this is simply a very solid addition to the band's growing catalog, and is an exciting sign of what their second full album might sound like. If you love the band--buy this. For fans of Fleetwood Mac, ZZ Ward, The Avett Brothers, Wild Feathers etc... Hugely recommend and also a great introduction to the band for any newcomers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBDEQPYL9WX6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GSV6Y7I#wasThisHelpful","RBDEQPYL9WX6F","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jhen Aiko has been around for years since some features on obscure B2K remixes back in the early 2000s, but it's only recently with some guest appearances on Big Sean and Drake tracks that she's been beginning to gain momentum. Though this track still features a rapper--the witty and thoughtful Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino, Aiko shows that she can carry a song on her own instead of just dropping a chorus. This song is chill and fresh sounding R&B. However, Aiko is slightly auto tuned at times (which she totally doesn't need) as well as doesn't show off her vocal range which would have helped give this song a bit more punch. Still pleasant though, and I hope Aiko can finally get the mainstream recognition that she deserves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MOQYLVIEDSI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FYI902M#wasThisHelpful","R1MOQYLVIEDSI4","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thankfully, I have yet to test out this filter's ability to withstand damage/protect my extremely expensive lens. But I can speak to it's clarity and high build quality. I've used this on my Canon 24-105mm f/4 lens for several shoots and literally can't tell the difference between shots when this lens if off, and when it's on. I've studied side by side comparisons in detail in a variety of lighting conditions and can't tell any major difference between shots with this on and off my lens. So A+ on clarity.This also fits very well on my lens. Tight and like it was simply another part of my lens instead of being a separate piece. It also accommodates a large lens hood being placed on top of it with no problem. All the threads line up and fit perfectly. Hopefully I'll never have to discover if this can prevent my glass from cracking in event of a fall--but it's completely worth it in protect my glass from dust and scratches.

"I bought this diffuser because I wanted to upgrade from my velcro cheapo setup, and after reading several reviews of various diffusers was content I was on the right track with the LightSphere. Does it work as intended? Yes. As far as various diffusers I've been able to try out--this works comparably. However, I was expecting something a whole lot better than comparable considering that a lot of diffusers cost barely ten dollars. The construction here is quite sturdy, which I should be thrilled about as that generally means quality product---but my main problem with this diffuser is that it's actually far too sturdy. The plastic might be flexible, but it's very dense and thick. It weighs like a ton of bricks on my flash and actually can move my flash out of position when it's at a strange angle because it's literally just that heavy. At one point during a recent night shoot, I literally had to hold my flash in position so that I could get the light to bounce correctly as the diffuser just kept shifting the flash.Too expensive and very hard to use when you're constantly worrying about whether it's going to shift your flash.

"I wanted a pocket mirror for my desk at work that was simple and unobtrusive. I was pleased with the rather non super girly and classic look of this mirror, but was bummed when I finally got it. It's simply hard to open. I have to use my fingernails sometimes which is painful--and even then it still won't open on the first few tries.

"I tested this out recently on a video shoot that needed to look like it was shot at different times of the day--and the gels really helped in slightly changing the tone of my video. Also, it provided all the light I needed and more (although I was pretty close to my subjects at all times and didn't test it out over a large field or anything). I used if for about three hours of sustained shooting and it didn't get too warm either which I was worried about. I read several reviews here, and something I didn't realize until I received the light was that it comes with a battery adapter so that you're not tied down to just using AAs which is a nice touch.

"Like pretty much every teenager ever, I would latch on to bands and artists that expressed some of the confusion and angst that are practically teenage rites of passage. Eminem, Skillet, Seether, Breaking Benjamin, Flyleaf, Evanescence and Amanda Palmer just spoke to my middle school soul. As a slightly older adult now, I find myself listening to these bands less frequently as thankfully I've grown and matured--but every once in a while--there is nothing else in the world that can fit the mood. That mood when you're just told off at work by your boss, or ditched by your friends, or caught in between a fight with people you love--that feeling.Icon for Hire has now entered that rotation of bands for when I can't process my thoughts but just know I'm hurt and angry. As nice and deep as bands like Bon Iver are--sometimes you just want something to hit you in the face. Subtlety and poetic lyrics can be checked at the door. Albeit much more poppy and less explicit than many of the bands mentioned above--they're honest and hardhitting. What makes Icon different though, is the message of hope interspersed with the pain. And that's incredibly comforting. I listen to music like this not to make myself more depressed or angrier--but to process my feelings and then come down and stabilize. And Icon let's me do that and more. I can know that whatever it is, will be okay.That said--I would be into this album for the music even without the lyrics. It has influences of early 2000's pop punk groups mixed with more modern electronic synth inspired tones--with hints of hip hop. While not perfect, Icon manages to basically nail this combination which makes for very ""now"" extremely catchy music.Highly recommend. For parents looking for music that might really connect with confused teens (yet with a positive spin) or young 20 somethings just looking for cool music. For fans of more punk rock bands like Paramore, Flyleaf, Fireflight as well as fans of more pop/electronic outfits like Kerli, Krewella or even Dev.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMEP1LT4RAX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FGK4EX8#wasThisHelpful","RCMEP1LT4RAX5","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gorgeous. Film makers tend to still score movies with ""classical"" soundtracks for a reason if they have the money for original scores. There is a timeless quality to well done classical music that just can't be touched. You don't have to understand the words to be swept up in the emotion or just bask in the beauty of exquisite art. In this song, opera legends Ernest Blanc and Nicolai Gedda pair their voices for one of my favorite songs. The solo parts aren't as powerful as when they are singing together, but in a way it's worth it to build anticipation and make you appreciate the duets that much more. When they hit the high notes on the chorus together, it's just sublime. If you're like me and tend to just ""skim"" from most music genres but can appreciate opera, then I would highly recommend this song as it's extremely melodic and accessible. And for any hardcore fans of the genre, then you probably already know and love this song. However, if you haven't heard Gedda's and Blanc's interpretation then I would still pick this up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B38WML14SJCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0026BPK6K#wasThisHelpful","R2B38WML14SJCK","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you happened to have just completely loved Diane's first album and were expecting more of the same, then you might be somewhat put off by this followup. The first album drew quick comparisons to Carole King and Norah Jones, but this one is much more in the same lines as artists like Florence Welch or Adele. There's an increased emphasis on larger orchestral pieces punctuated with a strong bass line. It's darker yet more pop friendly and seems to be closer to the type of artist that Diane sees herself as.""Lighthouse"" is the first song standout (I personally would have started the album with it instead of the rather mundane ""Speak a Little Louder."" It combines synths, strong backing vocals, handclaps, hints of piano and a throbbing beat that veers between 70s pop and modern indie pop and really sets the tone for the album.  It's both darker as well as more interesting than almost all of her previous work combined.  ""Tell Me Tomorrow""  has a strong piano line but pairs it with a restrained vocal and lightly upbeat music. If you switched out the piano for a guitar, it wouldn't be out of place on a Faith Hill album.""It Plays On"" is a softer ballad that is borderline magic. Hypnotic and ragged with raw emotion--it's worth the price of the entire album. Also, I cannot stress enough that the normal cd is not what you want-get the deluxe. ""Adelaide"", ""Staring At You"", and ""Hold On A Little Longer"" are massive tracks.Some people may  be surprised to see the appearance of the ""[Explicit]"" tag after the album title, and it's due to inclusion of ""Unf*d"" which probably isn't quite what you're imagining. It's one of the few pure piano ballads on the album and is actually one of Diane's most vulnerable and likeable moments. It's honest and so very human. That said---if language isn't your thing--no need to avoid the album for literally just one track.I really could go into detail about almost all of the rest of the songs on the album. It's all just that universally consistent and interesting. Diane's lyrics continue to be a bit of a problem area though. They're not awful, just sort of generic. She's capable of more. Her father recently passed, and while you can hear the darker tone and mood to the album--I think she could have reflected this darkness a bit more in the actual lyrics as well.I thought Diane's first album was pleasant--but this one is memorable. And that's honestly one of the highest praises I can give an album. I've been blessed to have been exposed to a tremendous range as well as volume of music, and while I enjoy lots of artists--not many stay on my mind. With ""Speak A Little Louder"" though, Diane has made an indelible impression. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DTFO1ZRSW7RM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK04RCW#wasThisHelpful","R3DTFO1ZRSW7RM","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that while I remember that at the time I liked Lissie's debut album, I can't really remember any songs from it (went back and listened to it for this review). I don't think I'll have that problem with this album though. It's like Lissie took all the good from her debut, and spiked it with bolder instrumentation and even better crafted hooks. This album is right on trend with hints of 70s and 80s rock like Tom Petty or Aerosmith with a healthy channeling of Stevie Nicks, wrapped up in a bright upbeat pop/folk/rock package.Lissie's not the most witty or poetic lyricist, but what she lacks in originality--she makes up for in earnestness and a willingness to just lay it all out there. The music on this album is bold and is much better vehicle for her emotions than her more muted and acoustic debut album. The drums and groove to ""Shameless"" manage to convey a sense of youthful rebellion which Lissie pairs with the admirable declaration that: ""I don't want to be famous/If I got to be shameless."" ""Sleepwalking"" is one of my favorites with a much more chill vibe and totally relaxed chorus that you will just want to sink into like a favorite recliner. ""What It's Like"" and ""I Bet On You"" are other standout tracks.There's something maddeningly about this album though--which is that several of the best songs have bits and pieces that sounds incredibly familiar. It's not to the point where I could say ""oh song x sounds exactly like song y from back in the day."" And yet there are repeated isolated sounds that I just know I've heard before. It's not a bad thing, and quite frankly probably played no small part in my immediate enjoyment of it--but it's just continually in the back of my mind which for a music junkie is super frustrating.Taking everything into account though, this is a very pleasurable listen with big hooks that have me hitting the repeat button, and enough honesty that allows me to really connect as well. For fans artists/bands like Brandi Carlile, First Aid Kit, Alabama Shakes, 70s and 80s rockers, and Fleetwood Mac.**Update, I've been listening to this album for weeks now--and it's only gotten better actually. I find myself really digging into it at a deeper level than I do with most albums. Pleasantly surprised.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R242EESR52SE76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJG5IF2#wasThisHelpful","R242EESR52SE76","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Throw any expectations you might have had about this album right out the window. Whatever direction you thought British soul singer Vanessa (VV) Brown was going to go into after her commercially successful debut ""Traveling Like the Light""--guaranteed this is not it. In fact, you would be hard pressed to even recognize her voice. So what is this album all about, and what on earth has happened to VV?""Samson & Delilah"" is highly polarizing art pop. It's part conceptual, based loosely on the Biblical story of Samson & Delilah, and part swirling landscape of operatic/goth/experimental pop. It will either be your thing or very much not be your thing. It's the product four years of creative growth stemming from her ditching her previous label, recording an entire album which she then refused to put out as she felt it just wasn't her, creating her own fashion line, and finally creating her own music label which has let her put out an album that is all hers from conception to production.For anyone unaware, Samson was essentially a ruler of ancient Israel who was blessed with supernatural strength that was somehow tied to his hair. Also, he loved the ladies and partying it up. Over the course of his life, Samson amassed a large group of political and personal enemies who became intent on his downfall. Enter Delilah. She seduces Samson and after a while, he falls in love with her and lets her in on the secret of where his remarkable strength comes from. Delilah promptly betrays Samson for a large amount of cash money and has Samson's head shaved--thus rendering him weak and able to be captured. Most people familiar with the story stop there, but Samson's saga continues. Though his eyes were gouged out and he becomes sort of spectacle for mocking amusement, eventually his hair grows back out and he commits suicide by literally pulling down the central columns of a building where his captors were partying thus getting revenge and killing tons of people in the process.Whew. Bible history time is now over. Why does any of that matter? Well in pop culture, Delilah has become synonymous with a sort of cool sexy femme fatale but people often forget about Samson's role in all this. And what's interesting on this album, is that in many ways VV could be singing from the perspective of Samson instead of Delilah which throws a wicked twist on an already charged tale of obsessive lust, betrayal and murderous revenge. Lyrically, this album is simply light years more interesting and layered than her debut though she falls back on tired cliches more often than I'd like.Musically, this album is something else. Cohesive it is not. Which to be honest is half the fun. Album opener, ""Substitute for Love"" is one of the strongest tracks on the album and is VV's way of letting the listener know from moment one, that she's doing whatever she wants with this album. Slow and ethereal, it's almost a modern pop take on a requiem. ""Samson"" contains a similar feel, but this time VV drives the song with a big drum line which makes it more accessible and even danceable. If you like ""Samson"" then chances are you'll also probably like it's twin ""Igneous."" Aside from the opener though, there are several other gorgeous ballads like ""Knife."" Album closer, the six minute long ""Beginning"" is perhaps the most experimental track on the album. There's not really lyrics as much as sounds. It's meant to intrigue, tease.While I would respect VV for attempting something this ambitious, I respect her even more that she was in fact able to pull an album like this off. Sure it has it's moments where things just didn't come together, but I kept thinking of how I just haven't heard something quite like this done in this way before. What differentiates this album from others who would fall into the same vague genre--is that VV still retains hints of her background in vintage r&b powerful soul music--which gives her operatic delivery on this album some much needed edge and interest. This album was wholly unexpected, but a very enjoyable surprise for me.For fans of artists like: Imogen Heap, Lykke Li, Active Child, Marina & the Diamonds, Bjork and even someone like Tarja Turunen. Must have tracks: ""Substitute for Love,"" ""Samson,"" ""The Apple"", ""Faith"", ""Igneous.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DM8VRQMKCQ5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5F3FS4#wasThisHelpful","R2DM8VRQMKCQ5E","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2013 has been the year of Haim. From dominating the summer festival circuit to performing for prime ministers and gaining rabid fans the world over--these three sisters from California have done all of this without an official LP to their name. Now that it's finally here, it's both what I had hoped for as well as refreshingly surprising. To say that their music contains a whole host of influences is an understatement, yet the sisters ground their many influences in their sweet perfect harmonies and bouncy feel good attitude floating throughout the entire album.The Haim sisters come from a family of accomplished musicians which makes sense as their technical skill and ability to craft songs is borderline genius. The flitting nuances and subtleties come not just from musicians who love music and can sing and play, but those who have deeply lived and breathed music their entire lives as well as exposed to an incredible range of music from birth. Thus the music has an organic and effortless appeal despite the many disparate tones which belies the tremendous talent it takes to create an album like this. Musically, this album really surprised me as it manages to both be almost immediately accessible as well as satisfying with real weight.The first three tracks off the album make for a 1-2-3 punch of frankly some of the best pop music of 2013. ""Forever"" is my favorite out of the three currently, but ask me in another month or two and it might well be ""The Wire"" or ""Falling."" ""If I Could Change Your Mind"" has a nice r&b influence, and while upbeat is one of the more serious and emotional tracks on the album. ""Days Are Gone"" is a really fun meld of electronic and folk with a strange little almost chirping synth sound in parts and also sees the appearance of Alana with lead vocal duties. Danielle has the majority of lead vocals on the album, but Alana and Este each take turns stepping up to mike. ""My Song 5"" is another showstopper with a wicked deep grunge industrial feel paired with a bass line that pops in and out making for a very odd yet memorable moment. ""Let Me Go"" is a continuation of the darker feel to the latter half of the album and really shows just how much depth these girls have.If I had just one minor criticism of this album, it's that sometimes the Haim sisters are too professional and polished for their own good. Produced by Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, Alex Clare, We Are Scientists) this album would have benefited from the vocals instead of the always the music conveying the angrier emotions. Imperfections are what make us human, and a few broken notes or a raw breakdown thrown in some songs would have made it a bit more relatable. Their live wild/hippie/rockstar personas don't quite match up with the very tight and technically sound song writing and instrumentals, and I think they need to work on a way to better mesh their personalities into their music. You can be wild and carefree while still being an un-apologetically serious musician.If you asked me to outright define Haim's sound, the best I could do is throw a bunch words out there and hope a few stick. I'm not sure I've ever heard such an effortless amalgamation of influences turned into one compelling and consistent feel. I realize I'm gushing about this album, but Haim is here to stay and their obvious passion paired with their breadth of knowledge and talent makes them the type of artists that I'm sure I'll still be hearing new albums from 30 years from now. I don't want to detract from the amount of blood, sweat and tears these girls have spent working for this moment---but they have a magic that can't be taught or bought. This music is a piece of their soul. Adventurous, Daring, Bubbly and so very SoCal. And they're only just beginning. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F553R3NB8VC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAXLCWW#wasThisHelpful","R1F553R3NB8VC3","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two things first: the majority of songs on this album don't come anywhere close to the radio friendliness of ""Royals"" and this album is most certainly a grower instead of an immediate sugar rush. Best advice--find these songs on YouTube or elsewhere and really listen before you decide whether or not buying the entire album is for you. You will be disappointed if you're expecting 10 songs similar to ""Royals"", but if you keep an open mind then I think you can really experience something special.Much has been made of New Zealand's 16 year old Ella Yelich-O'Connor's skyrocket ascension into the top of the charts--but when it comes right down to it--all I'm concerned about is whether she delivers. And I think she does--not in the way I was expecting, but in a way that makes me incredibly excited about her future and solidifies her as more than a one trick pony in my book. Lyrically Ella is both wise beyond her years as well as still a teenager, constantly walking a tricky balance of keen life observations mixed with insecurity and idealism.This album is extremely cohesive both thematically and musically, relying on minimal electronic pulses and a bass line that that grounds the entire album but never takes the forefront. This enables Ella to basically do whatever she feels like with the melody and use her own voice in layers and loops to become another instrument. Ella stays comfortably in her hypnotic lower register for the most part and paired with the stark and aloof beats makes this album sound different from every mainstream young pop starlet.But unfortunately, it means a few songs towards the middle all sound similar by lacking either a buildup or any special sound to really differentiate them. The album is essentially front and back loaded though with ""Tennis Court"", ""Royals"", ""White Teeth Teens"", and ""A World Alone"" being the must have tracks. The middle contains some growers like ""Team"", but the rest will have you pressing the skip button unless you just so happen to really connect to the lyrics.That said, Ella's fearlessness in creating an album that is just so out there is commendable and pays off when she gets everything lined up perfectly. The fact that she was discovered when she was 12 by a major label actually makes me appreciate even more just how hard she must have had to fight to write her own songs (which she does) and craft an album that is all her. Her best moments scream volumes of what she's capable of in the future, and I know that I'll be along for the ride.Ella doesn't sound that similar to any of these artists but I bet if you enjoy artists like Charli XCX, London Grammar, BANKS, Earl Sweatshirt (in attitude), Fiona Apple, Ruby Frost, or even Bipolar Sunshine that you'll at least enjoy the standout tracks here. Think lovechild between Lana Del Rey and Kanye.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVF8R57LTOQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAEPX9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVF8R57LTOQ5","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm almost embarrassed to say how much I loved this series. It has ridiculous amounts of both explicit violent gore and sex. And if that is all this series was about-or if both of those aspects weren't flawlessly  integrated into making the story--then I wouldn't be here at all. However, here--it all just makes sense.I think the biggest thing that separates ""Banshee"" from similar tv shows that go for the ""HBO"" content--is that they realized that character development is foundation to all. The violence and sex would quite frankly have been awful if that was the star of the show. Instead, the characters are well drawn out and incredibly sympathetic, making the violence and sex just a part of who these characters are and just part of their intense stories.And the plot really is intense. Man gets out of prison, kills some people, then impersonates a sheriff all the while trying to stay hidden from a Russian mafia boss who wants him dead as well as maybe win back his ex-girlfriend. I realize that sounds absurd and rather dumb on paper--but again--it just works. In fact, everything would quite frankly either seem voyeuristic or just plain stupid if it wasn't for the amazing cast.  The acting here is top quality and this is what gives the far fetching plot and gratuitousness weight and a natural impact.Kiwi Antony Starr has a remarkable talent for being able to mete out extreme violence and yet look sad and regretful the entire time. Hoon Lee as Starr's sidekick could have been a very camp role as Lee's character is frequently in drag and spewing catchy one liners--and yet Lee's character ""Job"" is one of the most hardcore and rock like characters in the whole cast. Ivana Milicevic plays Starr's ex, and her physicality in this role is astonishing. She's believable as both a warm and loving mother as well as the type of person who you would want by your side to face an angry horde of zombies with. Ulrich Thomsen rounds out the fantastic cast as the local ex-Amish mafia lord who is emotionally caught in two worlds thus slightly sympathetic yet capable of horrible violence.The production value wasn't something that I particularly noticed--which actually speaks volumes to the quality of the CGI as I was never once pulled out of the story by too ""fake"" looking gore. Although, I also tend to shut my eyes when body parts get torn off so maybe I'm not the best judge of that. However, the set was really nicely done. They focused on just doing a small town and a few key locations really well--which works much better than if they had tried to spread out their budget.Again--if gratuitousness in any way isn't your thing--don't even try attempting to watch the first episode. I think within the first 10 minutes there was three people killed and a sex scene. However, if you can possibly see past that, or are coming here for that--know that you're in for a fantastic thrilling story. Can't wait for season 2!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B0A0JT3KSZT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7NCJ8M#wasThisHelpful","R2B0A0JT3KSZT3","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Came across this song in a trailer and just needed to have it. It's subtle and repetitive which usually equals boring, but this is a song that you just wrap around you.  The general vibe reminds me somewhat of Active Child, but not as complex. This song though just floats across the cosmos and conjures up grand houses now standing empty, standing on top of a mountain by yourself and something not quite natural. The basic piano line bumped up with tinges of electronic makes for a compelling and ghostly soundscape.

"It was Sarah's cover of the The Decemberists' ""Shankill Butchers"" off of her 2009 debut when she was just 18, that first put her on my radar. Haunting with incredible technical skill on both the banjo and the mandolin--she was incredibly exciting and yet collectively both her debut and follow up record fell flat for me. Quite frankly, it always just felt like she didn't have much to say which in my eyes is one of the worst things in the traditional folk world. It can't just sound good--it needs to be torn from your soul. This is where all that changes.""Mile on the Moon"" has a crooning country atmosphere with an electric guitar giving it a little edge. Album title track ""Build Me Up from Bones"" is an early album standout and is a great example of how accessible Sarah can make traditional instruments sound. Soft and lilting with picked cello and fiddle notes, its refreshingly genuine and heartfelt. Sarah's take on Bob Dylan's ""Simply Twist of Fate"" is subtle with extremely minimal instrumentation--but sounds like its an original Jarosz song as she so completely owns it. Her other cover, ""Book of Right-On"" by Joanna Newsom is actually one of the album's few low points as it doesn't sound that different from the original as well as lacks Joanna's stunning quirk.This album was produced by longtime collaborator, Gary Paczosa (Alison Krauss, Dolly Parton) and also features a few guests spots with Chris Thile, Aoife O'Donovan, and Darrell Scott--but perhaps for the first time--the focus is consistently on Sarah and her band of two, Nathaniel Smith, and Alex Hargreaves. The music sounds more organic like it was all recorded together and less like it was just Sarah's parts with the rest dubbed. Her songwriting maturity is also on full display. Her use of second and third person has been replaced by Sarah finally being an integral part of the story.  And finally, I think the third thing which sets this album apart is the more expansive tone.  In the midst of finishing this album, Sarah graduated with honors from the extremely prestigious New England Conservatory--and I think everything she was exposed to there enabled her to both more more confident in her sound as well as branch out a bit.Sarah is part of a very exciting movement of young people who love traditional folk music yet understand how to frame it within a more modern melodic palette. Highly recommend.

"You would have had to have been living under a rock buried under sand in different galaxy to have not heard the song of the summer, Icona Pop's ""I Love It."" It was everywhere and like it or not is going to be the standard by which people judge this album. Well did Swedith duo, Caroline Hjelt and Aino Jawo, manage to put out an album full of more ""I Love It""s? No. But that doesn't mean plenty of songs don't make a very good attempt.Many people are already buzzing about album closer ""Then We Kiss"" as being the next big hit, but it lacks the aggression that made ""I Love It"" standout for me. ""In the Stars"" though has a euro pop edge with a bombastic chorus which I think makes it possibly even better than ""I Love It."" ""Just Another Night"" though is probably my favorite with its more melancholic tone and allows the girls to shine individually on the verses allowing glimpses of needed rawness in a very slick polished soundscape. ""Girlfriend"" borrows two lines from Tupac's ""Me and My Girlfriend"" and twists them into a totally new meaning. Big risk for a big payoff.Caroline and Aino got together about four years ago, and rumor has it that the very night they first met at a party was when they decided they were going to make music together. This clear chemistry and almost familial blending of voices is the thread that holds this album together. When it's right--it's very very right. And then at other times, you wish they just let loose a little bit which would have given the songs a needed hit of emotion.This album is not going to blow your mind, but it will occupy your mind for a long while after the music has actually stopped playing from your speakers. Very solid pop/dance music from two fantastic vocalists.For fans of bands like The Ting Tings, Florrie, Charli XCX, Natalia Kills, Marina & The Diamonds.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3789G1QH38Z3H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EIRECP0#wasThisHelpful","R3789G1QH38Z3H","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the past year, buzz about Scottish synthpop band Chvrches has been steadily growing. From appearances at major festivals like SXSW to touring alongside bands like Depeche Mode and Passion Pit, Chvrches have been doing their best to stand out in a sea of synth pop. And on their debut, ""The Bones of What You Believe""--they do in fact stand out in the best of ways. Accessible and fun yet with an underlying aggression and angst paired with strong beats and a full bodied vocal, Chvrches has created an album that many established pop stars don't seem to be capable of making.Lead vocalist Lauren Mayberry deserves much of the credit for the success of this album. A lot of similar bands have girl vocals that are thin and whimsical, but Lauren has a fuller sound, better range and an uncanny skill at building layers of drama and emotion through tiny tone changes. She can casually get away with quite dark lyrics at times and still have the music sound very danceable and light given her sweet clear tone. Just like how it took me several plays of Foster the People's ""Pumped Up Kicks"" to actually realize what they were singing about as the lyrics and bouncy tone are quite incongruous, Lauren's music has several similar moments though not to that extreme. Her lyrics have an intelligence and layer of complexity that is unusual, which may or may not be related to the fact that Lauren is highly educated with a full law degree as well as Masters in journalism.Musically, this album doesn't exactly break new ground but when playing the album through--the songs thankfully do stand out from each other which I find is my most common problem with synth based music. It's also more refreshingly straightforward than similar bands like Purity Ring. And yet-with Lauren's vocals--it still has the ability to stomp out major anthems for intense highs. ""Recover"" is mind numbingly catchy with a chorus that's going to wreak havoc with your subconscious. ""Science/Visions"" has a very ethereal almost movie score quality to it which is very interesting. ""Gun"" was just featured on the FIFA 14 soundtrack and suitably shiny and bright.Finally, if you happen to have a chance to see them live--do so. While they are naturally high energy with an infectious enthusiasm---they're also hilarious and self deprecatingly genuine. In short--though not musically brilliant, this album has so much going for it just entices and draws you in. It's like a will-o-the-wisp ghostly shining on a dark moor at night. You just can't help yourself but to follow. And dance.For fans of bands like Passion Pit, M83, The Naked and Famous, Purity Ring and Kate Boy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD1D6WY0U45CA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ2WBX4#wasThisHelpful","RD1D6WY0U45CA","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a custom machined pen that was created specifically for the Fineliner ink refill. I'm not a huge fan of Mont Blanc pens--but the actual inks are exquisite. The Fineliner is almost like writing with a marker or Sharpie--except smoother and the ink is essentially instantly dry. Also, this is not a fine tip but is instead closer to a broad. The ink does run out more often than I would like when each refill costs roughly $7.50, but the experience of writing with them trumps cost and inconvenience. This is the Ferrari of Mont Blanc inks, it both performs as well is ridiculously sexy. If you're a pen aficionado, then I highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L949WRTPA2RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002L4IXAM#wasThisHelpful","R1L949WRTPA2RZ","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My feelings about New Zealand band The Naked and Famous's first album, ""Passive Me, Aggressive You"", verge on the ridiculous. They had simply managed to create such a unique synth/electronic/pop sound that was so fresh, memorable and fun that was I completely hooked. Ever since, I've just had huge expectations of the possibilities of this album. Does it completely live up to my expectations---no--and in many ways I think you could argue this is a weaker record, but it's good to keep in mind that the album I'm comparing it to one of my 2010 albums of the year. At the end of the day, this album is more mature and moodier with a wider range of instrumentation--and still has moments of epic bombastic highs.This album starts off with a bang-- ""A Stillness"", ""Hearts Like Ours"", and ""Rolling Waves"" are three of the best tracks off the album. Album opener, ""A Stillness"" also shows the broader musical range of the band on this album with it's acoustic guitar driven edge. ""Waltz"" has a classy duet of Thom's and Alisa's vocals floating over each others which creates something really special (this layering appears on a couple different songs actually). ""The Mess"" and ""I Kill Giants"" are both solid hits for me as well. Not spectacular, but consistently enjoyable and will be go to songs as they can fit many different moods. ""A Small Reunion"" is a beautiful epic close with the appearance of a building vibrant strings section that just makes so much sense paired with TNAF's signature synth/drum/guitar sound.In fact, I wish they would have played around more with the strings on several latter middle half songs like ""We Are Leaving"", ""Grow Old"", ""Golden Girl"" and ""What We Want."" They have great ends but tepid and rather boring beginnings. The addition of some interesting instruments on the first halves of these songs could have really saved them. It's not that I insist all TNAF songs be upbeat--but to have several in a row with the same song structure (minimal and quiet for about 2-3 minutes, then get aggressive), it just takes away the drama of the songs. It let's them bleed together which is just as bad on an album as it is when your clothes in the washing machine all come out hot pink. Also, I felt that nothing even the singles on the album reached the same heights of ""Punching in a Dream"" from their debut.That said--we're just a few months short of the end of the year here, and this is definitely one of the pop standouts for me. MGMT and Grouplove both have albums dropping today too, and I have to think this was somewhat of an intentional thing as these bands often get compared. In that tossup--hands down, it's TNAF. This album is just more cohesive with better hooks as well as an increasing depth of lyrics and atmosphere which I think really makes them stand out. Final round win for the Kiwis and here's hoping to even better progression and song structures on their next venture!For fans of bands like CHVRCHES, M83, and Passion Pit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DCB81NZEXGAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0ZWCCY#wasThisHelpful","R1DCB81NZEXGAW","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***If you don't already know the story--then this review contains the basic plot spoilers. Also, as of November 22, one of Rebecca's brothers has made some mildly inflammatory comments about this book in a short ebook. Short story--it's sensationalism without any substance over minor details and reads like that of a jealous family member angry at the way he was portrayed. Don't bother purchasing it (for anyone interested--I wrote a detailed review of it)***First things first. This book is not an attack against Mormons, God or even polygamy. And neither is this review. It makes clear distinctions about why the type of FLDS that Warren Jeffs was leading was in fact very different from both Mormonism as well as other forms of Christianity. If I recall--not once does Rebecca even use the word cult--but for the purposes of this review, I am going to. In my opinion, whether it's under the guise of religion or helter skelter--when you have a population of people who are both terrified of as well as essentially worship a singular leader, cut off from the rest of the world, indoctrinated from birth, driving out all those who dare to question, and most importantly creating a system of that greatly disadvantages and mentally stunts a portion of the population so that they are easier to control--that is in fact a cult.I rarely read books like these (although I did greatly enjoy the Susan Atkins' autobiography), but every once in a while I come across a news story that just captures my imagination. I remember seeing news articles when Jeffs was arrested where there was just a lot of controversy about whether or not Jeffs and his congregation of FLDS members were just misunderstood or whether they were in fact criminals. Eventually, during his trial--more evidence came to light that Jeffs was in fact a serial pedophile and abuser not to mention was a total con artist concerning his ""religion"". Jeffs would preach about abstaining from ""worldly sins"" but then would use the substantial tithe money to live the very type of life that he preached against. Enough tales of 12 year old brides, rape and systemic corruption emerged that I think eventually the media finally came around to the side of the prosecutors--but some still made the case that Jeffs and his members should have just been left alone.I dare anyone who thinks that to read this book. It's clear that even the prison terms that Jeffs and several high ranking members received was only just the tip of the iceberg. This book is positively heartbreaking. Told through the eyes of Rebecca Musser, this books gives a gripping perspective into the tragedy of the Warren Jeffs era FLDS.Rebecca starts with her traumatic childhood of her siblings and mother forced to live in a dark basement and abused by her father's first wife. The physical and emotional trauma she received in this house was in no way merely a form of physical discipline. This was not spanking a child carefully--this was full on bloody beatings from the first wife to the point of organ failure in the case of one of her beloved brothers, sexual molestation from a half brother, and grievous mental and emotional abuse. Rebecca makes it clear though, that at least in her mind---she viewed this as unusual and not the norm for all polygamous families. She makes it clear that child abuse is not a necessary byproduct of bigamy--though she did see reoccurring jealousy leading to violence or passive forms of aggression repeatedly in in first/second/third/etc... wife relationships.Something that was surprising to me though, was the realization that the FLDS movement was much more like the Amish than cult like towards the beginning of the book. While I would disagree with many if not all of their views, the FLDS church was not always synonymous with human trafficking and child rape. It seems it used to have a more democratic (though barely) structure not to mention didn't seek to wholly cut off their children from the outside world. Rebecca even attended a normal school up until somewhere in elementary I believe. Unlike many in the church, her father was a highly educated engineer who clearly passed on his mental acuity and passion for knowledge to Rebecca. It seems things honestly didn't reach the point of outright major law breaking (for the greater organization--certainly Rebecca and her siblings would have all been taken away and her parents put in jail if authorities were aware of the child abuse) until maybe the late 90s early 00s.What changed things was Warren Jeffs. He had taken over the ""school"" system and little by little chipped away at whatever real knowledge these kids had and replaced it with a systematic indoctrination of both the church, himself, ""sexual purity""/total submission of women and how evil the rest of the ""Gentile"" world was. When his father (the revered yet lecherous Prophet who Rebecca was married off to at 19 and he 85) became sick, he took over the main religious not to mention purse strings of the cult. When his father died, Jeffs began a systematic purge of all those who opposed him as well as rewarding young and younger girls as wives to those who backed his rise to power. When Jeffs started to pressure the sister wives of his father--specifically Rebecca--into marrying him, this was the moment when Rebecca found the courage to escape the compound as she was absolutely sickened and terrified of Jeffs.In the time Rebecca left and the time Jeffs was finally arrested--it's clear that things just got worse. Just because these young brides weren't chained physically, they might as well have been. When you have virtually zero education, poor communication skills and own zero property to your name, you really don't have a choice. It's either leave (provided you aren't dragged back like many girls were) or marry. Neither of which is a fair choice. And many boys were also either raped or sent off to work in almost chain gain like conditions for various construction FLDS owned companies if they showed the slightest sign of mere hesitation or rebellion.As she became increasingly aware of just how great some of the lies told to her were, not to mention broken over the unknown fates of her biological younger sisters--she began a relentless yet cautious effort to locate her littlest sisters who she was concerned had been forced into marriage. Eventually, as the federal and state governments began to make a case against Jeffs and senior members of the church--they called upon Rebecca to help them. At great emotional and psychological harm to herself and her marriage, Rebecca slowly started helping the authorities build a case against these members. Eventually, she became the star and fearless witness in a series of trials which eventually ended up in prison sentences for Jeffs and other members. She symbolically wore red during her testimony in Jeffs trial, a moment of defiance as Jeffs had banned the color red from ever being worn in the FLDS church.While emotionally difficult to read, I do want to make it clear that this book was incredibly riveting. I knew the ending, I knew Rebecca had survived, I knew Jeffs was arrested and sentenced to life--and yet this was genuinely more tense and gripping than several thrillers I've read recently. All credit to Rebecca as well as Bridget Cook (co-author) for masterful storytelling.Part of what made this book so powerful to me is that it's not a rant. It's not a pity party. It's not even about how heroic Rebecca was--which she unquestionably was. It's clear the journey Rebecca went through was gradual and that she often felt hopelessly alone and not in control. And yet, with each little decision she made--she got one step closer and closer to not just freedom for herself but many of her siblings and others. Her steely determination and self respect is what saved her. And that's an incredibly empowering message.I would highly recommend this book to anyone simply curious about the history and insight into the world of the Jeffs era FLDS, as well as young girls. One of the many powerful ideas from this book that has really stuck with me--is that Rebecca didn't know she had the choice to respect herself. She had been taught that she was nothing except a body in which to sexually and otherwise serve the whims of the men in charge. And it was the moment that she realized that she was special that she was able to start questioning what she saw around her.Emotional, visceral, enlightening and riveting--this book can help you see the world a little bit clearer. Highly recommend.*********Promised myself I wasn't going to write any more--but ended up buying and reading the book by Rebecca's little sister Elissa who had been married off at 14 to a first cousin and repeatedly raped. I don't want to take anything away from her story--but the perspective here is wholly different. Elissa was a kid and relaid her story through the eyes of a kid--and tho Rebecca wasn't much older, she had much more knowledge and an awareness of what was actually happening due to her status as the elder Prophet's wife. Honestly, Rebecca is also simply a much better writer. Essentially, this book is much more detailed and provides a better perspective of the entire FLDS situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8XRJBTX04QJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAXFZQK#wasThisHelpful","R3F8XRJBTX04QJ","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like one of the other reviewers, my mother also bought these for me at Costco in an effort to try to get me to more regularly eat something for breakfast. She however, combined them with toasted pecans and chocolate covered almonds before giving it to me though. I've never been a huge nut fan but I literally cannot stop eating these. I keep the bag at my desk at work and find myself reaching for it in the morning to sprinkle on a Chobani for breakfast and then towards the end of the day as well.The mix itself is gummy, salty, sweet and just an amazing blend of flavors. The light cinnamon combined with peaches and a nutty flavor is just sublime. I'd recommend cutting it with some plain nuts to stretch it though, as the mix is strong enough to totally handle it. They're not overpowering or anything on their own, just have enough flavor to cover up some plain nuts if you want something a little bit healthier. Delicious. Delicious.

"Hannah Reid. Hannah Reid. Hannah Reid. While full credit for the sensual instrumentation and restraint displayed through the music no doubt goes to fellow band members Dot Major and Dan Rothman--a massive part of why this British band is blowing up is all down to lead vocalist and songwriter Hannah. Comparisons to Florence Welch are completely warranted. Powerful, ethereal and emotional--she just lifts the music into a different stratosphere.  This  deceptively minimal yet  intense  album  is one of the best indie pop albums of the year.Lead single ""Hey Now"" made a big sonic impression when it first popped up on the internet in 2012--and it still retains all the magic I'd remembered. ""Wasting My Young Years"" also especially resonates as it seems Hannah is asking many of the same questions most 20 somethings are asking about themselves and their place in the world. I can see how older people who have their lives all figured out might get aggravated at the general content though. It does tend to trail off into repetitiveness which almost always gets on my nerve-and yet here the lyrics almost serve  as simply an excuse for Hannah to be singing. Honestly, she could be singing the watermelon song and I'd still be in awe, it's a bonus that I happen to identify with and feel where she's at in her life though. ""Strong"" and album  closer  ""If You Wait"" are other album standouts for me.My one complaint is that this album is simply too short. Hannah's voice is epic. It has a almost mystical quality that the only feeling I can compare it to is that of traditional Celtic band singers like Enya or Clannad (though she doesn't sound like them at all). Her voice somehow just has a sense of history and time that lends itself to epic six or seven minute long songs. However, most of the songs are just barely over 3 minutes in length which doesn't really begin to allow a real sinking in of the sound.That said, if you're fans of artists like the xx, Passion Pit, Lykke Li, or Florence--I would bet money on your enjoyment of this album. It's melodic, subtle, catchy and intriguing. It's quite simply just beautiful music. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D2LER8NT4JSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVCGUNY#wasThisHelpful","R1D2LER8NT4JSB","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It used to be whenever I was really sad that I would throw on some of my favorite hard rockers like Seether or Three Days Grace, yet recently I've found myself reaching for my Weeknd mixtapes as the majority of his songs run this interesting line between beautiful vocals yet heartbreakingly sad and bitter lyrics always grounded in a heavy beat.On ""Kiss Land"", Abel Tesfaye aka The Weeknd, doesn't stray that far at all from what fans have come to expect from his numerous mixtapes. This means if the Weeknd has never really been your thing or if you find him boring--then this album will certainly not change your mind. However, if like me you can get lost in Abel's high tenor and falsetto, then this album is an exciting more aggressive addition to his discography.Abel's particular brand of R&B is more akin to murky atmospheric soundscapes punctuated by pulsing beats and floating searing vocals than the type of radio friendly stuff that contemporaries like Chris Brown or Jason Derulo put out. The music is ambiguous, harsh, melodic, debauched. Main producer Danny Schofield (Nicki, French Montana, Mims) really allows Abel the freedom to go where he wants and not forcing him to produce a radio single.""Belong to the World"" is quite possibly the best track on the album with a heavy industrial beat that's a bit unusual for Abel but a natural fit and cool new direction. Drake has the sole feature on the album on ""Live For"" and his rap breakdown serves as a nice contrast towards the middle of the album. ""Wanderlust"" is another standout with a strong 80s beat and is one of the few ""upbeat"" tracks.If I had one criticism of Abel's work--it's a common one I have with most R&B/HipHop artists-- and it's that women are viewed in a less than favorable light here. It's not even just objectification, but a cold calculating attitude which does get a little bit disconcerting. Part of why I love Abel's songs though are for this very same chilling menace though--I just wish women weren't so often on the brunt end of this focus.If The Weeknd is your thing, then you'll love this album. More muscular yet still so exquisitely polished and thought out as his mixtapes--this album will no doubt be on repeat. It's intriguing and potent. It's the type of music you put on when frustrated, whether emotionally or sexually. Another solid standout release from one of Canada's best young artists.For fans of Michael Jackson, the xx, Future, Drake, Miguel etc..","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZUB705YNS58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUT6OEI#wasThisHelpful","R1EZUB705YNS58","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I probably have a borderline unhealthy obsession with the single ""Wonderland"" off of British native Natalia Kills' debut album--but while I really enjoyed the rest of her debut, it was too derivative to stand up to repeated listens. And yet it was clear that Natalia had so much more potential just raging under the surface. And happily, this is the album that Natalia really steps into her own. ""Trouble"" is a much more focused record that rings truer on the authenticity scale, not to mention is chock full of Natalia's trademark witty writing and ridiculously catchy dark hooks.While Rihanna frequently flaunts her ""Good Girl Gone Bad"" persona, Natalia actually seems like the real deal although it might be a stretch to imagine a time when Natalia was ever really innocent. She honestly and bluntly lays out and explores why she is the way she is. Subtlety is not the goal. Drugs, domestic violence, brushes with the law, thoughts of suicide, reckless sexual behavior and above all a plea for parental affection and guidance are all recurring themes.""Stop Me"" and ""Saturday Night"" are two hugely catchy album standouts which both delve into her family history and dysfunction a bit like P!nk's earlier work.  Much of the album plays like notes from a therapy session mixed with a steely determination to not just survive but thrive and party till the break of day. The beautiful ballad ""Devil's Don't Fly"" is a searingly raw and haunting look into a broken relationship: ""It's not cause I'm young or from a broken home/ Maybe I just fight cause I don't know where I belong."" Musically, though firmly pop---this album seems a bit more drum and bass focused instead of slick synth sounds like on her debut, which I think really propels the sound into being more memorable.""Trouble"" is the top shelf of quality of what mainstream pop has to offer. It's not revolutionary but crawls under your skin and unleashes something deeply sexual and emotionally primal that is intoxicating. It's clear from her producer's discographies, Jeff Bhasker (Kanye, Beyonce, Alicia Keys) and Emile Haynie (Kid Cudi, Eminem, Emeli Sande, Lana Del Rey), that whatever collective wisdom still in the traditional music industry has recognized a star in Natalia and I wholeheartedly agree with their assessment. Don't sleep on Natalia.For fans of P!nk, Marina & the Diamonds, Ke$ha, Miley, Katy Perry etc...**Quick note, don't bother getting a ""clean"" version of the album--that really would ruin the impact of many of the songs. Plus, if you're the type of person who wants a ""clean"" version, then this probably isn't the type of album for you in the first place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17H6NGT7P7Q5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUS92EI#wasThisHelpful","R17H6NGT7P7Q5B","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Janelle Mone is hands down one of the most exciting and creative artists currently putting out music, and this latest album is a worthy addition to her repertoire. Slightly more focused on R&B than her last album, ""Electric Lady"" constitutes the fourth and fifth suites (of a proposed seven) of Mone's epic saga of the world of Metropolis--the futuristic dystopian world of androids as seen through the eyes of rebel android (and Mone alter ego) Cindi Mayweather. ""Electric Lady"" balances a thoughtful and probing social conscience with an uncontrollable toe tapping/body throbbing good time.The sci-fi fantastical world of Metropolis full of androids and zombies is  just beyond our reality, which allows Mone the freedom to tackle heavy topics like gender, race, religion and sexuality in a different context without things getting too ponderous and exhaustive. While clearly relevant and important, Mone grounds these discussions with a playfulness which has her pairing questions like ""Say will your God accept me in my black and white"" in the same song as ""...You gotta testify because the booty don't lie"" (from ""Q.U.E.E.N.""). Aside from her infectious energy and fantastic vocals-much of Mone's brilliance comes from her ability to raise and discuss these issues without it seeming forced, pretentious or angry. She's a feminist, civil rights activist, opinionated and yet still approachable, danceable and fun. Which means her message actually gets through instead of your brain just shutting it all out.Musically, this album is a bit less eclectic than ""ArchAndroid"", but still manages to run the gauntlet of funk, r&b, classical, psychedelic punk and jazz. It also sees the appearance of several respected artists like mentor Prince on the funk ""Givin' Em What They Love"". Erykah Badu is a righteous soul sister on ""Q.U.E.E.N."" laying down a bridge that gives into Monae showing off some admirable rap skills. These features aren't always successful though as illustrated by the rather tepid duet with Miguel on ""Primetime"" which may or may not have been a half hearted attempt at a radio hit. My personal favorites are probably mostly in the first suite as it seems to have a bit more edge, yet it seems Mone's vocal prowess is showed off a bit more in the second suite like on ""Sally Ride.""Now as wonderful as this world of Metropolis is, and as skilled as Mone is at using and manipulating this world--the explanations are still at times a little heavy handed and clunky. Her insistence on putting on this robotic persona at all times does wear out its welcome a little bit. And while at times incredibly thrilling and thought provoking, Mone's many nods and ""inspired bys"" to a whole host of different things is also a reference too far sometimes. Far be it for me to tell an artist that they need less layered music--but sometimes you just wish you could see more of  Mone and her essence in her music.That said, Mone is an artist artist--willing and able to make art for herself before even thinking of an audience and I tremendously respect her fearsome commitment to her craft and her concept. In the meantime, I get to enjoy an album that somehow makes my body break out in violent spasms while driving--which I imagine on a more coordinated person would look at lot more like dancing.  And as a cherry on top, I don't have to check my mind at the door either. Janelle Mone is a musical maelstrom who is a shining beacon of individuality and class, not to mention an incredible vocalist--and it's a privilege experience her Metropolis. If we could all be as fearless and passionate as Cindi.For fans of Erykah Badu, Outkast, Lauryn Hill, Kimbra etc....***Mone is on tour right now and I cannot highly suggest going to a concert enough. I saw her a few years ago and was blown away. If you think she's high octane and energetic in her music videos-prepare for world domination during a live show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30QOA5GDGDWTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EVCD9HY#wasThisHelpful","R30QOA5GDGDWTF","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most Americans don't know who Juno award winning Serena Ryder is, but it's not for lack of talent or energy. For whatever reason, she just hasn't been able to crack the US market yet. And unfortunately, I don't think this album will be the winning ticket either unless one of the singles breaks out. What makes Serena interesting though is her fun pop/rock throaty sound paired with being a very experienced and technically excellent musician. To be honest, a lot of rockers just get away with whatever they want--but Serena really puts the work in to get things ""correct."" She also has a pretty big range, able to hit high notes in full voice which also makes her stand out.I'm not that familiar with Serena's early career, but I do know she used to have much more of a ""folk"" sound which does make brief appearances. However, this album is pretty solidly in the pop/rock category with the exceptions of a few songs like the acapella ""Nobody But You"". I would compare Serena to Grace Potter or Chantal Kreviazuk or maybe like a cool modern version of Melissa Etheridge.Empowering lead single ""Stompa"" is possibly the best track on the album, which Serena wrote to remind herself of how much joy and hope music could give herself and others after dealing with depression for a time. Second single ""What I Wouldn't Do"" is also a fun upbeat song worth making it onto your playlist. ""Call Me"" has hints of Anastacia which honestly just makes me smile and happens to be a pretty catchy song as well. The jazz influenced standout ""For You"" is heavily reminiscent of both the classic song ""Feeling Good"", as well as Adele's ""Skyfall"". I think this was a very interesting direction for Serena and I wish had had explored it more.My main issue with this album is that it's just a singles album--the singles are great, but the rest are simply unmemorable. Not bad--just not memorable. A shame, as the music doesn't to her talent justice. Her live show is a thing of wonder and I so wish they had been able to capture some of that magic on this album. I'd recommend listening to the singles and buying them individually. I really hope she just continues to grow and explore/work with more exciting producers next time around. She's capable of much more.That said---the singles really are fantastic and if you like upbeat rock, I would certainly check this album out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12KY4GLBGJJRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELAYQHS#wasThisHelpful","R12KY4GLBGJJRB","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Macklemore and his performance of ""Same Love"" during the 2013 VMAs definitely got me a little teary eyed. I'd never really noticed Mary's chorus that much but was really taken with her tone. So I looked her up afterwards and am just thrilled that she built out the chorus into it's own song. Really beautiful and very memorable. Definitely will be checking out her whenever she drops a full album in the hopefully near future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TIWEYY0JY11X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9JQNTK#wasThisHelpful","R1TIWEYY0JY11X","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have work tomorrow. And yet I just stayed up till 3:30 in the morning to finish this book which I started about six hours ago. Stupid--but I couldn't help myself. And now I feel I must pour out of all of the feelings inside right now in this review instead of waiting till a more opportune time (tomorrow after work and after a nap). What you need to know is that this book is simply one of the most thrilling and nuanced books that I've read in the past several years.Unique it is not, as it borrows liberally from Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Was None"" not to mention pays homage to ""A Most Dangerous Game."" Paul even managed it fit in a ""Lord of the Flies"" reference as well. However, two of those are some of the best literature that I've ever read (disliked LOTF), and when I tell you that this book fits right in with those two--that is one of absolute highest compliments that I can give it. Detailed, layered and above all exciting, Paul has just firmly established himself as an author to watch.The basic plot is essentially that a group of people get stuck on a very treacherous island under the guise of competing in an extreme reality TV show. When it becomes clear that there is something very much amiss, people start panicking and doing whatever it takes to ensure their survival--even if that means killing whoever gets in their way. Ratcheting up the tension though, is the mystery of who is the grand puppeteer--the person behind all of this and what their motivations are. I have to say that Paul kept me guessing right up to the very end, as he carefully sketched out several possibilities, though thankfully he did drop some clues so it wasn't a total surprise. However, knowing Paul's clear influences, I was still trying to figure out the final twist right up until the last line. And deliver Paul did. Not quite in the way that ""And Then There Was None"" did, but yet a very satisfying positive moment which helped push this book into 5 stars for me.In lead Camilla, Paul managed to create an incredibly fascinating and complex character who I couldn't help but care about (even after I did my absolute best to not get attached too much to any one character after reading the book blurb). And yet I was rooting for her from the beginning. Something that frequently irks me about male authors even really successful ones like Crichton or Ludlum, is that the woman's perspective is quite often totally wrong. It's not how women actually think--it's how men think women think. Here though, I felt Paul did a fantastic job at creating female characters (not just Camilla) who thought and acted like real women. As the cast of characters is quite large and Paul switches perspective a few times, I was amazed at his ability to keep the perspectives clear and consistent.If I had to critique this book, I would say that it could stand to be a bit shorter (especially in the latter middle half) and that the end pushed the boundaries of what is realistic a bit too much. Not that I need my fiction or action to be realistic, it's just that Paul so carefully crafted a hyper realistic and factually accurate world that to see things trail off into the imaginary was a bit of a let down.And now I have a pounding headache and really must go to bed. But if you're thinking about about buying this book, I would strongly push you into the ""yes"" direction. If you enjoy any of the stories mentioned above, or just psychological thrillers in general--you really can't go wrong with this book. In a time when so many popular authors are spewing out a book every six months with tired love triangles, where everyone is supernaturally attractive and turn into creatures during a full moon, Paul has managed to craft a book that really stands out.Meticulous yet effortless, this is a book that you will actually remember reading a year from now. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7MY9BWCJDIG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E69E91M#wasThisHelpful","R7MY9BWCJDIG5","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2010, a then 16 year old kid from California, Earl Sweatshirt (Thebe Kgositsile), released a mixtape called ""Earl."" He had recorded it predominantly with the help one of his  best friends--Tyler, The Creator. Tyler was the magnetic force of nature behind rising rap/production/art crew, OFWGKTA (aka Odd Future). Together with Tyler's self released album ""B***rd"", suddenly the Odd Future kids were blowing up the underground rap scene. While Tyler was volcanic and seemingly delighted in seeing how obscene and strange his bars could be, Earl was quieter though no less extreme--and yet also displayed a shockingly  arresting skill at wordplay. Despite the DIY production and rather murky beats, Earl became one of the most buzzed about rappers of the year with the mixtape ""Earl"" making several respected ""best of the year"" lists.Then suddenly Earl disappeared off the internet and off of Odd Future's mixes. For two years, people wondered what had happened to Earl while Odd Future released crazier and crazier explanations for his absence, which played no small role in contributing to the mystique of Odd Future. Eventually, it was leaked that Earl's law professor mother had sent him to a school for ""at risk"" boys in Samoa. And then Earl was suddenly back just as quickly as he had been gone. However, while Earl had been off isolated from the world--the world was focusing in on Earl and the Odd Future crew. Tyler had started working with veteran music jack of all trades, Christian Clancy, who had been instrumental in guiding Eminem's early career. Odd Future member Frank Ocean was setting the r&b world on fire. People were listening. All eyes were on what Earl would do now with virtually total freedom over his music not to mention direct access to the best of what the rap industry had to offer.Which brings us to ""Doris."" Light years more mature than ""Earl"", Earl has realized that shock tactics and gleeful fantasy rapes and killings quite simply cease to shock and lose their impact. Instead, Earl turns his insecurities and frustrations inward, offering up both intimate details of his life as well as a glimpse of the now man behind the Earl mask. The absence of his acclaimed poet father (Keorapetse Kgositsile), his loving but push/pull relationship with his mother, and his insecurities of dealing with such sudden and high expectations are all laid bare. One of the most rightfully talked about lines of the album comes from ""Chum"": ""It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless/ And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest/ When honestly I miss this n****, like when I was six/ And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it.""Now the music is a step above what many of the Odd Future crew have been putting out, and yet it still is within the same similar style of synth laden spare beats. There are virtually zero hooks on this album, almost being an endless stream of simply rap. This is both refreshing as well as one of the album's more annoying aspects. Aside from the real standout tracks, the rest of the album is practically a stream of consciousness as opposed to sounding like individual songs. Intriguing, but I'm  not quite sure that this works out  in the way that Earl intended.There are a couple of songs, notably the Neptunes produced ""Burgundy"" that have a unique flair--but the rest fall into a similar pattern despite having different structures and being produced by a slew of different guys like fellow OF crew members Tyler and Matt Martians, not to mention Alchemist, Flying Lotus and more. It's interesting that Earl himself actually co-produced much of the album under the pseudonym ""randomblackdude"" along with Christian Rich (J. Cole, Lupe, Pharrell). Still, there is a cohesive, sleepy, muffled dissonance that is pervasive throughout the whole album. It's fitting for the lyrics, and Earl's slower delivery--and yet at times it feels like you're just slogging through without needed pops of relief.For as many producers as appeared on this album, there are almost as many features like Mac Miller, RZA, Domo Genesis and Vince Staples. Herein lies my second big gripe with this album. For supposedly being all about Earl, this album has very little Earl actually on it. There are literally just four tracks without a feature--and two of those don't really count. Sometimes it pays off in spades--the emotional Frank Ocean track ""Sunday"" is perhaps the best song on the album, and the songs with Tyler have a palpable energy as they just feed off of each other. However, the album starts off with a weak track featuring no-name SK La'Flare, and you can't help but wonder why someone simply didn't just tell Earl no. Quite simply, this would have been a much stronger album if there was literally just more Earl.""Doris"" is part confessional, part coming of age, and yet part wholly detached and unaffected teen cool. Though ""Doris"" is no ""Earl"" in terms of graphic content, it's no ""Heist"" or ""Recovery"" either, so if ""Relapse"" era Eminem isn't your thing--you're probably not going to love ""Doris."" Although, quite frankly I doubt this will be an album that many will ""love"" or push as a classic. It's not. It's so insular that my appreciation of it is more academic than emotional (though if I'm in the right mood it can really hit home). What it is though, is a very exciting debut of potentially one of rap music's biggest future heavyweights. It reaffirms Earl's prodigious talent (especially at internal rhymes) and shows how exciting and adventurous rap can be when not overburdened with creating radio hits. This is much hungrier, much rawer and much more skilled than almost all of the mainstream rap releases of 2013--Jay included. And so for that, five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDXZ8Q7BYUWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EE66CW6#wasThisHelpful","R3CDXZ8Q7BYUWS","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the youngest of several siblings, I generally just got passed along most things. Somehow I came to have two brushes that were exactly the same, that none of my sisters liked because they weren't good for their hair. However, my hair is a very odd mix of slightly curly and a little thin and these brushes worked just fabulously on them. For years, I tried finding replacements for these brushes--and even when I bought new ones that I thought were similar--they weren't. It always felt like I was trying to brush my hair with a cheap paint brush, and I couldn't figure out why these brushes that looked and felt the same actually had very soft bristles and couldn't ""dig into"" my hair.Reinforced nylon is the answer. Apparently, most brushes that look like this are made with boar bristles, and not nylon. Unfortunately, probably because my hair is a little curly--these boar bristles are just wholly ineffective. It's a little pathetic that it's taken me into my 20s to figure this out, but at least I know what to look for in the future. As for this actual brush, it looks just about as pictured in the preview pic and feels quality. Works beautifully for me. Recommended for those people who need this type of brush, but with stronger bristles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134V4CEEDEXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019ZD6FQ#wasThisHelpful","R134V4CEEDEXL","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember first hearing ""Crossing Over State Lines"" several years ago and getting so excited about Matt Hires. He sings upbeat rock/pop that is perfect for listening to while driving late on a summer's night. It's feel good, happy yet aggressive music that won't let you fall asleep at the wheel. I took several of my friends to one of his concerts the last time he was in town, and despite not being familiar with his work in the slightest--everyone left happy and content.In some respects, Matt is like a male version of Sara Bareilles just with a guitar instead of a piano. Not too terribly surprising given that both of his albums have been produced by Eric Rosse (Tori Amos, Sara Bareilles). Unfortunately, I don't think Matt is willing to take the risks that Sara is willing to--which leaves him sort of stuck with the same sound again and again. While it's fun, its still a bit of a rut. When it's just right--it's great, and when it's not--it's just not memorable. Which leaves this really being a singles album instead of an album to buy in its entirety.""Restless Heart"" is the big single that has gotten a lot of people excited with its relentless positivity and ultra cool folk touches reminiscent of the Lumineers or Mumford. ""A --> B"" slows things down a bit though, and has a really nice harmonica bit that sets it apart. ""I Am Not Here"" and ""All That's Left of You"" are both moodier and slower with a piano grounding them, and actually sound a lot like Straylight Run which I think is awesome. I really wish Matt had pushed himself further in this direction.I really did like several singles, but suggest looking up these songs online before buying them outright unless you're just a huge fan of Matt. For fans of singers like Matt Nathanson, Mat Kearney, Needtobreathe and the Gaslight Anthem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3444DF7B5GBLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5ZCK72#wasThisHelpful","R3444DF7B5GBLD","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently there has been a plethora of neo-folk bands and solo singers that have all started to sound the same. Throw in some hand clapping with a little banjo and a group of people shouting the chorus, and it's automatically ""real"" and serious music. It's only when comparing some of these bands and singers to the real deal when it becomes clear how average and dull they are. Valerie June is the real deal. She has this music deep in her Jackson, Tennessee born soul. It's not forced or contrived. It's not pop music trying to hide under a few strands of double bass. It's quite frankly some of the best modern fusion folk music to have come from this whole modern folk movement.Let's start with Valerie's voice. Astonishingly unique and instantly identifiable. Part Nina Simone, Billie Holiday and Dolly Parton yet all Valerie. On the more upbeat songs, it tends to go rather flatly stylized very reminiscent of early 1940s folk bands like the Carter Family or Hank Williams.  On the softer songs, her tone is simply flawless showing much more range and a real talent for finding the groove to a song. Genuine and heartfelt, it makes me feel like home.The music is really something special as well. It's not merely borrowing an occasional twang--it is unapologetic folk music. Albeit folk music that has been influenced by the delta blues, Southern spirituals and jazz. In Valerie's own words: ""It's moonshine roots music."" Produced by Kevin Augunas (Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, ZZ Ward) and Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, this album has just enough modern sensibilities to make it much more accessible than old 1920s recordings of traditional Appalachian music. Still you can hear the spirits of Mississippi John Hurt, Doc Boggs, and Elizabeth Cotten  giving their approval and smiling down from above.""Workin' Woman Blues"" sets the tone for the album with its spare guitar line and basic percussion interjected with a jazzy trumpet. Valerie doesn't dress up her brand of folk with trying to make it complicated and needlessly layered--it's the art of minimalism perfected. ""Twined & Twisted"" showcases Valerie's ability to both write and sing poignant tales of lost love. She's a troubadour, a wandering minstrel content to play at the campfire after a long day in the saddle. ""You Can't Be Told"" kicks things back up a notch with full on backing vocals on the chorus and a funk jazz guitar throwing down a wicked little groove that is sure to get you moving. My favorite though is the matter of fact and slightly morbid ""One My Way"" with its soft piano flourishes provided by none other than Booker T and a beautiful fiddle carrying the melody.All in all, really exciting music and a standout voice. Though this is her first full studio album, Valerie has been playing music professionally for about 10 years now,  and you can hear her utter confidence in her sound and where she wants to take you. If you are a fan of any of the singers listed above or into modern bands like the Carolina Chocolate Drops, Alabama Shakes or the Avett Brothers, I bet you'll find something to love here. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHWCFK646YE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E88YNJY#wasThisHelpful","R1LHWCFK646YE6","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"AlunaGeorge is a British duo focused on pairing modern electronic with 90s pop/r&b. Singer Aluna Francis has a almost childlike voice, very reminiscent of 90s girl bands like TLC with touches of Kate Nash and Ellie Goulding. George Reid is the man behind the music, crafting minimal yet catchy beats that both highlight as well as save Aluna sometimes. As a proud child of the 90s, this music is both familiar as well as fresh--with several standout pop gems like ""You Know You Like It"" and ""Attracting Flies.""Aluna's lyrics are also a highlight. She's not quirky in the same way that Lily Allen or Marina are, but she has a distinctive way of putting words together. Her chorus from ""Attracting Flies"" is both hilarious as well as genuinely clever: ""Little grey fairy tales/ And little white lies/ Everything you exhale is attracting flies."" Aluna's lyrics combined with George's early Pharrell-like production are what really make this album stand out from the crowd. It's both style as well as substance, which honestly makes them a cut above a lot of the very material and bands they musically reference.The main problem with this album though, is its cohesiveness. It's all pretty much universally good, yet not all brilliant. AlunaGeorge is almost a victim of their own talent--some of  their songs are just so strong, that when the others don't reach that point, it's a disappointment even though they're not bad songs. Still that just speaks to how capable both Aluna and George are and the high standard of quality on this album. It also would have been nice if George could have incorporated some sounds that didn't sound like they all originated from the depths of his computer. A few punches of real instruments would have seriously beefed up the depth of the music.For fans of 90s era pop and r&b like TLC, Dream, and 3LW plus modern influences like Disclosure, Charli XCX or even Rudimental. It's a fun ride.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L1LGLBZ8S0HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5PZGXM#wasThisHelpful","R1L1LGLBZ8S0HM","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had heard such good reviews of this show, but thought the whole ""one girl plays multiple characters"" thing was really stupid and stayed away from it. I thought it would be a gimmick and silly. How wrong I was. Tatiana Maslany's performance in this show is mind blowing. Each of her characters doesn't just have say a different hair color--they have wholly separate personalities and ways of simply moving. They walk and sit differently. Not once when watching was I pulled out of the story and think that it was ridiculous. Tatiana's acting is simply superb.I thought about several mainstream Hollywood actresses, and wondered if they could even possibly begin to pull Tatiana's characters off--and got nothing. Tatiana isn't just an incredible actress but she has a remarkably physical androgyny that is crucial to her being believable as different people. Not that she isn't pretty--she is, but it's almost like she's a blank slate. Distinctive yet malleable. This show wouldn't have a snowball's chance in Hades of succeeding without her.Moving on from Tatiana though, this show has a really fun plot as well. It's sci-fi in a way that I've never seen been done before. The sci-fi exists simply to move the plot forward. It's the basis of the show, but not really the point of the show. Sure, it's the big mystery--but the drama and meaningful plots all come from the people involved. It's a means to an end, and allows the freedom for this show to cross major boundaries. It's Desperate Housewives meets Bionic Woman while hanging out with Continuum and Lost Girl. It's drama, sci-fi, comedy, a cop show, an action show etc...I also need to mention that the method of filming was quite nice as well. It changes depending on which of the characters is on screen. It's subtle, but there and helps to establish character as well as the mood.Really engaging, really fun. Recommended for any discerning viewers out there who want to watch one of the best shows of 2013. (Heads up to any parents out there though, it does contain graphic violence, nudity/sex scenes, and explicit self-harming so this might not be something for the kids. It really doesn't have a lot of all of that--but know that it's there.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27F0JXPFHE24R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D56GJCE#wasThisHelpful","R27F0JXPFHE24R","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent British espionage tv show came onto my radar late last year, and I remember consuming all of the episodes within one weekend. While the core plot is rather run of the mill as far as spy stories go--agent gets betrayed, then tries to figure out by who, then vanquish them---this tv show really elevates itself with its stunning cinematography and a tremendous performance by lead Melissa George. She reminds me a lot like Continuum's Rachel Nichols, yet I think George can handle the physicality of this type of role even better than Nichols. She's volatile, intelligent, emotionally complex and her performance grounds the rest of the show.At times I felt like the numerous subplots were taking up a bit too much attention, but towards the final episode you could see how what you thought were subplots were really part of the spider web of the overarching plot. It is a slow burn though---episodes don't contain concluded stories within each one of them like CSI. It's more akin to The Killing or Broadchurch--things happen in their own time when they need to happen as opposed to being stuck within having to finish within one episode. That's not to say that there isn't any action or it's just a bunch of talking--there's tension and suspense galore, just don't go into it expecting Alias. Also, like most spy related entertainment---there are some logic gaps that you just end up having to swallow and move on to keep being immersed in the experience.The directing also deserves a major kudos, as this tv show is just a visual feast with an eye for detail that not many tv shows even attempt much less succeed with. It's not about flashy theatrics but showcasing the natural landscape and type of camera angles to create something really special.Right now this series is sort of floundering as original producer BBC One has said no to a second season, but it looks like Cinemax may help it get there. Even if it's not picked up for a second season, it still resolved enough of the story that watching this season was still tremendously satisfying though there are major stories left unexplored. All in all, a very thrilling tv show where I could not physically stop myself from watching the next episodes. For fans of female fronted action a la Continuum or Haywire with touches of Homeland and The Americans, and anyone who simply enjoys a great spy story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9Q1LD4EJYXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8B9AT4#wasThisHelpful","R1R9Q1LD4EJYXE","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit to being rather new to this type of genre. Previously, it's never really held much appeal to me. However, I now work at a desk for several hours a day, and it's been really helpful for me to listen to more subtle music with less of an emphasis on lyrics than I'm used to. It helps me focus instead of distracting me. But just because it needs to be a little quieter, doesn't mean it can be elevator music either. That type of stuff would just really annoy me and end up distracting me just as much as listening to rap would. Enter Benjamin Stefanski aka Raffertie.Raffertie is a young British dj/producer who has been making a name for himself in the indie electronic scene for a while now. On his debut album, he rides an interesting line between very minimal almost clinical electronic--but paired with a tremendous ear for creating atmosphere. He incorporates a few notes from a piano, underwater synth sounds, an occasional hip hop beat, sometimes singing with his falsetto--which really gives his songs character. He simply is able to craft very melodic music from practically nothing. Raffertie also excels at building and layering his sounds. Listening to the album in order is definitely recommended as several of his songs really only hit if following/proceeding certain tracks.""Rain"", ""Gagging Order"" and ""Trust (Feat. YADi)"" are my favorite singles from the album. They're all stand alone tracks as well as probably the most melodic. James Blake, Active Child, and the xx all certainly come to mind when listening to Raffertie--but I think the meticulous craft and attention to detail makes Raffertie stand out even when compared to these three. If this type of music is your thing, I would definitely check Raffertie out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20YRG45XVJCJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJ9GO0E#wasThisHelpful","R20YRG45XVJCJX","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting a few months for this album to finally drop in the States. Rudimental consists of four very talented British producers/songwriters. This album bounces between the spectrum of popular and edgy electronic music--not content to sit anywhere too long. I've seen several people complaining about how widely the tone and style varies, but personally I think it's thrilling. The majority of electronic albums figure out one sound that they like, and then everything else is a simple variation of that same sound. This album though has distinct songs and sounds that you can actually pick out and remember afterwards. It's thoughtful electronic ranging from massive drum'n'bass bangers, to very subtle minimal arrangements  la the xx and a very soulful r&b sound a bit like Frank Ocean with a bit of rap thrown in courtesy of Angel Haze.If you're familiar at all with Rudimental, you're more than likely aware of their number one hit ""Feel the Love"" featuring the very unique soul vocals of upcoming star John Newman. It blew up for good reason, the catchy synths, trumpet solo and John's Amy Winehouse like vocals make for a definite standout. Enough cannot be said about the quality of talent that Rudimental were able to get featured on this album. Mnek, Ella Eyre, Sinead Harnett not to mention John himself are all on the brink of really making it. This is one day going to be a who's who list of British musicians. Not to mention two tracks with the incomparable current ""it songwriter/singer"" Emeli Sande. Also one of the few non-Brits on the album, American Angel Haze lays down some wicked rhymes reminiscent of mix tape era Nicki.Biggest thing that makes me angry --on the deluxe UK edition, there is a brilliant jazz influenced track with killer vocals from Ella Eyre and trumpet solos from Mark Crown. It does not appear on the US release and this is makes me irrationally ticked off. Please go and find it. It's just got a killer chill groove paired with Ella's sultry vocals. It's the first song on the 9 minute long ""Solo"" which sort of rambles off into a free form jam session. It's a must. Also, despite the diversity--some of the songs get a touch too formulaic. Much like how they used actual spoons to provide some percussion on ""Spoons"", Rudimental could have pushed the boundaries a bit more on other tracks.Though this album is probably closer to 4 stars, I'm rounding up to five because I'm grateful to this album introducing me to so many quality artists plus I really dig the majority of songs even if they're not necessarily revolutionary. I would listen to the samples if you're still interested, as most samples give a very good idea of the songs are like.

"Unfortunately for many artists, quite often the best art comes out of very painful life events.  In the space between KT's last album and this release, her father died and she divorced her husband. It's clear that KT has channeled whatever clarity she has gained regarding mortality and heartache into this album. Musically it strips much of the production of her last album out, which leaves just KT and her guitar with minimal touches of other instruments. It's reflexive, meditative, and melancholic, yet not without moments of hope.This album though probably her best, will also probably do the worst commercially. It's exchanging of big radio singles for bare instrumentation is a brave artistic choice, which I believe pays off in the end for the listener. The real power of this album is KT's pairing of her words with her music. Often, it seems skilled lyricists simply come up with music just because they have to--and it only serves to showcase the lyrics. And then the majority of radio singles disregard lyrics all together, and the focus is on the feeling of the music. KT was able to write both lyrics and music though that work in harmony to convey the same message--same tone--same feeling. I do recommend listening to this album only when you have time to really listen to it. The nuances will likely be lost in a hurried rush through, it needs focused attention to be appreciated.""Made of Glass"" a song she wrote after the death of a dear friend, is an album standout. Understated and fragile, it's clear that KT has been grappling with thoughts of the afterlife for some time. Her father had Parkinson's for about two years before dying in a bike accident, and unsurprisingly mortality and how this relates to how we live our lives is a big theme of this album. ""Feel It All"" both the acoustic as well as band version included on the deluxe edition are mesmerizing. ""You made my branches grow/Now they can play in the wind/And they can carry the snow"" KT softly lilts.This album carries a double name as it is really two different albums, though each side compliments each other. This is due to KT recording the two different sides in two sessions, one in early April 2012, and the latter half in November of 2012 with each session having a different theme given KT's dealing with tremendous life changes in the space in between. If you've gotten a little bored with the first half, know that KT kicks it up a little on the back half. Howe Gelb co-wrote, co-produced and served as a backup vocalist for this album which I found a little unusual but welcome. KT is Scottish, but it seemed that I could almost hear the Arizona desert through Gelb's influence on this album. She recorded reel to reel, so all in one take and all live which I think really suits this stripped vulnerable style.If you're only a fan of the ""rockstar"" KT and were looking for some upbeat folky pop, then this is not the album for you. However, if a minimal and honest KT sounds good--then buy this album immediately. For fans of artists in the vein of Cat Stevens, Norah Jones, Missy Higgins and Laura Marling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG86EO2WY2KB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E5UEA4I#wasThisHelpful","RG86EO2WY2KB0","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As of August 2013, the Civil Wars are no more. They are no longer speaking to each other, and are indefinitely broken up. It has been speculated at length as to the nature of Joy Williams and John Paul White's breakup--whether in fact it was a romantic breakup despite both being married to other people, or artistic differences that could not be resolved. One cannot help but listen to this album and to think it's probably both, although the romantic feelings may have stayed emotional and never a full blown physical affair. If their breakup was necessary to create this album though, then I would say it was worth it. Intensely intimate and honest, there is a tortured beauty in the heavenly tones of Joy and John Paul's harmonies. Moments like this happen just once.The album starts off with the single ""The One That Got Away"", an impassioned story of regret that showcases Joy and has John Paul singing background to her. Then on the next track, the brooding innuendo laced ""I Had Me a Girl"", John Paul essentially sounds as if he's answering Joy. This really sets this album apart from their first, in that the music is two people singing to each other instead of with each other. Joy and John Paul are alternatingly smolderingly furious and resignedly fatigued, but always controlled, paying attention to their pitch perfect harmonies.While there are those moments of breathtaking harmonies like on ""Eavesdrop"", Joy does seem featured quite a bit more on this album than on their debut. This is a little unfortunate, as Joy's exquisitely pure voice often needs John Paul's raspier vocals to pull it away from coming across as  rather melodramatic. Still, I think the balance is more or less there on most of the songs. However, if you're predominately a fan of John Paul's voice--then this will be a big disappointment even though you can feel his influence probably more than on their debut through the music.Musically, this album infuses more Americana and rock into the Civil War's brand of largely acoustic driven folk/country/gospel. The music has a more aggressive ominous tone to match the heightened emotional stakes with drums and an electric guitar added on several songs making this album sonically different from their debut. Not surprising given John Paul's previous stint as a failed rock artist. This album also sees the inclusion of two covers, ""Tell Mama"" by Etta James and ""Disarm"" by Smashing Pumpkins. Strangely, it's the cover of ""Disarm"" that is one of the album showstoppers with a perfection that comes from the pair having performed it for years for live audiences. Also, the modern day hymn ""From This Valley"" serves as a nice respite in the middle of the drama providing a glimpse of the way Joy and John Paul used to be.At times, the album is a little uncomfortable to hear. It's almost as if you've been peeping into your arguing neighbors' window sort of enjoying the entertainment--but then witness them stab each other, and suddenly everything becomes deadly somber and almost claustrophobic. While Joy at least is willing to talk about the album--and has said that the imagery used is just that--poetic imagery, you can hear that it's more. You can feel it, see it. While I recognize the exquisite ""The Devil's Backbone"" is their purposeful take on an Americana murder ballad--you can't help but think the opening lines are truer than either Joy or John Paul will admit, ""Oh Lord, Oh Lord, What have I done...""This is not a breakup album--it's a Southern Gothic tragedy played out through music. It's quiet. Loud. Desperate. Remorseful. Accusatory. Seductive. It's two excellent solo artists realizing that they will probably never again taste the type of magic that happens only when they're together, and broken that they just can't be together anymore. In my opinion, the album of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5ULYRL5YZ5G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3Q14KW#wasThisHelpful","R2N5ULYRL5YZ5G","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was a Saturday night and I was bored therefore trolling through random trailers on Amazon when I came across ""Wasteland."" Immediately a couple of words stood out: ""Usual Suspects"", ""Oceans 11"", ""heist movies"", ""revenge movies""  etc.. The cast looked attractive and looked capable of acting. The production looked fine. I love all of these things. How on earth could this go wrong???Easily apparently. Much like the ""Usual Suspects"" this movie is being narrated by the lead in a jail interrogation room. And then it flashes back to what he is describing to the police officer. Now in these flash backs, it shows the the lead getting his three friends on board and then the planning and execution of a heist. And yet, you felt like nothing happened.I'm not sure why--the acting was fine. But it just seemed too shallow given the emphasis on the characters as opposed to plot. It was supposed to be emotional though and had lots of ""let's talk about our feelings"" scenes but somehow never gave these moments passion. ""The Town"" managed to show the strength and high stakes of interpersonal dynamics between a heist crew much more effectively than this movie. Even if the director hadn't wanted to go there-he could have gone the ""Inside Man"" route which doesn't focus on the characters as much but on the action. ""Wasteland"" spent just a short montage on the getting ready for the heist though, and just a few minutes on the actual heist. And in the ""Inside Man"" the interrogation scenes only serve to continually ratchet up the tension--where here they serve more as a children's bedtime story hour.This is basically a movie where nothing happens. Not between the characters and in a plot sense either. And honestly, I had actually figured out the real ending within about 20 minutes into the movie. And then towards the end, when it shows the ""big reveal"" it spent another 15 minutes hitting you over the head with it despite it being very clear as to how they did it. It has the subtlety and nuances of a three year old child. Which just leaves you with an incredibly flat frustrating very long story. Not that I need explicit sex scenes or graphic violence in all my movies-but I have to think they could have helped punch up the emotional content a bit. Despite being rated R for a beat down and some language--it has almost PG like sensibilities.In short, movies like this only work if you're on the edge of your seat the whole time--and I decidedly was not.So much potential. Such a big miss.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNYBIVGHHII2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU71NUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2XNYBIVGHHII2","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much of the comedy in this movie made me borderline uncomfortable. Steve Little's character Chad especially had the lines where you sort of spit the water in your mouth back into your cup and raise your eyebrows, not knowing whether or not its okay to laugh. There are jokes made about just about everything that you're not supposed to make jokes out of. However, I think the humor by in large managed to stay rather satirical rather than juvenile. I saw Chad as sort of vehicle for opening up a discussion about some of the topics raised, which in the end was refreshing.As this is the type of movie that is basically endless talking with very little set changes and action--it's important that the relationship dynamics are simply perfect at all times. Unfortunately, there were a few times that I felt that movie was forcing things a little bit which just served as a reminder that the movie is pretty low budget and takes you out of the momentum. But by in large I found it witty and very different to the types of movies currently being made. It did remind me of times like an extended episode of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", but that's not a bad thing in the slightest. I would rent this movie first, if after watching the trailer there were moments where you genuinely laughed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WU44688TWAUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJVKIIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1WU44688TWAUB","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Longtime fans of Franti will probably be disappointed with this album. It's essentially ""Michael Franti: the Lite Edition""--which doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. Yes, it's less political and certainly is lacking  the depth of earlier albums, but it's also probably his most accessible album. Before the cries of ""corporate sellout"", it's important to realize that this album managed to combine very catchy and well done music paired with positive messages of equality, hope and love in a manner that is highly listenable and not sickeningly cheesy. And I think this could have been a great thing.While Franti certainly has his fans, it wasn't until 2009's ""Say Hey (I Love You)"" that he gained wide attention. This album is very much a continuation of that type of sound (albeit with a little more pop and hip hop thrown in).  Franti's current sound is very much an evolution and amalgamation of all of his previous work. It often has a reggae like groove, but now uses music from other genres--folk, rock, hip hop, pop, jazz and funk all make appearances to combine into a layered yet generally fast paced and upbeat sound.Lead single ""All People"" blasts off with a party of different instruments and electric sounds. While lyrically repetitive, if it doesn't put a smile on your face--then you're probably the type of person who also kicks puppies in your spare time. However, ""11:59"" quickly pulls things back into a more serious yet sweet tone: ""One Love/One Blood/ One Heart/ One soul/One drum and only one rhythm/ One tribe and all of us singing.... If I'm gonna die tonight, I want heaven--with You."" It's probably one of my favorites off the album, and lyrically is very representative of the album as a whole. ""On and On"" is more narrative like, but again it focuses on Franti's relationship with someone--just asking for more time, ""...as simple as that.""Unfortunately, I don't think there is any song on here with real staying power. I like them, and I'll have fun listening to them in these last few moments of summer, but this is not memorable music. Here is where Franti's lack of depth and repetitive lyrics really hurts. While I hope people appreciate Franti's message and that it reaches people his old stuff would never have reached, this isn't an album that I'll remember next year. However, at the end of the day, it's a well made--slick pop album with a positive message and that the kids I babysit frequently would really enjoy.***The Deluxe additions contains the added tracks: ""Gangsta Girl"", ""Life is Better with You (Acoustic)"", ""I Don't Wanna Go"", ""Do It for the Love"", and ""Let It Go."" I personally would only pick up the acoustic version of ""LISBWY"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EWLXHJAJPXTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0ZKSHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2EWLXHJAJPXTC","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last night I saw this movie on Netflix, but then went over to Amazon to immediately buy this movie. Why? Because it's just that good. Kristin Chenoweth is one of the most underrated actress in Hollywood--spot on every time. She has impeccable comedic timing and facial expressions. But this movie is certainly more than just Kristin--and it would have to be to really succeed as this is very much an ensemble production.Relative newcomer Olesya Rulin (that is if you don't count small parts in ""High School Musical"" trilogy), is a total standout in this role, and also carries much of the emotional balance of the movie on her shoulders. She plays Emily, an uptight and often more disciplined kid than the rest of the adults in the movie (much less in real life), but is also a kid who sometimes makes horrifically bad decisions. I really think Olesya deserves much of the credit in turning what  could have been a cheesy and wholly unbelievable slapstick comedy made for ABC Family, into a nuanced subversive intimate portrait of an extreme version of what many modern families actually are like--and the consequences and emotional impact of when that family unit breaks down.That being said--this movie is also hysterical. It probably helps if you have both an appreciation for modern art as well as a little knowledge about it's history (Warhol, Pollack etc.) as there are several sight gags as well as verbal jokes that otherwise would be missed. Matthew Modine as the free spirited stoner parent/painter is equally deplorable as well as adorable. He also is practically pitch perfect in his role-really everyone in this movie carries their own weight--even the child actors. Joey King's acting out of several characters and scenes from ""Taxi Driver"" as well as ""Reservoir Dogs"" is equally uncomfortable as she's just a child as well as side clutching hilarious (much like Chlo Moretz's role in ""Kick-A**"").It's funny, but I actually wanted to show this movie to some tweens I regularly babysit as I thought they would both enjoy it simply as entertainment--but that it also might help them deal with some of the issues dealt with in the movie that pretty much all teenagers go through. Then I realized that this movie was rated R, and decided I might wait a year or two as the R content though very mild and brief is still probably pushing the line too far for where the tweens are at right now. However, I have no doubt that I will eventually show this movie to them, and that they will both enjoy it as well as appreciate the emotions and themes the movies deals with.Very funny, very heartwarming. Recommended for ages mature teens-mid 20s, and parents of young teenagers as well.***Side notes, if you happen to see the main trailer for this movie--it looks super dumb and cheesy. Ignore the trailer and watch the movie. This is one of the rare cases where the trailer doesn't do the movie justice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FG0ROROGI14H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CG6CRTI#wasThisHelpful","R2FG0ROROGI14H","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Far too short to satisfy. I want more. Right now. I want the full album! There hasn't been much in regards to rap music that has gotten me this excited this year. ""Anatidaephobia"" (aka the fear that a duck is watching you), is one of the sickest and intelligent takes on incorporating electronic sounds like trapstep into hip hop that I've ever heard. You feel it pump straight through your bloodstream which then comes out in your inexplicably moving feet.There are three enormously talented djs/musicians/producers between this debut EP, who all hail from Georgia. If you listen to much Southern rap, you can definitely hear early 2000s crunk mixed in with this hybrid hip hop/trapstep. Also, mixed in with the heavy bass lines are full on horn and piano not to mention straight up rock arrangements which really elevate the music. On a vocal front these guys both sing as well as rap. And by sing--I mean really sing. While not as smooth, the main vocalist really reminds me of Otis although that's not a very good comparison. I think it has to do more with the grit and soul in the voice instead of actual tone.Oh--about the whole duck thing. Per one of the members, ""Everybody sees the duck traveling smoothly on top of the water but nobody sees it kicking hard as hell under it, struggling to stay afloat.""This album simply makes me frustrated. It's so good that I get to the end and am then unhappy.

"I think it's easy to often brush off the children of major stars who then go into the entertainment/fashion industries as merely skating by off of their parent's cred. That being said, I think it's important to realize that sometimes the very same things that can drive the parent to success can be present and burn furiously in the child. Sting's daughter Coco is a perfect example of someone who clearly inherited talent, but then put their own unique spin on it. And as for the children of two artists who then grow up in an environment full of other artists and creators, on top of often having frequently turbulent and unusual childhoods--it's not surprising that they can be capable of real magic if they can just harness all of that talent, experience and emotion.I believe that Lou Doillon is one of these artists. Her family is practically French royalty (mother singer/actress/fashion muse Jane Birkin, father acclaimed filmmaker Jacques Doillon, sister actress/singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and her sister's father iconic singer Serge Gainsbourg was also a constant presence). Lou herself acted in numerous films starting from a young age, but she always felt sort of the odd man out in her very famous extraordinarily talented family. At age nineteen a cousin who she was very close to was tragically killed, and she also became pregnant by a man who soon left her. Afterwards, her life dramatically changed and she became something of a recluse for about 10 years--that is until a friend of her mother's heard some of her music and convinced her to record it. In 2013, Lou won the French equivalent of the Grammys for female artist of the year for her debut album, shocking just about everyone.""Places"" is the type of achingly confessional folk music along the lines of artists like Cat Power and Leonard Cohen with definite influences of second father figure Serge. It's intensely honest and personal, yet the delivery is quite often dispassionate almost like Lou is singing as an observer to her life and not as the star actor. She sings in very measured tones, practically speaking sometimes-definitely speaking on brilliant title track ""Places"". Her strength in songwriting comes from her ability to paint scenes not always with physical details but sometimes with emotions. At times these scenes are so vivid and palpable that you are find yourself immersed in them, able to perfectly relate them to your own experiences. And so Lou sets the scene for you to relive some of the most difficult and hard to accept truths about your own life by opening up about her own life.Now every song doesn't achieve a magnetic connection, and on these few misses--the songs end up just being boring and rather tedious. And honestly, I imagine that's how a lot of people will hear this record. Unless the lyrics speak to you, the music is not going to entice you to stay. It's either an emotional introspective journey or monotone drivel depending on the listener. Both viewpoints can be entirely accurate. Lou doesn't have the type of standout technical talent say of someone like Mariah Carey who most people may or may not enjoy but will agree on her tremendous voice and vocal range. Either you believe Lou and are swept into her perspective of the world which may give clarity into your own world, or this album will come across as excessively self indulgent.On a side note--Lou speaks/sings impeccable English, so understanding her lyrics is never a concern. Also, Soko's  I Thought I Was An Alien reminds me as a more sarcastic and funny version of Lou. My two favorite songs aside from ""Places"" are the upbeat and layered with jazz touches ""Questions and Answers"" and the softly lilting ""Same Old Game"". If artists like Power, Cohen, Buckley, and Mitchell get you excited--then I would definitely recommend spending the time to get to know Lou.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3II7LFA3I5E4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8UOE5G#wasThisHelpful","R3II7LFA3I5E4W","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros burst into the music scene in 2009 with the already classic single ""Home"" and a debut album bursting with potential. People wanted to know where this joyous Woodstock lovechild had emerged from--and who on earth Edward was. As so often with brilliant debuts, they are not really debuts but really the culmination of previous failed attempts. After initial success with band Ima Robot, lead singer Alex Ebert felt lost in a party lifestyle and drug addiction. He subsequently went to rehab and while he then continued releasing music with Ima Robot, he still was clearly looking for something else. Later Alex found the pixie like and wonderfully intoxicating Jade Castrinos wandering about in Los Angeles. While together, they started writing and performing, slowly building up a troupe of 10ish troubadours and artists that finally collectively became known as Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, named after a quasi-religious alter ego that Alex created once he became sober.The band followed up their official debut with sophomore album ""Here"" which was a disappointment as while it was consistent; it was not exceptional and had no breakout singles like ""Home."" At this point, I was prepared to sort of write off the Zeros as somewhat of a novelty act capable of greatness but realistically a band that made me feel more nostalgic about the past than grounded in the present.However, the Zeros eponymous third album is where all that changes. While there are still no singles which reach the zenith of ""Home"", Alex has finally managed to ground his writing in reality that resonates. It's much more mature, more somber writing--though musically this isn't always reflected as there is no shortage of bombastic clapping stomping choruses. Alex is at his absolute best writing though, not when falling back on sweet but rather contrived lyrics or when giving into moments of nonsensical hyper religious imagery--but when writing from the perspective of just a man in a desperate and determined quest for total abandon in the face of pain and difficult life circumstances.On the brilliant ""Life is Hard"", Alex is a pied piper, beckoning us, slowly pulling us in, ""Do not fear/It's safe to say it here/You will not be called a weakling/Nor a fraud/For feeling the pain of the whole wide world....Come celebrate/Life is Hard/All Life is All We Are.... It's getting lost and getting found/To growing up and getting round/It's feeling silence, feeling sound...It's feeling oh so beautiful! Yes!"" Set over a rather sparse instrumentation of restrained horns and piano with Jade trading off on the verses and the whole band joining on the chorus, its extraordinarily powerful and emotional. Leading track ""Better Days"" is in much of the same vein as well--acknowledging the past, yet ""dreaming of better days."" And closing track ""This Life"" is perhaps the most vulnerable Alex has ever been. Alex teeters between newfound truth and a growling self-focused anger at lies he's told himself to get by. It's a seething aggressive end to an otherwise celebratory as opposed to confrontational album.That's not to say that this album is without moments of sheer exhilaration. ""Let's Get High"" steals the musical stylings of the Beatles mixed with Dylan's ""Everybody Must Get Stoned."" And anytime where Jade gets the lead is sure to bring happiness. Her standout solo on ""Remember to Remember is soothing and like wrapping oneself up in sweater knitted by grandma while sipping cocoa. Jade simply has one of the most unique but unaffected sounding voices I've ever heard. Imagine if Tinker Bell was real and had been born in the 60s. That's Jade. Flower Power for sure.I would be remiss in not mentioning though, that there are several rather ""flavorless"" songs as another reviewer put it. ""Two"", ""Please"", and ""In the Lion"" could have all been tracks from the ""Here"" album. Not horrible, just not memorable and bland. However, I would much prefer an album with exceptional tracks mixed with a few duds in contrast to one with homogeneously standard sounding tracks that that don't really move me.For anyone disappointed with ""Here"" but willing to give the Zeros another try--I'd definitely recommend picking up this album. And if you happened to love both albums, as well as Alex's solo music, then I can't imagine this will be a disappointment either. It's a progression in maturity, content and restraint. All of which let the natural talent of Edward and his Zeros shine that much brighter. For fans of modern bands like Freelance Whales, Blitzen Trapper or even Mumford plus anyone seeking a little bit of that spirit of the Summer of Love.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EU0W5U9XBC67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWNDSM4#wasThisHelpful","R1EU0W5U9XBC67","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In high-school especially, I would never ever admit to anyone that I even listened to mainstream bands. I made sure that my ""favorite"" bands were all either obscure, foreign, or respectable oldies. While I totally did and still do love those bands and I'd like to think that my musical taste has only gotten better with time, I also totally have always indulged in the occasional mainstream band/artist. Cody Simpson is one of those mainstream artists.""Surfer's Paradise"" is not a full album but a continuation really of Cody's first full length official album ""Paradise."" While record label Atlantic no doubt wanted to just push out more music to ride the wave of success off of 2012's ""Paradise"", ""Surfer's Paradise"" actually is a whole lot more layered and much more stylistically true to who Cody probably is/wants to become as an artist. He's honestly not a Justin Bieber, but more like a baby pop version of Jack Johnson or even the brilliant and fellow Aussie Xavier Rudd.That's not to say that this album isn't straight up pop though. It is. Unashamedly. It even has the prerequisite guest rappers on a verse or two. But it has a slight island breezy acoustic vibe, as opposed to just strictly dance/electronic inspired pop which most other mainstream pop artists are throwing out. So essentially, it's fun and light and summery, but it has enough depth that I actually remember the songs afterwards. And maybe find myself humming them while work and then having to play them on the ride home.Parents--this is an album that you could buy for your kids and not cry when having to listen to it for the 60ish time.

"I bought these a while ago before I figured out that while I love the in ear Skullcandy buds, their actual headphones are generally really cheaply made. I have now owned three different types of the over the ear Skullcandy headphones, and while I have thought the sound was pretty decent and they looked so cool (which is why I kept buying them), all three pairs simply broke down after a few months of light use. I'm used to keeping excellent care of my electronic toys, as when I was in college--every dime I spent was a dime I had to earn and I had precious few dimes. Basically, I'm super careful with things I spend my own money on. And these just didn't have the build quality to back up the cool design. Shame.For anyone looking for superior build as well as superior sound, I would check out these other headphones which I've also owned and really got a whole lot more mileage out of. Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black) for a super cheap option. And V-MODA Crossfade LP Over-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone (Gunmetal Black)for a higher priced set that has great sound but also looks as cool as the Skullcandy line.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8KU55UTOVUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FOK28Y#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8KU55UTOVUP","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit to having a small crush on Matt Nathanson. Let's be honest, ""Come on Get Higher"" is literally pure sex. However, given that I have all of his albums--it means that I probably hold him to a higher standard than a casual listener, as I know just how right Matt can get it when he's on. And I'm thrilled to announce, that this album is largely ""on"" for Matt.Matt sort of perversely mixes alternatingly bitter and angry breakup/bad relationship lyrics with quite upbeat and happy music that leads to some very powerful moments. And in the moments of real pain and frustration at not being able to get a bad relationship right, there are much needed moments of optimistic hope. Despite the fact that lead single ""Mission Bells"" references suicide, drowning, and other ominous imagery, it still manages to make you stomp your feet and leaves you with the anticipation that things will somehow get better in the future. Matt is also capable of creating intricate pictures through use of specific details which strangely doesn't alienate as much as make the underlying emotions more relatable and sincere. You sort of feel, ""Yep, we've all been there.""Musically, I think Matt actually branched out a little more than usual with this album. It has moments of unashamed big hand clapping numbers reminiscent of several popular indie folk bands, pure rock (""Annie's Always Waiting"") not to mention sugary hooks that will have you singing along at the top of your lungs in a car with friends. The piano driven ""Kill the Lights"" though, is probably my favorite song off the album. It's grounded  in a an aware acknowledgement of what older relationships often look like, yet has this fearless and almost arrogant ""come at me bro"" attitude. It also happens to be very sensual.Another very solid album from one of the hardest working musicians in the business. I sincerely hope that this album's radio friendly hooks yet depth of lyrics and skill help push Matt back into a mainstream conversation.  For fans of singers like Matt Hires, Philip Philips and Gavin DeGraw.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J9YLSIGA5BVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRCP12A#wasThisHelpful","R3J9YLSIGA5BVS","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago I saw Sara in Chapel Hill performing with Greg Laswell. I realized there that Sara was simply just the real deal. She has both a magnetic joy onstage as well as the actual vocal talent to make her live performances sound as good as if not better than her studio albums. Something I've always found really special about her music though, is how accessible yet a little left of mainstream it tends to be. Its equal parts catchy and heartfelt--yet I never feel like she's trying too hard.This album builds upon that by incorporating some new elements like jazz and electronic into her special brand of aware piano driven pop music. While listening to the exquisite ballad ""Manhattan"", I could see a dark smoky jazz club from the 1940s with Sara lying across a piano, crooning about a lost love to a hushed audience. Another more upbeat jazz influenced album standout, ""Little Black Dress"" sees the appearance of Sara's older sister doing Motown inspired pitch perfect background vocals which just mesh perfectly with Sara's voice. ""Satellite Call"" on the other hand, with its slight reverb and haunting melody makes me feel like I'm somehow underneath the Northern Lights just staring up at the stars lit up in swirling colors.""I Choose You"" starts with a subtle stringed bass line and understated vocals, yet builds into a very sweet and honest love song. It's the type of song that you could see being used in one of those lip synched marriage proposal extravaganzas on YouTube. Overall, this album probably is a bit more upbeat--not so much in tone (as many of the songs sound like breakup songs), but musically than her past two albums. ""Eden"" especially embraces this driving electronic sound. In the hands of a lesser talented vocalist, I don't think it would have worked and would have stuck out like a sore thumb. But Sara's smooth and melodic voice is the glue that pulls the range of musical genres together into a package that just feels right. Highly recommend listening through a few times before making up your mind about this album (it's streaming on iTunes), as I found myself being nonchalant about a few songs the first time I heard them--but then going back and just losing myself in them.Longtime fans of Sara will not be disappointed with this album. She managed to push herself musically and keep things interesting, while retaining everything that makes her art special. It has poetic quiet moments, bombastic inspiring anthems (""Brave"" was co-written with Jack Antonoff of FUN.) and above all a determination to embrace life to the fullest and well, be brave. Excellent pop that does more than entertain--it speaks for a generation.***For anyone looking for new similar artists, I recently saw piano pop singer/songwriter Jillette Johnson in concert, and she positively blew my mind. If you're a huge fan of Sara's, I'd wager that you would love Jillette too (Water in a Whale [+digital booklet].","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QZ1M18Q878K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRDSKUE#wasThisHelpful","R39QZ1M18Q878K","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, the 2011 version of this album that most everyone in the world is already familiar worth is by far my favorite Beyonc album. ""Start Over"" and ""I Was Here"" are both brilliant in my opinion. Beyonc somehow manages to stay relevant and on trend without actually partaking in current music trends. Her voice is phenomenal, capable of soaring power as well as determined emotion.I was very surprised to see this release of ""4"" with two new songs almost two years after the original version dropped. I haven't heard anyone talking about this re-release or seen any buzz which was really surprising and led me to believe that the two new songs probably sucked or otherwise were unworthy of excitement. This however, is totally false.""Schoolin' Life"" has a little 80s pop vibe that sounds vaguely like ""Papa Don't Preach"" by Madonna. It has fresh lyrics and vocal style that make it grounded in 2013 and directly applicable to me life situation right now though. I haven't heard a take on 80s pop that I've enjoyed this much in a very long time.""Dance For You"" though takes on the next decade and is a throwback to 90s style r&b. On the chorus, I can even imagine that it's Aaliyah actually. It has a chill sexiness mixed with Beyonc's total confidence in herself. Also really enjoyable.If you already own this album and enjoy it, I would highly recommend picking up these two new songs. No brainer. If you're on the fence about Beyonc, these probably aren't the two to get your feet wet with though. If you're new to her discography, I would recommend listening to ""Ave Maria"" off of her ""Sasha Fierce"" album and ""Ring the Alarm"" off of ""B'Day."" Either way, Beyonc is one of the most influential and genuinely talented singers of this generation, and worth a listen no matter what.***Update--apparently both of these songs were on the 2011 deluxe version, so if you got the deluxe--you should already have these songs. Now they're simply on the regular album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROA2JS8VNRRV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C10MFQE#wasThisHelpful","ROA2JS8VNRRV9","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that I had no idea who RDGLDRN was, but have recently become obsessed with all things Angel Haze. She's skilled and very listenable yet retains a little bit of underground cred edge. I thought this song was pleasant enough with its rebellious chant or mantra like chorus and punk rock edge provided randomly by the Foo Fighter's Dave Grohl (apparently he happened to be in the same studio at the time or something like that).However, if Angel Haze is actually on this song-you wouldn't know it. Maybe her voice is part of the auto-tuned chorus--but that could just as well be another band member. I went and watched the video to see if I had somehow missed her, and she doesn't show up there either. And the thing that's bumming me out, is that she really would have been perfect on a song like this if she had actually been utilized properly instead of being regulated to the cliche ""girl sings chorus"" thing. Meh.I think I would like the song a whole lot better if I didn't know that Angel was supposed to actually be on it, as its pretty good and RDGLDRN seems like they have a unique spin on the whole hip-hop/rock crossover genre. But knowing what it could have been makes me sad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1INM55PU14SCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DOOCAQG#wasThisHelpful","R1INM55PU14SCX","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This song kept popping up as a recommendation, and as it's currently free--I thought ""why not."" I'm glad I picked this up though. I think a few years ago, this is the type of music I would have written off as boring--but now I appreciate the light indie pop groove. The leads voice keeps reminding me of Don McLean (""American Pie""), and the brief moments of harmony make me think of great 60s bands like the Mamas & the Papas or the Byrds. As long as this song is free, I'd pick it up--if not, it's probably something only a more dedicated fan would want to pay for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MEKG5SU7TE5X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DAPKFI4#wasThisHelpful","R2MEKG5SU7TE5X","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first became aware of Skylar Grey through my middle school obsession with all things related to Linkin Park. When Mike dropped ""Where'd You Go,"" I immediately looked up who sang the haunting chorus and discovered the slightly gothic and intriguing voice of Holly Brook. I listened to her solo debut album a few times (""Like Blood, Like Honey""), but ultimately didn't get into it. It was just a little one note for me, but over the years Holly went through some major life changes--the least of which was changing her professional name to Skylar Grey, living in a remote Oregon cabin for a year, and starting to write with Alex Da Kid.With Alex producing, Skylar wrote one of the biggest and most influential songs of the past decade--""Love the Way You Lie"" as well as wrote and sang the hooks on other massive songs like ""Words I Never Said"" (Lupe), ""Coming Home"" (Diddy), and ""I Need a Doctor"" (Dre). When one listens to Skylar's original demos of these songs especially ""Love the Way You Lie,"" there's just this tearing sadness and brutal vulnerability that demonstrates her incredible skill as both a songwriter as well as showcases her quiet yet unique and pitch perfect voice.With this new album, I was really hoping that Skylar would really be able to be confident enough to push herself musically, yet be willing to reveal herself lyrically---and she kind of succeeds in this aspect. There is a subtle range between more hip hop influenced songs (the excellent ""S***, Man!"") to a darker more hypnotic pop (""Final Warning""). The piano driven ""White Suburban"" is pretty reminiscent of early Holly Brook though, and is actually one of the album standouts.Unfortunately, I think this album suffered from being put on shelf for too long though, and then got re-worked too many times. Skylar is at her best when she is searingly honest with quiet instrumentation to back her up. I just felt there were several missed moments on this album though with too much production that leached out the emotion. Probably my biggest disappointment with this album is simply that I don't think it did Skylar justice, she's brilliantly talented and this just wasn't mind blowing.That's not to say this album is bad in any way though. The majority of songs just work. The emotion, the lyrics, catchy music, Skylar's voice. ""Clear Blue Sky"" and ""Wear Me Out"" are early favorites. If we're being honest, Skylar at her worst is about 10x better than the majority of drivel out there. She's been singing professionally since age 6, and you can hear her total mastery of her voice as well as thoughtful song interpretation. At the end of the day, Skylar is not just a singer or songwriter, but an artist. She doesn't just sing a song, she crafts and builds them.While all songs aren't created equally, I wouldn't recommend just buying singles as I don't think one would be able to tell which songs appeal from just listening to the samples or even a full one time listen. Skylar's music grows on you over time, and I think it's worth it to buy the whole album to figure out what personally appeals (provided this is your type of music in the first place obviously). For fans of Imogen Heap, Dido and fans of mixing pop with hip hop influences.******************UPDATESo in the last few days, I've realized that Skylar released several different versions of this album. Honestly, if she had been allowed to include a few of these songs on the official album--that would have bumped this up to 5 stars for me. See below for what versions contain what--and what matters.Amazon & Target Deluxe CD Bonus Tracks:""Weirdo""--lyrics too reminiscent of ""Creep"" for my taste but a nice track.""Beautiful Nightmare""Itunes Bonus Tracks:""Love the Way You Lie, PT. III (Original Demo)""--incidentally used to be on the ""Buried Session of Skylar Grey"" here on Amazon but has been removed since I bought it. More powerful than Part 1 and Part 2.""Ticking Time Bomb""Spotify Deluxe Edition:""Only Thing I Hear""--Can't believe this wasn't included on the actual album. It's probably the best on it. Subtle and deeply emotional. I would definitely find this somewhere.Floating around the internet:""Can't Haunt Me""--A track with Marilyn Manson that was apparently cut all together from the album, but is also a standout track. Sexy vocals singing about zombies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32QU82ZSL7W20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNN8DG4#wasThisHelpful","R32QU82ZSL7W20","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In general, they have pre-filled out insides as well as less than classy outsides.

"I haven't seen the ""Lone Ranger"" yet, but from the previews it looks like an action comedy much in the vein of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" just on horses. Hans Zimmer is even back again to team up with Director Gore Verbinski to write the actual score of the movie. When I realized though that Disney was in fact releasing two soundtracks to the movie--the score by Zimmer, and then music inspired by the movie, I was interested in seeing what types of music would be ""inspired by"" a comedy western action film.Surprisingly authentic and serious music actually. I was fortunate to be able to attend Merlefest this year which is one of the largest folk music festivals in the US and founded by the brilliant and late Doc Watson in memory of his son Merle. While there are a range of music styles on this album: country, rock, modern folk and even reggae--they are all grounded in a respectful traditional folk that wouldn't be unwelcome on the main stage at Merlefest. Some of these songs are originals, and some are covers of Americana classics like ""Sweet Betsy from Pike.""Grace Potter's ""Devil's Train"" is an immediate standout with its upbeat acoustic guitar yet old timey gospel inspired lyrics. She certainly does Hank Williams proud. Iron & Wine's Samuel Beam is back with a new single in the form of the lilting and ominous ""Rattling Bone"" which crescendos to a nice deep bass drum and keyboards. Sara Watkins of Nickel Creek fame lets loose with some excellent fiddling on ""Central and Union."" John Grant's cover of Julie London's smoky and jazzy ""Saddle the Wind"" is also a nice touch.There are a couple of songs that don't work that well for me, but at 14 tracks--it was cheaper to buy the whole album than pick out singles that I liked. However, that may not be the case for everyone. I would recommend listening to the samples to see if particular songs are up your alley before buying as there is a wide range of styles. Still, I would recommend this album as a refreshing and respectful take on a beloved genre of music that doesn't get much mainstream attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CNX0DWAST0SG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGFIEBS#wasThisHelpful","R1CNX0DWAST0SG","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not often I'm left unsure of how I feel about something. I think most people much like myself will waver between two opinions--either this movie is needlessly confusing/tedious and the director was just getting off on being clever, or this movie is a fantastic graphic psychological thriller. After having mulled on this for a while though, I've decided that I am in the latter camp.British director Danny Boyle of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Trainspotting"" has created a world that is both paradoxically grounded in a gritty R rated visual, yet is on a whole different dimension when it comes to the plot and sequencing of events. Much like ""Inception,"" ""Trance"" can be interpreted several different ways. The time frame of events, what is actually real, and who is ""telling"" the story are all subject to discussion. Unlike ""Memento"" where the story is clearly told backwards, it's possible that ""Trance"" is not linear either backwards or forwards. But at the same time, it could be. This is both part of the fun, as well as part of the frustration I felt when watching for the first time.I tend to gravitate towards mysteries or plot twists that are shocking due to their relationship to the rest of the story, yet ""Trance"" is different. Its plot twists are not something that you can definitively figure out like a good mystery, nor are they related to the story so much as the very method of filming. There was a point while watching the movie though, where I just accepted the complexities and relaxed into enjoying the stylish and dream like narrative though. Strangely, once I let go of forcing things to make sense--the movie actually picked up and I started really noticing details that helped in my understanding.James McAvoy as the intriguing art auctioneer who comes by a head injury/amnesia, and Rosario Dawson as his hypnotist with ulterior motives absolutely nail their respective roles. Their minute facial expressions and body language are spot on, and really push depth into the script and into their characters. The soundtrack by Rick Smith is appropriately scattered and the electronic edge serves the mood of the movie as well.At the end of the day, this movie really stuck with me despite having seen it a while ago. While it didn't really effect me emotionally, it was mentally interesting enough that I kept going through the events in my head and wanting to discuss my latest theories with my friends. Visually and musically, it's a feast. I would highly recommend this movie to people who enjoy movies like ""Inception"", ""Memento"" or even ""Donnie Darko."" If you're willing to go along with the ride, that ride can take you places no other movie I've seen this year has been able to do.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JSJN2BPTAU6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGBRGGG#wasThisHelpful","R2JSJN2BPTAU6U","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My boss suggested I get an actual planner after seeing me struggle to keep track of different tasks and meetings between my Outlook calendar, my Google calendar, Word document lists for myself and random notebook scribblings.At first I got the planner just to make him happy, believing that I knew a superior way being a child of the tech generation; however, now this little book organizes my entire life. Having something physical in front of me--and writing with a pen is simply different and strangely more demanding of my attention than a Gcalendar. When my life is on pen and paper--I pay attention, when it's a Google alert, it's just too easy to delete the notification. The planner devotes an entire page to each day with times on every half hour which is super helpful.My only dislike is that the cover is difficult to close and make lay flat on the paper. NBD tho.

"A few months ago, I was able to catch one of my favorite bands---Delta Rae--in front of a massive packed crowd in their hometown of Durham. While they were amazing as always, I left raving about the first opening act, Jillette Johnson. Somehow she was able to turn a simple performance on just a keyboard in front of an audience unfamiliar with her work into a highly emotional and charged experience. My friend who I went with even started crying during her performance of ""Cameron"" (incidentally the song that got her signed).Jillette's particular brand of pop is similar to that of Sara Bareilles, it's highly listenable piano driven pop paired with intelligent lyrics and a powerhouse vocal. At times actually, I think I can hear a little bit of Idina Menzel in Jillette's voice. The music is layered nicely as well. Knowing that Jillette more than likely wrote most of these songs by first starting at the piano, her music never feels like disjointed or an afterthought. There are strings, drums, horns etc. when there needs to be, and just her voice and her piano when it needs to be. Much credit to her producers Peter Zizzo (Vanessa Carlton, Avril Lavigne) and Michael Mangini (Joss Stone, David Byrne) for helping her achieve this tricky balance.Immediately after I saw her in concert though, I went out and bought her excellent little EP ""Whiskey & Frosting."" So I sort of initially bought this album simply out of an appreciation for what Jillette does, but I had resigned myself to believing that the EP probably had contained all of her best songs. Not so. While I still love the songs from the EP, the rest of this album is equally as good. ""True North"" and ""Basset Hound"" are immediate standouts. And I've realized now that I've played ""Butterfly Catcher"" 49 times in my iTunes, so I guess that's a standout too. Jillette's writing prowess cannot be emphasized enough. She really knows how to craft a song, and milk the big moments. Not to mention her lyrics have a poetic quality to them that is very refreshing.After seeing her pour her heart out onstage though, I have to say that this album doesn't in fact do her voice total justice. On my favorite song ""When the Ship Goes Down"", she positively let's loose live, while this album version is much more restrained. However, that's a minor criticism to an album that is unequivocally an excellent pop record. I doubt this album is going to get much radio time (not for the lack of catchy tunes tho), but I sincerely hope that people really get on board and embrace this record. Not only is the album chock full of songs with real staying power, but also songs that can make a difference in helping people understand not only other people--but also themselves.For fans of Sara Bareilles, ZZ Ward, and Paloma Faith, and people who like intelligent pop. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZHFRF56DO7JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCIRRIA#wasThisHelpful","RZHFRF56DO7JP","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rise"" is Skillet's magnum opus. It's perhaps the best album that they will ever create. Musically it incorporates Skillet's entire body of work from the early electronic influences to the harder edge of ""Collide"" to the symphonic rock found on the most recent albums, yet all these elements work together to relentlessly push ""Rise"" into new places. The effect of everything hitting at once is visceral--tangible.Thankfully, I'm no longer the painfully strange middle schooler who latched onto the crying angst and loneliness found in Skillet albums like ""Collide;"" however, I believe I'm always going be asking questions like ""How can evil like that exist in this world"", or ""What is my place"" to ""How on earth am I going to get through this day."" These questions and answers have always been the core of John Cooper's writing; however ""Rise"" puts these messages into a logical progression and flow that makes them even more powerful.""Rise"" is not a rock opera or concept album in the way many people are probably used to---probably because most of types of albums always seem so forced. However, it is in fact a concept album divided into three separate chapters. It's not so much a story as an emotional journey as seen through the perspective of a young teenager. The first act is about a kind of naive brashness and optimism (""Rise"" to ""Not Gonna Die""). The second act is really a horror and growing awareness of the world (""Circus for a Psycho"" to ""Madness in Me""), and the third act is about redemption and hope (everything after ""MiM"").Now a casual listener could totally hear a few singles, and get a pretty good idea of the message of ""Rise""--as well as thoroughly enjoy those singles--but I do strongly suggest listening at least twice to the entire album in progression for the full impact of the writing. Also, one need not be a Christian or even particularly religious to both be moved by this album as well as enjoy it for being a killer rock record. It's very telling that in 2012, only three ""rock"" bands achieved platinum status (if you're seriously counting Mumford and the Black Keys as rock bands along there with Skillet). That's not to say though that Skillet hides their Christianity in any way though. From quoting Bible verses to explicit Christ references, it's very clear that John's answers to the aforementioned questions are found in a deep and abiding trust in Christ.Musically, ""Rise"" is aggressive and loud. John Cooper is simply one of the most intense rock performers still active who is also out on the road for the majority of the year. You can hear his passion and skill honed by countless performances in the past 20 plus years he's been professionally creating music. The addition of Seth Morrison on lead guitar was almost certainly a factor in kicking up the edge in ""Rise"", as Seth lets loose with several mean riffs. John's wife Korey is always a solid presence, adding depth and complexity with both her backing vocals that blend so well with John as well as her skill on multiple instruments. Jen Ledger is still simply a wunderkind on the drums, able to flawlessly move from crashing thunderclaps to providing the fragile heartbeat to the music. She also has an expanded role on this album, sharing more lead vocal duties with John. It's extremely rare to have a rock band integrate two powerful female rock musicians as simply integral members of the band as opposed to just the lead singer or eye candy. Too often I feel like the male/female divide in rock is akin to the ""separate but equal"" philosophy, where the best of the best are usually in all one gender bands. It's great to see that turned on it's head with Skillet.Jen also provided the exquisite album artwork which so beautifully encapsulates the message of ""Rise."" I think everyone still sort of feels like a little kid sometimes, facing the world-- feeling like all you have is your slingshot and not sure if you can actually take down Goliath.""Rise"" is no doubt one of if not the rock release of the year. It's unapologetic in it's message, yet any appreciator of rock music can find something to love about it. For fans of Seether, Three Days Grace, Red, Thousand Foot Krutch, Breaking Benjamin, and even bands like Paramore.***Definitely recommend the deluxe version, as one of my favorite songs ""Battle Cry"" is a bonus track. Other song standouts: the very different for Skillet ""My Religion"" which has touches of almost rockabilly and ""Salvation"" where John and Jen trade vocals with lush orchestration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QXFE54FXRU7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DANS6DW#wasThisHelpful","R3QXFE54FXRU7M","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this album a few months ago, because I had heard ""Trojans"" a few months previously to that, and had not been able to get it out of my head. While the samples of the album didn't immediately stand out to me, I figured that ""Trojans"" initially hadn't blown my mind either but that just like ""Trojans"" now is one of my current faves--the whole album might grow on me in the same way.The album languished in my library for several weeks though, until I had to stay late at work one night for several hours. I thought the album would provide nice background music. And then I found myself playing it again. And again. I think I played the entire album through over six times that night. And I just couldn't stop playing it. Ironically, just like the historical Trojans--this album first appeared as something far different than it actually is. There are virtually zero albums that I play through in their entirety without skipping tracks--and this is one of them. One of my favorite albums from the past 5 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A2VSNVJH3ID4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BBJL1V6#wasThisHelpful","R1A2VSNVJH3ID4","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few years ago, I went to see one of my favorite artists in concert, Janelle Monae. I quickly realized though, that almost the entire crowd was there not for her or Wale--but the opening act, J. Cole. Within minutes, Cole had the entire audience on their feet and rapping along with him. I didn't know his music at all, but found myself moving along with the crowd and smiling just because the vibe was so good. I had to wait two years though before I could go and buy his first album though. I wasn't that impressed to be honest. I thought that I had somehow mis-remembered how good Cole was.Two years later though, J. Cole is back with the album I think he had always been trying to make. He even says as much on the brilliant ""Let Nas Down."" It's clear the label and Jay-Z made him release a far different debut album than he had intended originally. This though--this is where you really see him.""Born Sinner"" is both reverential as well as super modern musically. Cole hasn't hopped on the bandwagon of rap trends like having a girl sing all of his choruses or making the beats all dance tracks, but he is also not stuck in the past. His beats are clean yet with subtle touches that really elevate them like a jazz saxophone. He both samples as well as references tracks from the beginning of rap in a very respectful way-- A Tribe Called Quest, Biggie, and Outkast all make appearances. Also, Cole very smartly pairs himself with some great collaborators like the Dirty Projectors' Amber Coffman, Miguel and a choir who all provide a contrast to his rather deadpan delivery.Lyrically Cole is a beast. He is introspective and thoughtful, sometimes bragging, sometimes telling stories. He's not afraid to really be vulnerable and honest in his questioning of some of his choices and his daily struggles. ""Runaway"" was especially poignant as he discusses racial issues and ties that back in with his own family history.Now we do have to mention the elephant in the room though: Kanye West. It's not being unfair to compare the two--Cole is in fact begging for it. He knew exactly what he was doing when he released this album the same day as West dropped his. He forced himself into the conversation. And personally, I think his gamble worked. While ironically, Cole actually sounds like early West on a couple tracks, these two albums could  not be more different. Where Kanye's is aggressive and arrogant to the extreme (the ""I am a god"" track hello), Cole is human and self-deprecating (see title track ""Born Sinner""). Kanye is off ""making art"" with minimal electronic beats, but Cole focused on making one of the best hip hop albums of the year. So yes, West might be more revolutionary and his hype machine is massive right now, but at the end of the day I'm going to be listening to Cole's album.Things that bother me: despite the fact that pretty much every rapper ever (including women) do this, the objectification of women on some songs does get annoying. The empowering message on ""Crooked Smile"" (featuring TLC) would mean a lot more if he could actually refer to women as neither a B***h nor a H*e.Hands down one of the best albums's of the year. I would recommend to every lover of rap out there. This album is personal and really pushes the boundaries of what old school rap artists might sound like if they were making music in 2013. It's not a throwback, but an evolution of rap music. It's modern rap in the very best way possible.***Update, Nas just dropped a remix to the already brilliant ""Let Nas Down."" Seriously, go look it up. It's so incredible to hear rappers who are more concerned about hip hop than silly made up beefs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI7HEHB2YNMVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8WJ9JK#wasThisHelpful","RI7HEHB2YNMVO","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Continuum is worth the hype. After discovering season one while it was still just a small Canadian show, I've been salivating for the second season. In the months since the first season ended though, Continuum has blown up in the US and while I am incredibly grateful for this--I was worried that it would somehow be affected or influenced in a negative manner given a bigger budget and larger audience.While the special effects used have been consistently top notch, the reason why this show works so well for me is not because it's scifi, but because of its emphasis on the characters. Personally, I think one of the greatest achievements of a scifi picture, is when it can let the viewer actually forget that is what they are watching. When the setting and characters are so authentic, that it's simply real. And I believe Continuum not only accomplished that in the first season, but that they are also nailing it in this season as well.Part of the larger budget has gone into better production quality, and it makes it visually an even more pleasure than watching the first. All the characters are back in a big way, and the storylines being set up are delicious. Enough cannot be said about Rachel Nichols acting. She is capable of both intense vulnerability as well as total and complete world domination. Very few actresses in Hollywood could even begin to attempt to pull Kiera off, but Nichols is simply captivating. The actor playing Kellog is also somewhat of a revelation. I know you're supposed to hope for Kiera to either make it back to her own time to be with her husband or end up with Carlos, but Kellog is just awesome. However, the relationship between Kiera and Alec is what really drives the show for me though, and season two succeeds in building off of the foundation in season one as well as greatly raising the stakes.Continuum is hands down one of the best tv shows currently on air. It has the plot, setting, characters, dialogue etc etc. Not to mention it also raises some very interesting ethical issues regarding big business versus governments with direct correlations to our current world (for anyone looking for some deeper content in their entertainment).  I honestly think most people would enjoy it as well. It transcends its genre by focusing on telling a freaking good story-----and who doesn't like an awesome story?***Just a heads up, for those of you who love Continuum and are looking for more in the same vein, I would check out this British spy thriller, Hunted (Mort). It's not sci-fi, but I found it had similar sensibilities, albeit a more serious tone--and personally loved it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVX0JRKP05XTG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DEYSWZO#wasThisHelpful","RVX0JRKP05XTG","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Philip Lawrence is one third of the massively successful production and songwriting group, The Smeezingtons, comprised of himself, Ari Levine and Bruno Mars. The Smeezingtons have been behind some of pop music's biggest hits from the past five years. They are the tour de force behind Mar's own ""Locked Out of Heaven"", ""The Lazy Song"", ""Grenade"", ""Just the Way You Are"" and many more. Not to mention have been behind several of Bruno's collaborations like B.o.B's ""Nothing on You"" and Bad Meets Evil's ""Lighters."" They've also done songs like ""F*** You"" by Cee Lo, ""Wavin' Flag"" by K'naan, and ""Rocketeer"" by Far East Movement. In short they are quite possibly one of the biggest forces in mainstream pop music that you've never heard of.This album though is completely different though than all of the songs mentioned above. This album is rock/folk/pop ooey gooey goodness. Philip has a fantastic voice that's equal parts smooth and raspy emotion. You can hear influences of Billy Joel and Seal, packaged in a fresh sounding acoustic guitar driven music. That's not to say that you can't hear music that wouldn't be out of place on a Bruno Mars album though, like ""Trying Times. However, Philip brings something wholly different to the table. He's a storyteller first and foremost. When he sings, you believe him.The music is far above average with great range. There's really nothing similar being played on the radio right now. It's not even close to the brand of folk music being popularized by bands like Mumford, nor contains even a shred of the dubstep/electronic/dance music that is so extremely popular right now. It's not a throwback either though it does some light jazz influences like on the excellent ""Heaven High."" It's not real rock either. All I can say is simply listen to some of the samples. It's more akin to 90s pop rock bands like the Goo Goo Dolls or even like Savage Garden--but fronted by someone like Seal. ""Finally Free"" and ""When You Come Back"" are exceptional.This album is something fresh and thoughtful. Give your ears a rest from the Skrillex/Bieber/Minaj/Cyrus stuff, and listen to an expert craftsman with a beautiful voice. You can hear the passion and love in his voice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VM6ZW5MAHB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D39U190#wasThisHelpful","R3VM6ZW5MAHB6","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was 13, my Mom took my sister and I on a trip to Boston to visit some relatives and just have fun walking around the city. We watched Shakespeare in the park and rode the Swan Boats, and then we wandered into a massive ocean of people near the Hatch Shell. A band I had never heard of was giving their last ""official"" concert. I was mesmerized. My super cool Mom let my sister and I stay until almost the end of the concert when it got a little too rowdy and violent for two young girls. Years later, my sister and I realized just what an honor it was to have attended that concert. It's been since dubbed the ""largest independent concert in history"" and was attended by well over 100,000 people. And Dispatch picked up a fan for life. The studio version as well as the live version of ""The General"" included on here is simply one of my all time favorite songs.This album is completely worth purchasing, much less picking up for free.

"I had the great pleasure of watching ZZ Ward in concert with Delta Rae a few months ago. I was expecting a great show--but ZZ blew my mind. She's positively electric in concert, and probably not quite what you were expecting either. Even more so than off her studio albums, you can see how she really embraces and revels in her own special combination of heavy dramatic folk music that's dripping with rock and topped off with a healthy dose of hip hop.Casual listeners who already own her album might not care to have the first three songs again as they aren't that radically different from the album versions. They're simply more rock and a little more bombastic. Which I happen to really enjoy and think most super fans will definitely want to pick up, but just a heads up.Son House's classic ""Grinnin' In Your Face"" though is on a whole different level. ZZ is simply brilliant at making music that has long been lost suddenly sound like the coolest, most hip thing in town. She's just singing over a guitar and harmonica for the majority of it, and yet it's far more sexy than that combination has any right to be. It's a little bit dangerous, a little wild, and sweetly ominous.Can not freaking wait for ZZ's next album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEU72BJOBEMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3VFGTS#wasThisHelpful","R2KEU72BJOBEMQ","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On Kickstarter a few months ago, I came across a campaign for a random band that I had never heard of--The Limousines. I listened to a few of their songs, and thought, ""hey--these guys are pretty good, why not..."" After having received the album a few weeks before it officially dropped and having listened to it several times, I'm still thinking ""hey---these guys are pretty good...""This album is not brilliant. It doesn't revolutionize electronic/dance/pop music in the slightest. However, it is really solid and enjoyable. ""Fools Gold"" and ""Gimme Control"" are two of the better songs from this genre that I've heard in a while. ""Fools Gold"" in particular has a killer sax solo that really bumps it to the next level. I actually think it's quite refreshing to not be listening to a screaming in your face beat that's trying to be a hit at a club, but listening to smoother more chill music with an edge which The Limousines do really well. It verges on being background music on a few songs, suitable to be hummed along to while working, but I've found myself randomly singing ""Haunted"" to myself a few times and then feel an overwhelming urge to listen to it at that very second no matter where I am and what I'm doing.Also, I should mention that having received all of the Kickstarter updates from these two guys from the past several months--that they both seem really passionate about music as well as very conscious what they are saying as a band in the public eye. Their original album artwork was essentially stolen by some people and used to express very negative messages about rape and racism--and The Limousines made the difficult decision to scrap all of their artwork (which was very cool I might add) because they didn't even want to be associated or seen as condoning those messages. Very admirable.In conclusion, this is just a fun album perfect for the summer. It's a cool relief from the current deluge of club-banger-esque tracks which all end the same. This album has real nuances and emotion not to mention different tempos and instruments than you might expect. Recommended for fans of bands like Capital Cities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5TSWJRTV4O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CVCLC3E#wasThisHelpful","R1R5TSWJRTV4O0","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the book I have been waiting for. After the first two books in this excellent series, I was convinced that Singh had managed to come up with a killer template for the rest of the series: passionate romance in the midst of intense political games and violent clashes between ideologies set in a unique and sprawling fantasy world. However, the majority of the rest of the books in the series haven't fully done all that for me though.Especially the recent ones just seem focused on the romance aspect between two lesser characters and haven't really seemed to push the overarching plot to the series. The thing about this series is though, I think the question of who the ghost is, and what's going to happen to the twin Net Minds, and whether a full on war is going to explode--are all more interesting than the romance of the week. Singh has simply created far too a wonderful world for these important matters to be pushed to the background. Therefore, I was hopeful that both we would soon get a book about Kaleb (as he is inexplicably one of my favorite characters even though it's been intimated many times that he's a sociopathic killer) as well as a book that would really push this series into a high gear regarding the series plots.This book changes everything.From the first page, you know big things are going to happen. Kaleb as a Councilor is simply too big a major player in the Psy world for his actions not to have massive consequences. We do find out who the ghost is, and without completely spoiling it for everyone, it's not wholly unexpected. In fact, it makes more sense than if she had picked another character-still it wasn't the big surprise that I was kind of hoping it would be. I think what made this book really different for me was that Kaleb, Nikita and Anthony finally band together beyond reactionary stuff. They make things happen as opposed to react together to things happening. On that note, the entire Psy world changes by the end of the book. The overarching plot is kicked into overdrive, and finally the big major changes that you hoped for actually happen.Also, the romance furthers and pushes the plot forward as opposed to halting it in the middle. However, there were times that that their interactions got a little repetitive (""she's broken"" etc.) It was otherwise well done though, with palpable tension between the two. I think it was very important for Kaleb to have someone that could kind of match up against him instead of being a pushover, and I think Singh managed that very well.I think something brilliant about Singh's writing that I don't see often mentioned in reviews, is that her world building isn't just exceptional for a fantasy series--it's also a powerful commentary on many of the social issues being debated in real life. Not to read too much into the series, but coming from the Deep South as well as a massive history nerd, perhaps I'm more aware of situations where sometimes one group of people tries to isolate themselves or weed out the ""unpure"" ones, or those who just don't belong. I think this series is remarkable in being able to avoid the preachy aspects of a ""we are all equal"" agenda, but is still able to show through an engaging plot that a world full of diverse groups of people living harmoniously is to the benefit of all.In conclusion, I don't want want to turn this review into an essay, but I do want to make it clear that this book is one of the best not only within the series, but within the genre. While many series that get up to the 8-12 books range, tend to peter out idea wise towards the end--this book is the opposite of that. Singh simply nails it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27RIRILZPP12C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1N9JWO#wasThisHelpful","R27RIRILZPP12C","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beth and Joe are simply magic. Covers are generally pretty hit and miss for me. It's hard to respect the original yet make the cover different and interesting enough to warrant a cover in the first place. But Joe and Beth somehow managed to make some of these classics sound even more alive and rocking than, dare I say it, the originals.Now the music is where we get into muddy water though. Personally, I'm astounded that Beth and Joe were able to make some songs sound like they could both be simultaneously be playing on the radio now, as well as could have been played on the radio in the 70s and 80s. It's a real testament to their musical sensibilities as well as clearly shows the influence of producer Kevin Shirley (Led Zeppelin, Journey, Iron Maiden). It's big band, r&b, rock, blues, and soul. And therein will lie the problem for many people. Despite Joe and Beth both being incredible blues artists--this is not a blues album. If you were expecting a pure blues sound in every song--then walk away. However, if you can check expectations at the door, then prepare to be blown away.""Nutbush City Limits"" is the first big standout for me. Beth certainly does Tina proud. It's aggressive and seething with intensity.  Buddy Miles' ""Miss Lady"" is another showstopper. Beth's vocals are honestly mind-blowing. She can go from the smooth jazzy groove to hit a perfect Janis Joplin wail. What's more striking than her sheer vocal skills though, is her ability to connect to the material. When her voice breaks, she can make your heart break. Comparisons to Etta James or Billie Holiday are completely justified. And her Nina Simone inspired take on the classic ""Strange Fruit"" is spell binding.Now, Joe does have his moments as well; his guitar work on ""Can't Let Go"" made holding my body still while listening physically impossible. However, every song does not ""feature"" Joe. At times, especially in the songs with big horn sections, he's essentially background. I think it's important to recognize though, that even when Joe's guitar isn't out front--he--and not Beth, is the driving force behind the direction of the music. While Beth is a great songwriter in her own right, it's clear Joe is in the driver's seat musically for this album. While talking about the music again, it's important to mention that the backing band are quite simply in a league of their own.Another reviewer mentioned that this album ""got him and his wife in the mood."" While I don't want to make things awkward, he's not far off the mark. This album simply electrifies your body. It's smoky and passionate yet aggressive with a killer groove. If you're prepared to appreciate it for what it is, this album is quite simply one of the best of the year. Highly recommend to literally everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TWTNT1L65AW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CE004XM#wasThisHelpful","R35TWTNT1L65AW","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"French folk/jazz singer extraordinaire, Zaz simply hits it out of the park on her second studio album. I've followed Zaz for years, and must admit that I was scared that I might have over-hyped this album to myself. It's rare that a singer can maturely evolve their sound without losing their special essence. To my utter delight, there isn't a sophomore slump in sight on this album. This album samples a broader range of music genres than Zaz's self-titled debut, yet Zaz's soulful and emotive singing is front and center at all times.Musically wise, the first thing that struck me--was that this album was much more guitar driven as opposed to piano driven. I must admit that I miss the driving piano and think in general that you can hear much more emotion in a piano than from a guitar, but the fact of the matter is--these new more guitar focused songs are just flat out awesome. ""La lessive"" is subtle and controlled, yet keeps popping back into my head. I think I miss the more piano like songs, as they remind me a bit more of Edith Piaf, but this is a fresher sound for Zaz. While she can nail the sultry powerful cabaret siren, the wandering street minstrel seems to be a bit truer to who Zaz is as a person, and I think it shows in her music as well.""Si je perds"" however is a haunting piano piece that just flows from the soul. Zaz is practically speaking, her tone is so light and soft yet the sorrow in her voice just cuts through. ""Si"" is another standout for me in a similar manner as ""Si je perds"" yet is a bit more forceful and gritty. Now, while Zaz's slower songs tend to be my favorites, I don't want to give the erroneous impression that this album is full of sad slow songs. Quite the contrary, about half of them are much more upbeat and incorporate a wide range of musical instruments like the cello, accordion and even some that I can't quite identify. ""Nous debout"" is an immediate standout that will definitely make you want to tap your toes and probably attempt to sing along as well.I do want to add that I don't speak or understand any French at all. Occasionally I hear a word that I may or may not recognize, but I certainly don't have any comprehension of what the songs are about unless I've previously looked the lyrics up. I write this to emphasize that Zaz simply makes music that transcends language. I would highly encourage anyone who enjoys Edith Piaf, Constance Amiot or even someone like Colbie Caillat to check out Zaz. Understanding of French not required to enjoy the beautiful and memorable experience that Zaz creates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SXT521NWRWM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMKPNBC#wasThisHelpful","R1SXT521NWRWM8","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eve is back after an 11 year hiatus, and it's obvious that she's back and hungry to reclaim her position as one of the foremost female mcs of this generation. While she does experiment at times with different genres (the very pop ""Make It Out This Town"" being the most obvious), Eve never loses sight of the end goal and manages to spit some of her hardest and most intricate raps that she's ever let loose. I was scared that she might just be desperate for a new hit and sacrifice her unique sound for derivative pop like so many others, but this album is catchy, aggressive, and un-apologetically showcases Eve's signature rapid fire rapping style to a T.I for one especially love that Eve doesn't have someone sing the hook and chorus on all of her songs. It's there on a few of them, but by in large Eve is content to succeed or fail based on her own merit and skill at rapping. And even when Eve experimented with incorporating new sounds (slight Middle Eastern tones, dance, pop etc.) she doesn't so much as fully embrace these new tones as much as prove that she can literally rap over anything.Now lyrically, Eve doesn't venture far from three different messages: the ""Bow down to the boss,"" the ""I'm super sexy,"" and the occasionally inspirational ""Don't give up."" I must admit, it would have definitely improved this album if Eve really had pushed herself a bit more and been a bit more vulnerable. Strangely, having less than deep lyrics isn't really bothering me though. It's quite simply such a pleasure to hear Eve slaying the mic that when she goes off on how she's a just the most amazing woman ever, a part of me just is like silently agreeing. However, this pushed what could have been a phenomenal album into more lukewarm territory for me.All in all though, if you like rap, being a boss, dancing, or wish you could replay a little bit of your childhood (90s babies), this is the album for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8HO26G8J8J1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFN3MM8#wasThisHelpful","R8HO26G8J8J1I","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Describing why I like the ""The Black Balloon"" is hard. It's not the usual type of movie I'm drawn to. It doesn't have big explosions or lots of quirky comedy. I also don't particularly relate to anyone in the cast either--I've never been to Australia nor am a teenage boy or have someone with special needs that I'm close to. The plot doesn't have some big plot twist at the end or really any plot at all other than just a few days in the life of a family. And yet, this movie effects me in a way that just cuts me down.Basic plot: Thomas is a teenage boy with a brother with special needs, Charlie. The two brothers and two parents (Toni Collette is amazing as the mother) live in what reminds me of military like housing, somewhere in Australia, and probably sometime in the 80s. The setting and time is both unique as well as timeless. It neither feels old nor new really--just present. Charlie is both lovable at times, as well as is truly heartbreaking. The movie does not shy away from showing the tremendous stress, exhaustion and even anger that can be part of trying to love and live with someone with tremendous needs. Thomas is just trying to grow up. To put this movie in a box, it could be easily classified as just another ""coming of age film."" And yet, it's so much more.When I see this movie, I see fundamentally good people all trying to do ""the right thing."" But sometimes, life and our emotions just get in the way. Navigating the tricky landscape of trying to be your own person, yet with family responsibilities both thrust upon you as well as welcomed. Thomas loves his brother Charlie, and yet is constantly feeling like he's being ignored by his parents and comes to resent always having to look after Charlie. And even when Thomas finds a girl who not only puts up with Charlie always being around--but who also really cares for Charlie as well, everything comes crashing down anyway. Not because so much of what Charlie did, or even how Jackie initially reacted--but how Thomas reacted to the ""big confrontation.""I admit that this movie may have been too depressing for me as a whole if it hadn't had ended on a rather light note, but I also know that I wouldn't feel remotely the same about this movie if it was all just awkward situations and the usual difficulties that come with puberty. I guess that's really the point though--this movie feels a whole lot more like real life than most Hollywood fare. It's messy and complicated and difficult. And yet, there is still a beacon of light and hope that shines throughout it all. And to be cheesy yet honest, it give me hope as well. And I guess that's why it effects me so much.This movie certainly isn't for everyone, but if you grow tired of watching car chases and soap operas maybe try a movie that might just help you see the world a little bit clearer and with a little bit more joy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BLX05SPCWGEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U8VU7K#wasThisHelpful","R1BLX05SPCWGEK","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This song is incredibly catchy, but once past the initial sugar rush--also has the depth to pack a punch. I've known girls who get into relationships like the one described in the song. We all have. And it's something not talked about that often either. Probably because most girls who get out of these relationships don't like to admit to the world how they were kind of lost in a bad relationship to the point where they changed themselves, and well--the girls who never get out don't have the guts to say it either. Bottom line, the lyrics are refreshing and the music is killer.

"Recently, several pop singers from across the pond have been making it in the US. Charli fits right in with Ellie Goulding, Marina & Diamonds, Cher Lloyd, and Jessie J. In fact, often she sounds like a hybrid mix of all of them. Her voice isn't quite as melodic as Ellie, as quirky as Marina, as accessible as Cher, or as technically excellent as Jessie---but still Charli stands out.The first song I heard by Charli, ""You (Ha Ha Ha),"" expertly samples one of my favorite songs, ""You"" by Gold Panda. This is what initially piqued my interest. But then I realized Charli has this twisted little edge that makes her much more mysterious than any of the above artists and adds a layer of needed complexity to solid/enjoyable but not astounding dance/pop music. It's hard to describe--it's not her lyrics as much as the choices she makes when she sings. At times I imagine an evil clown is singing, at times I see a femme fatale, at times I hear the barely legal and still vulnerable but fun Charli come out, but at the end of the day Charli simply owns each song. She just posses such confidence that she's unafraid to play around with both her voice as well as music styles. And she also has a natural swagger that enables her to pull off even some of the stranger choices on the album.As for music styles on this album--everything is in the range of pop/dance music, but is actually quite fresh sounding even in a music market full of people who are attempting similar things. It's more subtle and hypnotic than most mainstream music--yet much more hard-hitting and catchy than a lot of indie pop/synth groups. Also, you might not realize this, but Charli both wrote as well as was featured on the recent Icona Pop hit, ""I Love It.""At the end of the day, this is simply a great pop record that offers something different and there is no doubt that Charli is one to be watched. I would highly recommend it to anyone who are fans of the singers previously mentioned or even artists like Santogold. Normally I scoff at people who try to predict the next big thing, but I can't help but hear Charli and think---this is the future. She's got the skills, confidence and most importantly the determination to stand out.**Since buying this album, ""What I Like"" has been on constant repeat in my car, at my desk at work, in my head. It's got a 90s chill groove dressed up with a 00s auto-tuned chorus that is unbelievably catchy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32VZQ95G72KG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4U9U4Q#wasThisHelpful","R32VZQ95G72KG3","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While doing my monthly trolling of Amazon's discounted albums, I came across this one. From the song previews, I was intrigued enough to spend $3 to see what Lacey was all about. Lacey is talented, no doubt. Her voice/tone is like a strange combination of Rihanna and Justin Beiber. Given that description, it's surprisingly pleasant and capable. The problem here is the material.Lacey doesn't fall into the annoying mistake of having all of her songs sound the same. Instead she incorporated several different genres, at times you can hear Caribbean inspired beats right next to British drum and bass (Lacey is British), some mainstream pop, and even touches of old school 90s r&b. I appreciate all of these things. And it almost all works. But these songs simply read more as B-sides to an album of really good songs, as opposed to the actual album material. They're enjoyable, but fade out of memory pretty quickly.Lacey is talented enough that I went on youtube to see if her music might translate better live, and I think it does. She has a commanding presence and energy that I feel hasn't really been captured on this album. I also saw a couple of videos doing some sic acappella versions of several of these songs, and was amazed. With stripped back production and a more raw edge, Lacey simply shines. So good news for her, she definitely has something good going on--bad news is that this album isn't quite what's good. Maybe buy a couple of singles if the previews do it for you. My favorite songs are ""Stop Start"" and ""Greatness.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHS3YA2LXRMOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARGYUKS#wasThisHelpful","RHS3YA2LXRMOP","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went to see this movie in theaters solely because it was directed by the Wachowskis. I love the Matrix, and trusted them to have made a fun action movie. I left the theater still almost in tears knowing I had just seen one of the most profound and brilliant movies to have been made in the last decade.Critics say that it's confusing. This is true for about the first 40 minutes. The stories aren't told sequentially in chunks, but are spliced into each others. That plus the fact that several of the actors play multiple parts--is a perfect recipe for confusion. However, if you've been trying to pay attention and have any amount of reasonable intelligence, the characters and separate story lines soon become clear and distinct. And in a way, they all end up being the same.This is the brilliance of Cloud Atlas. These stories are radically different--different times, planets, people, plots, and yet they tell the same story. I know the writer's original intention was basically a ""we are all connected, and our actions affect others,"" but this wasn't what I really felt. I saw all of the stories as moments of redemption.***Spoiler*** I normally can't stand movies that kill off main characters or have generally depressing endings, and yet this movie needed the moments of sadness to help further the story. And I actually didn't leave sad. If the movie had focused solely on say the couple where one of them commits suicide, I would have felt gypped and would not be raving about this movie at all. And yet, each story while interesting, emotional and sometimes hilarious--is just a part of the whole story. And the whole story taken together just hits you in the gut. It made me laugh, made me cry and made me think.I dislike both Halle Berry and Tom Hanks as actors, and it didn't matter in the slightest. They played their parts to perfection (especially Hanks). The settings and costumes from each time period are also on point. And I was right in that the Wachowskis also delivered a cinematically stunning movie as well. However, unlike the Matrix--where you can get caught up in the action just because it looks so cool, the action and general stylism used here is not just here for the sake of being cool. The stories wouldn't have worked if you were constantly being drawn out of them or distracted. Here, the stylism actually propels the story. It's necessary to keep the stories just slightly outside of the realm of reality. In becoming fantastical looking, the viewer can then simply focus on the story which in turn actually makes the stories more real.There is not a doubt in my mind that all three directors are simply genius. I think it's ridiculous that this movie got such bad press, honestly--I can't help but think that those who didn't enjoy it simply weren't smart enough or more likely didn't bother to engage themselves with the material. This isn't Transformers or even James Bond. Thinking is required to enjoy. But instead of this being tedious, this movie can affect a person in a way that a movie like Red Dawn (just a recent example) never can. This movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2013. It is more than the sum of its parts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAV12MNHZTVAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT0ZDF2#wasThisHelpful","RAV12MNHZTVAB","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Personally I hate it when people make grand sweeping statements. Rarely do I agree. However, in this case--I can say with certainty that of all of the movies I saw in 2012 (which was quite a lot), this was hands down the funniest. Every single character is perfection and the casting is brilliant yet mostly anti-type for most of the actors. Hugh Jackman is a blundering idiot. Jennifer Garner has a complex. Olivia Wilde is a money hungry stripper. Ty Burrell is hysterical, but actually his character is probably the most like the  ones he usually plays. The dialogue is usually just witty and subtle, yet I actually laughed out loud several times for some punch lines (getting me to laugh audibly while watching a movie usually never happens). I literally watched the entire movie with a happy smile on my face.Also, without getting into it--this movie has a real heart and warmth to it, aside from the comedy. The little girl with her adoptive parents is simply a beautiful story. And yet, it's not super melodramatic or even cheesy really. With so many over the top performances (Garner & Jackman especially), somehow the very real human sentiments come through and hit home. Garner is ridiculous, and yet isn't one dimensional. We actually feel kind of sorry and empathize a little bit with her at the end even though she's sort of awful.I've read a couple of reviews though that think this movie is mocking ""Middle America"" or even familial units. I don't see that at all. I'm from the deep south, and while we don't have butter competitions--we do have some other crazy things that people here take just as seriously. And that's not a bad thing. In my opinion, the movie might play the butter competition for laughs--and yet isn't saying that it's a stupid or evil thing either. It's possible to really enjoy these zany things, take them seriously--and yet find the humor in them as well. As far the family aspect, I think the movie tries and succeeds in contrasting a less than ideal family (Garners) with the adoptive parents family that really showcase the beauty of family.This is not a movie for everyone though. For instance, the ""Harriet Tubman"" line is only funny if you actually know who she is. There are several references like that in the movie. Not necessarily specific people, but (without sounding ridiculously pretentious)things and concepts that are generally a little more high-brow than a lot of whats out there in comedy land. This isn't slapstick comedy where people just fall down a lot and fart loudly or get super stoned and jump in pools. Basically, I think this movie is either going to really hit your funny bone--or you will think it's super boring. There's not a lot of in between. All I can suggest is that you give it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28IY395BQMBXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00978SIJ6#wasThisHelpful","R28IY395BQMBXN","ANGNKTK2J7JFF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANGNKTK2J7JFF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:53 MinsThis is my 4th pair of premium headphones. I currently own the following: a Turtle Beach i30, a Bang and Olufsen BeoPlay H8, and a V-Moda Crossfade. We're also pretty familiar with Phillips since we love their LED light bulbs as well as their really awesome Philips HF3500/60 Wake-Up Light[Good]Wired sound is great.

It's a solid performer here.It feels comfortable.[Ok]The look is alright. I feel that the designer was trying to make it look like you're wearing speaker grills. I didn't really appreciate it very much but the use of black as a color is a saving grace that kind of hides it and the general overall shape is good. On another note, it has a general shape that's very similar to the BeoPlay H8. Not sure if this is pure coincidence or flattery.[Bad]Bluetooth pairing doesn't seem to work: I'm a techie so I'm not a stranger to bluetooth pairing, especially since this is my 4th pair of premium bluetooth headphones. I've read the instructions and I can see a blue flashing light on the headphones, but they never show up on the following devices: Apple 6S Plus, iPad Air 2, Motorola MotoX, HP Pavilion HPE Windows 10 PC, Apple MacPro. I may be able to understand not being able to pair with Apple devices due to a iOS issue, but not being able to pair with either an Android device or a Windows 10 PC is just strange. Apple has also supported Bluetooth 4.x ever since the iPhone 4S so I'm not sure what the problem is. Was this even tested? I will try to contact Phillips support to see if this can be fixed, but this is really bad.I didn't like the use of fabric on the inner portion of the head phones. The way it's positioned (either refer to the pictures or my video), it'll make it prone to both dust and ear wax (even if you clean your ears daily and have dry ear wax). This will get nasty looking within a few months since it's not super easy to clean without tearing it. I'm guessing this is related to acoustics so cleanliness may be a worthy sacrifice... but I don't have this issue with my other headphones.It doesn't turn off bluetooth when you plug in a headphone jack. This is a common problem with cheaper bluetooth headphones that can wire up. I didn't expect this for something in this price range.It is not cheap. When a product isn't cheap and there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, you're going to get punished more for mishaps.While the packaging isn't horrible, the packaging cheapens the device i.e. it's not awesome or great, even the wires came out all tangled out of the box. While this may not be a problem for people purchasing these headphones for themselves, for people giving these as gifts it may be a big problem since the packaging doesn't seem to match the price of the headphones. It makes headphones that cost almost three hundred look like they only cost about one hundred. In a post-Apple era, this is a big no no. There's really no excuse for this. Phillips is not a small company nor is it a new one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDGPHEP1FE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0163ZHROM#wasThisHelpful","R3NDGPHEP1FE9","ABSYIF0ONC2AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABSYIF0ONC2AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have one from Turtle Beach and another from Bang & Olufsen, the BeoPlay H8.[Good]Awesome wired sound: it competes well with the BeoPlay H8 minus the extra hundred-ish dollars.Good wireless sound: It's much better than my TurtleBeach bluetooth headphones as well as cheaper Sony's wireless headphones.Looks pretty good: it looks fine pre-modded, though BeoPlay H8 looks better when the V-Moda has the 'stock' look.Very customizable look via faceplate on each side: There's a decent selection at V-MODA's website. They have a range of designs and a variety of different materials like carbon fiber, stainless steel, and even real gold and platinum. You can upload your custom design to V-MODA, but they have limitations in terms of size and dimensions. If you want your own crazy design (e.g. cherubs flying next to your ears, elven ears, etc...) you probably want to print your faceplates. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a base template out there already that you can use to build on.Really nice case: It beats a normal loose headphone bag.Good value: you get a lot for your money with V-Moda. Not sure if it's because of the lack of general brand awareness (i.e. very little marketing dollars spent) but whatever it is, their stuff exceeds expectations. We only know of vmoda because of an Amazon Lightning Sale for the LP model. If it weren't for that, we'd know nothing of Vmoda.It can pair to two different devices (phone, computer).Decent battery life: this lasts the entire office day for me (8-9 hours - I do charge it during lunch)[Bad]Wireless Sound doesn't match wired sound: It just doesn't sound as good wireless compared to when it's plugged in. Like the BeoPlay H8, it's subtle but noticeable with the most obvious problem being a lack of bass. I have a feeling that this has to do more with the bluetooth specifications than anything else since both headphones sound really great plugged in. Even if the latest version of the bluetooth spec supported better sound, there's no guarantee that all the devices this pairs with will support the latest standard so this will always be an annoying problem.There are exposed wires leading to each headphone. Didn't notice them at first until I first started to accidentally snag them here and there. I'm worried that I will eventually accidentally rip one of them out. I'll probably mod this with some Sugru SBLK3 SUGRU 3 pack Black to prevent a future headache.

"So far we've had the 'pleasure' of going through one Recaro Pro car seat and two Britax Advocates (one Click Tight and one non-Click Tight) so we can make a good comparison.[Good]Comfort: The Maxi Cosi is the best one we've had for comfort. While the Britax's were pretty highly rated by Consumer Reports for safe if you don't include their forced recall issues with the click tight mechanisms, both are very uncomfortable for our child. They only have two positions for the crotch portion of the seat belt (making it really tight in that area) while the Maxi has three. The Recaro seems to have limited tilting and it doesn't seem to be well designed for rear facing positions.Safety: you can't rely on Amazon reviews for safety. You need to consult something like Consumer Reports. This car seat rates well.Looks: It doesn't look as awesome as a Recaro racing style car seat but almost anything looks better than a Britax though Britax has improved the look with the Click Tight product line.[Ok]The price isn't cheap but it's very reasonable compared to the other models that we've bought.[Bad]N/A but will update in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5O994G8TD28/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OU9CKTG#wasThisHelpful","R3T5O994G8TD28","ABSYIF0ONC2AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABSYIF0ONC2AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a cheaper version of Vtech's Smart Friends toys that tries to be more like Bratz or Barbie.[Good]They are more interactive then either Bratz or Barbie since they talk and what they say will be different based on what Smart Point piece they are in contact with.It's more educational than either Bratz or Barbie.Batteries are included.Compared to Smart Friends, these dolls look better. They aren't pudgie and rotund which may be why they need LR44 batteries.[Ok]The main feature difference between this and Smart Friends is the greater emphasis on fashion. These dolls have changeable hair and various fashion accessories and clothes. We're not fans of that but others may be.[Bad]Compared to Smart Friends, Flipsies sets since too be more limited.Flipsies are definitely not unisex compared to Smart Friends.Not a fan of using weird batteries like LR44. We like being able to find rechargeable batteries from major brands like Eneloop for both cost and limiting hazardous waste to the environment. Using weird batteries like LR44 doesn't help and is a bit annoying.

"Note: Since Amazon isn't selling this directly, 3rd party Amazon sellers are overcharging for it. At Toysrus and other major retailers, it sells at nighty nine dollars at the time of this writing.[Good]It draws your child away from a screen whether it's the TV, smartphone, or tablet; and it doesn't need a smart device to interact with it. It uses either physical cards (which is recognizes through its nose camera), what you say (you may need to connect the bear to the Internet for this to work), or physical interaction (throwing the bear in the air - it has an accelerometer, or hugging it) as input.It has a lot of activities ranging from trivia (riddles), story telling, music, and drawing. Most if not all of these activities are educational. It's best to play with your child for these activities, though you can leave your kid alone with this toy as well.It can help you with sleep time, brushing teeth, and chores. Though you can use cards to do this, it's better and sneakier to use the iOS or Android app to do it.It can potentially have more activities through firmware updates in the future if you connect it to the internet.You can customize it, by giving it a name as well as your child's name.It has a great voice and... you can change the volume which is great.It has great minimalist look - very modern.'UI' helps with hand eye coordination for younger kids. My toddler now knows how to align a card with an image-recognition camera (the bear's nose)It doesn't overly rely on an internet connection aka 'The Cloud'. It'll still work without an Internet connection.[Ok]Setup is not as easy as it should be. On the first try, it failed to connect to my WiFi and it doesn't feel as intuitive as other products (even though it's simple) e.g. Why would you ask for the name of someone's WiFi router only to show a list of detected WiFi routers later? Why would you ask for the password first before you let someone choose the WiFi router? The list goes on. We feel that the initial setup is flawed and there's really no excuse for this. This isn't the first Internet connected device that uses iOS or Android for a client. Yes this isn't a catastrophe but it's not good either and also I would imagine that non-techies would get even more frustrated.Not sure if this is an upcoming feature, but it still doesn't really know its own name and it still doesn't call my kid by name either even though we entered both.[Bad]It doesn't remember my kid. We turn it on, it doesn't remember that it's already been introduced to my kid several times. This toy keeps thinking that it just got unwrapped. We don't know if this is a bug, a feature that hasn't been release yet, or just plain missing but it's really annoying and it destroys the fantasy that this toy is more than a toy (which may be a good thing for children).While it does ask questions and it's able to understand what's said, it's not impressive. Why? Because a non-internet connected Hallmark stuff animal can recognize phrases as well. The difference is that the less tech heavy Hallmark toys have more responses. I know that Smart Toy isn't Siri, Cortana, or Google but at the moment its internet connectivity feature feels more like a gimmick. Fortunately I have a feeling that this will change one day unless Fisher Price gets scared and stops pushing innovation.It isn't cheap.You need to charge this for 5 hours to get 3 hours of play time. For the 1st session, I'm pretty sure we only got an hour of playtime instead of 3 before it said that it needed charging (this is after we charged it for about eight hours).Not as as soft as it looks: The main body houses the electronics as well as a big button (used to detect hugs) so it's rock hard. The head isn't completely soft either. The nose portion with the camera is anything but soft. My kid's forehead found this out the hard way and he starting crying.It loses connection to WiFi at times even though it's almost right next to the router.Depending on your family, losing cards may be an issue. Apparently it is an issue for my family. If we weren't vigilant about my kid throwing cards left and right for fun, we would have lost the majority of them already.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5SEW82ZQHDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UIQB9W#wasThisHelpful","R1K5SEW82ZQHDC","ABSYIF0ONC2AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABSYIF0ONC2AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To start while we like physical LeapFrog robot toys (talking ovens, stuffed animals, etc...), we are not fans of LeapFrog platforms like their past tablets and even their video game console (which had a lot of problems).[Good]The main benefit for families who already have a tablet like an iPad or some Android variant: You no longer have to watch your children like a hawk whenever they use a tablet so there's no danger of them getting inappropriate content or (more likely) messing up your main tablet (settings, making calls, etc...).The main UI is amazing. I've seen nothing like it and the team who created it is genius. Instead of a vanilla Apple, Google, or even Amazon grid of icons interface, the LeapFrog's UI is a small little town that your kids can customize. Amazon should definitely learn from it. This is our favorite feature.LeapFrog apps tend to be awesome for education.This is nice, safe walled garden for your kids where parents have full control.LeapFrog also has a media section of curated content.Built for families:- Each child in your family can have their own customizations (different cities, different permissions for apps, and so on)- You can use this for allowances and rewards- Lots various parental controls which are pretty impressiveLeapFrog finally gives families more choice:- Official Amazon App Store access will be available via update. This should solve the major problem of a lack of content that is a problem for past LeapFrog devices since now we can use Netflix and Prime Video for kids- You can download a web browser if you don't want to be limited to the small LeapFrog approved media content. Again this helps solve LeapFrog's lack of content since now everyone can access Youtube.It has a nice rubber case like Amazon's kid version of Kindle Fire.It has a camera for taking picturesIt has a tethered stylus for educational writing software.It has a decent price.[Ok]The hardware is better than LeapFrog's past releases, meaning you won't have annoying freezes where you have to restart everything. This may also be due to LeapFrog not completely reinventing the wheel this time i.e. this is Android based. This said, the hardware is not amazing; it's just enough to get things done. This is a minor gripe for the present (but one that grows as time passes). Amazon's Kid version of Kindle probably has better specs.Some LeapFrog games weren't as much fun as they were educational. This is inevitable when it comes to educational games, so this is a minor gripe.[Bad]A physical home button or one that's always visible onscreen would have been nice. As of right now, there's no one consistent way to reach the main menu from every app. For example, for books you have to reach the very end of the book in order to reach the main menu which is just dumb. For other apps you have to swipe up before it appears on the bottom. This doesn't make any sense and there's no excuse for it. This tablet should have a dedicated home button (and maybe even a dedicated back button). We're not fans of Kindle's home button implementation either. Just add five or ten bucks to the cost and put a physical home button please. Ideally both a physical home button and a physical back button as well.The micro SD slot is either flawed or just defective on my unit. Once you stick one in, it's not coming out.Half the apps are a little pricier than similar apps that you find on either the iOS or various Android app stores (around ten bucks). The quality makes up for it. Some apps are really expensive (around twenty bucks).[Misc]We weren't able to test durability which may be an issue in some households who have children that are rougher with their things.[Verdict]This is a winner that makes a great gift for those you love.It's good to see LeapFrog learn from past releases. Until now, I never understood why LeapFrog was so adamant at pushing its own software / hardware platform when it didn't seem to have the right resources to execute it properly. I'm happy to have been finally proven wrong.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCN3YFHOBU3K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NMTJA6#wasThisHelpful","R3CCN3YFHOBU3K","ABSYIF0ONC2AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABSYIF0ONC2AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It has a simple brain wave reader that talks to your iPad through bluetooth which allows you to do things like raising an X-wing like in Empire Strikes Back.[Ok]There's some assembly involved but it's not horrible.[Bad]You NEED an iPad or another tablet with the same screen size as an iPad for this to work properly. Even though they have a notice that you need a tablet on Amazon's page, a lot of people will still miss it since it's in gray. The tablet requirement notice needs to be in bright colors in stated multiple times through out the page unless they want a lot of angry returns with negative reviews.

"[Good]This is a lot less complicated to transform compared to the original robot toys that I remember. More on this later.It's meant to be used in conjunction with a free downloadable video game. Using this robot, it unlocks Bumble Bee as a playable character. The Transformers video game is a hack and slash similar to games like Diablo and Skylanders.It talks and its eyes light up. We could do without it.[Ok]It's huge. Initially your kid will be more excited due to the size. However that will fade when you look at the toy's detail. This also isn't great for people who live in smaller spaces like condos and apartments.[Bad]In case you forget to zoom into the included pictures, the quality is just really bad. There are just no details compared to my old Transformer toys and the build quality is poor. It reminds me of the Transformers toys released in Asia but not in the US due to quality issues.Given the quality, the price makes little to no sense. I'm guessing the price of the toy is meant to offset the costs of the 'free' video game. Hence the crazy price. As others have mentioned it should be twenty five or less like 10-15.[Verdict]With the existence of both Disney's Infinity Box, Nintendo's Amibo, and Skylanders, I just don't understand why they made this robot gigantic at the expense of detail and quality. If you want people to buy a lot of these robots, does it make sense to make them all ginormous and expensive? There's really no excuse since this wasn't an original idea.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PG85DUO3Z9A6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOFZFBM#wasThisHelpful","R1PG85DUO3Z9A6","ABSYIF0ONC2AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABSYIF0ONC2AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my 3rd Black and Decker PureOptics lamp. I also own similar lamps from both taotronics and 3M.[Good]It's an LED lamp so it uses very little power (4 watts)It's great if you want more ambient lighting at night either at your nightstand or your desk. The lighting is better than competing lamps in terms of brightness.Faster to use: since there are less lighting levels you can turn it on and off with one touch each compared to competing products where it takes several touches to turn a lamp on and offIt looks great; minimalist design that blends in with the room.It has a builtin USB port for charging. This is probably one of the key features that differentiates it from the competition. It's annoying to have to make a point of adding a surge protector and USB plug near every bed.Has integrated smartphone dock. This is another cool feature.Adjustable arm[Bad]It's way pricier than the Taotronics lamps. My guess is because of licensing the Black and Decker brand name. Black and Decker doesn't actually make these lamps. I'm not sure the brand name is worth the huge markup when Black and Decker seems to have nothing to do with actually designing and manufacturing the product.Like other similar lamps, you can't change the LED bulb unless you like playing with solders.There's less variations in lighting levels. Other competing models have four more levels of lighting.There's less features than competing lamps like an auto-off timer aka sleep[Misc]The only thing that can't be verified yet is how long the bulb lasts compared to cheaper models.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZKNYB098NQKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW793M#wasThisHelpful","R2ZKNYB098NQKP","ABSYIF0ONC2AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABSYIF0ONC2AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We already own multiple Smart Wheels and Smart Friends play sets, so we're very familiar with VTech's Smart line of toys[Good]It's somewhat educational. More on this in the 'Bad' sectionIt helps promote creativity since it allows children to build their own farm.Each Smart Animal interacts with specific points in the play set.The growing carrot garden was clever.[Ok]It interconnects with both Smart Wheels and Smart Friends sets, though I'm not sure why anyone would do this.[Bad]The design is confusing for children:1.  My niece keeps referring to the included animal as a 'Chicken Car'. I don't correct her because that's what it is. It has wheels and she's seen cars at parades. Judging from the other Smart Animal play sets, it seems like someone just transitioned a Smart Wheels design into animals. I'm really glad that Vtech didn't take this approach with Smart Friends. Hopefully Vtech just ends the Smart Animals product line and just continues to expands Smart Friends instead.2. The chicken isn't made well in proportion to the other Smart figures. It's as big as a Smart Friend. This could have been fixed if instead of a rooster they made the piece as a smaller chicken surrounded by her chicks or as a group of chickens.3. Barns have ramps? Animals on farms have tree swings that they use?4. The chicken sounds like a normal person when talking. It shouldn't have been too hard to change the actor's voice to make him sound more like a chicken, or better yet not have him talk at all and just use chicken sounds.[Verdict]A Smart Friends farm would totally make a lot more sense than this.

"We already own multiple Smart Wheels sets as well as another Smart Friends set.[Good]This is very educational. It teaches children how adults interact with everyday things.This is currently the largest Smart Friends set.Each play set has smart locations that a Smart Friend interacts with. In most cases they just say specific phrases based on where they are docked. In some instances there are special locations that are mechanical, like automated elevators that go up and down on their own.Each Smart Friend can talk on their own if you press their middle button. Think of them as mini-robots.Multiple Smart Friends pieces can talk to each other.It helps with creative construction if you buy more than one Smart Friends set. Like Smart Wheels, Smart Friends is modular; meaning you can combine them in multiple ways like Legos. Right now the focus is on roads, since Smart Friends can also have their own cars. Hopefully in the future the structures themselves will be more modular i.e. you'll be able to combine different rooms into a frankenstein structure.Even though Smart Friends are technically doll houses, they are still unisex.[Ok]It only comes with one Smart Friend. To really experience it fully, you need at least two Smart Friends which you can either buy as a separate piece or as part of another complete set.[Bad]After a lot of training and the passage of time, my child no longer chews and sucks on things that aren't food or drink. However not all children are at this point yet and this toy is rated for 1 year olds. Why am I mentioning this? There may be an issue with Smart Friends pieces and contact with liquids.

If you do this,  your baby will take longer to get acclimated to sleeping in a crib and you'll just pay for sleep later when you try to transition from swing / rocker to crib.It has a lower weight limit than many rockers but it's comparable to other swings.[Misc]I would put the cord away when not in use.

"AbbeyLoo and Gus the Talking Toad is a really fun, whimsical read.  Kaitlyn (my four year old) and I both enjoyed it!AbbeyLoo loves finding toads in her backyard.  She picks them up to examine them, as they are all different.  She loves hearing them croak, especially at night.  One day, AbbeyLoo picks up a toad, and he starts talking to her!  And she can understand him!  She's astounded at this discovery.  The toad's name is Gus.  And she and Gus figure out together that the reason AbbeyLoo can understand Gus is due to some magic fairy dust she'd sprinkled in the yard, hoping to understand the animals talking.The next day, Gus takes AbbeyLoo down under the ground to Hopville (after AbbeyLoo uses the magic dust to make herself as small as Gus). What follows is an Alice in Wonderland type of adventure.  AbbeyLoo's experiences in Hopville were fun and imaginative.  I loved the imagery and the illustrations of Hopville (and Kaitlyn did too).  The descriptions of Hopville, especially the town fair, were Kaitlyn's favorite part of the book.We really enjoyed this book.  The only thing that I didn't love was how much text was on each page.  I wish Cortez had made the book longer, with less words on each page and more illustrations.  I think both Kaitlyn and I would have enjoyed the book more that way: she was anxious to see the next illustration and was a little confused that we weren't turning pages at our usual pace.With all that said, AbbeyLoo and Gus the Talking Toad is still a great read.

"Tamera Alexander is quickly becoming a new favorite author for me.  I love her books: they are historical Christian fiction with clean, sweet love stories.  I can easily lose myself in one of her stories, and each one I read seems to be better than the last.A Lasting Impression is the first Belmont Mansion novel.  The Belmont Mansion series features Adelicia Acklen, one of the wealthiest women in the United States in the 1860s.  Tamera Alexander visited Belmont Mansion and knew that she was going to write about the home and its inhabitants.  Alexander was able to use some of Adelicia Acklen's correspondence to get a feel for what kind of woman she was, as she was developing her character.  Fiction novels based on real people and places are always so interesting to me.  I love the feeling that I'm learning about history as I read.As in her other novels, Alexander's writing style has such a great flow to it in A Lasting Impression.  I was drawn in from the very first page, and for such a long book, there really were no slow parts.  I like the way Alexander moves the story through time so effortlessly.  Oftentimes, skipping weeks feels like a jump ahead, and it makes the story feel choppy.  Not so with this novel.  The plot moved seamlessly forward at a pace that made it hard for me to put the book down.Claire made a journey to faith in A Lasting Impression, and that part of the story was especially poignant.  Alexander wrote it beautifully, and one conversation in particular between Claire and Adelicia really stayed with me.Claire is an artist, and the emphasis on art made the story feel even richer.  I loved following Claire's creative process, even though she struggled at times.  Her struggles made her work more authentic for me.  And Adelicia's art collection was staggeringly beautiful---and that's just reading about it, not even seeing it!The character development was very well-done, with a lot of growth in the characters throughout the course of the novel.  I loved that.  Alexander's imagery, as well, was outstanding.I really loved A Lasting Impression.  I can't get enough of Tamera Alexander's books!  If you are a fan of historical, Christian, or clean romance, I would highly recommend this series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKTX4L6RTEKZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764206222#wasThisHelpful","RKTX4L6RTEKZ3","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earrings are so pretty and fun!  I love the design.They are comfortable to wear, and I like that the backs fit snugly to keep them safely in my earlobes.These hoop halo studs sparkle like real diamonds, and really shine when worn.  I have shoulder-length curly hair and earrings often get ""lost"" in my hair.  Not so with these earrings.  The sparkle shines right through my curls.The design allows for a little bit of movement during wear.  The hoops can turn around on the strip that holds them in place.  The only issue I've had with this is when putting the earrings on.  Just make sure you have them stone side up and you'll be fine.  They don't move enough to flip around once they're on.I recommend these earrings for women of any age.  They're beautiful and classic.Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U6EEBJWC92HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014WWYBVK#wasThisHelpful","R1U6EEBJWC92HU","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love this beautiful ring.  The setting is so classic and timeless.  I love that this ring features a round center stone in a square setting of surrounding diamonds.  For those unsure of the direction to take regarding round or princess cuts, this ring gives you the best of both worlds.When I opened the black velvet box (nice packaging, by the way!), I was so stunned at how pretty this ring is.  I put it up next to my round solitaire diamond engagement ring, which is set in a band with three round stones on either side, and I was surprised at how well this Cubic zirconia ring holds its own next to a diamond ring.  It doesn't have the same weight that my platinum band has, but it feels sturdy and well-made.  I really like that the center stone doesn't stand up very high.  My engagement ring has a high-set stone that's always catching on things.  This halo ring has a lower profile which is trendy, sensible and chic.  The center stone is mounted with eight prongs, which makes sense since it is a large carat weight at 1.9 carats.  When I read the ring's description, I worried that the eight prongs would distract from the look of the center stone, but they do not, not at all.The setting around the center stone really highlights the stone without looking too flashy.  The smaller stones in the band are a welcome addition and add more shine to the overall look.  I noticed other reviewers saying the stones in the band were uncomfortable, but I found them to be just fine.  I like that the stones in the band go far enough around the band that the rings appears to be an eternity band.At first sight, my four year old daughter immediately fell in love with this ring and asked for one in her size.  She loves to play wedding and loved opening the black velvet box and 'proposing' to me.I can see this ring being a great engagement ring, a promise ring, or even a fashion right-hand ring.  I love it and plan to wear it often.  I've already worn it in place of my engagement ring and I've really enjoyed it.  I'm quite impressed with this beautiful ring.Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.

"These butterfly earrings are beautiful.  They are delicate, yet substantial enough in size that they don't look little-girlish.  I love that the butterflies are of an open design.  It gives them a light and airy look.The earrings have a slightly textured back but are very comfortable to wear.  They have friction grip backs for safety.I'm not an expert, but these cubic zirconia butterflies look like diamonds to me.  I recommend them and think that they would make a great gift.  They truly look much more expensive than they are.Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WSVQDW28B0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0152RFJAG#wasThisHelpful","R2WSVQDW28B0I","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picture of Grace is such a beautiful book, both in imagery and in story.  I read this one alone, because I haven't yet explained death to my four year old daughter, Kaitlyn.  However, I did let her look at the illustrations and she loved them, especially the paintings.Taylor Bills did an excellent job illustrating this story.  The images are so descriptive: a reader could discern the entire story just by paging through the book and studying the illustrations.  I especially loved the way Delilah was drawn.  I could feel her every emotion through her facial expressions.I love that Armstrong's story features a little girl and her grandfather.  Often children form stronger attachments to same-sex grandparents, so I loved that this book was different from the norm.  Grace and Walt have a strong bond, based on love and respect.  Grace adores her grandfather and the feeling is mutual.About halfway through the book, the worst happens: Grandpa Walt dies.  I appreciated how Armstrong handled this aspect of the story.  It is very much implied without being explicitly stated.  That seemed really appropriate for a children's book.The conflict resolution was so moving.  I found myself tearing up as I read.  Picture of Grace is a beautiful book, and perfect for children experiencing loss.  I highly recommend this book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAH41WQCO5G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986237000#wasThisHelpful","R3UAH41WQCO5G1","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Om-Bork was a sweet and fun read.  I really enjoyed it!I don't think I've ever read a Christian science fiction children's book before, so Om-Bork is definitely unique in that sense.  I wasn't sure how Robert Lampros would pull all of those elements together, but he did it very well.The story was engaging and meaningful.  As well as funny!  The illustrations really added a lot of depth, humor and meaning to the story.  I loved Om-Bork's face and facial expressions.Being that I have a four year old and this book is recommended for ages 7-12, I read Om-Bork on my own.  But, I think children ages 5 and up would understand and enjoy Om-Bork.I really liked this book and would definitely read more from Robert Lampros.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37VS1QLRYFN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1516866347#wasThisHelpful","R37VS1QLRYFN2","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've loved Tracy Banghart's Rebel Wing series from the start (back when book one was called Shattered Veil, in fact) and so I was super thrilled to read the conclusion to this imaginative series.  Also, I was a little sad to see the Rebel Wing series end because they've been such great reads and I wanted to stay in Atalanta a little longer with Milek and Aris.Torn Sky was, I think, my favorite book out of the Rebel Wing series.  And that's saying a lot because I loved Rebel Wing and Storm Fall.  Torn Sky was everything I've come to expect from a Tracy Banghart novel: fast-paced and full of action, plot twists, and emotional moments.Banghart employs her usual third-person narrative in Torn Sky.  Third-person narrative is not my favorite style of storytelling but it worked perfectly for this novel.  I sometimes feel like I don't get to know the characters as well when the book is not a first-person narrative, but happily, that is never the case with one of Banghart's books.  I felt connected with all of the characters, and found myself emotionally bound to their particular fates.Torn Sky is a fast-paced novel, which is impressive considering its length.  There were no slow spots or times where I wanted to put the book down.  The action was intense but not so intense that it felt like constant battle scenes (something I don't particularly enjoy).  I loved that there were so many surprises and plot twists along the way, several of which were truly shocking to me.  I absolutely love being surprised like that.The love story between Milek and Aris was one of my favorite aspects of this novel.  Their relationship is so sweet and perfectly written.  They are realistic about their future, since they are officers in a war, but also hopeful for a better tomorrow, all without being saccharine about it.  I loved that there were more scenes with the two of them in Torn Sky.  And they weren't the only relationship featured, so that was nice.I'm sad to see this series end, because it has been such a great ride.  I highly recommend the Rebel Wing series, and all of Tracy Banghart's books!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ONH25JFYLL7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z77ROAU#wasThisHelpful","R2ONH25JFYLL7Y","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfriended was a great read.  It really took me back, way back, to my own middle school years.  That feeling of not fitting in, and so desperately wanting to, is something that's hard to forget.So it was with great empathy that I understood Truly's situation.  On a whim, one of the popular girls invites her to sit at their table for lunch.  Truly turns her back on her best friend Hazel to join the ""it"" crowd.  And Hazel doesn't really take the rejection well.What follows is a story of friendship, both real and imagined, bullying, and redemption.  I liked the way Vail resolved the conflict and felt that Unfriended accurately portrayed the friendship dynamics of middle school.Unfriended was a fast read, and is not to be missed.  One of my favorite lines from the book comes towards the end when Natasha says to her mother:  ""'You make me hate myself, and then it's like, all I am is hate.  All I have, all I can put out there into the world is hate.'""  --- Unfriended, page 269When I read that passage, I found myself tearing up.  This is why girls can be so mean to each other.  It all comes from their own damaged self-esteem, and often stems from their relationships with their mothers.  It was a powerful realization, especially for a middle grade novel.I really enjoyed Unfriended and would definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REQGGZT5A7W73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147511542#wasThisHelpful","REQGGZT5A7W73","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this book for my four year old, Kaitlyn, and I to read since we will be moving twice in the next few months.  We're moving from our house to an apartment while our new house is being built.  And hopefully we'll be moving into the new house before Christmas.  Since she's only four years old, she's been a little confused about the moves and thinks that we will have all new things (and toys!) in each new living space.So, I guess it would be fair to say that Kaitlyn identified well with Boomer the dog.  She loved that he was clueless as to what was going on.  The fact that movers came to pack Boomer's family's belongings up was a big plus for us, as we are having packers as well.  Kaitlyn loved the illustrations (and I did too!), especially the faces Boomer and the family cat make as the move progresses.Boomer's Big Day was such a sweet book.  I believe that it helped clarify a few confusing things about moving for Kaitlyn.  Besides that, we both really enjoyed it!  There are other Boomer books and we will definitely be reading more of his stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL7RDHADVH5O0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811814920#wasThisHelpful","RL7RDHADVH5O0","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Francine Rivers is one of my absolute favorite Christian fiction authors.  Her books are just perfection.  Any time I start one of her stories, everything in my life goes on the back burner.  I find it nearly impossible to put her books down once I've picked them up.  And Bridge to Haven was no exception.  This book was one worth ignoring my family to read...and read...and read.I was drawn into the story from the very first page.  Baby Abra is born under a bridge in the town of Haven, left by her mother, and discovered by the small town's pastor.  Pastor Zeke and his wife take the baby in and name her Abra.  Because of the circumstances surrounding her birth, and those regarding her adoptive mother, Abra has always felt unloved and unwanted.  She grows up resentful and eager to leave Haven.  And she leaves the town at the first opportunity---hand in hand with a dangerous young man bent on using her for his own gain.Abra's sad story reminded me a lot of Angel's in Francine Rivers' earlier work, Redeeming Love.  Of course the circumstances are different, but there were some similarities between the two women, and this was a good thing.  Reading Bridge to Haven made me want to read Redeeming Love again (for the, oh, fifth time?).Bridge to Haven is a long book, and could have easily slowed down during parts.  But, Rivers' pacing is perfection and the story moved at a pace that made it very difficult for me to put the book down.  Abra's story is so tender and heartfelt.  I found myself tearing up more than once as I read.  Her journey to faith was so meaningful and emotional.  I loved the relationships as well----Rivers excels at developing characters and the characters in Bridge to Haven are what made the book so special.Bridge to Haven is Francine Rivers at her best.  I loved everything about this book, and can't wait for her next release!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q9OGAMMPTX5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1414368194#wasThisHelpful","R1Q9OGAMMPTX5V","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never read a book quite like Chemistry.  It was dark, twisted, and tragic.  I was simultaneously appalled and intrigued by the plot and found this book nearly impossible to put down.I didn't realize at the time I started Chemistry that it is a retelling of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Now that I know this (after finishing the book), the entire story makes so much more sense.  There were times while reading that I was just confused, overwhelmed and shocked at the way the story was going.  Claude was far from a likable narrator and he got worse as the story progressed.  But after finishing the book and realizing it's a retelling, I completely understand why things went the way they did.If you're unfamiliar with the basic tenets of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, read about it on Wikipedia here.  I highly recommend being familiar with the plot of The Hunchback of Notre Dame before reading Chemistry.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  You'll like Chemistry so much more if you have a little bit of an idea why these shocking and scary things are happening.I could see Chemistry being used as a read-along novel to The Hunchback of Notre Dame in classrooms.  It certainly gives a modern, contemporary feel to the classic historical fiction.With all that said, I have to say that I did overall enjoy this book.  The intensity of it was unique.  It was definitely a consuming read, one that I finished in two sittings.  I kept thinking, ""surely, now will be Claude's redemption,"" and then he would go and do something else even more twisted.  Some of the appeal of Chemistry was a voyeuristic sense of ""how bad can things get?"" not unlike being unable to look away from a car wreck on the highway.Lamm does a great job at depicting her characters' emotions, especially the tormented Claude.  It is the hallmark of great writing when an author can make you care about a character that you don't even like.  And in the end, I did care about Claude.  I refused to give up hope for him no matter how deplorable his actions were.If you like contemporary retellings of classic novels, I would recommend Chemistry.  Just be forewarned that it is not a feel-good book, but it's still a good book.  Chemistry is one of those books that will be hard to forget.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WPOZXJPB8IHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493665081#wasThisHelpful","R1WPOZXJPB8IHG","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been a fan of Libba Bray since I read her Gemma Doyle series (A Great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, The Sweet Far Thing).  The Gemma Doyle books were beautifully written and intense, and I can say the same for Lair of Dreams.  Once I started this book, I knew I was in for a treat.I started Lair of Dreams without realizing that it is actually the second book in The Diviners series.  I have not read book one, The Diviners, but that didn't hinder my reading.  I was able to follow the story without incident, although I would have preferred to read The Diviners first, since the characters referenced events from book one quite frequently in this story.Bray has a deliberate pace to her writing, which can sometimes lend her books a slow start.  I found this to be true for Lair of Dreams.  However, once the story was set up and the world-building was complete (about halfway through the book), I could hardly put this book down.  The second half of Lair of Dreams was just thrilling and surprising.  I loved it.Some of my favorite things about Libba Bray's writing are her excellent characterization and her imagery.  I loved feeling like I knew her characters inside and out and I also felt like I was in both New York and the dream world right along with everyone else.I am not a fan of ghost stories, not at all, so I'm surprised that I actually read this book.  There is a ghost in it, along with some other very creepy things.  I couldn't read this book at night because I was scared it would keep me up (I'm a ninny, I know!).  But, all of this to say that I didn't have any trouble feeling spooked or nightmares after reading Lair of Dreams.  And that is really quite surprising, but I'm glad because now I know I can finish the series.I really loved Lair of Dreams.

"I'm really impressed with this screen cleaner kit!  For under $8, you get a good sized bottle of screen cleaner and a very nice-sized microfiber towel.  My towel was black instead of green, as pictured, but this was not a concern for me.The screen cleaner sprays evenly and has no odor at all.  I love that.  It is natural, bio-degradable, and hypo-allergenic.  I have asthma and allergies and often have trouble with cleaning products giving me problems, especially trouble breathing.  I didn't have this issue in the least with EcoMoist.My husband and I each cleaned the following items right away:1.  Both of our laptop screens (which are touch screens so they get yucky).  There was absolutely no streaking at all on these screens.2.  Our Kindle Paperwhites.  Even though these screens are the e-ink screens, they still cleaned up beautifully.3.  Our phones.  We both have our phones in OtterBox cases.  I wondered how the EcoMoist would do on the OtterBox screen protector.  It exceeded my expectations and now both of our screens are clear and streak-free.I haven't tried it yet but I'm quite tempted to clean my glasses with my EcoMoist.  My usual glasses cleaner always streaks.

"The scripture from 1 Samuel 1:27, ""For this child I have prayed..."" has become a common thing to see on picture frames, crosses, and wall plaques for nurseries.  It's a meaningful scripture that has become increasingly popular.  William Gage took the surrounding verses from Samuel 1:27 and fleshed them out into a short story, of the same name.I didn't remember the story of Elkanah and Hannah, so For This Child I Prayed was a treat in that aspect.  I found their story moving and emotional.  I liked that this short story provides the reader with a deeper look into what it was like to be a married woman in Old Testament times.Hannah and Elkanah were married for years when Elkanah took a second wife, Peninnah.  The most likely motivator for Elkanah's second marriage was that Hannah was unable to bear children.  As Peninnah births child after child, Hannah's sorrow grows, until she finally prays to God for a child.  As she prays she promises that after the child is weaned, she will give him to the high priest so that the child may serve the Lord always.Reading the original scripture gave me the facts of the story, but Gage's short story really gave the words life.  I loved seeing the scripture come alive like that.  Hannah's heartbreak at the way her life has turned out was deep and very well-portrayed.About halfway through the story, there was a section where Gage veers from Hannah's perspective and talks about how hard the holidays are for those who are infertile.  While intuitive and informational, it felt more like that part belonged at the end of the story.  It was a little different from the rest of the story and interfered with the flow, in my opinion.Overall, I really enjoyed For This Child I Prayed.  I liked the addendum, which described the history behind the cover of the book.  It was definitely a nice touch and a good addition to the story.  I look forward to reading the rest of the stories in Gage's series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GUFD8W1F6WEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010VZNN7U#wasThisHelpful","R3GUFD8W1F6WEV","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like millions of people worldwide, I fell in love with Wonder.  I was so excited to read more from R.J. Palacio when I got the offer to read Auggie & Me.  I am not usually a huge fan of short stories, but the three stories in Auggie & Me are short stories done right.The first story is The Julian Chapter, which I admit, I was looking forward to the least.  I mean, who doesn't love to hate Julian?!  But, I was so surprised at the way my view of Julian changed after reading his story.  I enjoyed hearing Julian's own narrative voice and found myself completely understanding where his anger and hate towards Auggie came from.  Julian's history doesn't excuse his actions, and Palacio does not try to create false sympathy for Julian.  She simply delves into his character and own family life, and through that narrative, the reader comes to see that Julian's behavior towards Auggie and Jack was only natural for him: he is the product of his upbringing.  However, all is not lost, as Julian undergoes quite a bit of character growth in this story.  His visit with his grandmere in Paris was life-changing for him, and reading her story was the most touching part of The Julian Chapter.  I started this short story thinking, ""I'll just get through this one quickly because I really want to read the other two,"" and ended it with tears of compassion for Julian and his family.  Bravo, Palacio!Next comes Pluto, Auggie's friend Christopher's story.  Auggie and Chris have been friends since birth, but Chris moves away before Auggie starts at Beecher Prep, so he's not there to shelter Auggie at his new school.  Chris's story was just as touching as I expected it to be, and I was once again moved to tears by the end of it.  I loved learning more about Chris, since he wasn't a prominent character in Wonder, at least the way I remember it.  One prominent theme to Auggie & Me is that these stories are not about Auggie.  They're about Julian, Chris, and Charlotte.  Auggie is mentioned in the stories, of course, but in almost like cameos.  The stories are how each character reacts to Auggie, and how his presence at Beecher Prep changes their lives for the better.The last story is Shingaling, and it was just so cute.  Palacio delves into the ""girl war"" in Shingaling, and does it with aplomb.  Charlotte's use of Venn diagrams just made me smile.  I loved her spunky personality and her honesty.  I really enjoyed getting to know the girls in Wonder better.  While Shingaling wasn't as emotionally moving as the other two stories, it was still an awesome read.  And the ending was just perfect.I loved Auggie & Me.  It is a must-read for fans of Wonder.  And if you haven't read Wonder yet, stop, drop and read that awesome, life-changing book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25DZZU3KT5YH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101934859#wasThisHelpful","R25DZZU3KT5YH6","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I were an author, I would imagine that it would be difficult beyond belief to follow up a book as stunning and popular as The Language of Flowers. How could anything else compare?Diffenbaugh manages to accomplish the seemingly impossible with We Never Asked for Wings.  This book was entirely encompassing in its beautiful prose and nuanced characters.  I couldn't put it down and didn't want to.We Never Asked for Wings is told in the third person perspective.  This isn't my favorite narrative style, but it is used to an advantage here: the reader learns the thoughts of all of the main characters.  The end result was that I finished the book feeling as though I knew the characters personally.  They were so real to me that they could have been anyone I encounter in daily life: the mother with two children at the store, at the doctor, getting gas.  Letty, Alex and Luna were more than just fictional characters; each of them had traits that anyone could relate to.  And that is the beauty of Diffenbaugh's writing: even when she's covering a topic that you may think has nothing to do with your life, you see yourself in her characters.  After all, it doesn't matter what our challenges are---hard is hard---our human response and reactions are all the same.My point is that reading Vanessa Diffenbaugh's work makes me feel more connected to the world around me.

"I read and loved the first installment in Russel Middlebrook the Futon Years, The Thing I Didn't Know I Didn't Know, and so I knew I was in for a treat with Barefoot in the City of Broken Dreams.  I love Hartinger's writing: it's simultaneously light-hearted and introspective and his characters are so easy to relate to.  Barefoot in the City of Broken Dreams was my favorite Russel Middlebrook book to date.Like Hartinger's other books, this story was fast-paced, yet it never felt rushed.  I read the book in two sittings because the story was so good I didn't want to put it down.  Russel's narrative voice is probably my favorite thing about his books.  He is honest and sweetly optimistic, without being too naive.  I truly like Russel as a character, and I can't always say that about main characters.Russel and Kevin's relationship is a favorite of mine.  I loved watching their relationship strengthen and develop over time.  Like all love stories, there were some bumps in the road for Kevin and Russel, but the way they worked past them was what I really admired.  Both characters grew in this book, and I enjoyed that aspect of the story, particularly Russel's growth.I liked that even though Barefoot in the City of Broken Dreams spanned a long period of time.  It's not a particularly long book, yet it covers months of Russel's life.  And that led to even more growth opportunities for Russel.I feel so invested in these characters; even the minor characters like Zoe, Lewis and Otto.  I love that Hartinger puts so much development and depth into each character, no matter how big or small a part they play in the plot.I just love this series and I really can't wait for the next Russel Middlebrook book!*I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RABGV0LXHVSPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514382415#wasThisHelpful","RABGV0LXHVSPB","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Could It Be You? was a really fun and light read.  I enjoyed this book so much.  Books like this one are why I keep coming back to contemporary fiction: they are just fun to read.  I don't have to work to remember the ""rules"" of a fantasy world, or remember the characters and plot points from previous books in a series.  I can just read the stand-alone novel and enjoy it for what it is: a fun escape from every day life.  And Could It Be You? embodied all of those things, and more.I liked Rachel, the main character, right from the start.  It was so easy to connect with her, and especially to feel for her situation.  She's recently separated from her husband, and trying to grow her soap-making business.  Rachel has a spunky attitude and I could tell right away that while she was having a hard time, she wasn't going to stay down for long.Could It Be You? spans only a few weeks in time, but Kirby manages to fit a lot of action and character growth in during a short time period.  I loved that so much happened for Rachel throughout the story.  I liked that the story is written from Rachel's perspective because it made me even more invested in her happy ending.There were lots of small details that made this book great.  The minor characters were very well-written and interesting.  I especially liked Rachel's parents.  Their scenes made me smile and even laugh out loud.  Rachel's group of friends was supportive and realistic.  I was glad that she had them to lean on and I enjoyed getting to know them.  I also really enjoyed the element of Rachel's business.  Soap-making seems simple enough, but the way Rachel is focused on growing her business and everything that entailed was interesting.The love story was just right for the tone of the book: it was not the emphasis of the story but it was a welcome addition.  I really enjoyed Could It Be You? and I would most definitely read Katie Kirby's work again.4.5/5 stars; I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

"I'm a sucker for a book with a good extremist religion premise, so I knew I had to read Awake.  I had a few issues with this book, but overall, I liked the story.I didn't re-read the summary before starting Awake, so for the first third of the book or so, I thought that Noah and his family were fae.  Ha!  The description of his former life: living off the land, being outside, being away from civilization, it all fed into my belief that Noah was a faery.  And Scarlett spent a lot of time thinking about how handsome he was, which is also a fae attribute.  So, I was surprised when I learned that Noah was a regular human, just part of a cult (not a spoiler, this is in the summary!).  I have to confess that thinking Noah was fae made me want to read a Julie Kagawa book.  Because when I think of romance between humans and fae, I think of Julie Kagawa.  And given those thoughts, it was very hard not to compare this book with Kagawa's work.  But, once I learned that Eternal Light was a cult, not some kind of code name for a faery village, I was able to appreciate Awake for itself.I did have some issues with Awake.  The love story was a little too saccharine.  I know this was first love for both characters, but it was just too sappy for me.  There were a few too many ""I love yous"" exchanged and they fell in love super fast.  I know things move faster when you're that young (sometimes) but it was insta-love and I'm not a fan of insta-love.  Secondly, I felt that the story was not always realistic.  There were several small things that didn't add up or make sense to me.  And, once I learned of Noah's betrayal, it was hard to forgive him.  At least it was hard for me to like him as much as I did in the beginning.Despite these issues, I did like Awake.  I liked the plot, which felt fresh for the genre.  The imagery was beautiful and made me want to visit Ireland.  The emotions were raw and unfiltered.  Preston's pacing was great and the conflict resolution was good as well.  I enjoyed Awake and would definitely read Natasha Preston again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33CA3POTI13KW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTWFUN6#wasThisHelpful","R33CA3POTI13KW","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kari Edgren's Goddess Born series is an absolute favorite of mine.  I love historical fiction, and this series is a perfect blend of clean romance with paranormal and mythological elements as well.  All of these elements come together to make an awesome story, and Edgren's world is one I don't want to leave.The Goddess Born series started out strong with Goddess Born, and the second installment, A Grave Inheritance, was even better.  I felt sure that An Immortal Descent would be just as good as its predecessors, but I did wonder how Edgren would top the first two books.  But top them she did: An Immortal Descent was my favorite book in the series.Once I started An Immortal Descent, I knew I was going to be ignoring my family until I finished the book.  The story starts off with lots of action and the pace didn't let up.  I loved that there was so much going on with the plot.  And Edgren threw some unexpected plot twists in that really took me by surprise.Once again, Selah is our narrator.  I enjoy that the series is told from her perspective, as it makes me feel even more invested in her story.  I admire Selah, and my respect for her grew throughout the story.  She's brave, has gumption, and does not need a man to save her.  Selah is not afraid to speak her mind and can hold her own in a fight.  She's a great main character and I loved watching her grow throughout the series.  I felt like she did the most growing in An Immortal Descent.Henry is an interesting and nuanced character in his own right, but I find it hard to get past how perfect he is for Selah.  He's definitely sigh-worthy.  I love Henry and Selah's perfectly written love story.  This series is a clean romance, and while some readers may not like that, I love it.  Selah knows she is saving herself for marriage, which fits with the historical aspect of the story.  And so it follows that she and Henry have passion but have to rein it in before it goes too far, so to speak. To me, the emotions mean more when the relationship between two characters is not just about what's going on in the bedroom.  I like having a series that I feel like I can share with my mom or freely recommend to teens because the author has kept the romance clean.There is so much to love about An Immortal Descent.  I feel like I could keep gushing over it forever, but I'll stop now and just highly encourage you to read it!  I loved the story, characters, pacing, and writing style.  I can't wait to see what Kari Edgren comes up with next!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WX3T7Q6QEW23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCYM8XS#wasThisHelpful","R2WX3T7Q6QEW23","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know it's mid-summer, but I believe books about Christmas are fun all year-round.  After all, ""I'm going to ask for that for Christmas"" passes Kaitlyn's lips on a regular basis.  Kaitlyn and I really enjoyed The True Spirit of Christmas.I like that Manning uses her book to teach a lesson about giving, not receiving, at Christmas.  As is expected, Kaitlyn loves to receive gifts.  So she identified well with Maddie, the protagonist.  But, Maddie is a bit of a brat when it comes to receiving gifts: she has to have it all and she has to have the best.  This extremism in the main character was good for the story as it really drove home the point of how we look to others when we make Christmas all about ourselves.Kaitlyn loved the illustrations in The True Spirit of Christmas.  She especially loved the expressions on the character's faces and how easy they were to read.  The faces helped her ""read"" the story on her own after I'd read it to her.  The story rhymes, and some of the rhymes were a bit tongue-twisting.  Kaitlyn loved hearing them, but I didn't love reading all of them.  This is the only thing I didn't love about this book.As soon as we finished the book, Kaitlyn asked to read it again.  That's her version of giving a book five stars!

It keeps shoes off the floor.  It didn't smell like chemicals when I received it, like plastic or rubber products often do.  It is the perfect size for holding a pair of shoes for each family member, and I love the color.  It's hard to find this kind of tray that isn't black.

"Faithful was my favorite book in S.A. Wolfe's Fearsome series.  These books are stand-alone novels, but if you read them out of order, you'll know who ends up with whom.  So, I'd recommend reading the series in order.I liked Faithful so much because I loved Imogene.  Her voice, her perspective on life, was honest and refreshing.  She wasn't a typical female lead character and I liked that about her.  Imogene knows what she wants and won't settle for less.  She's in charge of herself, her life, and her sexuality.  Imogene makes no apologies for being the person she is, and to the world is kind of ""here I am, take me or leave me, I don't care either way.""  I like that kind of spunk in a character!Cooper was a likable character as well.  He wasn't quite the typical male lead character either.  The relationship between Cooper and Imogene was a fairly slow build, and quite steamy once it heated up.  Wolfe's books are like that, and in my opinion, are more adult than new adult.I loved seeing the characters from books one and two living out their happily ever afters.  There was an emphasis on friendship and the group hung out a lot, so there were plenty of chances to see my favorite characters from previous books.The conflict resolution was sweet and and realistic.  I liked it.  I enjoyed Faithful and would definitely read S.A.

"Lola and Tattletale Zeke was a hit as soon as I pulled it out of the shipping envelope.  My four year-old daughter Kaitlyn loved the picture of the sibling dogs on front, especially because Zeke looks a lot like her aunt's Yorkie named Oliver.  Kaitlyn got a kick out of that.The pictures, taken of Lola and Zeke at home, really served to further the story line.  They were so cute and fun: Kaitlyn enjoyed them and so did I (and we're not even ""dog people!"").The relationship between Lola and Zeke was sweet and helped serve the message of the plot: about when to tell on someone.  Although that message was subtle to say the least, I still think Kaitlyn got something out of it.  She especially liked the sudden arrival of the cat Isabel.We really enjoyed Lola and Tattletale Zeke and would definitely read more from Marcia Goldman!**I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16DTAM97JF0CQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939547164#wasThisHelpful","R16DTAM97JF0CQ","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been on a contemporary binge lately, and books like A Million Miles Away are exactly why I keep coming back to this genre.  I loved so many things about this book!First of all, I should mention that A Million Miles Away is a clean contemporary read.  I love it when authors make their books clean without being too ""goody-goody"" or prudish about it.  There can be plenty of chemistry without toeing the line of YA and NA, and Avery's writing is a perfect example of this fact.A Million Miles Away gave me all the feelings.  Happiness, despair, elation, grief, uncertainty, and most of all, that all-encompassing falling in love feeling that I love YA for.  Kelsey goes from being a typical teenage girl to a girl who has experienced one of the worst possible things she could go through: the death of her identical twin sister (I'm not spoiling things, this is in the summary!).  Kelsey and her parents are affected by this loss in different ways, although they share the same grief.  The emotions were so raw and real that I cried more than once while reading.Avery explores many themes in this story, which I loved.  The entire book could have been about Kelsey's grief over losing Michelle, and that would have made a good story.  But Avery goes the extra mile (sorry for the pun, I had to do it) and explores other themes.  This gives the book even more depth and emotion.A Million Miles Away is such a great story.  It ends on an up-note, without being too saccharine.  But I will not soon forget the emotional journey of this story.  A Million Miles Away should not be missed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R286R7XLUFQ3IU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316283681#wasThisHelpful","R286R7XLUFQ3IU","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After reading Christina's open letter to the producers of The Wolf of Wall Street, featured in LA Weekly, I was excited to read her book.  I'm not usually one to pick up memoirs, but Christina's story intrigued me and I had to know more about her and her journey.The first thing I noticed and liked about this book is that Christina is unflinchingly honest.  I admire that.  Christina told the truth when it made her look bad, when it would have been so much easier to skim over things or just omit them.  She never took the easy way out, though.  I could feel her commitment to telling her story, her whole story, and tell it she did.I admit that I haven't spent much time thinking about the families of the men of Wall Street who were caught breaking the law.  I certainly never imagined a father who would steal his own daughter's identity to keep living a lie of wealth, even as he waited to go to prison.  The grim reality of the Prousalis family's fall from grace was sobering.  And as I read about Christina being hungry, not having a place to live, and struggling to find work, I just couldn't believe the disparity of her past and current lives.  The story went from present times back to the family's wealthy years.  They lived the high life, and it was definitely easy to feel jealous of their lavish lifestyle.  But the line that I kept hearing in my head was, ""we never knew any different.""  And that made me feel sorry for Christina.  To have the false security of having grown up in a bubble of wealth---never knowing any other way to live---and that bubble was shattered in an instant.I love the way Christina ends her book: not with a story of great redemption, but with one of resilience, coping, and growth.  It made me proud of her and happy to feel as though I knew her, through her words.  I really enjoyed After Perfect and would definitely recommend this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XSISWCMS90QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476785325#wasThisHelpful","R2XSISWCMS90QM","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Books like Silence are what keep me coming back to contemporary young adult fiction.  This book was stunning.  Silence is beautiful in its simplicity: a young teen loses her hearing in an accident and is left trying to put her world back together.  But at the same time, Lytton provided tremendous depth to the story via her characters' feelings, histories, and response to trauma.Silence could have had a predictable storyline, but it didn't.  I loved that feeling of never quite knowing where the story would go next.  There was so much character growth throughout the book, much more than I expected out of a book that encompasses about four weeks' time.  I usually don't like it when books are based on such a short time period, but Lytton avoided the pitfalls of a rushed plot and insta-love, so I ended up with zero complaints on that note.Silence ended so beautifully.  This book left me feeling grateful for everything I have and more conscious of the beautiful world around me.  I highly recommend Silence and look forward to reading Deborah Lytton again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IL30U71FKOTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609079450#wasThisHelpful","R1IL30U71FKOTO","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved every single thing about this book.  The first words drew me in and I couldn't put Every Last Word down until I'd finished it.Every Last Word hit uncomfortably close to home for me.  Like Samantha, I also have Pure-Obsessional OCD, or Pure-O, and often feel tortured by my own mind.  In the first chapter, Samantha is trimming roses for Valentine's Day and when handed the scissors, is afraid she's going to cut all the roses up with them.  And then she'll cut her friends' hair and not be able to stop.  This kind of thinking, going into a panic over what would be a fleeting thought for most, is called an intrusive thought.Intrusive thoughts cause major distress, panic, and upset.  They are a hallmark of Pure-O, and the way Stone wrote Sam's intrusive thoughts was so perfectly accurate, I got chills.  I could so easily identify with Sam, especially how she feels as though she has to keep her disorder hidden from her friends.  Stone's personification of Pure-O was so true to what my experience with it has been.  I could tell that she did a great deal of research while planning and writing this book.  I love it when authors write so knowledgeably on a difficult subject.One of the caveats of books that address mental health issues or substance abuse issues is how the protagonist's issues are addressed.  Too often, I've seen the trope of ""love cures all"" and that just rings false and feels like a deux ex machina to me.  I was so happy that Sam got better in realistic ways.  Sam goes to therapy and does the hard, hard work of sharing her thoughts and reframing them.  She takes medication to help herself cope, and surrounds herself with people who build her up instead of bringing her down.  Sam learns healthy coping methods (several of which inspired me!) and I loved Stone for the way she addresses Sam's OCD.Beyond Sam's OCD, there were so many interesting aspects to this story: bullying, 'mean girls,' poetry, music, swimming, and young love.  I loved the depth that these themes provided.  Each chapter was titled, something else I really like, because it adds interest and meaning to the story.  And the titles themselves were so relevant to Sam, because they all consisted of three words (three is 'her' number) and were all three words taken from the chapter.  This is significant to the story because this way of creating titles is something Sam came up with herself for her playlists.Stone's prose flowed so well, that I ended up reading Every Last Word in one sitting.  I loved every single thing about this book and can't wait to read more from Tamera Ireland Stone.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N3C5117Z4VFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484705270#wasThisHelpful","R2N3C5117Z4VFI","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ugly Stepsister was a fun and unique read.  I really enjoyed it!  I love a good fairy tale retelling, so I knew this would be a good book for me.What made The Ugly Stepsister so neat was that Ling veers from the classic fairy tale and creates a different story in Cinderella's world.  Immediately, I liked that the story is told from Katriona's perspective, and not Cinderella's point of view.  The other stepsister has never been really fleshed out as a character (the movie Ever After did the best job of it until now, in my opinion) so it was neat to read the story from a different perspective.  And I liked Katriona right from the start.The fact that the book was magical and that Kat had to complete the story gave The Ugly Stepsister a sense of urgency.  Kat desperately wants to get home, back to her family, and yet she must complete the story to do so.  Much of the book is spent with Kat devising ways to get Elle and Edward to fall in love.  It was funny and inspiring to watch her keep trying to do the impossible, moving forward with dogged determination.  I admired Kat for being so focused and committed to her goal of getting home.  But I also admired her commitment to making a difference in the story world while she was there.I usually don't comment on covers but I have to ask: what is going on with her skirt in this cover?  Is it caught in a drift wind?  It looks like the hoop part has flipped up on itself and is stuck. The dress is also not consistent with the corseted style the characters wear in the novel.I really loved everything about The Ugly Stepsister, right up until the ending.  After so much build-up and anticipation, I wanted to see more of Kat's own happily ever after.  I wish that the epilogue would have been longer, and maybe set in the future.Those two complaints aside, which were small in comparison to how much I liked this book, The Ugly Stepsister is a great read.  I highly recommend it to fans of YA and especially fans of fairy tales.4.5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311QN1VUDZX5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511956720#wasThisHelpful","R311QN1VUDZX5A","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This wasn't my first time reading April Marie Libs, and it certainly won't be the last.  I love her books!  I read Bridge to Destiny earlier this year, and it had me on the edge of my seat, much like how I felt when reading Kaleidoscope.Libs excels at writing stand-alone novels with tons of character growth.  There is so much depth packed into her stories, which doesn't always happen with stand-alones, in my opinion.  I loved that Kaleidoscope has an emphasis on healthy friendships, especially between girlfriends.  Too often, women are at war with each other, so it's always nice to see a healthy relationship between two female characters.Piper's happily ever after is just within reach when the rug is pulled out from under her.  She discovers her fiance with another woman (I'm not spoiling anything: this is in the summary).  It's basically the worst thing that could happen.  Piper's world is turned upside down and as a result, she decides to move and completely start over.Piper's move allows her to reinvent herself and she ends up being a lot more assertive by the end of the book than she was in the beginning.  I loved seeing her grow and own her assertive nature, even when it was difficult and it would have been so much easier to let things go.I was surprised by the conflict resolution, but upon further reflection, it was true to the story line and perfect for this book.  I love a great stand-alone contemporary fiction novel, and April Marie Libs is an author to follow.  I can't wait to read her next novel!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C69S37KWYS0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKUDT94#wasThisHelpful","R3C69S37KWYS0V","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't just speed through this book, I devoured it.  Mathieu has written another stand-out story, one that stayed with me long after I finished reading.For reasons I can't articulate, I am always drawn to books about religious extremes.  Peggy Riley's Amity and Sorrow comes to mind, as well as another whose title escapes me at the moment.  So, Devoted was right up my alley, so to speak.  I'd already read and loved Mathieu's The Truth About Alice, so I knew I was in for an intense read.I connected with Rachel from page one and that feeling of understanding only intensified as the book progressed.  Rachel's life consists of caring for her younger siblings.  Everything she does, thinks, says, and wears is dictated by her religion.  Her religion is very patriarchal and her father has the ultimate say-so in everything that happens in their family.  Rachel is one of ten kids (ten!) and early into the book, her mother announces her eleventh pregnancy.  Rachel immediately feels overwhelmed at the thought of another sibling to care for.  And she's terrified of turning 18 and soon having her own spouse and children.  Rachel wants to learn, to go to school, have a profession, and exercise some free will.  But her church does not allow for women to do any of those things.Rachel is living in a kind of torment: knowing she wants more out of life but unable to even ask the questions she has.  She connects with another young woman who left the church.  Rachel starts to feel like there might be a different kind of life out there for her, and just as she starts to really have some hope, things turn on a dime.  Her world is turned upside down and she has to make a choice.What I loved about Devoted was the intensity of the story. I felt each of Rachel's emotions as if they were my own.  I love that Mathieu's writing evokes those feelings in me.  This book was fast-paced and I kept finding myself saying, one more page, just one more page.  And Devoted was full of my very favorite thing: character growth.  So much growth for a novel of this length.The story ended just as it should have: no happily ever after, but yet a 'hopefully ever after.'  I admire Mathieu for keeping things realistic.  I finished this book with a sense of anticipation for Rachel's future, and I loved feeling that way for her.  I loved everything about Devoted and highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JD94NRNWPQLS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF6QKDA#wasThisHelpful","R2JD94NRNWPQLS","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fifteen Minutes of Summer is the third book in Heather Wardell's Seven Exes series.  I really love this series: what started out as light fiction quickly turned serious with tons of character development along the way.  I generally liked Summer in Seven Exes Are Eight Too Many (book one), but felt that she was hiding something behind her veneer of sexiness and her very outgoing nature.Summer ended up being my favorite character from the Seven Exes series.  She has so many layers to her personality and I enjoyed uncovering them as the book progressed.  Summer's parents and sister are extremely intelligent.  She can never keep up with the conversation when they are all together.  In turn, Summer is perpetually feeling like she is dumb.  Summer hides her low self-esteem behind her looks, clothes, and vibrant personality.  She can talk to anyone (and does!) and decides to play up her strengths instead of her (perceived) weaknesses.But things quickly spiral out of control as Summer is pressured at work into sharing secrets about her friends.  Summer begins to lose control of the situation, yet is too embarrassed and afraid to ask for help.  Fifteen Minutes of Summer begins with Summer's worst dreams coming true.  Everything blows up in her face and she is left alone to pick up the pieces.  Summer goes from having a boyfriend and a group of supportive friends, to having no one.  (I promise I'm not spoiling anything because this is in the prologue!)The crux of the story is how will Summer make amends for her actions?  How can she atone for her mistakes?  What does one do when ""I'm sorry"" is nowhere near close to enough?  Those are the things Summer has to address in Fifteen Minutes of Summer.  After much heartache, Summer takes drastic measures to reconcile with her friends.  That particular scene was the absolute biggest surprise and most emotional part of the book.  I loved it.  Wardell took the story in a direction I could never have anticipated.  I finished this book with so much respect and admiration for Summer.Heather Wardell's books are in a category all their own.  Her genre is women's fiction, yet these books are just so meaningful, easy to relate to, and moving that they stand out.  Fifteen Minutes of Summer is Heather's 17th novel.

"Oh, was this book good!  I loved Uprooted from the first words to the last.  I didn't want this book to end!  I was completely entrapped by the story, Novik's captivating world, and her lyrical prose.From the very first page, I knew I was going to love Uprooted.  There is an intrinsic quality to good writing, one I can't even name.  When an author has it, they have it.  Naomi Novik has it and it shows.  Her writing drew me in from the very first words, and I was almost spell-bound as I read.  I simply couldn't put this book down.In my experience, long books like Uprooted often get draggy in the middle.  That was not the case with this story.  Novik kept a great pace, and the action didn't stop for the entire book.  It was very intense for being such a long read.I love it when stories move through a long period of time because it allows for so much action and character development.  Uprooted spanned many months, maybe even a year, and there was just so much going on.  I loved the plot twists, surprises along the way, and the way the story came full circle.I loved so many things about Uprooted but my favorite thing of all was Agnieszka herself.  She is not your typical heroine.  She's plain, always gets dirty (no matter how hard she tries not to!) and very practical.  Agnieszka loves being outside and especially being in the forest.  If this was a contemporary story, she would have been living on a farm, growing all of her own food.  Agnieszka was that kind of girl.  Novik drew away from the norm with her choice of heroine and I love her for that.Agnieszka is a strong young woman, full of self-assurance and determination.  She is true to herself and her calling.  She doesn't need or want saving from a man and I loved that about her.  Agnieszka is true to her calling and accepts it, even though it's not what she expected or desired, with grace and dignity.  The ending of the story was so perfect and true to Agnieszka as a character.  I loved it.I don't often read high fantasy, but books like Uprooted make me remember just how much I like this genre.  I loved that I didn't have to work to remember the rules of Agnieszka's world.  Sometimes high fantasy books can feel like work to read because I'm trying to keep all of the background information straight in my head as I read.  That wasn't the case here: I fell into the story and grudgingly crawled out as the book ended.I can't say enough good things about Uprooted.  I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S6YQXP9JCBSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUQIU7O#wasThisHelpful","R1S6YQXP9JCBSJ","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this book!  When I read the title of If You Feel Too Much, I knew that this book would be one for me.  I live my life feeling as if I DO feel too much, and I was hoping for words of encouragement and wisdom within these pages.If You Feel Too Much read like poetry.  The book is comprised of essays: a writing style that I really enjoy.  The format keeps the book from getting repetitive and also each chapter is like a little book in and of itself.  I liked reading one or two chapters at a time, then sitting back and thinking about what I'd just read.The essays are soulful and beautiful.  Jamie's writing is lyrical, and the book reads almost like a song.  It was definitely a song to my heart.  I found myself crying and feeling as though my heart were being filled up with hope, peace and love as I read.My favorite thing about If You Feel Too Much is the way I felt when I finished reading it.  This book gave me hope for our generation, knowing that there are people in the world like Jamie made me feel like we just might be okay after all.  He has devoted his life to helping others, and bringing love and light to those who are suffering.  I believe that there is no higher calling, and this world is a better place because of Jamie's work.I highly recommend this beautiful book to anyone and everyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AV4N76H2IOVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6M8E8A#wasThisHelpful","R2AV4N76H2IOVM","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have recently started reading poetry, and Ugly People Beautiful Hearts is a great example of why everyone needs to read poetry.  This book was achingly beautiful.  The poems resonated with me, Marlen's words touching me deeply.  There were several poems that had me tearing up, and others that had me nodding my head as I read.Ugly People Beautiful Hearts is about love, loss, and living through it all.  As I read I felt a sort of ringing truth to Marlen's words, deep inside.  I absolutely loved ""In Here, I'll Wait.""

"A Rant of Ravens was a fun, light read.  I really enjoyed it!I was drawn to this book after I read about the setting: the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.  My family vacationed there every summer growing up, and reading A Rant of Ravens was like being back in the mountains again.  I loved that aspect of the story---the beautiful imagery was one of my favorite things about this book.I love a good stand-alone read and A Rant of Ravens is the perfect example of why stand-alone novels are so satisfying.  The story is complete!  No cliffhangers, no waiting to see what happens.  The action happened, the mystery got solved, and the characters moved on with their lives.A Rant of Ravens is a murder mystery, and it was written in a way that made it feel almost light hearted.  I love it when authors don't take their books too seriously, and Goff hit just the right note with this story.I was surprised by the ending and I loved that.  I also liked that this is a clean adult fiction novel.  A Rant of Ravens is a fast, fun read, and I'd definitely read Christine Goff again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R330BXIARZ69MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9X7YN4#wasThisHelpful","R330BXIARZ69MN","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love and Miss Communication was such a fun read.  I really enjoyed it from the first page to the last.  Evie is completely addicted to her phone.  She is constantly on Facebook, email, and other social media.  Evie is caught up with making her life online look perfect, when in reality, it's not.  It's all about image.  Until she stumbles upon some crushing news about an ex on Facebook.Evie decides to stop using the Internet for a year.  She learns a great deal about herself in the process, and finds a different kind of lifestyle than the one she had before.  Evie is able to focus on her passion, and what makes her happy, instead of being caught up in the frenetic pace of her former life.I loved the metamorphosis in Evie.  It was fascinating to watch her change and grow into a better person.  She had a few stumbles along the way, but always managed to pick herself back up again.The love story was super sweet and perfectly done.  I liked that Love and Miss Communication is an adult read, but a fairly clean one.  One of my favorite aspects of this book were the minor characters, particularly Evie's grandmother Bette.  She was so much fun!  And Bette's paramour, Sam, was a great addition to the story as well.Love and Miss Communication was a fun, light-hearted read.  It made me consider how important it is to put my phone down and interact with those around me.  I liked that the focus on connectedness was delivered in such an engaging and entertaining way.  I highly recommend Love and Miss Communication and will definitely read Elyssa Friedland again!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E6UFS7TYC39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062379844#wasThisHelpful","R25E6UFS7TYC39","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this charging station.  It's enabled me to consolidate cords, ac adaptors, and the messy, unsightly entanglement that was our current charging area in our kitchen.I really like that this charging station has an on/off switch.  When the weather gets bad, I can turn it off and protect any devices that are plugged in.I can see this charging station being used in a desktop charging center (the kind that look like mail organizers with shelves and drawers).The cord is bright white but the housing of the unit is a very slight pink.  This wasn't a problem for me but it is notable.There are only two downsides to this unit: the clamshell packaging (I would have loved frustration-free packaging for this one!) and the fact that the 6 ports are limited to 7.1 amp total.  So, if your devices are more than 2.1 amps each (as the latest iPhones and iPads are), you can't charge six devices at once.  The unit will flash red to alert you if you are exceeding the charging capacity.  I charged an iPhone 6 Plus, an iPhone 5, a Kindle, a powerbank, and an iPad 2 all at once.  With those five devices, I didn't overload the charging station.Overall, I really like this charging station.  I'd definitely recommend it.Disclaimer: I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PMTPQ68XSHXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SA0IV94#wasThisHelpful","R1PMTPQ68XSHXE","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this lantern.  It's sturdy and bright.  I'm not an outdoorsy person but I do love the idea of having this lantern on hand for power outages.  I can also see my family using this when my daughter's playing on the swing set outside in the winter when it gets dark early.This little lantern gives off a lot of light.  I like that it has an LED bulb.  There are rubber grips on the bottom and top of the device, making it more sturdy and less likely to break when dropped.  It also stays in place well because of the rubber grip on the bottom.There's one operating button and the lantern has three modes: lower light, brighter light, and flashing light (which is extremely bright and I assume is for emergency situations).  There is a tiny indicator light that flashes once every 30 seconds (bright green) which enables you to find your lantern in the dark.The only thing I didn't love about this item is that it requires three D batteries, which adds to the weight of the device.  If I were using it for hiking, and it was in my backpack, that would be a problem.  However, it's not too heavy to carry by the top handle for short distances.  Speaking of handles, there is the carrying handle and also a plastic hanging handle on the bottom.Overall, I really like this lantern.  AYL products are, in my opinion, reliable, good quality, and at a great price point.  I would definitely recommend this lantern.Disclaimer: I received a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSZC5GN48EMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPTKQ7M#wasThisHelpful","R1TSZC5GN48EMR","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There might be even more personal growth in this installment than in book one.  The book was packed full of tasteful romance as well.

She reflects on the fact that her mom knows how to do all kinds of things.  The little girl decides that her mom must have gone to Mom School, to learn how to be a great mom.Mom School is full of beautiful illustrations.  Priscilla Burris did a wonderful job with the pictures.  They were Kaitlyn's favorite aspect of the story.I loved the sweet and concise prose.  The story flowed well and easily.

"Use Your Words, Sophie is a fun book about a two year old mouse whose family welcomes a new sister.  The baby, whose name is yet to be determined, is not a welcome arrival for little Sophie.Sophie decides to start speaking in other languages when the baby comes, for example: Jellyfish language, Hyena, etc.  That brought some humor into the story, which made it fun.  Sophie's parents can't calm the new baby so Granny comes to visit.  Sophie finally uses her words (after being prompted to do so on nearly every page) and asks to hold the baby.Sophie determines the baby's name and that the reason why the baby was crying so much was that everyone was calling her by the wrong name.I liked that there were two main plot points to the story: determining the new baby's name, and Sophie's reaction to the addition of the baby to her family.  The way Wells reconciles Sophie to the new baby was perfect for this age group.I also really liked the layout of this book.  The pages are all laid out exactly the same: with the illustrations taking up the majority of each page and the text at the bottom.  I love not having to search along the page to find the text----it just makes reading aloud to Kaitlyn easier for me if my eyes stay at the same place in the book on every page (what can I say, I'm lazy like that!).Kaitlyn liked this book because it was about animals, and the illustrations reminded her of the Peter Rabbit series, which I think is a big compliment to Wells.  She also liked the colors----Use Your Words, Sophie is definitely a book for little girls.  In fact, the colors are perfect for spring and it would make a great addition to an Easter gift.We enjoyed this book and would definitely read Rosemary Wells again.4.5 stars Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBL31XQ5OCMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016632#wasThisHelpful","R2SBL31XQ5OCMJ","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Sugar Spun Sister, book one in the Sweet Dreams series.  Cricket's story was covered in book one, and Sundaes With Nora is of course, about Nora.  The last book in the trilogy will be Lindsay's story, and I am really looking forward to it.This series is written with a first person narrative, which I love in a contemporary fiction novel.  It just makes for a smoother read.  I love series where each installment features one character.  Each book always has a good amount of closure, and the characters star in all of the books in the series.  I love getting to see my favorite characters over and over again.Anna Garner excels again with Sundaes With Nora.  I liked it even more than Sugar Spun Sister.  I really felt for Nora, and understood her better than I did Cricket (even though I really liked Cricket, Nora was more my speed).  Nora leads what many would presume to be a charmed life.  She and her husband are wealthy---which sets her apart from Cricket and Lindsay, who struggle financially.  Nora's world is turned upside down, though, when her husband unexpectedly decides to divorce her, with no provocation at all.  He says that since Nora left her job in the financial district, she's changed: read, she's relaxed and become happy!  And he doesn't like the change in her.  I felt like it made him uncomfortable, but alas, I never found out exactly what Kenneth was thinking.  It was his folly to lose a good woman like Nora.I felt for Nora, and found myself wishing for her happiness throughout the story.  I hated the way Kenneth treated her and honestly wished him ill.  It would have been easy to be (book) jealous of all that Nora had.  After all, just reading about her wardrobe had me green with envy.  And to think that in cataloging their possessions for divorce, they had so many things of value that art dealers and historians had to come and appraise them all...I can't even imagine a life like that.  Yet, Nora is very down-to-earth, kind, and generous. She gives freely and is a loyal friend.  I loved how she gives so freely of her time, money, and love.  The way she makes what is probably the worst time of her life into a time of growth was inspiring.  She is a true friend, and helps those she loves without question or resentment.  I loved that about her.I also loved how Nora grows throughout the story.  She really changed a lot, and learned how to stand up for herself, especially with Kenneth.  I rejoiced at that!The Sweet Dreams series is a lot of fun, but it's also inspiring fiction.  I love that these are such clean adult reads.  I always finish Anna Garner's books in one sitting, and this one was no exception.  I really can't wait for the final installment, featuring Lindsay!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V0M4ZTKR64M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYBR2FC#wasThisHelpful","R2V0M4ZTKR64M3","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These earbuds are a lot of fun!  I was excited to use these.  I have found Filltech's products to be consistently durable and a good value for the price.I charged the earbuds and then plugged them into my laptop.  I listened to both music and a motivational video.  It was neat to watch the headphones light up in time with the cadence of either the music or the voices.  They emit a pretty bright light which I could still see even with the lights still turned on in my kitchen.  When I turned the overhead lights off, the  headphones really shined brightly and got my daughter's attention (she now wants them for herself).There were a few things I didn't love about these headphones.  I didn't like that the buttons take some force to press down.  I felt like the earbuds would fall out easily during exercise (luckily Filltech includes three sizes of ear pieces to get a good fit).  I also found that the cord itself is thick and kind of stiff.  I think it just needs to loosen up over time.Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.  These earbuds are fun and would make a great gift for a child, tween, or teen.  I think they would be fun to use while exercising outside in the dark, at a party, and at night (you'd always be able to find them as they are bright).Disclaimer: I received a complimentary pair of these earbuds in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JNMOKN7VG0EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UM9YY8I#wasThisHelpful","R3JNMOKN7VG0EW","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Afraid of Everything was such a neat book.  I really enjoyed it.  The premise is very intriguing and unique, especially for Christian fiction.  It's one of those stories that stands out in the genre, and one I know I'll never forget.The book started out a little slowly.  I wasn't sure about Helena or how engaging her story would be.  Then, the story took off and I fell in love with the characters and the story line.Helena is literally afraid of everything.  She's spent her entire life anxious, afraid, and unsure of herself.  Helena has built up a protective wall around her heart and guards it at all costs.  This leaves her very alone, and even more afraid when her fears start to come true (the thinking of believing something will happen can cause it to actually happen is the case with Helena's life).  But then, Helena is involved in a car accident, and that's when her story really changed.  Suddenly, the narrative changed from first person (Helena's voice) to a third person narrative.  This change really threw me off at first, until I realized that Jones changed narratives to fully portray the events that occur in Helena's Great Sleep.And speaking of the Great Sleep, this was such an interesting part of the story.  Helena calls her coma the Great Sleep, and in it, she travels to mystical worlds, sometimes alone and sometimes populated by other people---some of whom she knows.  And they all seem to know her.  She's not sure if she's in Heaven or not, but she loves it there.  Helena's Great Sleep was my favorite aspect of Afraid of Everything.

"I first got to know Russel Middlebrook in The Elephant of Surprise.  Russel was in high school back then, and I loved his optimistic and unique voice.  Hartinger has created such a unique and likable character in Russel, and the reader can't help but root for Russel's happiness.I was excited to check back in with Russel as a young adult.  Russel's fresh out of college and living in Seattle with two of his best friends from high school.  Russel feels out of place in the world, noticing that everyone around him either has what he calls Career Ambition or either Passionate Aimlessness.  Russel has a little bit of both, but mostly he's just working two jobs and trying to figure out what he's going to do with his life.The plot takes a fun and unexpected twist when Russel saves a woman from drowning while working at his low-paying lifeguard job.  The woman befriends him, and he learns a lot from her---Vernie was a screenwriter in Hollywood during a time when women weren't accepted in the industry.  Vernie was a great addition to the cast of characters and added a lot of depth and humor to the story.For me, the story really got exciting when Kevin, Russel's love from high school, comes back into the picture.  I confess that I was secretly rooting for Kevin and Russel to get back together---they were so perfect for each other back in high school.The Thing I Didn't Know I Didn't Know was such a great read.  Russel's narrative voice is engaging and unflinchingly honest.  You can't help but love him.  Hartinger's character development is excellent, and I finished the book smiling and glad I'd read it.  I recommend this book and will definitely read Brent Hartinger again.4.5 stars; I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6QRB5R93L2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKQZJQA#wasThisHelpful","R3M6QRB5R93L2L","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a fun read!  Kaitlyn, my 3 year old, saw it on the counter and wanted to read it right away.  She loved that the crayon on the cover is crossed out and that premise really intrigued her.Kaitlyn loved the cover and immediately interpreted the crossed out crayon to mean that she needed to color in the book.  Usually, this would give me so much stress: to have her 'ruin' a book by coloring in it.  But, I've been practicing letting go lately, and I was happy that the cover inspired her and excited her enough to engage with the book.  Plus she colored only on the inside title page, so that made it a little better (for me).The story was engaging and simple enough for Kaitlyn to follow: Amy is having things go wrong in her life and they all have to do with the color red.  Amy wishes to never see red again, but then realizes that she's missing out on things when her wish comes true.The hand-drawn illustrations are such a nice touch, and I like that they make this book unique.  The story was fun to read and Kaitlyn liked it so much that she requested I read No More Red again right away, which is rare for her.  I liked that this book is fun but also has a subtle message.We've read and enjoyed Bonnie Ferrante's books before and look forward to her next story!*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIZFXZ9R2BA8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1928064159#wasThisHelpful","RIZFXZ9R2BA8O","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Theresa Rizzo's Just Destiny  and was really excited to get to know Jenny and Gabe before the events of Just Destiny took place.As is the case with all prequels, it was odd to read this book, knowing what would happened to Jenny and Gabe in Just Destiny.  It was almost like having a premonition of something bad happening the whole time I was reading.  This feeling kept me from really investing myself in the story, since I knew sad times were on their way for Jenny and Gabe.  My only regret about Just Beginning is that I wish I'd read it before Just Destiny.With that said, I did really enjoy Just Beginning.  I love Rizzo's writing style: she draws me in and I can't put her books down.  Her premises are so believable and realistic that I feel like the things that happen to her characters could easily happen to me.  This feeling allows me to put myself in the characters' shoes and really get drawn into the story.I loved getting to know Steve, Jenny and Gabe's neighbor and great friend, even better in this book.  He's one of the main characters in book two, and I loved knowing his history and back story.  It made me like him even more.Just Beginning is a great read.  I highly recommend these books, and can't wait to read Theresa Rizzo's next book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S7BBZZGJSOYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7ZKHYG#wasThisHelpful","R1S7BBZZGJSOYH","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have you ever been dumped by a friend?  Maybe you never found out why.  Maybe you knew why...but she wouldn't return your calls or let you apologize.  Maybe she just vanished.  All of these examples of real-life situations are explored in Dumped.I was excited to read this book because, quite frankly, I have been dumped by a friend and that hurts.  I think all women at some point in their life, have lost friendships without knowing exactly why.  We'll never be inside someone else's head, or know what makes them tick, which makes their behavior difficult to figure out, to say the least.  Especially when it comes to female relationships.I found Dumped to be such a relevant book for today's times.  Women of any age can relate to these stories: from being unfriended in grade school, high school, college and beyond.  It seems to me that the older I get, the more it hurts to lose a friend, and this theme was echoed in the stories I read.The stories are all written by different authors---which gives the book a very fresh feel.  Since the narrative changes with each chapter, and the circumstances change as well, it keeps the book feeling new with each new essay.Dumped: Women Unfriending Women is a heartfelt, relevant read, and I would definitely recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23X8YZ07WOYTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SUUFSMM#wasThisHelpful","R23X8YZ07WOYTI","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved everything about The Winner's Curse and have been anxiously awaiting the release of its sequel.  I felt like The Winner's Curse ended on a cliffhanger---the story just sort of stopped, and I was dying to know what would happen next.I often re-read novels before reading their sequels, and I so wish I would have taken the time to do that with this series.  Rutkoski's world is so complex, so richly layered with so many characters, that I found myself a little lost from time to time.  I wished I would have read the two books back to back so that I could have enjoyed The Winner's Crime even more.With that said, I did love this book.  Rutkoski's writing style is unique: it's got a weighted depth to it that makes each sentence, each word, even, important to the story.  There is no fluff to her writing, no extraneous scenes.  Each paragraph serves to further the plot, and what an intense plot it was!  I found myself on pins and needles many times reading The Winner's Crime.  The stakes were so high for Kestrel and Arin---and it made for such a thrilling read.Everything is a game in Kestrel's world...her life is full of subtle machinations and she never knows who to trust.  It's like she's a chess piece and the emperor is moving her, and the other characters, around, all to his benefit.  Kestrel and Arin are constantly trying to figure things out, and sometimes their realizations about what is true come too late.I read this book during a busy, stressful week and therefore couldn't read it in one sitting as I would have liked to.  So, I found myself having to sort of catch up on things every time I sat down to read.  What I'm trying to say is that I had to work at reading The Winner's Crime, not because it's a hard read, but just because there is so much going on in the plot.  I highly recommend reading it when you have time to sit and read it through over a weekend, because you'll enjoy it more that way.  I really love this series, and cannot wait for book three!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WXABG5EFS9VF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MLNBJTA#wasThisHelpful","R1WXABG5EFS9VF","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have liked this series and was so thrilled to have this novella as an epilogue of sorts for Allyson and Willem. My main complaints about the first two books in the series have been with the endings.  Just One Day (read my review here) ended on such a cliffhanger, and Just One Year (read my review here) ended at the same point in time that Just One Day did.  I was not happy about that----I was expecting more of the happily ever after, not just the journey there.I am so happy to say that Forman completely and utterly redeemed her blunders with the endings of books one and two with Just One Night.  NOW I feel like this series is finished.  Now I feel like I can move on with my life.  Now that I know Allyson and Willem are happy, I can go back and appreciate the first two books for the great pieces of writing that they are.Just One Night is the perfect conclusion to Allyson and Willem's story.  It was just long enough to satisfy my every desire for their relationship---declarations and plans for the future were made---yay!  I loved seeing them together at last and really reveling in each other.Just One Night has a finality to it that really pulls the books in the series together.  I so wish I'd read the three books back to back because I think I would have enjoyed the first two books so much more that way.  There's not anything I would have wanted to change about this book and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AFT2397NWYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJXV3OQ#wasThisHelpful","R14AFT2397NWYK","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh wow!  I absolutely loved Seeker!  I can't think of one single thing I'd change about this book.  Everything was so well-done and I loved every aspect of this engaging story.Every time I think I'm through with fantasy novels, I read one like Seeker that renews my faith in the genre.  Seeker is everything I love about YA fantasy: a strong heroine, a well-developed cast of characters, a unique premise, and a fast-paced plot.  Not to mention an ending that left me aching for more.Seeker is full of action from the very first page.  The story moves fast, and there was not a dull moment to be had.  Seeker was one of those ""ignore my family"" books.  I couldn't get enough of the story, and when it ended, I was sad. I wanted to stay in the world Dayton has created with Seeker.Seeker has a fantasy premise, yet it is set in our world.  This is my favorite kind of fantasy to read: there are no rules of a high fantasy world to remember.  And the thought of paranormal events happening as the rest of the world is unaware makes these books very plausible to me.I am usually one for a first person narrative, so I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the alternating perspectives in Seeker.  Each chapter is narrated by a different character, with the main characters Quin, John, Shinobu, and Maud.  I really fell in love with these characters and found myself quite invested in their stories.I love it when books encompass a long period of time, and Seeker takes place over a period of eighteen months.  Of course, the plot skipped ahead a few months at a time, otherwise this novel would have been huge.  I loved that the arc of the story took place over such a long period of time, because it allowed for so much character growth and plot development.The ending was just right for this story: a good amount of closure, yet open enough that I was left wanting more.  I so wish I had book two right now, but I'm willing to wait for another book as good as Seeker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QD5YIDEETCO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSRW7IQ#wasThisHelpful","R1QD5YIDEETCO9","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy the Beautiful Fates series, and was excited to read the latest installment.  It's been over a year since I read the first two books in the series, so I had a little bit of catching up to do regarding the plot and characters.  But the biggest issue I had was reorienting myself to Mann's writing style.  She tends to mix past and present tense and that sometimes slows down the flow for me.  Once I readjusted, I really enjoyed A Promised Fate.Ari and Ava are deeply in love, and their love story could be described as too sweet.  Some of their declarations to each other felt saccharine to me.  Until....they started fighting.  I'm not usually a fan of arguments, but in this case it made Ari and Ava's relationship feel realistic.I liked that Ari is the narrator in A Promised Fate.  He's always been a somewhat elusive character, and I liked getting to know him better.  This is a fairly long book, but there was a lot of depth to the plot, which kept every page interesting.  The minor characters and their stories are one of my favorite things about this series.  I love how well Mann has developed them.Like its predecessors, there's a major twist at the end of A Promised Fate.  I couldn't believe it was happening as I read it!  I had predicted part of the twist but was shocked at the duplicity of some of the people in Ari's life.Needless to say, now I'm really looking forward to the next book in this series.  If you like contemporary fiction with a paranormal twist, I recommend the Beautiful Fate series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAMMG7O86WYRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R561NZS#wasThisHelpful","RAMMG7O86WYRO","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first experience drinking flowering tea, and it was really fun and delicious.  I used these teas with Tea Beyond's teapot which has a butterfly on top of it.  You have to use a strainer with these teas because they are loose.Each tea came in a sturdy zip-top package, so that you could use a little at a time and save the rest for later.  There were specific instructions for use, which I appreciated, being new to this type of tea drinking.The flowering teas were my favorite flavors, although all of the teas were tasty and I could tell they were high quality.  In my opinion, these teas are for aficionados, given their variety, quality, and flavor.My favorite aspect of sampling these teas was watching the little buds open up with the flowering teas.  It was beautiful, fun, and made my tea-of-the day very special.

"I love drinking tea and was excited to receive this teapot in exchange for my honest opinion.  I usually drink tea bags, so loose-leaf tea was a new venture for me.My first impression upon receiving this package was that the item was packaged very securely.  It's such a pretty teapot!  It's the perfect size for serving two to four people.  The butterfly on top is a beautiful touch, but my favorite design aspect are the wave dots symbolizing water.  They give the teapot an extra special look.  I was worried that the glass handle would be slippery, but it's not.For such a delicate item, this teapot is very easy to clean.  I love that it's dishwasher safe.  I also love that it's glass so I can watch the strength of my tea as it brews.This teapot would make a wonderful gift, especially as a hostess or wedding gift.

"I am really loving this series!  The Unseemly Education of Anne Merchant, book one in the V Trilogy, was so unique and captivating.  I was so excited to continue Anne's story in The Wicked Awakening of Anne Merchant.  I was expecting another compelling and intense read, and Wiebe did not disappoint.  The Wicked Awakening of Anne Merchant was even better than its predecessor.I liked Anne right from the start in book one, and I liked her even more in this installment.  She's strong, loyal and clever.  Her prosperitus thema, or PT---the unique talent each student possesses that guides their behavior in the race for the Big V---is to look closer.  Therefore, Anne takes nothing at face value and is quite tenacious about always trying to get to the truth.  I admired that about Anne, as well as the fact that she doesn't scare easily.Anne is a gifted artist, and there was an extra emphasis on her art in this book.  I enjoyed her creative process, especially with regards to how she paints the portrait of the school's headmaster.  I was impressed at the way Wiebe gave that particular painting had such an important role in the plot.The premise of this series is so unique.  I'm not going to tell you what it is, because it'll spoil book one for you, if you haven't read it yet.  But suffice it to say, it's imaginative and really fun to read a story this different from others in the genre.Wiebe's pacing was perfect.  The book moved quickly, but not so fast that I felt like I was racing to keep up.  I had a very difficult time putting this story down once I started reading.  It was good from beginning to end, with no slow spots.The Wicked Awakening of Anne Merchant is a compelling read.

"Bridge to Destiny was such a compelling and emotional story.  I loved it from the first page to the last.Avery and her husband Mitchel are deeply in love.  They have a four year-old daughter, Hannah, who completes their family.  The story starts with Avery getting ready for her husband's annual work Christmas party.  Within just a few pages, I could feel the love between the family members.  And that deep love made what happens next all the more difficult to read.  Avery and Mitchel are in a car accident, and Mitchel doesn't survive (I'm not spoiling the story---this is in the summary!).Avery is left to pick up the pieces of her heart and her family.  She has to pull herself together for Hannah's sake, and just as she starts to adjust to life without Mitchel, another tragedy occurs.  This time, Hannah is hurt.  Avery's world spins out of control as she faces losing her precious daughter.  As a wife and mother, Bridge to Destiny hit really close to home for me.  I too, have one child, a daughter who's almost four.  The thought of what happens to Avery happening to me was sobering to say the least.  So, it was with bated breath that I read Avery's story, desperately hoping for a good outcome for her.Besides identifying with Avery because of our common circumstances in life, I truly liked her.  She was full of spunk, strength, and wit.  I loved her quick comebacks, her loyalty, and her open, honest disposition.Despite Avery losing Mitchel, there is a love story in Bridge to Destiny.  In fact, the crux of the book is the question of if Avery can let herself love another man again.  I was on pins and needles waiting to find out the answer to that question.  One thing I will say, though, was that I really liked the slow build to the relationship between Avery and Nathan.April Marie Libs portrayed life with a small child perfectly.  It's a pet peeve of mine when authors write a character's family life as saccharine-sweet.  Hannah threw tantrums, got mad, and acted just like a kid should.  I loved that that part of the story was true to real life.I was so pleased with how Bridge to Destiny ended.  It was an emotional ending, and so fitting for the story.  I really loved this book and look forward to reading more from April Marie Libs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WS58R7VSN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PHVZZ9I#wasThisHelpful","R3WS58R7VSN7","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the premise of Since You've Been Gone.  I think that Payne had a lot of potential to make this a really great story.  And it was a good read, but I think it could have been better as a longer novel.I liked Edie from the start, and felt so much sympathy for her and her mother's struggles.  They are constantly on the run from Edie's abusive father, and Edie keeps having to change schools as they keep moving.  The story is told from Edie's perspective, and I liked that I got to really know her through her thoughts and memories.What I didn't like about Since You've Been Gone was that the story felt choppy and rushed.  I think that there were several plot points that could have been fleshed out to make for a longer, more intensive look into Edie's life.  As it was, I felt like I got only a glimpse of Edie, and would have liked to know her better.  Lastly, the conflict resolution was rushed and I would have loved an epilogue to really see Edie happy and settled after the big conflict was over.Overall, I did enjoy Since You've Been Gone and would recommend it.

"4.5 starsTo My Hero was an emotional, powerful book that I really enjoyed.  Carly is a high school student in an abusive relationship.  She is the victim of an assault, and no one in her life will support her.  Her parents don't believe her side of the story, her friends take the attacker's side, and she's all alone.  Except for Ryan.  Ryan has liked Carly for forever---unbeknownst to Carly---and she's liked him too.  Ryan is Carly's rock as she recovers from her attack, and their friendship is her saving grace as her world falls apart around her.I can't believe I'm admitting this publicly, but I didn't read the entire title before starting this book.  Or, if I did, I forgot.  Usually, that wouldn't be a big deal, but it was in this case.  The part of the title that says ""A Blog of Our Journey Together"" is instrumental to the story.  I didn't actually grasp that the entire book is written as a blog post until the end of the story.  And then, the writing style----Carly is writing to Ryan, recounting events----made perfect sense.  Until that point, I was a little put off by the unusual writing style.  And so I'm telling you so you'll be prepared if you read this book---which I hope you do, because it was great!The premise of To My Hero is a powerful one.  I liked that Sibarium treated Carly's attack with the proper gravity and depth.  I also liked that Carly behaved somewhat irrationally after her attack: not taking Ryan's advice about going to the hospital or police.  I wanted her to act differently, but I felt like she was acting realistically and that made the book feel even more authentic.  The ending came as a shock but was perfect for this story.To My Hero is an emotional and deep story.  I really loved it, and look forward to reading more from Danielle Sibarium.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12F3AMKSY9PSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIBUJBE#wasThisHelpful","R12F3AMKSY9PSN","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great flashlight.  I like it for several reasons:1.  It's easy to get the batteries in.  Sometimes, flashlights have that tension compartment at the end that makes it really hard to get the batteries in.  I did have to exert a little pressure to get the cap at the bottom of the flashlight back on, after inserting the three AAA batteries, but not so much that it bothered me (I have arthritis in my hands).2.  It's BRIGHT!  Man, this thing is bright.  I've never had a LED flashlight before and there's a big difference.  I love the clear white light.  There are three light options: 1---front and top LED light.  I really like that the light goes around the head of the flashlight as well as the traditional beam light.  It's a neat addition.  2---the LED lights along the barrel of the flashlight light up with white light.  3---the LED lights along the barrel light up with blinking red lights.  I would have liked a fourth option: to have options 1 and 2 combined.  But, that's a small complaint.3.  The weight.  Many flashlights are heavy and I'm always afraid of dropping them on my toe and hurting myself.  This flashlight is pretty lightweight, and I like that.  With the size of it, it has the potential to be pretty heavy, so I appreciated the lightweight design.4.  The size.  This flashlight is a good medium size.  It's not a mini-flashlight that would fit easily in a pocket, but it would fit in a purse or bag.  It would also fit in the glove compartment of a car---which is where I plan to keep mine.5.  The price.  In my experience, AYL products are very well-priced alternatives to brand-name products.  I have yet to notice a quality difference in the AYL products I've reviewed.I like this flashlight and would definitely buy another one, if I had need of an extra.Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

"I bought Glo-Bo to go with my 3 year old's collection of Doc McStuffins' patients.  I liked the low price---he was cheaper than the other friends---and thought he would be a good addition to my little girl's collection, weird-looking though he is.

"This frame is really pretty.  It's not my favorite Stonebriar frame, but I do like it.  I bought it for my SIL as a gift, and she liked it too.What kept me from giving it five stars is the fact that the ""Believe"" at the bottom is not very clear or distinctive.  In fact, my SIL didn't even notice it at first.

"A Beauty So Rare was one of those books that I simply couldn't put down.  I loved it from the first page to the last, and didn't want it to end.Eleanor was immediately likable, and so easy for me to relate to.  I really felt for her in her struggle to become her own woman and not depend on a man to survive.  Eleanor is honest, hardworking and dependable.  She is considered an old maid at age 29, and has reconciled herself to the fact that she'll never marry.  However, Eleanor's great dream is to own a restaurant and she does everything in her power to make that dream a reality.Marcus was an enigma from the start.  I liked him too, but Eleanor was my favorite.  I liked the air of mystery surrounding Marcus, and the tension between he and Eleanor was palpable.  I wanted them to fall in love so badly!Alexander's books are Christian fiction, however the Christian element is handled with a light hand.  By that I mean that they aren't in-your-face Christian and if someone were not a fan of faith-based reads, I don't think that would stop them from enjoying these novels.  I think of Alexander's novels as clean historical romance.  I love how she conveys emotion and feelings between characters without going into the physical side of a relationship.  She does it perfectly, without feeling too sweet, yet the feelings are so raw they are palpable.I loved everything about A Beauty So Rare and immediately bought another one of Alexander's books upon finishing it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FBYVUL67V03K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWA69PU#wasThisHelpful","R1FBYVUL67V03K","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've loved every book in the 2B Trilogy, and The Shape of My Heart was the perfect ending to this steamy series.I didn't expect to like Courtney as much as I did.  She was so honest, so real, that I was drawn to her.  I loved her outlook on life, ""take me as I am.""  Courtney knows who she is and isn't ashamed of it.In that respect, I was surprised at how much I grew to love Max.  I thought I knew who he was from the previous books.  Imagine my surprise when he was totally different from the 'surface' Max I was introduced to in books one and two.Ann Aguirre has written this series so well.  The books feel fresh, the pace moves quickly, and the romance is so well-written.  I love the love stories and the conclusions are good but not saccharine.

"Chasers of the Light is a beautiful book, in every sense of the word.  The cover is simple, yet eye-catching and gorgeous.  The pages are thick and glossy, perfectly suited for showcasing Gregson's photographs and poems.I love the fact that Gregson writes on a typewriter---he can't go back and change his words like he could if he wrote on a computer.  This stream-of-consciousness style of writing makes for very expressive poetry.  The poems are meaningful and striking.  Many are written simply, yet this doesn't decrease their impact.Chasers of the Light is the type of book to be enjoyed a little bit at a time.  I found myself picking it up here and there to read a few poems, as many as I had time for.  Some of the poems are quite sensual, and I found myself blushing more than once.I love the photographs and the way the poems are displayed on each page.  It makes the entire book feel like a work of art.

"I love historical fiction, but have never read a novel set in Tuscany, so I was really excited for The Towers of Tuscany.  I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this book!Sofia is an artist who paints for her father's shop.  Female artists were not accepted during the 1300s, so she has to paint in secret and her work is sold as her father's.  Sofia's father is also a gifted artist, called a maestro, and he is the one who taught her to paint.  Sofia spends almost all of her time painting, and her creative process was described in exacting detail.  I loved learning how artists painted in the 1300s.  It was fascinating to me, and the fact that their panels and frescoes took so long to create made them all the more meaningful.  Sofia was responsible for each and every step it took to create a panel, starting from preparing the wood, to creating the pigments and colors.  The focus on her creative energy was one of my favorite aspects of The Towers of Tuscany.Cram infuses The Towers of Tuscany with the most beautiful imagery.  Reading this book was like visiting a museum to me.  I learned so much about Tuscany and the time period Sofia lived in.  The way Cram describes the cities Sofia lives in, and the world around her was so well done.The Towers of Tuscany is told in a third person narrative, which usually isn't my favorite style of storytelling, but it worked for this book.  There are flashbacks to Sofia's childhood throughout the story, and in these flashbacks the reader gets to know Sofia better.  I understood Sofia's motivation for her actions as a result of the flashbacks to her childhood with her widowed father.My only complaint about this book was the slow start.  The story took a while to really take off, at least for me.  However, once I got about one-third into the book, I was completely hooked and ended up finishing the book as fast as I could read it.  I just couldn't put the book down!There is a very intense romance in The Towers of Tuscany, one that was adult in nature but tastefully written.  I admit that the love story didn't have the outcome I initially hoped for, yet upon further reflection, the resolution of Sofia's love life was perfectly suited to the feel of the novel.  If Cram had ended it any other way, the ending would have felt false.  I admire Cram for the way she concluded her story.  There was an epilogue as well, which I loved (who doesn't love a good epilogue?).I really loved The Towers of Tuscany and would recommend it to fans of historical fiction.4.5 stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMOIGOMKXDMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477827218#wasThisHelpful","R1WMOIGOMKXDMU","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed Etiquette and Espionage and I started Curtsies and Conspiracies soon after finishing book one.  Curtsies and Conspiracies was an even better read than its predecessor!I love the world Carriger has created with this series.  It's the same premise as her Parasol Protectorate series, just with the addition of the finishing school.  This series is, of course, YA, and so it has a younger, fresher feel to it.Sophronia is a fun main character.  She's got more personality, at least to me, than Alexia from the Parasol Protectorate series.  But, she and Alexia do share qualities of pragmatism, wit, and fearlessness.  In addition, they are both highly observant and quick to take action.  I enjoyed seeing Sophronia flourish at school, and seeing her really own her education as an intelligencer.One of my favorite things about Etiquette and Espionage was the character crossover between this series and the Parasol Protectorate.  There were several cameos from characters I already knew in this book, and I loved that.  Curtsies and Conspiracies also had more action than book one.  The pace was quicker and there weren't any lulls in the plot.I really enjoyed Curtsies and Conspiracies.  It's light-hearted, unique, funny and just plain fun to read.  I'm really loving this series, and can't wait for book three!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W9E3EN54VZ6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316190209#wasThisHelpful","R1W9E3EN54VZ6K","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked Your Life Isn't For You from the very first paragraph, and that feeling continued for the entire book.  This book was moving and very inspirational.Smith writes with a conversational style, one that's both easy and fun to read.  He starts off the book with some background on the ""isn't for you"" concept.  He wrote a blog post, titled ""Your Marriage Isn't For You,"" in November 2013.  That post ended up going viral.  In his post  he talks about how his father gave him some life-changing advice.  Seth was getting ready to marry his long-time friend and love, Kim, and was questioning if he was making the right choice.  His dad told him that ""you don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy."" (quote taken from Seth's blog post).  This sage advice resonated with people as it spread around the internet; as of spring 2014, his post has had over 30 million hits.  Take a moment to read it, if you haven't already.  It's great advice for anyone, regardless if you're married or not.Seth expounds on the advice he received from his father in Your Life Isn't For You.  Not only is marriage not about you, but your very life isn't about you either.  It's about your family, the people who love you, your friends, and the people you are put here to serve.  Seth learns this lesson the hard way, and shares his knowledge with the reader in an accessible, relatable way.There are many personal revelations in this book, which served for me to understand Seth better.  But, the fact that he was so open about his past and his struggle with depression and attempted suicide made me really sit up and pay attention to what he had to say.  I too, struggle with depression, and while I've never been suicidal, I certainly understand what it feels like to be depressed and hopeless.  Seth's journey from attempted suicide to happiness was inspiring.  He shares the words of wisdom, advice, and thoughts that helped him along the way.Seth could have easily made Your Life Isn't For You into a 'preachy' type of book.  Instead, he imbues his book with sarcasm and self-deprecating humor.  This humor is evident in his footnotes, which really made me love the book even more.  The footnotes are what made me smile through some of the sad parts of the story, and kept the book feeling light in spite of the heavy subject matter.Seth starts each chapter with a quote----I absolutely love it when authors do this.  The quotes set the tone for the chapters and bestow an air of gravitas to the book.  Your Life Isn't For You is a moving read---I found myself tearing up more than once while reading.I really loved Your Life Isn't For You.  I found it to be surprisingly inspiring and moving for such a fast read.  I finished the book glad that I read it and motivated to make some changes in my own life.  And really, what more can you ask for from a nonfiction book: than to be galvanized to change?","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EURL3JS41O6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626560951#wasThisHelpful","R3EURL3JS41O6Q","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed Gig Wailgum's first Santa Clops book, titled A Visit From Santa Clops.  I loved the story for Wailgum's fresh take on the Santa Claus theme.Santa Clops is a Cyclops who delivers coal to children on the naughty list.  He lives in a cave along with some interesting dino-penguin birds--- the alternative to reindeer to pull Clops' sleigh.The Cave of Santa Clops was just as much fun as its predecessor.  In it, the kids from book one learn the story of Santa Clops from their neighbor, Mr. Bones.  After reading A Visit From Santa Clops, the kids ask their mother if Santa Clops really exists.  She tells them to ask Mr. Bones because he knows the truth.  I love that Wailgum referenced book one in this book.  It was clever and it make me smile.  It's this kind of inventiveness that makes these books so enjoyable for me.The bulk of the book is Mr. Bones' retelling of his years-ago encounter with Santa Clops.  The story was exciting, and had a lot of action compared to book one.  I felt like this book was geared towards a slightly older audience due to the adventure aspect.Wailgum illustrates his own books---I love that.  There are few children's book authors who write and illustrate their own books and I love it when authors do both.  It just makes the book better, in an intangible way.The only caveat to The Cave of Santa Clops is that it might be a little scary for younger children, or sensitive children.  My 3 year old is really sensitive and already scared of Santa Claus, so I didn't read this one to her.  I was afraid that the illustrations of Santa Clops would scare her.  I think this series would be perfect for ages 4-5 and up.The Cave of Santa Clops is a fun, inventive read.  Wailgum provides a unique alternative to Santa Claus, along with an entertaining story.  I recommend this book and will add it to our Christmas book collection.  I expect that by next Christmas, my daughter will be ready for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8GX5W6IUS2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1502365901#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8GX5W6IUS2Q","A11L3YX5WIDKJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11L3YX5WIDKJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jill Smokler's website, Scary Mommy, is one of my all-time favorite sites.  The articles, the anonymous confessions, the community with like-minded parents, all of these elements combine to make a site that I visit at least once a day.  Jill hosts guest bloggers regularly and usually has a new article every day.  I love that!I bought this book because I knew it would be a fun read, but I also wanted to support Scary Mommy Nation's Thanksgiving Project.  Every year on Scary Mommy, families in need are provided with gift cards to grocery stores so that they can have Thanksgiving dinner.  Isn't that awesome?  Jill keeps Scary Mommy fun, but also helps people---not just at Thanksgiving---and I love that about her and her site.I really enjoyed Scary Mommy's Guide to Surviving the Holidays.  It was a light-hearted, fast read, and I found myself smiling and laughing as I read.  This book consists of essays by different contributing authors (many of whom I regularly follow on their own blogs) and also recipes for holiday food.  Even the recipes were funny, as each contributor put their own spin on the instructions or the description of the food.  Not to mention, some of the recipes were quite mouthwatering just to read about!The group of authors and the varied content kept this book feeling fresh and new the whole way through.  I never got bored and found myself loving the change in ""voice"" with each essay.  The perspectives from other moms, who get just as stressed during the holidays as I do, were comforting for me.  I often feel like I'm the only one who gets so overwhelmed by the get-togethers, the gifts, the busy-ness of the holidays. It was nice to read that other women, women whose writing I know and respect, feel the same way.Scary Mommy's Guide to Surviving the Holidays was a light-hearted, fast, and fun read.

"This product is the second one I have purchsed for my Chevy trucks.  I guess that will tell you a lot about TruXport covers.This is so easy to setup and install, and they are right there to help you by phone..... if you need any that is.  Nice people!The first one I owned I had for almost 3 years and it did very well and still looked good after that time.  That one was for the 6.6 ft bed and this one is for the 5.8ft. bed Chevy.  The one thing I do recommend is that may wish to buy with your cover some of the manufacturer's special Protectant Spray for it.  The soft vinyl cover is not good with all types of supposedly ""protectors"" like Armoral or such like that.  Many ""protectors"" build up on the surface, are hard to remove and clean: they don't look to good after a while..... not sure otherwise which to buy.  I just tried out McGuire's Vinyl Protectant Spray today and it looks very good, but it also brand new too.  Why use it?  Not just for the protection and new look, which is a great thing too.... but to sort of seal up the leatherette creases and irregular surface that the vinyl has in it's surface.  Without some sort of sealant the dust and wet dirt tend to be very hard to clean out of those fine ridges and dimples.  It does look very good, and for the price..... this one is hard to beat.  The latching system is simple and almost fool proof.  Nothing with humans if really fool proof, right?Buy with confidence and enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BEEBPVWTQIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NLZ2OK#wasThisHelpful","R20BEEBPVWTQIV","A11KQADBYE0UZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11KQADBYE0UZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice ""concentrated"" type of compact welder..... that is a good thing for most folks.  It is not a light weight unit with little going on inside of it.The one question that I personally wondered about was if the dual voltage would be worth the extra money over just buying the lighter single voltage unit.  Now that I am using it, I think that I will indeed get some use out of the convenience of the 120VAC input.  But do be aware, and know,  that when using the 120VAC input you will NOT be able to do any heavier welding or aluminum welding unless it is paper thin materials.  Aluminum sucks all the heat away so fast that much higher currents and voltages are required than with steel.  I put it up on voltage levels 6 & 7 and ran two beads of about 1.5 inches long at 30% wire feed speed..... it tripped a 20 amp single pole Square D breaker immediately.  Biut, that is exactly what one should expect to happen, right?  Also, Square D is one of the best made and most sensitive breakers on the market so if you have an old GE panel or a Cuttler you may get away with more.  (Just a not from a Journeyman Electrician for over 30 years now:  the breaker protects the wiring within your walls.... prevents fires, so if it trips there is a reason and do not merely reset and go on.  These are thermally triggered so need time to cool down or a wiring fire might result.)This machine has some great engineering in merely the packaging, let alone the rest of the machine!  It is well packed and should get to you without any problem.  The assembly of it is easier than many and should present ZERO trouble for anyone..... the instructions are excellent.... but what else would one expect from a USA made machine??  To say it is ""Made in USA"" at least the majority of the unit must be assembled from USA made parts as well as labor - I was glad to buy USA and support my fellow workers.This machine has a novel way of swapping the wire drive wheels too!  Just push it in, turn 90* and slip it out, turn it over and slip it back in and it is ready to go:  no screws or tools needed at all.  The stinger is quite good for the size and price of the machine..... oh yeh, like some commented, the trigger is pretty easily tripped, but most of us do not use the big heavy leather guanlets with a buz box because they are not as hot and do not present such problems to require such heavy gloves.  I just used some good medium duty leather gloves and the switch was ZERO problems at all.... at least it was zero for me.Would I buy this again?  Yes I would, and I think that if you want a slightly larger/heavier unit with greater capacity than the smaller units, this might be just what you are looking for.  Hobart has a very good warrantee, and that too is a bonus.  Buy with confidence.

"Well, these are ""okay"" mats..... that is about all one can say about them.  They are very low pile cheapo mats(I have seen worse), but about the same value I guess as I saw at WallMart Auto.  A bit better made, lower price, or such like would have reaised them to 4 stars.  If you are looking for something to hold a bit of grit, keep it on the mat, and not slipping onto the vehicle carpet.... this is not it.  Low flat pile will hold nothing.If you are looking for a great product at a great price, this isn't it.  I had hoped for a much better set of mats after reading the description, but that is the risk of buying over the web..... you often do very well, and other times not quite so much.If you have ever bought real quality mats when buying a new car.... you probably paid about twice the price of these.  So,..... it is a solid 3 stars, is not badly/poorly  made, but offers nothing special, and not too bad.  It is a good minimalist floor mat set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8D59JQTXRVBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJPLPIM#wasThisHelpful","R8D59JQTXRVBP","A11KQADBYE0UZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11KQADBYE0UZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received them today and think that they look well made and will work great.  They do lack some of the finese' of some of the MUCH more expensive brands, but that does not make them any less of a quality or valuable tool..... it merely saves you some money buying them.You could call that the negative part of things, but on the positive side, they are a tripple jaw (roller) type of device that looks as if it will do a great job without (always) ruining the stud.  That is a great positive in many cases for me!  Also, the socket is about the size of a normal 3/8 drive sparkplug socket.  That is so much better than the size of most tools of this type.  That means that they will fit into tighter places than most stud removers will.  This important to me personally and might in many cases also be so to you too.  Maybe not all the glitz (4 stars) but a real solid value for the money spent in my opinion.  If they work as good as they look, I just may raise them later to 5 stars, if they don't, I will update this review accordingly later on.

"I just received my set of rail covers yesterday and installed them today.  They do look nice too!  However, there are some things to mention here that you will want to know about:1:  Follow the directions exactly, and they should go on pretty well with very little trouble at all in most cases. (That is my best guess from my Left side of bed.)2:  The double sticky tape is very good at locking in and holding on for most applications: prep as directed.3:  Do take note of some important ""issues"" with the plastic.....  Here is an example of what I mean from my own installation today.3a:  The Left side dry fit perfectly, and once installed, it fit and looked absolutely perfect.  Can't get better than that! :-)3b:  Then since the Left was so good I did the Right side..... not quite so perfect as it looked when dry fitted. :-(3c:  The whole thing looked great with my tailgate down for installation purposes, and the entire process completed.  When I went to close the tailgate I found out that it was not like the left side on the rear by the gate at all.  It was about 1/2 inch wider across the curved end of the cap, and the gate would not close..... I had to ""push"" the gate and material a bit to close the tailgate.  Then, I found that closing the gate pushed the outside edge outward about 1/2"" so it no longer fit tight to the side of the bed like it did before I closed the gate!  Simply put: it did perfectly on the Left side panel but not the same on the Right side..... Ooops.  Not so great. Bummer!This IS a fine looking and excellent product, but the 2009 Chevy short bed PU model may not be done right from the factory!  Fact.  The casting or moulding of the plastic had made it bigger for the right side than it did for the left side.... Now I am a bit sorry I bought them.... they do LOOK cool from the side at a short distance, but the rear right side literally sticks out away from the bed by at least 1/2"" and possibly a tad more while all the rest of the right side looks perfect and fits just right.  Just my rotten luck, eh?  When I dry fit it, the gate was open, and it looked as if it would fit perfect.... so be VERY careful guys.Final UPDATE:  It got rather long, drawn out, and I was NOT happy with the factory warrantee claim process (and people)..... suffice to say, not so good.  But, it does turn out that they DO actually intend to make things right after all; it is just that the process can be so problematic that you think they are trying to sneak out of it... they were not it turns out.  However that may be, out of shear frustration, I finally removed both sides, told them I gave up on warrantee, and our good friend Amazon took care of things: returned for refund.  Later on, I got a very short email from the company saying that they were sorry and would send out another set.  Great, but frankly, I'm not really tooooo sure I want another set, ha ha!  Some days you just should not get out of bed, right?  The one good side looked really good though!  I hope your situation is good to you.

"Okay, I have to admit that this is my very first time using this product.  It is NOT like any other automotive type of anti-rust/ anti-corrosion material I have used previously.  It is a clear pink liquid... almost a light purple.  It does NOT contain any type of soluable oil or such at all.  I cannot tell how it would act in any way like it says it does as a water pump lube etc.... I didn't say that it does not work for that, merely that I cannot tell at all how it would work like that.  Okay?  Now it uses two major nitrate chemicals to tie up O2 in the fluid so it cannot oxidize, and possibly will not corrode nor rust at all..... that sounds great.  I am using it in the cooling system of my PU now, but have not had it long enough to really say +/- about the long term use of it..... I have a LOT of hope for it because of my industial background.  We used to use such chemicals to stop all rust and corrosion in piping for cooling and heating in HUGE inside building internal loops - VERY effective - but some were certainly MUCH better than others.  So far, so good, and I do really hope that this will be the best I have ever used.  I will try to remember to update this eval next year with more specific details.For now:  The concept sounds excellent, the true long term effects are as yet unknown to me, but it is NOT too expensive a product to use, and it does use some proven principles to make it's claims for excellent funtionality.  (Note: You need to use a certain ""mix"" of the liquid into so many gallons of coolant, so don't just dump the whole bottle in until you sort of figure out how much you actually need to use.... that's not too hard to do, just simple math.)

"There may be better units than this one out there, but if this one holds up, and gives good long service, you cannot buy a better one for the money than this one!  Compared to many others I have seen and used, this one has a larger tank, puts out (variable) a larger flow of mist, and even offers ionization that is selectable on or off to the mix.This unit from the description (typical of most China made stuff) and paperwork, at first seems a bit complicated or difficult to use.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is easy to fill, holds about 1.5 gallon of water, and assembles for use with ease.  I like this unit.  (Note: The 2 gallon capacity claim is generic, in that 1.5 rounds up to 2.  Even so, that is just about the perfect amount for one single day's use if set on high flow and high mist.  It is so easy to open, fill, and re-assemble that outside of 1.5 gallon of water being a bit heavy for a child to do, it is a snap for an adult.  It looks good, it is easy to use, it has great features, and makes only small noises from time to time.  There is a slight ""hissing"" sound that may be heard, and the occasional gurgle as water is drawn into the unit to make up for that which is used, but it is NOT loud nor noisy.  Note:  I am rather noise sensitive in sleep and this was placed about 4 feet away from my bed.  I placed the unit on a soft pad so that sound would not merely be reflected (like a sounding board) from the table top and wall, and I hardly knew it was there:  I had to actually look over at it to be sure that it was still working it was so quiet.  Some small noises as I said, but only small, and only for very short little gurgles from time to time... I can live with that!Buy with confidence, and possibly even get one of those low cost 2 Year appliance warrantee packages for an extra bit of comfort for the $4-5 they cost.

"Okay this is NOT a big fancy unit, HOWEVER, it has several very good things about it:1:  The price is good / reasonable and has a good name on it that we all trust.2:  This unit has the BEST tuner on the radio and antenna system I have found yet. Really!3:  It is compact, easy to use, and is not tooooo large to carry around.4:  It has AM & FM, plus tape and CD player: that is great to have in one unit.Cons?  Only one..... the speakers are quite small, and if turned up much sound poor.Even so this radio WILL DO what NO OTHER radio I have tried has been able to do.  Even on my big very expensive Sherwood sterio receiver with various aux. power booster antenna systems could not get this station!  For several years I have tested every radio I could find in stores and such and NOT one could tune in a weak local station that is my favorite FM station.  I could ONLY listen to it in a car radio or on computer.  This one must have an excellent PLL network tuner (is my best guess), and also an excellent signal booster built into it.  With all that it will receive this very weak station clearly in my bedroom at home!  That is a big deal if you wish to use the radio and get great reception.After around 6 to 12 months of use I will update this rating and let you know about longer term things.  For now, so far so good and even better than just good, so 5 Stars is a reasonable rating for it... it deserves it.

"This is an excellent heater unit!  The price is higher than some, but it has several very good things going for it:1:  It is a USA made product for which local service/parts are available, if ever needed.2:  It really does look good, is not too large or heavy, and does not take up a lot of space. (Very well made!)3:  It does not get real hot, so fire safety and child safety are much less of a concern.4:  It has NO moving parts to break, wear out, or fail quickly on it. (A very good thing too.)5:  It relies on convection instead of a fan to distribute the heat into the room. (No fan to quit on you.)Most people are NOT really aware of electrical concerns when looking for a portable electric heater.  This one stays under the level of power use that would cause one to have to be concerned about overloading your circuit breakers..... that sure does matter.  This unit, at the high power setting only requires 12 amps @ 120VAC.  However, if you are going to use this in a front room, or possibly a bedroom setting be aware that your home may be wired with only 15 amp wiring and a 15 amp circuit breaker;  this fact would mean that for continuous use, this is the ONLY thing you want to have plugged into that circuit.  Do NOT plug any heater of 5 KBTU or more into your bedroom or livingroom circuit, then turn on a couple of room lamps and a TV as well.  Plan to never load a circuit to more than 80% of it's rated continuous current.  So, a 20 amp branch circuit should NEVER be run for long periods of time over 16 amps total load, nor a 15 amp at over 1440 watts.  Example:  You take this unit on high, 1500 watt setting which uses 12 amps (as opposed to the ""low"" 1000 watt switch setting).  Then add a 100 watt light bulb in two night stand lamps, plus you have the TV in your room which takes 250 watts for a total of 450 watts of extra power all in the same room added to the heater which, at 12 amps = 1440 watts..... total load = 1890 watts.  If your bedroom has all the outlets on one 15 amp panel breaker (many/most do), then 15 amps= 1800 watts MAX load short term; @ 80% = 1440 watts.  You will blow the breaker, and possibly risk overloading and over heating the circuit itself.  Some of the larger heaters are full load, by themselves, even on a 20 amp circuit (like the small appliance circuit in most kitchens).  So do use these with wisdom.  As a State Licensed Master Journeyman Electrician of over 20 years, I do caution you with all electrical appliances to not overload and blow circuit breakers over and over, it can lead to panel damage and even a house fire.  This is not meant to say do not use these, fore I am also using one.... right?  :-)  Just do it wisely, and use it right, and it will serve you well and safely.  I hope this helps someone be safe.

"These were an exact replacement of the new factory lighting only 1/5th the cost of OEM by GM! (Installed today on a 2006 Chevy Avalanche Z71.)They look great and to adjust them you do NOT have to have a special security star wrench..... a simple phillips #2 will do very nicely.  That makes MUCH more sense than the way factory OEM parts do it!  Do show due care when disconnecting the plugs from the lamp sockets.... your know, older vehicle plastic crap gets a bit brittle over time..... just a little extra care and all will be well.I would buy them again if needed you may be sure.

"I installed this into my new Asus A88X-Pro Mobo and it is an Excellent Processor to be sure!  This processor, in the midst of all the over priced units, stands out as being quite a performer in it's own right.  It runs just over 4 GHZ without any board tweeking or boosting of voltages on auto mode: it runs smoothly, has no seeming weaknesses at all, and is an excellent buy for the money paid!!This processor is much under rated and under valued...... that will save you money.  From the many AMDs I have used and worked with, this one stands right up there with my 8 chip processor running at 4.1GHZ...... no real advantage to the higher priced units until you really tippi-toe on the egde I guess.... and since I don't go there because......... reliability is paramount to me......... this is an EXCELLENT choice.

"I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and have been installing the new system and such into this board.  This board has excellent capabilities!  After having the ROG Z board for year now the Bios on this one seems a bit limited, but it is still a great board!  Asus has reduced their warrantees to only 3 years on this board, but being Asus, that is not really much a worry.  If you are looking for the biggest, greatest, fastest Mobo out there, then this is just might not be what you are looking for, and you had prosibly best go for a ROG Asus board to get all you can get.  But if you need a good stable and reliable system, this has a LOT to offer by far over many others out there.... most for a lot more money too!  The built in video is no slouch! The USB 3.0 is fast and flawless in operation! I took this Mobo to replace a fast Dual SLI Mobo that died and did not even bother to add the High Performance video card.  Again, when not into the extremes, this board can really save you a lot of money with all this, and, it is simply built onto it.  It's built in test function for adding various memory sticks make it very easy, and if the BIOS setting crashes while setting it up, you push one onboard button and instant restart that works.  Once again Asus has come up with a excellent product if used for the purpose that it is designed for.  I am using this to do my business work, files, word processors, and graphics displays.... it will be an excellent choice and still have enough to have fun with some pretty good games too.  If I ever (even) need to, I can always add a serious video card and sound card to it.... I am notlikely to need that though from all I have seen so far!I hope this helps........ by the way, the AMD A6-6400+ processor I used runs in it at 4+GHZ with simple auto mode setup!  Works with ease and no over voltages or tweeking is required: This is much skipped over and underated processor that can do well and save you a lot money in the purchase!  As always, be certain to choose proven and tested memory to get the most out of it.  The new memory Test Function is great and saves a LOT of time on setup and testing too.  Enjoy!UPDATE as of 14 November 2014 up to 5 stars:  This has worked flawlessly, and with the afore mentioned auto-speed function in the AI Suite II program, you can seriously get some much higher working speeds going if you want to with flawless ease!  I am regularly running over 4.1 GHZ and it does it all for me without going to over boosting the prosessor volts!  If my ROG MOBO dies on me, I just may replace (even) it with this board or the next itteration of it.  It is that good!  Enjoy. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPZYB3NNZ05W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G47W6DM#wasThisHelpful","RRPZYB3NNZ05W","A11KQADBYE0UZL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A11KQADBYE0UZL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I installed these this last week in my Chevy Avalanche hoping to make the effects of the coil spring rear suspension less noticeable.  These are good shocks, they are a tad bit shorter than the stock parts but do seem to work out okay.  They are of course easy to install and are quite a bit heavier duty than any standard OEM shock!  I installed them with a matching pair for the rear and it IS better, but they are not quite as HD as I had hoped for.  Even so, for the money, these are a good value, and for most applications will be as HD as anyone would normally ever need.

"I have installed these before on my previous trucks for the front daylight driving lights..... they run cool, they won't burn out the sockets with heat, and they will probably never burn out... ever!  I installed these today and it took around 10 minutes.  The ONLY concern I have for you is that often the sockets have already been damaged severely by heat and burn up..... you will face this possibility when ever the old style bulbs burn out so do not let it stop you!  Either way you will benefit from this change and it lowers the over all electric load, so your work done by the alternator is reduced which may lengthen it's life and reliability.  Win - Win.  Enjoy.

I installed mine on a 2006 Chevy Avalanche yesterday.  They do as they say in that they fit well and go in relatively easy.  It is a good complete kit as well.  The hoses and the hose clamps are very small and do make it require a lot of extra work/effort to install this since the hoses go on hard and the clamps are so small tey are very hard to use and fit on the fittings..... even so, for the money, this is an excellent buy if the bags last as long as they say they will!

"In my case, I downloaded the ""Free Trial Version"" to see if it would really work...

It looked so good, and the write-ups about the software sounded just right,so I paid the money and then tried to use it.  It was 6.5 hours into the file recovery process and it completely crashed and locked up my computer and all had to be reloaded.....AND.... what you must have to some degree on all of this stuff is a good dose of patience and perseverance.  We all have variations in our computers and sometimes software will work on one and hick-up on the next.So be wise.  Learn from the expereinces of others, for as I learned later, there were a lot of others just like me.  For some it apparently works perfectly, for others you just got stuck for a bit.  So, if you are among those of us where it does not work quite right - you merely have to be patient and they will work with you several ways to make it work for your own system and in the end they will either give your money back, or they will work through the problem with you.

Buy the right type of drive(life & use), the right physical size of drive(fit), the right characteristic of the drive for the use intended(speed), and from the right store (price).This is one of the best internal drives that WD makes right now (IMHO).  It is fast, not THE fastest, but fast; it has a good sized cash memory built into it (64 MB) to help with speed and processing, and does not cost too much either!  Possibly, from what I have seen, right now.... this specific drive just may be the best bang for the buck that is out there!  Some are faster, but require 3 or 4 times the money too!

"I gave it 4 stars for being a tad bit larger than I had hoped it would be: It is not huge, but the footprint on my desk is just a bit larger than I had hoped for.  But it is well worth the 4 stars since it has great and easy functional attributes.  It is easy, fast, straight forward to use, and seamless in OPS.  The price is also quite reasonable, and in a way, this unit ""could"" be used instead of an external standby drive for back-up very easily;  and that would make it much more versitile than one of the great externals we usually see used in a non-portable way. Why?  Because you then are NOT limited to one drive, but could have several that you run when needed from this one station!  Cool, eh?  :-)  For a portable use, the externals from WD are fantastic and so very small as to be simply amazing in how easy they are to use for the cost involved.

"I think that this was written to be sort of a very very short primer on many subjects.  The answers are very short, and usually bring up more questions after you read them.  It is easy to use, and it does have a good number of excellent photos too.  The author does offer some good ideas on step by step elimination of this or that, but like most books..... it has large gaps here and there.  It is a good book, but it will not be your single answerbook in most problem cases.  One problem with all books of this nature is that they do spend a lot of time on things that, ""Simply anyone would find that on their own.""  It is the more obscure things that leave us stumped from time to time and that we need a book like this one to use in troubleshooting the problems.  I guess that it is a lot like one of those pocket dictionaries you can buy.... lots of words, but most are the common words that you need no help with..... does that explain my idea better?  You will get some benefit from this book:  The book is compact and spiral bound for ease of use, and the author has many good insights in it so I gave it 4 stars for that and the reasonable price.

"I was trying to find a slightly heavier base weight plastic blanket material that would take use without being torn apart so easily.  These are just that.  They are inexpensive but slightly heavier than most I have bought and used previously.  Previous materials would barely hold themselves together, so-to-speak, and would not hold up to any real serious use.  My best guess is that I had normally received plastic base materials of 2 to 2.5 Mil thickness.

"It may be true that these are a bit high priced (4 stars) but, if you want to protect your expensive gauges and keep them accurate, then this is about your only way to do that.  Without these covers, the gauges will most certainly be damaged over time.  Unless the gauges are protected they will most certainly be bumped, dinged, and damaged, which means that we cannot do our jobs right with inaccurate indicators, right? :-) In my actual use, they quite literally fit over and around the gauge like a glove.  The front edge is larger and built up a bit to extend (protrude)forward enough to give some extra protection, though not a covering of course, of the front face of the gauge. Now that I am using them, I will never go back to a good gauge set without them for protection!  The soft rubber like material should last the full lifetime of the gauge set.

"This is hardly the most toxic insecticide on the market and yet it works great for better than a month. I do repeat the spraying every four weeks. I make sure to spray when I have a couple of days of fair weather ahead and I never spray when it's windy. Anyway, what I wish to eliminate in certain areas of my yard are chiggers, ticks, and mosquitoes. I have used this product for the past five years and these have been eliminated entirely. It was a big problem prior to that. As far as ants, it only works on certain species, apparently not the ones I have but I'm not concerned about those anyway. We do have a bird-feeding area and some flowerbeds where we encourage bees, butterflies, and praying mantises. Of course I give these areas about an 8-foot berth and I have seen no ill results.This insecticide does what I want it to do. The grandchildren play in the yard and they come in without bites and my pets (cats and dogs) have no ticks and very few fleas. I keep the pets out of the sprayed area until the spray has dried and have experienced no problems there. The spraying only takes me about 20 minutes and I use a cheap 2 1/2 gallon hand sprayer that you can buy almost anywhere. I am using three tablespoons of the concentrate per gallon of water. I guess I'm a happy customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLEOOAZDN4TF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PIY7QS#wasThisHelpful","RLEOOAZDN4TF4","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those stories, starring Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, where there exists the all-too-common nuance of *lots* of running around here and there to fill in for large segments of script that was either never written or perhaps snipped out. Still, it's a better-than average yarn overall.THE STORY: An alien (the last of his race) has launched ""shards"" of himself into oblivion when his spaceship explodes long before man's presence on earth. Somehow, these pieces return to exist as entire beings, disguised as humans, throughout various epochs of Earth's history. The alien's objective is to go back to that egregious moment and manipulate history so that his ship doesn't detonate and thus his race can live on. Well, we all know that The Doctor cannot allow such nonsense as that.Meanwhile, The Doctor's (Baker) and Romana II's (Ward) holiday in contemporary Paris is thus train-wrecked. The enigmatic instant is first detected in a caf as the two experience a slight time wrinkle, another more dynamic force occurring while the two view the Mona Lisa, a priceless painting which the alien is about to steal to finance the necessary research and equipment to complete his time machine.Due to The Doctor's continuing interference with his plans, the disguised alien, (who actually has a greedy human wife who is unaware of his extraterrestrial status!), captures The Doctor, Romana, and a bumbling plain-clothes cop who finds himself on board with helping the pair of time travelers. Lots of running around Paris ensues, The Doctor makes a visit to Leonardo da Vinci, and the alien attempts to commence his hawking of fake Mona Lisas.This story incorporates plenty of humor which some fans prefer to see maintained at a minimum. David Fisher wrote the original story but the Script Editor, the late Douglas Adams of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy fame, altered it so much that the standard script-writer alias, ""David Agnew"", was substituted. One positive caveat: this was probably composer Dudley Simpson's finest moment as his clever incidental music really enhances the story although he did confess to ""borrowing"" some major elements of An American in Paris... and rightfully so. Even Douglas Adams' dear friend, the rascally John Cleese, snags a cameo in this one (more humor) so there's that.By this point in his career as The Fourth Doctor, Baker was losing some of his dynamism and enthusiasm for the program and unfortunately it shows more than a little. He had become somewhat unmanageable for the Production Nabobs (chiefly causing palpitations for Producer Graham Williams), occasionally improvising his own lines and adding one-liners to the rehearsed script. Baker eventually married Lalla Ward and, from all accounts, it was a turbulent relationship and it certainly did not endure for long. Fortunately they were apparently getting along during this production and much goodwill on the set was also likely attributable to Director Michael Hayes, whose laid-back approach made him popular with Baker and most others. The story having been shot largely on location in Paris augmented the final production's great look.I should mention that a second supplementary disc manifests pure treasure for Classic Doctor Who fans with a lot of insight devoted to mischievous production happenings, both on the set and off. One dubious entry on this disc entitled ""Eye on Blatchford"" probably conveys a lot more meaning for Brits than it did for me.There are much better Tom Baker Doctor Who stories and this one cannot compare to the work he achieved with Elisabeth Sladen or Louise Jameson, or even with Mary Tamm, (Romana I), for that matter. Still, this four-episode, (100 minutes), romp is a must for any fan of Tom Baker as The Fourth Doctor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29NZZWYQB91GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B7QCJ0#wasThisHelpful","R29NZZWYQB91GH","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's no such thing as a marginal Arthur Upfield mystery - however, this one, (originally published in 1952), is a poster example of his very finest efforts.Once again, Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte gets called out to the Australian boondocks to resolve two otherwise unsolvable murders. If you are unfamiliar with ""Bony"" don't be put off by his name or by the fact that his ethnicity is mixed. A lot of folks, (including me), often read a back cover summary and view such thrown-in devices of the author's fancy as a dreary gimmick, contrived solely to enhance an otherwise dull story. No fear! Bony is half-Aborigine and half-Caucasian and he draws upon the many strengths of his unique racial blend to solve his endless difficult cases.In ""Venom House"" he faces numerous impediments launched by two squirrelly sisters, their mentally-challenged Atlas of a half-brother, and their domestic workers, all of whom are isolated from local society by means of a sprawling shallow reservoir. The manor house is situated on an island at the center of this nearly immutable obstacle to casual visitation. This prickly caveat makes it extremely problematic for Bony to sneak and snoop around the premises as is his habit. But more than that, it's an ideal setting for a murder mystery. Location rivals ambiance, (which is artfully conveyed in equal abundance), in this marvelous whodunit.The somewhat meek and elderly matron of Venom House, (so-called by all, based upon a history of wicked incidents perpetrated by a long line of onerous family members), has been strangled and dragged into the portentous nearby lake. A local butcher, recently more flush with cash than he should have been, has also been strangled and submerged. The residents of Venom House are suspected although others in the nearby hamlet must remain in the suspect pool as well. Bony utilizes a combination of his great intelligence, effete diplomacy, and his wholehearted willingness to totally ignore police procedures to affix the crime on the actual perpetrator. However, before he can fully launch his inquiry yet more infamy looms upon the horizon, a nuance which complicates an already perplexing investigation.Through his gifted prose, Upfield's characters, locations, and settings are vividly conveyed to the mind's eye of murder mystery enthusiasts. I pigeonhole his numerous works within ""The Golden Age"" genre of mysteries much akin to those of Josephine Tey, Agatha Christie, and Dorothy L. Sayers. His works deliver that diaphanous Gothic feel which his fans have come to appreciate so devotedly. The late Arthur Upfield was English but spent most of his life in Australia, a nation that has adopted him as one of their top authors and a man who, through his writing, has serendipitously conserved much of the aboriginal anthropology of the island continent's colorful past.If you're up for a great rainy weekend mystery read, this is the one -- highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UEPZUU5PVLS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0020259018#wasThisHelpful","R2UEPZUU5PVLS9","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm compelled to confess that this device was considerably beyond my ability to work with it -- I have clearly reached the point where technology has left me behind. This, of course, is not the fault of the manufacturer. I would only contest them on one point of their marketing assertions: ""easy set-up"". This might be quite true if you're nineteen and plugged in to the endless technology which surrounds us today, or, if you're older and have the patience of Job to attempt to digest the written instructions, a virtue with which I have never been blessed. (And please do not ask me about did I call  in for technical assistance because the only thing I hate more than printed instructions is having someone I don't know try to explain some technical actions over the phone.)Honestly, I never got to first base on set up, (and quite frankly, I wasn't sure that I even knew precisely what I wanted to do with it as the keyboard performs so many functions in the contemporary household.)Finally, my young son-in-law got me up and running. It took him awhile and he is up on high-tech devices but after a few false starts, it worked. Soon after he left and maybe following an hour or so of tinkering around, I placed it back in the box to revert to my comfort zone of doing everything the old fashioned way with one control for each device. That is probably why I have numerous remotes falling off my end-tables but that's how I like it.This unit is for those who wish to move with the times and I'm all for that.

The handles are also easy to grab.For home use, highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W2DFMOBCWTUH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GJB4H2G#wasThisHelpful","R3W2DFMOBCWTUH","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Folks, I feel compelled to say that in a general sense where printers are concerned, (as least for good ones), gone are the days that they hiss, plunk, and clunk before one measly copy rolls off the press. These high tech machines are built to last and this one is at the top of them all.It prints, faxes, copies, and scans. The color copies are beautiful. Honestly, I think that when I use matte paper in it they are very good but the glossies look like something from a large-negative camera done at a studio. I just cannot believe how nice they are.This is a large machine with endless features but if you read the manual you will find that everything from set-up to practical use is pretty much a breeze.I would recommend this unit over all others in its price range -- I'm very happy with mine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXLB7A4QRDKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQBT3RG#wasThisHelpful","RAXLB7A4QRDKI","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I should point out up front that it might be easy to make a mistake if one is in a hurry and doesn't read the product description closely. Yes, It is a fax/copier/scanner/printer but it does not do color. What you have here is essentially a very high-speed, efficient, budget-priced, and compact office printer. If you typically print lots of documents and you like to have them in a hurry (and you have no need for color printing), then I could highly recommend this excellent.The feature that I most like for two reasons is the fact that it uses toner instead of ink: I can get my toner much cheaper than ink. The document look just as excellent to me so that is a huge plus. Also, I go for long intervals sometimes between printing large volumes of documents, weeks at the least. Ink tends to dry out and toner continues to work as good as the day I bought it.Yet another great feature is that this unit is wireless. I have it sitting in the opposite corner from my computer. You *can* plug it directly in to your computer port if you wish but it works just as well in the wireless mode.Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8KTSTPC2OFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IQBT3VW#wasThisHelpful","R1O8KTSTPC2OFZ","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first entry in Mervyn Peake's three timeless Gormenghast novels. The novels cannot rightly be called a trilogy because Peake had planned to write more books in the series -- unfortunately he fell to insanity before he could do so and he required help in completing the third novel, ""Titus Alone"". When you reach that point, you'll find that the overall work is indeed unfinished, much as it would be as if you stopped reading at the end of ""The Two Towers"" in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.I'll be honest, your listening experience with the audiobooks will be much enhanced if you read the books first. The best choice is the all in one paperback volume, now available. However, reading the books is not a must. The performance of Simon Vance on this audiobook is so terrific that you will get the complete story, no problem. [Every prospective buyer should be aware that another narrator, Robert Whitfield, is available for this audiobook - my review is aimed at the Simon Vance version.]One more point: there's not much use in listening to the first book unless you plan to also hear ""Gormenghast"", the second entry. The third book (or audiobook) is another matter altogether but I'll get to that later. Here is what *this* audiobook story is all about:The Kingdom of Gormenghast is ruled by the 76th Earl of the line. He's a vague old duffer but still spry enough to sire a son during his sunset years. He also has a daughter in her late teens. This place is strange... fantastical. Peake made it a great challenge, impossible actually, to put your finger on a time or place. The ambiance is definitely gothic, (but not all three books are gothic novels.)Gormenghast exists to exist. Over the centuries it has deteriorated to a place of strict ritual, pomp, and circumstance. Progress has ceased altogether and the biggest event is the annual selection of carvings produced by the Bright Carvers, the folks who pretty much make up the population outside this huge castle-fortress. There is an equally large population inside, chiefly servants and minions.This first novel sets up the story. The place is described, the onerous principals are identified and everyone's purpose and relationship to one another is established in great detail. Titus Groan is born and this is a great joy for all in the kingdom since they now have an heir who will become the 77th Earl. But an undertone of malevolence suddenly gives rise to an accelerated miasmic decay in the Gormenghast heavily-structured way of life. This is largely attributable to one Steerpike, a fast-rising young sociopath, freshly-escaped from Chef Swelter's hellish kitchens. That's about as far as I can go.Unlike Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"", do not look for orcs, elves, or dragons here - no magic either. But it always *seems* like their might be some magic around. Peake's style is unmatched.This audiobook is made up of 15 discs, (17  hours) and should play on your car CD player or elsewhere. However, at some point in time it was also available (or at least I think it was) on *one* disc, MP3 formatting. I think that many libraries favored this type so be aware of this if you buy a used ""library copy"" or a new one that mentions MP3. If you do acquire this type of compressed formatting, it will play on your computer auxiliary drive or if you have a CD player which accepts MP3 it will play on that as well. (I just bought such a portable player at Big Lots for $30).I should mention some key points about the next two novels in the series since it might affect your decision to acquire this first novel. The second entry sees Titus Groan growing up. But the third novel is *very* strange and far-ranging in its scope. Titus leaves Gormenghast and goes into ""the world"". Everything changes and a lot of readers complain clamorously about this third novel. Personally, I fancy it and I think it's the best of the three but there, I am much in the minority. One could almost pigeonhole the third entry as science fiction.So there you have it. You might think that there are way too many contingencies and red flags associated with this series based upon what I've told you. Therefore it's important to know that Gormenghast is an experience that you will never forget - there's nothing else like it and it defies genre classification, (at least for the overall series.) What I have discovered is that enthusiasts of the ""Gormenghast"" series are almost universally equally impassioned about ""The Lord of the Rings"" - but the reverse is not always so. I hope that observation helps.

"For the benefit of the uninitiated, nearly all of Arthur Upfield's mysteries feature Detective Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte (""Bony"" to his friends), of the Queensland [Australia] police. Still, every police province in the country attempts to steal him away in the hope of solving their most difficult cases. This time Bony is working for the New South Wales police in the town of Mitford.Bony is half-Caucasian and half-Aborigine so he can connect with either race. He is an expert tracker and he loves to brag that he has never failed to resolve a case. But this one is unusual as someone is stealing babies... *male* babies. The newspapers are pouring Australian heat down on Bony's superiors to resolve this heinous mystery and, of course, the brass tries to interfere with Bony's investigation; however, he knows exactly how to rid himself of the bureaucrats.The town is bulging with very strange people and a definite social class deviation stands as a challenging impediment to Bony's ability to ferret out the facts. One of the key elements of the case is that the mothers do not appear to care much about their respective offspring, excepting the most recent one. And there is one additional difference in that case -- the mother gets herself murdered!An unusual caveat to this case is that Bony takes on a partner... a female partner. Before it's all over, Bony has to risk his neck to solve the case which involves Aboriginal legend and a bit of Australian-style voodoo aimed at damaging Bony's well-being.While this entry is not the best of Upfield's works it's still First-Class. It's not the Upfield mystery I would recommend to newcomers to this author but devotees will again revel in the Upfield's renowned ability to paint lively landscapes and to convey Australia's anthropological heritage as he weaves this fascinating tale. Newbies to Upfield might first try either Murder Down Under or Wings Above the Diamantina (A Scribner Crime Classic).Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KKYOZ5LHLNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV8P9IU#wasThisHelpful","R20KKYOZ5LHLNR","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Still, every police province in the country attempts to steal him away in the hope of solving their most difficult cases. This time ""Bony"" (to his friends) is working undercover for the New South Wales police out of Menindee.Bony is half-Caucasian and half-aborigine so he can connect with both races. He is an expert tracker and he loves to brag that he has never failed to resolve a case. This is yet another convoluted situation: an outback sheep-ranch hand, Gillen, drowned months back in Lake Otway, a reservoir which is disappearing at an alarming rate due to a great drought. The death first appeared to have been an accident but there are those who believe otherwise because Gillen was known to be carrying 1,250 that he won in a lottery, a great deal of money for the period and certainly enough to be murdered for.When Bony arrives on the scene disguised as a horse-breaker who has been hired by the ranch owner he receives mixed greetings. He is warned about the two women who do the cooking for the ranch hands, a mother-daughter team who have perfected the art of soliciting expensive gifts from these lonely fellows. Some of the men have already laid claim to these women and Bony is so informed soon after his arrival in the form of an implied threat.Most these itinerant hands are eager to discover Gillen's remains when the lake finally goes dry, the focus being a locket that he wore around his neck. And more death, human and otherwise, hovers on the horizon. As usual, Bony risks his neck to solve the mystery and to recover the murdered man's money, for murdered he was.Prepare yourself for shifting loyalties and surprises around every turn. This is one of the better Upfield works, even when you consider that there is no such thing as a mediocre Upfield entry. It's not the Upfield mystery I would begin with but devoted fans will again revel in the author's renowned ability to paint lively landscapes and to convey Australia's anthropological heritage as he weaves his compelling story.If you are new to Upfield you might wish to first try Murder Down Under, (aka, Mr. Jelly's Business (Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte Mysteries: the Arthur Upfield Collection)).Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVDTLKV2LB98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=187598934X#wasThisHelpful","R3AVDTLKV2LB98","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here's why this thing is great for power outages:1. Because it's an LED light, the batteries last forever.2. It's really lightweight and you can get it into small spaces with it if you need to.3. It works either as a flashlight or a lantern, simply by flipping the top.I used to fire up my Coleman lantern during power outages, (which always includes a lot of preliminary hassles.) But not now. I can even read just fine by this light which also makes it terrific for tent camping. The strobe function can be used as a signal in emergencies. I wrapped a little strip of red cellophane around my globe and use it in the car for breakdowns in hazardous spots.For the money you won't go wrong if you grab a couple of these remarkably shrewdly-designed mini-lanterns.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5TOULBVRYSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FN1LP4Q#wasThisHelpful","R2E5TOULBVRYSJ","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had a little trouble getting started on this one because its a different sort of futuristic escapism fantasy/sci-fi tale than I have previously encountered. (I don't read a huge amount of this genre.) Also, it was obvious from the start that this story emanates from a larger work with which I was unfamiliar.That being said, all this also goes to the benefit of this particular tale of contemporary fantasy *because* it is different and this original, at least for me.Getting away from a doomed Earth for one reason or another is, of course, not an original idea but how one achieves this can be. I liked author Vaughn Heppners approach to the idea. To get to New Eden (Solar System), he made use of human telepaths who manipulate space to travel the many light years of distance.I wouldnt call this one a page-turner but its a thoughtful work and its certainly original enough in many aspects to be worthwhile reading.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RENUST05YKIC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477808825#wasThisHelpful","RENUST05YKIC6","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im not a huge fan of contemporary fantasy but this yarn sort of pushed the right buttons for me.The key to a great fantasy novel from my view is the manifestation of a magical ambiance and author Brian Staveley achieved it in spades in this instance. This idea goes beyond lyrical prose and clever plots. I was captivated by the story and thats what counts.Elements of this warrior tale include numinous monks, warriors-assassins, secrets (which of course are tendered for dramatic benefit to the reader), and monsters a winning combination. While the names of the characters seemed a bit pulled out of the air I can still live with that given the quality of all other aspects of the work. The important thing is that I didnt get the characters confused at any point, an aspect of unclouded writing.This one is certainly a page-turner and I will be reading more works by this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUK0D8SCJHJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765336405#wasThisHelpful","R2FUK0D8SCJHJE","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I waited a long time to acquire one of these units and now that I have it I can say that I have a lot more peace of mind. Quite honestly, just having the cameras up and running is enough to deter most thieves and other intruders. The fact that this unit records all that goes on (about fifty hours' worth) is a huge bonus. That is the purpose of the DVR unit which comes with the package.The package also comes with four very nice, sturdy cameras and I decided to modify the mounting on them. Instead of mounting them directly to the house I thought they would look much better with a pre-drilled flange at the base and so I went to Lowe's and picked some up (thin wood ones that I painted white, the same as my house -- very cheap to buy) and the mounting looks much better against the siding.If you live in the country as I do and you are gone for two and three days at a time, this is a very worthwhile investment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZWUHGI1FHKDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0SL5OM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZWUHGI1FHKDS","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must confess that I was skeptical that these pills would change my dog's behavior for the better but it did in a most astonishing way.I gave these pills to a small male terrier-type mixed breed dog that was very hyperactive.

Now he is well-behaved and normal. Everybody was amazed that this was the same dog.The main ingredient seems to be a magnolia extract. I happen to be an expert on toxic plants and in large doses, magnolia is toxic to humans BUT, like many medicines, used in the correct dosage, such chemicals can render beneficial results with no harm to the animal.

The craftsmanship of this stapler is excellent -- it is quite well-made.I should also note that loading the staples is easier than loading regular staples into my desk stapler, so there are no issues with that.You will find that you need a moisture filter (recommended by manufacturer) between the air compressor and the staple gun. I bought one at Advance Auto Parts, (all auto parts store sell them), which fits right in line using common tools, (2 minute installation), for twelve bucks.

So when I got down to the least potent patches, I started skipping them for 2-3 days at a time.

Still, it works for me this way so I thought the idea might benefit someone else. You would never want to use this gum at the *same* time with patches.

"I am very pleased with this printer and I have tried to be specific, rating every aspect on a 1-10 basis:Price [8] -- A  good value for the ease of connectivity and quality of printing.  Seems to be a good basic printer.Set up [9] -- Very easy, can print from windows, smartphone, and i-pad.  I went box to print in 15 minutes with no problem. Once I got the app, making the wireless connection was easy. Instructions could use some minor re-vamping for clarity.  The interface window is a little small.Quality [7.5] -- It's great for black-and-white printing but just okay for the color. I would not use this unit mainly for my main quality photo printing but itll get you by. It was nice to see cartridge levels in screen.Print, scan, and copy [8] -- All features work nicely and navigation in between is easy. I have not used the fax function.  I experie3nced the occasional paper jam, however those are aberrations and not the norm.Overall, highly recommended!Speed  6  not really fast, but speed is not so important to me.  Great for home use, maybe not in an office setting.Ink Price  6  pretty average pricing,  I have not had it long enough to determine cartridge longevity.Durability  8  felt solid out of the box, nothing seemed flimsy.

I have no issues with that because I have a color printer on another computer port.The reason that you get no color from this machine is because it uses toner instead of ink and I find this a much more economical way to get copies and printed documents; however, I hasten to add that the black-and-white photos that this machine produces are *beautiful*.

"Law Enforcement Officers (I was one for 25 years) used to carry the Buck Brand folding knives when they first came out in the early 1970s (or perhaps a little before) and that remained the industry standard for many years. A cop is always needing a razor sharp knife for many purposes and the Buck fit the bill for the era. However, as seat belt laws became more strict from state to state, and as people began to wear them with more frequency, the Buck was not so good. Why? Because you need a serrated blade to cut through a seat belt in a hurry. When you are trying to get someone out of a car that has landed in the water, or one that is about to catch on fire, you need to get that seat belt off in a big rush. Why not just un-buckle the belt? There seems always to be a complication in doing that from outside the car and they often won't unbuckle easily, even for the person wearing it, especially if they are over-excited.To make a long story short, this Coast Folding Knife is *perfect* for this job. The lower half of the blade is serrated and the upper is smooth. Add to that, never in all my years have I encountered a knife that is this sharp. The blade is made of a steel that will not soon dull -- this knife is going to hold an edge for a *long* time to come.If there is a down side, it would be that it's almost impossible for a lay person to properly sharpen a serrated blade, (but the upper half will still sharpen fine.)The blade locks securely, the weight is good (hefty for its size), it feels nice in your hand, and the blade has not the slightest wobble, no matter how hard you try to make it move in that way. There is also a dandy belt hook to carry it. A nice leather belt sheath would have been a great perquisite but you can't have everything.My highest recommendation -- this is a super-quality product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB4XSE0GA4JJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BE9OQ4#wasThisHelpful","RB4XSE0GA4JJ7","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a mental impression of a much bigger truck when I ordered this, not that bigger is better. But then, once I got it out of the box and messed with it, I understood why it is the size that it is.What you have here is essentially a big flashlight that looks like a truck and which can be played with like a toy truck. The kids like the additional numerous flashing lights on it and they have integrated it in with their other similar-sized toys when they are playing.But the fact that is functions quite effectively as a flashlight, (the purpose of the top handle which had eluded me earlier),  is the big draw.

"Having set this trap according to instructions at various locations around the yard over the weeks I have owned it, I have yet to impale a mole.Granted, something sets it off and it penetrates into the ground just fine where the mole *should* be.

The yard is plagued with the critters and there is no shortage of molehills.In summary, I think I have simply been unlucky, (or rather the moles have been lucky), because there seems to be no logical reason for this trap to not work.I will say that if I had cats around, I would not use this trap. You know how cats can get into things and places where they are not supposed to be and if one dug around the trap with his paw, he might get nailed.

"I don't usually care much for shrewdly-written novels in the contemporary style. However, this one integrates enough substance into the text that I approve.I'm compelled to observe that this work of fiction is life experience first, bird-watching as a connecting theme. The thrust of this yarn focuses upon clever, if not earth shattering, experiences.When I say this, I have in mind the backwoods encounter with the rifle-packing mushroom hunter who clearly wishes a fraternal relationship with the protagonist. Or the one-armed wheelchair guy who curses the protagonist and complains that his new ""nurse"" is neither female nor sensual [paraphrasing].And I award high marks to the author for being the first, (who I know of), to effect an accurate depiction of the average park ranger: surly, officious, ungoverned, and very clean. I know because I was one for 25 years. I'm a bird-watcher too. But you don't need to be a bird-watcher, (nor do you even have to *like* bird-watchers, a clannish faction at best), to appreciate the story.In summary, if you enjoyed Slumgullion Stew by Edward Abbey, then you'll find this fast read equally palatable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N4Z7TYTNB6ML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908054#wasThisHelpful","R2N4Z7TYTNB6ML","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oxo has a good name in kitchen utensil products and these measuring spoons work just fine. The shortcomings are quite minor.The best thing about these measuring spoons is that they will fit into most medium sized spice and herb cans, (depending upon the spoon that you are using.) In other words they are designed to fit down a rectangular hole, an oversight of most manufacturers.Of course they are accurate and it's easy to scoop excess ingredients off the top. (I don't believe in ""heaping teaspoons"" - that messes up everything in a recipe.) However, while they feel good in the hand, I have always shied away from non-metallic handles. They are a pain to wash if something gooey gets on them and I think all-metal ones are more sanitary.As to quality, these spoons are ""stamped out"" and not milled. The metal is very thin. Honestly, this is more of a guy issue since it probably doesn't matter unless you accidentally step on it. But I will never give up my Cuisipro Stainless Steel Measuring Spoon Set. They are made of heavy stainless steel and you could drive a car over them without any damage. They cost about the same as the Oxo spoons.In the end, I give the Oxo spoons the thumbs up on utility which, after all, is what most cooks/chefs want in the home kitchen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34RATD3CA0BVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSDP78I#wasThisHelpful","R34RATD3CA0BVP","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's gratifying to be pleasantly surprised when you naturally anticipate a story and you're treated to something quite divergent from and notably better than your expectations.This semi-bildungsroman is told in first person by a fictional urban Jewish teen who encounters life's little train-wrecks, as well as a few more positive events, as we all have during that joyous period of life. He has agreed with a creative teacher to write a book in place of having to study Shakespeare, (which he ends up doing anyway - that's not a big spoiler.) The teacher's actual agenda turns out to be quite different than what he has alleged to this bright lad; however, to reveal *that* would indeed be a spoiler for which you would not thank me.This young student, Twerski by name, lands upon one event following another, most of which are at least tenuously linked. These various activities embody everything from sports to puppy love and I must say that the conveyance of these youthful rites of passage launched me back to some hair-raising memories from my own dubious boyhood.What I found particularly compelling and inspiring about the work was an absence of ""the coolness of possessing things"", and a distancing of the characters from any compelling need to be anything but a regular kid. A complete void of noxious mentions of fashion and an equal dearth of obscene language represent the icing on the cake, features which seem to have become somewhat rare in contemporary teen reading. I don't consider this book to fall into the genre of ""Christian reading"" so much as to say that it simply does not need the foul language aspect to make the captivating points that it does. This book is well-written.Of course the thrust of this tale bulges with cloaked ethical messages, all nicely worked into the story but teens will get the picture clearly enough. I mention The Catcher in the Rye,(one of my huge favorites), in my title because it's the same *sort* of story: confused youth seeks moral direction - diaphanous hope lies ahead. An underlying theme here addresses the topic of bullying, making the book very timely and worthwhile, but that aspect is not in one's face and does not in any way blot out the joy of leisurely reading.This book is a rare find and would make a great gift for any young teen, especially boys but it's okay for girls as well.

"First and up front, you will not find a better no-stick skillet than this one for the price.If there was ever truly a non-stick pan it is this one. You want to fry an egg without using cooking oil? Go right ahead - I achieved that with no problem over fairly low heat using a plastic spatula. A perfect over-medium egg.The heat distribution in this skillet is terrific. The skillet itself is pretty lightweight but there's a fully adequate thickness to the bottom. I have used it multiple times at this point and I have yet to detect a mark or scratch on the inside. Of course, it is a breeze to wash and for frittatas, (for example), you can place this skillet inside a 350-degree F. oven without damaging it. The silicone handle feels very nice in the hand.I cannot say that I'm wild about the exterior color but neither do I find it particularly hateful. It does have a very modern appearance. If you're looking for a great no-stick skillet at a budget price, I can highly recommend this one.

"Well, I'm sure that there are other folks who could also enjoy this book nearly as much as I have; however, to wring the last bit of reading delight it helps to know a bit about Russian history. I don't mean dates, wars, and all that so much but more along the lines of the cultural proclivities and the personalities mentioned, (especially political ones.) You won't be lost if you know little of Mother Russia - the author explains a great deal but it's just better if you can read the work with a sense of Russian anthropology and to be able to comprehend the depraved mindset of the repressive Soviet Regime.The author takes us through the years of her childhood and forward, often regressing to culinary tales from her past, (often re-told to her by friends and relatives.) The author immigrated to America in her youth but she clearly wishes to cling to her Russian past so far as food is concerned, even back to the age of the Tsars when life was radically different, even for the peasants, than it was during the Soviet years after 1918. [At that point, Tsar Nicholas II had been murdered along with his entire family, Kerensky had assumed the role of leadership, and the Bolsheviks, (Communists), were about to change life for the Russians and the people of many surrounding countries for the next seventy years.]This is neither a recipe book nor a cookbook so much as it is a reflection on life. There are some recipes, a number you might wish to try and some not. Still, for the average American, the distinctive nature of these dishes might just make you think in new ways about your own cooking.I loved this book and, especially for those I mentioned, I give it my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XH27AM6FET4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307886816#wasThisHelpful","R2XH27AM6FET4Z","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I didn't care much for this tea pot but it has grown on me and now I couldn't do without it. I should say up front that I'm not using it for its intended purpose -- I'm just boiling water.This has become an item of major convenience since I can move it anywhere I wish, and it likely saves me money, instead of using my gas cook stove for the same purpose -- propane is high these days!I just plug it in, add about a quart of tap water to the pot, and then hit the little lever which causes a small power indicator light to illuminate. When the water is hot, you hear a ""click"", (the ""start"" lever popping back up - you quickly become acclimated to hearing this sound), and the light goes out indicating that the water is boiling hot. Now I'm ready to make my bagged tea or instant coffee.This heats water really fast, (about 7 minutes the first time around), and of course the less water you have added to the pot, the faster it heats. There is a convenient ""see-through"" gauge on the pot to let you know the status of the water level.The best thing about this tea pot is the handle. The balance with water in the pot is perfect -- a joy to the hand!If the pot has a drawback it is that you cannot get your hand down inside to wash it - you need one of those sponge glass washers. There is some sort of cone device up the center of the inside.

"We have multiple bird-feeders for various species in the back yard, including two hummingbird feeders. Since my neighbor also maintains hummingbird feeders we have LOTS of birds coming in. This particular feeder has worked out great due to its thoughtful design.First, the reservoir is large enough to last for two days. (You don't want to go too long without changing the sugar water because it will cloud and ferment.)Second, this is an incredibly easy feeder to clean. I can take this feeder down, scrub it out, rinse and refill it in less than five minutes.Third, the ""ant trap"" on the lid, (a small ring/water reservoir), gets added to by any rain we get. Additionally, I see other bird species actually drinking the water from the ant reservoir which is okay since we don't have a significant ant problem anyway.In summary, this feeder gets my highest recommendation. If you are a more casual feeder of the birds, you might wish to get the feeder from the same company which has the smaller reservoir.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HYTS8IHXF9UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UII5EI#wasThisHelpful","R3HYTS8IHXF9UL","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This turned out to be something different from what I was hoping for, so I don't intend to punish the manufacturer for my own oversight.The game amounts to a 21st century Scrabble game. (That was my actual hope, a game with high quality materials which was something like Scrabble.) However, it apparently spins off of the ZYNGA game which one encounters (ad nauseum) on facebook and which I view as an outright nuisance. There again, this is a personal foible and not the manufacturer's fault that I do not participate in that particular activity.What the game *does* offer is high quality materials/playing parts. To be honest, I'm going to try to figure out a way to adapt these materials to create my own ""semi-Scrabble"" game, probably similar to the way this game was actually intended to be used. I don't care much for the roll-around feature. I think my grandkids and I will have fun messing around with the game, even if we don't play it correctly - they love the colors of the pieces.The Smartphone feature also generates no interest for me. I do not own a smartphone or any other phone other than the ratty one that hangs on my kitchen wall. My point is, be prepared for that requirement to make the full use of the game.In summary, if you are an older person like me, stick with Scrabble if delving into new realms of the computer age irritates you as much as it does me. If you are young and adaptable to ever-changing technology and ideas, you'll probably like the game quite a lot.Recommended as described.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TOI1AW626ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KGR2OI#wasThisHelpful","R13TOI1AW626ZH","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most remarkable feature of this eye-catching bag is the obvious high-quality of both the materials and the craftsmanship. The best description I can yield of the *feel* of the exterior material is that of a very soft leather, (much like a pebbled doeskin glove), quite pliable and clearly durable.All the brass-finish zippers are heavy-duty, of the finest manufacture. They highlight the attractiveness of the bag. It's plenty large, without being bulky, offering more than ample interior space for its primary intended use.The sturdy, lengthy carrying straps make transporting the bag a breeze, quite comfortable. For the remarkable durability of the material, this bag is still plenty light and not burdensome in terms of weight. The ocean blue color is muted and classy-looking.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTEN8J01FL4H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ094BA#wasThisHelpful","RUTEN8J01FL4H","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My normal reading is classic literature but once in a while I have to clear my head with something less profound, something off the wall, (at least from my perspective.) In this instance I made a highly suitable choice because if this is not celebrated literature, the story was at least compelling to the degree that it held my interest from beginning to end.This was obviously a book aimed at female readers but I guess I chose it largely upon the basis of my being a cat lover, a facet of the story which I knew about in advance of acquiring the book. (Also, I'm from Ohio, so there was that.) It's also one of a series -- I regret that I cannot comment extensively on that aspect of the work as I have read none of the companion books and won't be doing so because, as I mentioned earlier, this read was simply to provide a break from my normal genre. Still, it was obvious that these characters had largely hung out together in the past and the author handled that smoothly enough as to not baffle me.The thrust of the story, the foundation, is simply this: What can one expect when a relationship un-expectantly shifts from ""friend"" to ""lover""? And that's a worthy premise since so many people can relate to such a predicament, (if you choose to look at it in that light.).It's a middle-America love yarn like many others of its type, (and perhaps just a bit stereotypical but not egregiously so), and the disquiet generated by the events and the characters, (Anna in particular), is probably the part I enjoyed the least. But that's also the aspect of the story that kept me turning the pages. (I prefer long, rambling yarns where nothing much happens and this one is pretty pacey by my gauge.)In any case, while not precisely a roller coaster, I found this one enjoyable, captivating, and worth reading. If I were into the genre, I'm sure I would read the entire series.Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJVSO5R9QR5IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062024612#wasThisHelpful","RJVSO5R9QR5IO","A1BA72K4VK1UN1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1BA72K4VK1UN1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those items that I always idly wish I had during very specific times.  Like when we go to the beach or the one or two times a year when I do a potluck.  So when it became available I decided to give it a try even though I had no specific need for it right then.But then my husband, who travels to NYC several times a year, kind of idly mentioned that the last time he'd gone he'd found a great restaurant that does Ramen (and no, not the cheap little bricks you find at the grocery store) and wished we could try it but it would probably be inedible by the time he drove back (4-hour drive).  I remembered this and told him to get some on the way back and we could test the efficacy of this.We did and it performed like a champ.  Instinctively he determined that it would probably work best to preserve heat if the container was already hot.  So he cleaned it and filled it with boiled water to bring the temp up before discarding the water and filling it with the Ramen.  When he got home (like 5 hours later) it was still nicely hot and tasted great!  He was worried about spillage & spoilage but the seal does a great job.It is stainless steel, has a lifetime warranty and no BPA.  Also very easy to clean and store.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S492LOX4ZUFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPISUJQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S492LOX4ZUFS","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say this is a pretty darned nifty printer.1. It is a littler bigger than I expected.  But not heavy at all.  I need to pay attention to dimensions more.2. It is really easy to set up.  We chose a wireless set up (a wired option is also available).  The quick-start guide is easy to read & follow and only requires a couple of steps. They give you a website to go to and all you do is follow the prompts3. If you have more than one computer in your home, follow the same steps on each computer to download drivers etc.and to allow that computer to 'discover' the printer4. Download the mobile app to your smartphone or tablet to allow you to print from your mobile device (need to be on your wireless network to do this).  This was pretty convenient since right now I have to upload stuff to the cloud and then go to my computer and then download it back to print it.5. Your printer gets assigned an email address!6.. (Optional, but I recommend strongly) set up an account with HP-Connected to manage all your printed devices as well as the ability to send documents to your printer remotely via email (and manage who can do this).7. The Printer comes with 2 ink cartridges (black, & tri-color) and a small quantity of photo paper.  Since ink is always the most expensive enterprise in owning a printer it is important to get an idea about how much you are gonna be spending in ink.  This uses HP 62 inks which retail for @ 14-16 bucks per cartridge (A LOT cheaper than my current printer inks let me tell you... but still....).  But when setting you you are given the option of enrolling in HP's instant  ink program which is a subscription service.  Your printer senses when it is getting low on ink and orders more and it is shipped to you.  You can set up the service level you think best fits your printing habits and there is a monthly scale based on how much you think you print per month. Yeah, I'm on that!8. It is a scanner & copier of course.  And the app uses your phone camera to document capture/scan & print.9. You can control it's functions from an LCD screen right on the computer or from whatever device you are printing from.I have tried all the functions, printing from all the computers, printing fro mobile devices, printing via email.

"I actually bought this because I had read somewhere that a molinillo could substitute for an Indian Mathani.  I was going to make a Makhani Dal and I needed a tool to puree some of the ingredients and mathani was highly suggested for it.  But I couldn't find one in my area. So of course I went online.This molinillo caught my eye because it is really quite pretty. I loved it even better when I got it.  It is a nice tool and bigger than I thought it was going to be.  It also did a great job on my Dal.  And welp, since I had it I decided to use it for its intended use, hot chocolate.  I had never realized my chocolate needing frothing until, well, I actually frothed.  Now I use it every single time I make hot chocolate.  Love this.  I also recommend using Mexican stone ground chocolate when making hot chocolate.

"I used this over a three week period and am generally pleased with the results.  Generally speaking my normal skin moisturizing routine for years and years and years has been a combo of shea butter and coconut oil.  I live in an area where winter is can be bitter and can last from October to April some years.  Indoor air can become very drying as can outside wind.  I am also a woman of color so dryness is incredibly visible on my skin, hence I hold moisturizing as a necessary part of daily grooming.This is a light moisturizer and while it would never replace by go to's it does give the skin a nice smooth texture with no greasiness or tacky feel.  It has no obnoxious scent which is a plus.  The instructions say to apply it liberally to wet skin and then rinse off, but not to apply it feet as it can be slippery.  I didn't experience any slippery feel but results may vary.In a three week period with daily use estimate I used about half the container.So in sum a nice light moisturizer with no sticky feel, no obnoxious scent.  I would probably limit my personal use to this in the summer/fall and keep my heavier moisturizing in the winter months.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86WFLN1PB1NU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0107QOZ66#wasThisHelpful","R86WFLN1PB1NU","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I find my opinion of this has already beenv ery well expressed by other three-ish starred reviews.As others have said set up is a breeze.  Instructions are not quite clear, but I managed to get it all up and running in just a few minutes.  Take it out of the box, plug it in to an available LAN port on your current router and that is about 99% of the set up.  It does come with a disc that says you need to use it, but I never did.  There is a website to do some additional set up.  It comes with a pre-set security key which you can changeSo that was a pro.I got this mainly because we are a very connected family.  Multiples devices are running through our router all over the house.  Three desktop computers, two laptops, all of our phones, a couple of tablets, a couple of smart tvs.  We stream incessantly and truthfully we don't really have buffering issues or anything like that.  But  figured I'd used this to distribute some of the load, so to speak, and to see if at leas the A/C enabled devices would benefit from some additional speed.While I did not do any actual measurements, I did not *feel* like I saw an appreciable change in download or streaming speed.  Honestly, we have excellent internet where I live.  The only issue we've ever had is in obscure corners of the house where sometimes we get low signal strength, and I thought this might mitigate that.  But nope.  No difference.I do plan to experiment a bit more with some settings though, so maybe I'll update if anything changes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FGDR8PPLGXH1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPDPFMI#wasThisHelpful","R3FGDR8PPLGXH1","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this because my tablet is used primarily for work meetings.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 note that I got because of the ability to write notes.  However as I quickly learned, I am much more at ease typing that I am in writing these days.  And I don't like the keypad that pops up on the tablet.  Hence I needed a dock.I like this on for a couple of reasons:1 - it is sturdy so it it also serves to protect the tablet in case of drops2 - It is flexible.  The tablet pops right into some adjustible anchors at the top and the sides and they sorta 'sqeeze' the tablet in.  Also, the case folds completely back when i just want to use the tablet as a table (no keyboard) or pops up like a de facto laptop.  It also makes sure all the ports are accessible (earbuds, camera eye, charging) etc.3 - The set up was simple.  A quick bluetooth pair and we were good to go.4 - The battey life is insane.  I don't think I've had to recharge it yet (tho to be fair, when i an not using it, I do turn it off)... Still it has been over a month now.My biggest con.... is that the weight of the keyboard is enough so that it can activate the voice response when the case is closed because it can press on the front facing button of the tablet.  I don't know how many times this has happened.But overall, I really like this for my tab.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZQ7FJ4473J3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3DLTF0#wasThisHelpful","R1TZQ7FJ4473J3","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first inclination in reviewing this book is just to fill this review up with quotes from the book. I think I highlighted about 60% of the book because it was so darned quotable. Every page has something I wanted to quote out.What I liked the most: Island. She was a hoot. Really funny and a little awkward. She had an unconventional upbringing traveling the world with her globe-trotting mother, incredibly smart and bit of a polyglot. The book has portions of dialogue in French, Afrikaans, and Japanese. But for all that, she is still a bit sheltered.What I liked second most: March. He is a cold eyed killer with some background angst that gets peeled back during the course of the book. But he has some wonderful quirks. He drives like a little old lady -- within the speed limit, observing all road rules meticulously (this drives Island nuts). He also has how own personal code and he becomes fiercely protective of Island even while he sometimes still menaces her. But she likes to tweak him on his OCD -- his reaction when she purposely moves one of his maps out of alignment in his car was great. He has interesting taste in favorite animals and his own roommate is...not a person. Such an interesting, charismatic character.What I liked third most: Each chapter is headed by an excerpt from one of Island's favorite romance novels. They have titles like ""Two Earls for the Virgin"" or ""The Billionaire's Beautiful Waitress"" or ""The Shifter's Mail Order Bride."" etc. Island's romance book titles are a sweet poke at some of the more eye-roll worthy romance tropes, but the author takes Island's love of the books seriously. You never get the sense that she's bagging romance at all.And finally this book has some great supporting characters and has some nice diversity in both location and in characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IZJLCGBPMFQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJ1V5QC#wasThisHelpful","R2IZJLCGBPMFQ2","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had this product for 30 days.  I decided to use is each night and assess the product at the end of the 30 day period. I was a little surprised to learn than the term 'mask' is misleading.  When one hears 'mask' one thinks of the chalky green stuff that you either have to peel off the next day of wipe off with a cloth.  This is actually a gel/cream consistency (closer to gel -- more like a pearly-gel) that you smooth on and it absorbs into your skin.  There is none of that unpleasant tightness you get with a mask.I was happy to know that the fragrance wasn't either heavily perfumed or heavily chemical.  It isn;t unpleasant, it smells vaguely 'creamy-like' (if that is a thing).So each night I cleansed my face and smoothed this on.  I have combination skin and a bit of an an uneven tone, so I was curious to see if I would see any result.The first time I applied it, I applied too much.  You really don't need much to cover the surface of your face.  This is 4.5 oz and after 30 days of daily use, I still have a LOT of product left.  Easily enough to see me through another couple-three months of daily use.Also, do not get this into your eyes.  Stings if it gets into the eyes.  Not pleasant.So after 30 days I can say I do see a visible difference both in tone of my skin (there is some nice evenness where there was some discoloration before) and in smoothness.  It isn't some dramatic thing, but it is noticeable to me.So after my first 30 days with the product I am very pleased with the results so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ROISMIDZB6A3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD650W#wasThisHelpful","R2ROISMIDZB6A3","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I rather like this scanner.  It is flexible and fast.Flexible because it allows a variety of hook-up options -- wireless, hooked up via USB or ethernet connected.It also allows a variety of file types and gives you a veritable laundry list of where you want your scan to actually go.  You can scan text or pictures or use the included software suite to scan OCR and create editable documents.  You can create naming conventions for your scans, specify folders, send it to a cloud storage, a thumb drive or just to your computer desktop.It also includes a feeder pocket to help feed through odd sized or fragile material or business cards.It would take a lot of time to really explore the different options.I set it up as a wireless connection to send files to my computer desktop.  This is my primary use and for that it works great.  The resolution is great for text or documents but not sharp enough for pictures, imo.  It also isn't a flat bed so obviously this excludes certain types of materials from being scanned.But if you need to feed through a forty page document, it will actually scan through very quickly and seamlessly  and show up as a multipage document of your choice.So in sum, great for scanning through  text based documents quickly and efficiently.  Not so great for picture resolution.  Lots of options and flexibility.

"This second book in the Hell's Viper's series is much stronger in both writing, characterization and tone than the first book. Although I liked the main plot a lot better in the first book, I think this book benefits from familiarity with the characters gleaned from the first book so that the author is able to deepen them to very good effect.For one thing, Jasmine and Nuke have settled into their relationship. They are married and committed to each other. She is accepted as 'good people' by the others at the club. In fact her and Nuke's ultra kinky sex life is a matter of continuing entertainment to most and bafflement to some.This brings me to one thing that I think this book had that the first book lacked was a very sharp sense of dark humor. Nuke and Jasmine are hardcore into their BDSM stuff and even amongst the jaded, free p****y on-demand anywhere anytime bikers, those two are a revelation. There was one scene where the President of the club, Mitch, has a 'Why in my day...."" moment lamenting that a threesome or back-door action is no longer the high water mark of kinkiness.Also there is a darkly funny scene of Kevin, Pipe and Nuke going to dispose of bodies while Pipe fussily makes sandwiches in the back of the van and offering cookies like some Assassin Martha Stewart. The book is peppered with good moments of dialogue and humor.This installment also does a great job of showing how close Kevin, Pipe and Nuke are. In the last book we were told they were long time friends. This one, the author really brings it home. The three get more scenes together and the camaraderie between them feels very strong and so sharply defined that you have no trouble buying that they've known each other since they were kids.We get a lot more exposure to Pipe who bonds with Jasmine. And we see Kevin going to some very dark places in the aftermath of his doomed relationship with Cindy from the last book.The main plot involves a blast from Nuke's past in the form of his half-brother Holden. Holden is one of those guys who puts on a golden-boy face and make people believe he is a great guy but is in reality a devious person. I know Nuke likes to think of himself as a sociopath but he isn't because he actually has feelings. He feels love and guilt and loyalty. Now, Nuke is a psychopath, for sure but he is NOT a sociopath.  Holden is actually the real sociopath because he is nothing but calculation from the time he appears in the book.His appearance sets off a series of events that actually precipitates the first bump in the road for what had been a rather smooth sailing relationship between Jasmine and Nuke.I like where the author took these two in this book because it felt like a realistic conflict for them. It wasn't contrived but rather felt very much in keeping with their characters.  It also sets the scene for a rather epic and violent argument between the two of them, the likes of which none of their friends or members of the club thought these two would be capable of. I loved the way the argument unfolded and its aftermath.I must say the author really knows how to tell a good story and craft some great scenes. She knows the difference between 'show' and 'tell'.  The scene where Nuke has his final confrontation with Holden was well done and nicely written. I loved the way it ended.My only quibble with these books is that they feel a might too short. But only because I am enjoying them so much. Not necessarily because the story feels shortchanged. It doesn't at all.  Also, of course, the casual, sometimes extreme, misogyny that is present in these books still is problematic for me.But all in all the first two books in the series have been really engaging reading.  And I am jonesing for the next one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UDTMMVECGP9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBCSX5C#wasThisHelpful","R2UDTMMVECGP9E","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsI thought I was pretty much over MC romance novels. They tend to click too many of my 'hell-to-the-no' womanist buttons what with their 'ownership' and 'property' attitude toward women for me to be able to easily enjoy them as just fiction. Additionally this is a BDSM novel so the D/s aspect adds a whole other dimension. By all rights I should not be fine with this book at all.But I enjoyed the ever loving heck out of this! I think the intensity of the main relationship, the interesting plot and the strength of the storytelling worked to offset some of my personal mental triggers.The story actually follow two separate relationships: One that is just beginning and flourishes throughout the book and the other that is at the end and we witness the destructive aftermath and consequences of it's ending.Jasmine and Nuke are the main A-plot couple. Nuke is an interesting character. Intense as all hell, Alpha as all hell and crazy as all hell . He actually has psych eval to back that character trait up. But he is smart as a whip, deep as an ocean, well read, and falls in love with Jasmine in a way that the reader is never in doubt about his feelings. I should hate Nuke. But I didn't. I liked him. He puts all out there. He isn't some closed off broody hero. He says what he expects from Jasmine. He communicates.I also liked Jasmine but thought she wasn't as interesting as Nuke. Actually I thought she came to grips with what it meant being the ""old Lady' of an MC way too easily for a person who was essentially a civilian with no exposure to the life outside of Sons of Anarchy. Sure she had doubts. In fact the depiction of how her early fascination/fetishization of the bad-boy biker morphed to dawning horror as the reality set in when Nuke explained what he really was during their first date was well done. She liked him, she wanted him but she throttled back realistically when he told her some truths. But that all went by the wayside after he kissed her and they got to boning.But the author gave them an interesting, involved and intense relationship that I enjoyed reading about (hard-core BDSM sex scenes aside). You come to realize they are a great fit for each other. They seemed like a more hardcore, extreme version of Kevin and Vee from the tv show Shameless.The other couple was Kevin and Cindy. As the book begins they are broken up because Kevin cheated on Cindy with one the hordes of females that are seen as available p****y to the bikers. Cindy is mad and bitter. A lot of the external conflict that affects Jasmine/Nuke is because of the Cindy/Kevin fallout. Jasmine is Cindy's friend and Cindy repeatedly tries to warn Jasmine that Nuke is bad news.I loved how complex the author made Cindy. On the one hand she was eaten alive with envy as she watched her friend have the sort of relationship with Nuke that she never had with Kevin. On the other hand she actually dropped some real words of wisdom the Jasmine. The problem is that her words were always filtered through her own bitterness so it was difficult to know if she was being sincere or if she was just letting her envy talk. I think it was a bit of both.I also got the impression that Kevin had authentic feelings for Cindy, it just wasn't in him to be faithful. And Cindy exacerbated it be criticizing the biker lifestyle.It almost felt like a theme for the two couples was to understand the person you are with and not try to change them into someone else. Jasmine and Nuke largely succeed because Jasmine embraces this concept and lets Nuke just be Nuke. Cindy, otoh, fails because she is constantly trying to remake Kevin into something else disregarding what the club means to him and how much it is a part of his identity.There is a larger plot about a feud between the Hells Vipers and a rival MC that acts as both a backdrop to the two relationship plots and as an element of conflict for both. With the state of both relationships and the feud coming to a head at the end of the book.I thought the last scene of the book, between Kevin and Cindy, was very well constructed and ended the book just right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJZMX2Q5RVSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCUI12K#wasThisHelpful","RPJZMX2Q5RVSR","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book had potential to be better than it was. I like this author's voice, I really do. It is a bit irreverent and very smart. This book only had glimpses of that irreverence & smartness which is why I think this book could have done better.The basic story is that Pasha Markovitch is a Russian boxer who lives in London. He needs sponsorship to go on to bigger and better things in the sport but his lack of British citizenship is preventing that.Lily Asare has just had her life savings stolen by her boozing, gambling wastrel of a father. Without it she can't start her own business and she currently absolutely hates her current lech of a boss.Pasha's father has a solution. Lily marries Pasha so he can become a citizen by marriage. And he'll pay Lily the money.So this becomes a rather murky Marriage-of-convenience story.I rather liked Lily and Pasha together but I felt so many other elements of the story competed (too successfully, imo) with the romance. For one thing both Pasha and Lily each have a set of frightful parents. And their dysfunctional relationship with their respective parents take up some rather hefty real estate in the book.I generally like messy relationships amongst characters in books. Feels more life-like. People don't behave like book characters do, so when I see book characters behaving like real people I like it. In this case it had the effect of coming off as rather disjointed and a little un-cohesive.It may sound like I did not like this book. I did. I actually did whip right through it. But I think my rating and review in reflecting a comparison to other works the author has done and this book feels just a little not up to her normal standards.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17UY88EQPETH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUG1RWY#wasThisHelpful","R17UY88EQPETH6","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A romance that at it's heart that was a little nod to the Boss/Secretary Harlequin romances. Yet it is modern and sexy and funny. It is also a little heartbreaking...but still very romantic.This book happens concurrently with the first book in the series  where during that book we got little glimpses of what was going on with Charlotte & Gabriel.  I very much anticipated finding out what was going on with Charlotte and her T-Rex in their own book.I really enjoyed Gabriel. He was just the right sort of Alpha hero I like. I also liked that he was an unremitting work-a-holic as well and that was an actual facet of his personality that was perceived as a flaw and not a celebration. That said, I enjoyed the work-place aspects of the book. I usually do when it it is well incorporated in a story.Charlotte was a sweet heroine whose back story was rather dark. I thought Gabriel's personality eclipsed hers a bit, but still I enjoyed seeing her blossom and come into her own over the course of the story. I also felt that her anxieties around sex felt well developed. Thankfully, this book didn't fell like a case of a 'Magical Healing Penis' where Charlotte just quickly got over everything with one night of great sex with Gabriel. He had to work for her and she had to kind of heal herself before his penis got anywhere near her.Good book, really enjoyed it","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPXW6M6ND24VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1942356161#wasThisHelpful","RPXW6M6ND24VA","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review ***This is the second installment of a serialized story following the love story of Nicole and Gabriel.  She is a recent college grad who had been in love with and fascinated with Gabriel for years.  Gabriel is a few years older than Nicole and is just on the cusp of reaching commercial success with his rock band.The first book of the series #1 Crush is an erotic novella that introduces them to the reader and allows them to recognize their attraction to each other and scratch a sexual itch.  It ends with them going their separate ways, having agreed that the sex was fun but they each have other priorities.  That book was pure erotica and a sort of appetizer for this much meatier dish of a book.In this second book, Nicole and Gabriel re-enter each others orbit.  Nicole is much more into Gabe emotionally than he is to her at first.  They hook up again and their sexual attraction is immediate and strong.  From there they continue to use sex to feed their emotional attachment until the two start to build something deeper and fall in love.Because this is a serialized work, this installment doesn't dot all the romantic I's and cross all the Happy T's.  This is another segment in their road happiness, but it isn't the end of it.  There is at least one more book on tap for them.  And therein I think lies some of my problem.Since the story doesn't end here, the romantic conflict felt somewhat manufactured. The internal conflict at first is just that Nic and Gabe can't admit to each other they love each other.  This went on for awhile and it got a little tedious.  They simply couldn't communicate.  When they finally could admit their feelings, you knew that something else was going to come along and muck it up.  And it did. There is conflict that comes from and external source as well.  I actually recoiled from some of the actions/decisions of the characters in the last 10% of the book.  Honestly, it kind of put me off them.Nicole came off as immature and honestly rather stupid and easily manipulated.  Gabe fared much better and I was really on team Gabe here.  But in the end my overall feeling as I was reading wasn't that this isn't the strong,  believable obstruction between the couple and their HEA that I wanted to see them work through, but rather they here was a conflict to throw in to get them to the next book.So in that sense I think the serialization aspect works against my own emotional involvement in the story and why I just couldn't give myself over to it and thus the book just didn't 100% succeed for me.But I must commend he author's writing.  The writing is strong and assured.  This is a work of erotica.  So the sex scenes are plentiful -- PLENTIFUL -- and they are explicit and they are well done.  On the characterization front, the author does a good job of crafting two distinct people and getting you into their emotional head-space.  This is the sort of writing you want to be reading -- descriptive, emotional and interesting.I do recommend this to readers who like really sexy erotica with an angsty emotional component and don't mind serialization.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ENLLZW0BO2DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIJEI1A#wasThisHelpful","R3ENLLZW0BO2DO","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I haven;t had any so far with this machine, but the only other machine in our house that routinely drops out from our WiFi is a computer running Windows 8.  We have an IPad, a Samsung Galaxy 10 tablet, Iphones, two other desktops that run Windows 7 and never a single problem with WiFi dropouts on them.  The Windows 8 OS -- constant.  So I was worried about this one, but so far so good. (knock on wood)- Comes with a lot of Windows bloat-ware.

"This was an entertaining, gossipy, cultural & fashion history that described events that led up to and surrounded the glittery night at the Theatre Gabriel in the Chateau de Versailles that put the world on notice that American ready-to-wear fashion was to be taken seriously.The book starts out as a mini-history lesson in how French haute couture developed and how as a result, France and French designers became the<defining body of what was chic and fashionable.  It moves across the pond to also give background on how the American fashion scene developed.It is chock full of dropped names, including not only designers as far back as Worth, but also socialites, industry big wigs, society matrons, taste arbiters and even the models.  Almost every person mentioned gets a mini-biography distilled into giving you just enough information to make their story interesting and relevant.  The result is it gives the book a chatty intimacy that made the pages really turn.The book also does a great job of building up anticipation and suspense for when it finally gets to The Event.  The run up is chock full of anecdotes of the personalities, insecurities, battles and genius of not only the ten designers involved, but also of the models themselves.I admit what really attracted me to the book was what little I had heard over the years about the involvement and yes, triumph, of the black models in the show.  A lot of the credit for the success of the Americans at the event is given to the black models.  They only made up 1/3 of the models included (10 out of 30) but their presence is heavily felt.One of the things that I heard over the years -- and what this book reaffirmed -- is that the fierce walk/strut/showmanship of he black models was a huge factor in how the clothes were presented.  It also created a major contrast between the vitality, youth, brashness of the American show and the staid, stiff almost too much pageantry of the French show.The author invokes the name of the Ebony Fashion Fair as an influence on that showmanship and I immediately 'saw' in my mind's eye what it must have looked like as she describes Pat Cleveland whirling down the runway like a moth while the sophisticated Parisian onlookers gasp in awe.One of the biggest downers of the book is the lack of pictures.  There is a good reason for this as we learn in the book.  It was a confluence of many factors that make images of this night somewhat scarce.  The chairperson of the event,  Helene Marie de Rothschild ruthlessly controlled any access to images as she wanted to preserve an air of exclusivity for the show.  In addition the official American photographer was drafted to help out backstage and was not able to take as many photographs as he could have.  And finally, Liza Minelli was the celebrity performer for the Americans and her contract stipulated no film.Since the author could do a romance novelist proud in her breathless descriptions of the looks of the models and the clothes, I found myself relentlessly googling images of people just to see what they looked like.  Additionally I decided to watch the Versailles '73 documentary done by Deborah Riley Draper as a companion piece to the book.  This proved go be a great decision as the documentary had some images and even some filmed snippets and many of the personal reminiscence of the models and others who were there affirmed much of what was written in the book.All in all this was a hugely entertaining foray into fashion history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIJZ7OA999UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250052904#wasThisHelpful","R2NIJZ7OA999UU","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The blurb of this book does not suggest it would make a good romance novel.  In fact the romance novel reader in me kinda cringed.  But you know what?  I am glad I was still intrigued enough to read it.This was an unconventional romance that kind of nods it's head a little to bit the movies 'Ghost' and 'All of Me'.  It has a dark, almost uncomfortable beginning that has the effect of making you wait for when the other shoe drops.And drops it does, there is a series of events that leads to the murder-suicide that the blurb alludes to.  Spicey is killed and Baxter kills himself.  And their spirits are tied to the house they died in.And then something curious happens... the book lightens up.  Over a span of 70 years Spicey and Baxter are allowed to explore their tangled relationship and grow their feelings for each, all the time while witnessing the changes in the world around them through the various inhabitants  of the house they are stuck in.  I liked the changing of the years and the changing of the attitudes between the two.I also liked how the story ended.  Spicey was able to gain a sense of justice and synergy and she is finally able to fully return the love that Baxter has had for her for almost a century.If you are one like me to complain about the sameness of romantic stories sometimes, read this one.  It is different and refreshing.  Also very well written.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEPCVNXZGRTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBVICOQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KEPCVNXZGRTX","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sequel to the fabulous The Parfit Knight This features the Duke of Rockliffe who was a fantastic supporting character in the first book.Rock is looking for a wife and is dragged off the Worst. House Party. Ever. by his younger sister, Nell. Her two BFFs are twin daughters of the host and her biggest wish is for Rock to marry the ravishing, outgoing twin Diana.But Diana is a bitch on steroids. And Rock can't stand her. And the rest of the family are a perfect fright. Except the Cinderella-like poor relation cousin, Adeline. Adeline is treated like total crap by the family and mostly by Diana. But Adeline has learned how to cope. She is snarky as hell and uses her words like a weapon. She hates her family like whoa and doesn't care who knows.Despite himself Rock finds himself drawn to Adeline. Oh, he has absolutely no intention of getting himself in any way attached to this ratchet family. But intentions are not reality.My overwhelming feeling while reading this book was that I really wanted to set that entire family on fire. Poor Adeline to be stuck with those awful people. Ioved that she wasn't some shrinking heroine who kinda wallowed in her victim-hood. Instead she was defiant. She was ""If y'all are gonna treat me like s***, then I will wear it on my face and bring it to the dinner table!""I didn't love-love this one as much as I did the first. There was this really big climactic scene where a lot of secrets come out publicly and i thought it felt overdone and out of place for a book that had been up to that point rather good about how it was handling all of the various revelations about the characters.But I massively enjoyed both Rock and Adeline together.

"I have no idea what made me look this book up, much less buy it. But I am so glad I did.Let me first say I had never heard of this author prior to reading this book. But something about this (and it's sequel which I read immediately after) intrigued me.The writing made me feel like I was reading Heyer. Maybe if Heyer had been writing closer in spirit to authors of the 80s, but still Heyer-esque nonetheless.The heroine, Rosalind, in this book is blind. As the book starts the reader is witness to the incident that caused her blindness. Later as we meet her again we find that she's well loved by her brother, but it is an over protective smothering love that leaves her somewhat lonely and well aware that although she is beloved, she has been given no opportunity to live a normal life. She lives in a lovely home in the country with an army of devoted servants and every wish she could have granted...except for the possibility of love, marriage and family.Into her life comes Amberley, the hero. A broken axle, a snowstorm and he must take refuge at her home. Amberley is a great character. He is handsome, well dressed, witty and clever. He has a great sense of ridiculous. I liked that he wasn't some dour brooding hero but rather a guy who didn't take things too seriously and had a good sense of humor. But he was still very deep.The scenes of Amberley and Rosalind getting to know each other during their snowy ideal were fantastic. I also loved all the below stairs machinations of the servants as they observed their mistress and her mysterious guest. Amberley read the situation with Rosalind perfectly and later acts a huge catalyst of change for her.As I was reading this book I had one of those reactions that I don't get all that often anymore, the sense of really, really sinking into and just basking in the enjoyment of a well told story.The thing that takes it over the top is the bird. Rosalind has a foul mouthed parrot. For two glorious paragraphs the parrot gets a POV. I loved that. And he plays another important part in the story later.Beside the central romance, which was so well developed, I liked all the side characters and different relationships they all had with each other. There were some stands out such as the Duke of Rockliffe aka Rock (this made me giggle). I also loved how the author described the moment Amberley realized he was in love with Rosalind and later what he felt when he had no chance with her. Such good writing.After reading this I immediately picked up the sequel and some of her more hist-fiction books.

"I got this primarily for my husband who is the whitest white man I know.  He totally needs this because he does hours longs touring bike rides in the summer and he comes back with his neck, arms and other exposed parts red as a beet.  But he hates heavy sticky lotions that tend to characterize the higher SPFs.  I figured something that sprayed out couldn't be considered 'heavy'So we tested it on our trip to the Caribbean this year.  It comes out of the spray evenly with not clumping or anything.  I thought it would be tacky-sticky but it isn't.  It goes on and dries.  Out of habit I think he rubbed it on, but he didn't really have to. Thank goodness it is not heavily scented.  That would have been a show-stopper.  No.  It is lightly but pleasantly scented.  And even that fades in a bit.Truthfully, 70 SPF is probably overkill, but it did the job and he came out with no burns and he felt comfortable,  he was even able to swim for awhile and the product was still protecting him.One thing I think that may be a bit of a con vs. a pro, is that as a spray on product it may not be as long lasting as a cream product.  It feels like it will easily be used much more quickly than a lotion, since you don't control the amount that gets misted on the way you do the amount that you spread on with a lotion.  So given the price point you could be spending more on this in the long run.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S38S4ERL4QDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NR1YL2C#wasThisHelpful","R3S38S4ERL4QDM","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The shade of this lipstick is very true to the picture.  Sometimes what you get in person doesn't match what you see, but not in this case.

I live in an area that has cold, dry winters.  I carry around lip balm in various pockets and purses.  My skin tends to the dry.  So I trend away from darkly pigmented  lipsticks in the winter because usually they just wear off unevenly.  But this one has the consistency almost of a balm.

"I got this bulb because of the reviews I had seen for it that it did help some of its users at least relax & unwind. The science behind this PM bulb is that the low levels of blue light help with the increase in melatonin which in turn promotes sleepiness.The light is very low on the blue spectrum.  It gives of a mellow orangey-amber light that does look like it should be soothing and promote relaxation.  I gave it to my son to put on his bedside table because he likes to read before bed and the light he had has a harsher light.  I figured he'd be a good candidate to try this out to see if it works because he also has a hard time unwinding.After a month of use, he did tell me that he finds himself falling off to sleep more quickly each night. So anecdotally this seems to work.Another big plus is that it is an LED light that is more energy efficient and has a longer life than an incandescent bulb.  They tend to be more expensive in the short run, but in the long run they save you money.  We have been slowly replacing our incandescent lights with LEDs and this one is a good addition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ROSYYEREUAXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PLR3M0M#wasThisHelpful","R1ROSYYEREUAXA","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No, there was too much going on in this book for it to be this page length and none of it felt fully cooked.There were some great relationships, friendships, soon-to-be-ex-friendships, romantic musical chairs and last minute bombshells roiling around in this story.  All these things were juggled well in the book and I got completely immersed in all the personalities and plots.  But I also felt shortchanged.  None of them concluded to my satisfaction.  So many of the balls being juggled still felt left up in the air.Even the romance...again well done, but I still wanted them to explore each other more.This was a very well written, very interesting, completely engaging book.

Did I do it right?Even with the insecurity, the wine that I did use it on tasted fine the next day, so maybe I did do it right.Not sure if I'd continue to use this for myself but it might make a nice gift for a wine enthusiast who would most likelt appreciate it (and use it better) than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRICZ4TB5VUI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000632Q7#wasThisHelpful","RRICZ4TB5VUI6","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Smaller than I expected, but no less mighty.  I have been needing a good, reliable kitchen scale for awhile.  The reviews are easy to follow and the scale itself has a rather simple interface.  You turn it on, cycle through the weight measure you want to use (I tend to stick with ounces), use the tare feature to exclude the weight of containers etc.  It will aut-shut off after  couple of minutes of dis-use.  It comes with batteries already installed.It is a sensitive scale that can measure something as light a single raisin or a dollar bill with accuracy.Very pleased with this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GBF33KQ2O8X4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ME8VI34#wasThisHelpful","R2GBF33KQ2O8X4","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little concerned when I first took these out of the package.  I am 5'9, 150 lbs and I got large because better safe than sorry when it comes to sizing.  When I pulled them out they looked smallish.  And they did not appear to have the length (mid-calf) they had in the picture.Boy was I wrong.  They fit perfectly!  Not only that they do fall mid-calf for me.  And even better these things are light as air.  They do not have that constricty feel that some leggings have.  They are comfortable and move with me.  I wear them for every work out now.  A quick wash in cold water and they dry fast (i don't put them in the dryer, but just dry them flat on a laundry table).

"...Way out of my comfort zone that is for sure.This book is about a D/s relationship. It isn't a BDSM book with all the spankings & such, even though Rick does have a 'playroom'. It really is a relationship book about a strong submissive who completely lives the life and her search for, and successful landing of, a caring Dom.This was a very sweet book that alternates POVs between Micah, the female sub and Rick her Dom. Rick was simultaneously Masterful and nurturing, while Micah was strong minded about how she needed to cede control.The two fall in love fairly soon, but take a while to admit it, mainly because they need to negotiate their relationship on two levels. One of course is the more conventional emotional relationship and the other is making sure they are a right D/s fit for each other. I liked how the author told both levels of that story.It was also very sexy.One thing I really appreciated was reading the author's foreword on using lowercase for Micah's name as well as any other references to her (even when she refers to herself in first person the 'I' is in lowercase). Meanwhile all references to Rick is uppercase. While his proper name was expected, whenever Micah used pronouns such as 'Him' and 'He' they were also capitalized. It had the curious effect of giving him an almost God-like quality. You really start to believe in him as Dom. It was rather fascinating.Really good book, I recommend it even to people like me who get a little squiffy about D/s stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L3ISJ2QUH258/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PSEO3XS#wasThisHelpful","R1L3ISJ2QUH258","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So what happens when an avowed racist white inmate finds out the woman he has been exchanging letters with (and falling in love with) via a pen pal program is black?That question gets answered in this book. Kinda.I found the premise interesting and the writing to be clean. It was engaging and I found Katie to be a sympathetic heroine.More problematic was Logan. For a racist he is remarkably bad at it. Honestly, he couldn't really get his back into it, really. For Logan, his brand of racism feels more like something he learned by rote and circumstance, rather than something he truly internalized. He begins to fall in love with Katie in her letters and once he discovers she is black, he takes a moment to be shocked and dismayed... but then she's pretty! So he can get over it.The book succeeds in what it attempts, meaning it took it's own premise and made it work. By not making Logan this bone-deep racist in the first place, the ease with which he reconciles himself to being with Katie doesn't feel so unbelievable.On the one hand, since I don't tend to like my leisure, escapist reading to spend too much time on people navel gazing about race, I bought what this book was selling.On the other hand, I can't help but wonder how much more affecting and powerful the story could have been if the author had allowed Logan's racism to go deeper than his epidermis?In any case this was an quick and interesting read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCO0GAZQY4DL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0BV752#wasThisHelpful","RCO0GAZQY4DL6","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Felt like a mystery/police procedural more than anything else.  Basically Ash & Janvier investigate stuff.  But the bad guy was telegraphed early on. So I didn't feel any real suspense personally.  Also, there was very little romantic tension as Ash & Janvier already have a thing going before the book starts.  The romantic conflict is based on a Big Secret of Ash's....but it did not feel very mind-blowing.  Naasir was fascinating, though.

"This is a typical Joan Wolf Trad Regency which means it is well written, with some actual real history included, and a smart romance at the center of it all.The heroine is dragged to Africa as a missionary by her zealot father and is  rescued by Hero from being sold into a Harem.  Back in England she just wants to settle to a ""Normal Life.""Yeah, RightHer life experiences have touched her too much and ""normal life"" in England doesn't really fit who she is.

"-  Picks right up where the last book ended, hence this is not the place to start the series a new reader would miss a lot-  Rowan, Clive and a few trusted people from their inner circle are on the Hunt for Sorceress Vamp Enyo-  But...for a hunt the characters felt curiously like they were standing still in places-  A little too much discussion, not enough action, imo-  Romance between Rowan & Clive takes a nice definitive step.  This was a very nice development.-  I am loving how the author is crafting the political situation between Hunter Corp and Vampire Nation & Rowan caught in middle.  For me this was the best part of this book and feels like awesome set up for a possible change of course for the next book for Rowan-  Final conclusion is that this one felt mostly like filler.

"I loved the first book in the series. It was a good, solid book that looked at the building of a relationship from the inside. No real external conflict, just the struggles and issues that a pair of grown ups with lives and a past have. It also did a great job of drawing a picture of a big, complex family as well as a fantastic friendship between two friends, Natalie (the heroine from that book) and Tuesday (the heroine in this book).So when Tuesday and Ezra circle around each other in that first book, meeting eyes and zinging with awareness, the anticipation for them was set.With such high expectations I was a bit nervous whether this book would really meet them.Boy did it.Just like the first book, there are no external conflicts here for the couple. They acknowledge they want each other. But each has a lot of baggage that is potentially problematic in trying to start up something new.Tuesday is still coming back from the devastating loss of her first husband to a quick and brutal bout with cancer. While Ezra is a 5-years clean ex-heroin addict. The book does a great job of letting us in on how the two of them are somewhat still broken by these things but because of their relationship, are starting to put it behind them and heal. Ezra struggles a bit more than Tuesday and I must say I liked that the author allowed this aspect to be a little lopsided, rather than trying to make both of their issues completely equal.Ezra is terrified of back-sliding back into the behaviors that made his addiction possible. We learned quite a bit of what happened to him and how it affected his family in the first book, so this one just colors in the lines a little bit more and gives some insight from his POV. He is deliberate in the things he does and the controls he needs to wield over his life. I was fascinated by the parts where he described how much of his success in staying clean was the result of behavior modification and how vigilant he still is. So Tuesday becoming a real part of his life must be approached with some caution by him.Of course, Tuesday is a grown-ass woman with ideas of her own and I like how she pushes him and doesn't shy away from saying things. She doesn't tip-toe and is rather frank in her feelings.This is a relationship book more than anything and it follows the pattern of the first book which just allows the couple of fall in love without odd misunderstandings or unrealistic situations.I enjoyed this quite a lot and am looking for the next one in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21MELVI26IM7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L0XO3F4#wasThisHelpful","R21MELVI26IM7N","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is equal parts humorous chick-lit and a loving ode to the journey a black woman takes when deciding to wear her hair natural.  It used the main character's Mahogany's transition from a life of relaxers and weaves to a natural style as a framing device and metaphor for her changing love life.When we first meet Mahogany, she has been in a seven year relationship with her Indian boyfriend Vinyay (Vinny) and he has yet to propose.  This bothers her.  What bothers her more is that she has never, not once, met any member of his family.  The obvious reason for this is that he can't tell his family about his  black girlfriend.  That is true and it isn't.  It is more than just being in an IR relationship on the down low. One of the reasons I like this book so much is that is is never just that simple.What comes next is reminiscent of that song in that commercial 'I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair.'  Mahogany, in a moment of in vino veritas, realizes that the time, money and effort she spends on her hairstyle -- a style that she was maintaining because Vinny liked it so much -- was not worth it.  So she does the Big Chop.Thereafter each step in her new hair journey becomes another step away from that relationship and toward another one.  Not only that, but in learning how to care for her natural hair -- something she has never had to learn before -- she is also learning how to care for her heart.Hence, we meet her grumpy co-worker Trent.  Trent and Mahogany have this great hate-hate relationship that morphs into an uneasy detente and then into attraction.  Another In Vino Veritas moment shifts their relationship irrevocably.  I was totally on Team Trent here.The book is told in Mahogany's first person POV and she is hysterical.  I just loved her.  She has exactly the type of life outlook I want all my best girlfriends to have.This was a fantastic book.  And by the time Mahogany had gotten to her full on Angela Davis fro', I was cheering for her and Trent.I only wish it were longer or we got an epilogue or something.  It is categorized as a novella and kindle page count has it at 173 pages.  It felt meatier than most novellas and I don't feel like I got shortchanged in the story.  But still {{whines}} I wanted more time with them. {{/whines}}.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PESN8N5MMGLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG9LZYC#wasThisHelpful","R3PESN8N5MMGLV","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I always prefer toaster ovens over toasters and I like the Black and Decker series.This is a nice, compact toaster oven that fits four bread slices.  it comes with a removable crumb tray for easy cleaning and a nice broiler pan.It has baking, toasting and broiling functionality.  I rarely actually bake in a toaster oven except to re-heat slices of pizza or pie etc.  There is a 'keep warm' setting as well.The toaster setting has 3-generic temps light, medium and dark and it does toast true.  I turned it to the 'dark' setting when I first tried this because my previous toaster had a very stingy definition of what 'dark' meant.  But not this one, glad I was watching because it would have been really dark.It heats up very quickly and the top part of the toaster oven can also get hot to the touch, I actually used it quickly soften butter while I was making my bagel.All in all it does what it says it does, it functions well and it is a reasonable price.

"I am giving this a three-stars for now, may up my rating or lower depending on how I can live with the bulbs & functionality over time.The pros:- The cool factor.  The ability to control your lights, dim them, program them with just your phone.- The clarity and brightness of them- The 9.5 watts, very efficientThe cons:- The set up started so promisingly and then devolved into frustration.  It took awhile for it to discover my devices.  I had to restart a couple of times.  I have an IOS device.- You can only use your phone (or tablet) with the App to remote control the lights. You can't use a computer, not even one that is connected to the same wifi connection your app is.- In the end you are paying for the cool factor.

"I bought this for my older son who likes to draw and needed a desk of his own to do his homework.  It took my husband and younger son about an hour to assembled.  The finished product is a very handsome piece of furniture that also feels sturdy and well constructed.  I was very nervous about the glass top, but it also feels sturdy and I has a reassuring thickness.  It is apparently tempered and so far has no scratches or anything, even though my son has been using it daily.We chose not to put the casters on the bottom and the desk is staying put.My biggest con, is that I wish it had a lip that ran across the bottom of the desk to keep papers etc. from slipping off when the desk is at a tilt.  There is a pencil/pen holder but that isn't adequate to keep stuff slipping off.Also, I need to remind my son that it only allows 25 lbs of weight on the surface.  Not an issue if all you;re doing is drawing or writing on it, but he can't set huge heavy books or anything on it.

"I generally like this author's voice so I tend to graviate toward her work.In this one, the heroine Laura is a young widow who had a scandal in her past and has been consciously trying to live a correct life since then.  But the past collides with the present when her young niece, on the cusp of her debut for the season, falls in love with a young man.  The son of the same man Laura herself was involved with so scandalously years ago.  In order to prevent history from repeating itself, Laura attempts to nip the romance in the bud.  But fate throws a lot of obstacles in her way.My 3-star rating reflects the actual romance between Laura and Ross and it is the strongest and most enjoyable element of the book.  Since they fall in love rather quickly, the conflict is primarily external and  unfortunately, this is the part that I think is the weakest.The ill-considered romance of Laura's niece starts off promisingly enough as a premise, but it devolves quickly because the niece is rather unsympathetic.  Actually I hated her.  It didn't take long for me to want her to be left to her fate with the loser who would eventually make her life miserable.  I wanted Laura to just wash her hands of the brat ans say, ""oh, well, this is what you wanted.  I tried to warn you."" and let her make her own mistakes.  But this is a romance, and Laura is a heroine, so she has Romance Novel Heroine disease, which means she is almost too nice and selfless.There was some amusing comedy-of-errors aspects of the story that result in some cute plot twists, especially as Laura lies outrageously to a couple she meets and she and Ross must make everything come out right.  But  in places there was a bit of a kitchen sink feel to the plot.  In addition to keeping the young lovers apart, there is some domestic drama with Laura's sister, a resolution of the old scandal and a spying subplot as well.Still the writing was good and the story flowed.  And it was an amusing way to spend an afternoon.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7WKP44DKVNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B79UQ34#wasThisHelpful","RQ7WKP44DKVNR","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this.  I've read other books that use reality shows as their settings.  Of all the books I've read with this setting, this is probably the one that feels like it gets closest to the truth. The manipulation, using a small thing and changing the narrative to make it worse than it is, sound-biting to create a narrative etc. Felt very smart.This is told from the heroine Lola's POV.  I loved her voice.  She was funny and smart and had a good sense of the ridiculous as she knows she is just the token black girl on the show, so she kinda plays around with her pre-ordained fate.  The writing was really quite witty.  Just the sort of light, breezy tone a book like this needed.One of my quibbles is with the hero Neil.  He felt opaque to me.  Understandable in some ways as this is told from Lola's POV, but still I wanted to see a little more of what made him tick.The supporting characters were great. Very intrigued by Neil's brother Aidan and the camera guy, Wedge. I also love how the author conceptualized Aram, Lol's cousin. In another book he would have been the gay best friend. In this book he is straight but with a gayfabulous sense of style.Finally the author  did not fall into any of my pet peeve traps with skin, hair, eye coloring etc. descriptions. I give her clever points for this sentence:""She had a Valrhona complexion...""I have begun to heartily dislike ""food coloring' descriptors (you know, chocolate, caramel, mocha, honey-skinned etc.)  This is how you  use chocolate to describe  coloring without actually using the word 'chocolate.'

"My rating reflects the fact that I enjoyed the heck out of this book.  Almost immediatelyLord Crane is the titular character, a despised second son who inherited his earldom after the death of both his father and older brother.  He is tall, handsome, well dressed, never a hair out of place and has an incredibly colorful and varied background.  He is also funny and an all around decent guy.  I really dug Crane and want to hear more about his various adventures when he lived in enforced exile before coming back to claim his inheritance.Stephen, the other major protagonist, is not quite so blindingly awesome (or as tall) as Crane.  And yet he manages to create as much of a vivid, memorable  impression as Crane.  Poor, from a family disgraced by scandal, Stephen is a mage who is called upon to help Crane escape a death curse. He is acerbic and biting and honorable as all heck.While Crane's character is immediately engaging, Stephen's character is a lot more stealthy.  And in the end, when I closed the book, he actually felt more dynamic than Crane.  The Stephen we met at the end was not the same Stephen we met in the beginning.  I liked how the author peeled his layers away. The plot was all kinds of fun.  There is a magic system in place that governs who practices and how it is administered and controlled.  Also how it works. Poor Crane is laboring under a death curse and the ways the author allows it to manifest are inventive and creepy.  Even the descriptions of Crane's home and the surroundings and the people all play into the dark, macabre, creepy  elements of the magic swirling around Crane.And yet, the book does not feel  that dark at all.  The dialogue is great and Crane has such a smart wit and Stephen has a such a dark humor that you find yourself gliding through the pages.  The relationship between Crane and his Man-of-All-trades, Merrick is all that that sort of relationship should be.  And the relationship that builds between Crane and Stephen is also well conceived and great to experience.I take half a star off, though, because I was not convinced of the romantic connection between Crane and Stephen.  They felt more bromantic than romantic.  It almost felt like simply dotting an 'i' or crossing a 't' to have them consummate a sexual relationship that I wasn't completely feeling.  In the end they are together and you know they are embarking on a relationship that has some significance given that it also ties into some powerful magic.  But yeah, just wasn't feeling them as a couple.I do plan to continue the series because it was sooo good and I want to hang out with them some more.  Maybe the romantic chemistry that I am missing will manifest then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X83XEMF7PGGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C6ZTNAU#wasThisHelpful","R1X83XEMF7PGGI","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""This is happening."" - Kate DanielsYes it was.  And like Kate I wasn't ready.  I really wasn't ready.But so what?  I love that the Andrews did this.  They threw me a curveball.  I was so sure Kate we'd get a little more lead up before a big showdown.  But nope. This book skips the appetizers and goes straight to the main course.The action kicks in almost immediately and it is relentless.  Kate and crew are constantly in crisis mode and it becomes increasingly clear that it is all leading straight to Roland.Because Kate is aware that she may not live much longer she becomes a bit ruminative. She faces some hard truths about Voron and thinks about her past, her training  and what she has  been made to endure to prepare for just this thing.Fittingly, this book also acts as somewhat of an old-home week as characters who had been instrumental in pivotal ways in the earlier books make re-appearances and prove to be instrumental in pivotal ways  again.  It was a nice to see some call backs and realize how they fit within the overall narrative.  Even Kate's own revelations are the fruit of seeds that had been planted early in the series.But before we get to the climactic scenes and the inevitable showdown, there is some business that needs to be taken care of.  There are some really, really, really satisfying fight scenes.  Some vengeance is meted in a very satisfactory manner.I loved the ending and resolution of the events of this book.  Loved it. It was smart and logical and gratifying.  It opens some some really interesting possibilities.  The epilogue was, well, rather epic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VJ3ZEPXWAI7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6JV4#wasThisHelpful","R1VJ3ZEPXWAI7V","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So the X small is a pretty sweet little automatic espresso maker.  It isn't huge that's for sure but I don't think I'd actually call it Extra-small.  It was a tick bigger than I expected.  Takes up about the same counter space as my Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer.It comes with great instructions.  The instructions walk you clearly through initial use, operations and maintenance. It has a quick start guide and a full instructional pamphlet.  They come in three languages (French, Spanish & English) but each set of language instructions is it's own little set, so you can just read the ones in your language and discard the others if you want.The operational design is also really nice and seems to be geared toward the decidedly non-Barista in most of us.  There are a series of lights that easily telegraph when things are a 'Go' (green) and where you need to pay attention (red).  If anything isn't properly closed, if the water is low, if you need to remove the dregs etc.  a light on the panel will alert you.It has a grinder in the top that automatically measures and grinds beans when you start the brew process.  There is a hopper where you store the beans.  It also has a grinder key that allows you to adjust the grind in 5-increments from fine to coarse.There are three modes: Steam, hot water, coffee brew.The steam wand comes with a panarello, which, imo, is a must for a foamy-milk-making amateur like myself.  Basically, you stick it in the cold milk and it does all the work infusing it with the air to make your foam.  It takes about 15ish seconds for the temp to come up hot enough for steam when you first turn it on.The brew mode is pre-measured to give you either single or double shots.  You can however program it to change volume.  The major con here is that you can't change the amount of coffee it uses per shot.  All of that is automated inside the machine. The instructions do say that the machine is designed to brew a ""true Italian espresso"" coffee.  But if you like your espresso super strong, this may not be the one for you.In Hot water mode, it simply dispenses hot water.  Just position your cup under the panarello.It takes a little practice to get the flow of the machine, especially if you go from foaming to brewing back to foaming.  There are little in between steps that the machine needs to adjust itself.  Also in the switching from brew to steam, it can sputter a little, so have a paper towel handy to wipe droplets.The water container is small approx. 32 oz.  So you'll be refilling a lot.  The dregs tray and the brew assembly are easily accessed and removed for cleaning.It took me about three brew cycles until I think it was where it needed to be.  Taste wise, it was perfect for me.  So I loved this!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W2V3GZIBMS3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8PZVBK#wasThisHelpful","R2W2V3GZIBMS3M","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not gonna lie, when I saw all the parts come out of the box, i was not enthused.  I actually let it sit for a few days.  But I finally rolled up my sleeves and got to work.I should not have been concerned.  Even for the mechanically challenged (Me!), putting this chair together was a dream.  The pieces are clearly labelled with letters, and directional signs like 'this side faces front'  and 'this side goes up'.  The instructions are clear and easy to read as well.  Gone are the days of line drawings that only vaguely resembles the pieces in your hand.  the thin booklet was bullet pointed with concise instructions and each piece on the sheet was labelled exactly to the piece in your hand.  Even the hardware -- the bolts, washers etc. -- were all clearly labelled so you know when you'd need them.  It took us 35 minutes to put it together and some of that was just organizing.  Everything you need to assemble this is in the box, it comes with a tightening/twisting thingy (see, mechanically challenged). No additional tools necessary.Once it was done, this was a damned handsome chair.  Dark grey with sleek silver/chrome accents.  It swivels, it adjusts up and down, it glides on smooth casters,  and it tilts.  Our only moment of concern was the tilt.  The tension was super tight and it did not move at first, but again -- Instructions are your friend -- and it told us how to adjust the tension.  The arms even swivel up  to allow pushing the chair in close flush against the desk.It is very comfortable as well.  Very pleased with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HC8Z2SN426GA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0OCX0U#wasThisHelpful","R3HC8Z2SN426GA","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"10-17-14 UPDATE:  So I upped my original review from 4-stars to 5 just on the weight of fantastic customer service (original review follows under the dotted lines).  We had been using these light pretty non-stop since we got them.  My husband rides a lot on trails and seasonal roads.  They are not paved and are often bumpy.  At some point during one of these rides the enclosure that holds the battery on rear light must have worked itself lose.  Truthfully, since we fiddle with the flasher setting, we may not have screwed it in as tightly as we should.  Whatever the case, a subsequent ride on an even rougher road caused the base to disengage completely.  My husband didn't notice it was gone until he got back home.Bummer.  No problem, though.  We really liked the lights so we just decided we'd call the company and order a replacement base.  The company cheerfully replied to our inquiry email and said they'd simply send a replacement base.  No charge.  When the package arrived, it wasn't just the base, but an entire new light set.We had already liked the product, but it the extra little things like this that foster brand loyalty.  Of course I do not expect future lights or replacements for free, but this was unexpected and very gratifying.  And we are more careful of checking to make sure the base is completely screwed in.---------------This is a really nice little light set and perfect for my needs.  The rear light is a red LED, which can be steady or flash, I set it to flash.  The front light is white and is adjustable to 'beam' or 'flood'.  Both lights are incredibly bright and easily seen in the dark.The lights have a nice weight and heft, and all the stuff you need to install is right in the box, including batteries.They are easily installed and feel very firmly seated.  They not only installed on my  regular bike, but I also installed them easily on our ElliptiGo (outdoor elliptical bike) with great result as well.We do not do a lot of night time riding, but once in awhile we can be caught out in the dusk and these more than meet the need.Very pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUOSCGHTNKXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L4YD37S#wasThisHelpful","RFUOSCGHTNKXT","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are two things this item does well:  1) Be a clock and 2) Be a bluetooth speakerThe rest is all needless complication.The clock had 4 modes:1. Standby - this is the one where you set the time & the alarms.  You can't do anything else in this mode.  For instance, don't try to adjust the volume in this mode because it will think you are trying to set an alarm because volume and alarm set share the same buttons.  This feels counterintuitive because no matter what mode you are in you should still be able to change the volume.2. Bluetooth - this is the one where you can listen to a BT paired item through the speakers3. AUX -  didn't use4. FM - this is the one where you can listen to the radioThe clock allows you to use it as a charging dock for your iphone.  I didn't mind that you needed to use your own charging cable, but the threading and the physical st up to get it properly seated felt, again, needlessly complicated.  Since it makes you listen to your music through bluetooth, the dock is really just there for charging.  Why so why go through all the trouble of doing the threading etc. etc. when all you need to do is set the phone next to the clock-radio in order to listen through the speaker.  That is what bluetooth is for.,  I will say the speaker was fairly decent so no problems there.You can use the little phone symbol to answer incoming calls.  But you can't use it to initiate an outgoing call.You can only use 'radio' or 'buzz' as an alarm.  The buzz is really more of a beep.  And the volume on it is incredibly low.  I had the volume set on the highest it could go and the beep was still difficult to hear, especially above a white noise machine.So in sum, this is a pretty good clock and bluetooth speaker.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IFTLGK2EM83K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HNO81WK#wasThisHelpful","R1IFTLGK2EM83K","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It also comes with a MS Office trial and McAffee anti-virus.

"Normally I run like my hair is on fire, far away from anything that is a retelling of or homage to or re-imagined Jane Austen fiction.  But as far as that goes, this wasn't bad.  It was clearly little bits and pieces of Austen fic & characters with the requisite drawing room romance and plot.  The thing that makes this a little different is the addition of magic.In this society, people -- young women especially -- use Glamour to enhance the beauty of their surroundings, create a mood, or even just scent the air with a hint of their favorite fragrance.  I liked the concept of the magic system and thought the author did a good job of incorporating it into the more familiar romance plot.Overall this was a fun little story and I actually enjoyed it more as it went on.

"You know.... I was really rather disappointed in this book.Tangled,  the first book in this series is a 5-star favorite of mine.  It was funny as hell and written with such dash and verve that it stood head and shoulders above a lot of books I read last year.I couldn't wait for this one.  To be fair, the writing is still fantastic.  I really enjoy this author's ability to create atmosphere, how she crafts her dialogue, and the fact that she writes humor so well.This time instead of getting a story told in Drew's needle sharp voice, this one is told from Kate's POV.  Honestly, I didn't quite connect with Kate the way I did with Drew.  Maybe I am a secret Dude Bro at heart?  Or maybe it could just be that it felt like the author was really going for broke with Drew and so the first book came off as a bit more fearless?  At any rate, Kate's voice felt more subdued.  Or rather more conventional.But that isn't what disappointed me.  Not really.  My biggest issue with the book is the plot.  The basis of this book is that Drew and Kate needed to get broken up.  How to accomplish that because they were so in love at the end of the previous book?  Why, a Grand Mis of course!  And frankly it wasn't even that clever of a Grand Mis.The whole thing depended on Drew and Kate speaking at cross purposes.  He was talking about one thing without actually explicitly saying in actual words what he was talking about.  Ditto with Kate.  I won't say what the Grand Mis was about, but it was unbelievable because all Kate needed to do was use one  very unmistakeable word and the whole misunderstanding would have been over right there.  But she never actually says it.  And I just couldn't buy that a guy like Drew -- the Drew from Tangled -- wouldn't spew out everything he was thinking.So the whole foundation of the plot was really rather.... disappointing.Still I find the author's writing style and voice so appealing that even with the plot, I couldn't help but read the darned thing.  And late in the book, the POV switches back to Drew and BOOM!  Immediately the energy of the book spikes.So yeah, didn't live up to the first one but still I'd recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TO51ZMI422ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EB9ZA24#wasThisHelpful","R3TO51ZMI422ZB","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was such an engrossing read and so well done.  It felt smart and even though the romance kind of takes second place to all the stuff that is going on with Carter, it was enough to feed my romance soul.Carter is a high school senior whose mother is an alcoholic.  He is a mass of emotions.  He loves her but he hates her.  He is ashamed that she drinks.  She isn't really a visible drunk and she isn't abusive or anything, so they manage to hide it, somewhat.  But Carter feels the burden of it all.  Of keeping his mother's alcoholism a secret,of trying to keep his younger sister from knowing, of trying to keep his mother from inadvertently harming her.The only time he feels any sense of freedom is when he is playing basketball.  And when he meets the new girl, Kira.  Kira is a free spirit who changes her look and hair like a chameleon.  She is funny and smart and she comes along at just the right time.This book is told in Carter's first person POV and his voice was very vibrant. I loved Carter.  I wanted to reach into the book and give him a big old hug.  He needed it bad.  I also loved him and Kira together.  They were sweet and awesome.This is a solidly written book that for once made me forget that I don't really read YA.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HJXBIOY7E7L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MP3Z1G#wasThisHelpful","R25HJXBIOY7E7L","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I got this book, I read the sample and was cautiously optimistic. There were no glaring typographic or grammatical errors. The premise seemed interesting. I love the friends-to-lovers trope. I really enjoy reading about smart, urbane professionals of which both Lacey and Rye were. It took place in Atlanta, so it sidestepped the small-town thing that is a bit overdone. So, yeah, I was happy.However my problems begin very early on with the book.  Before you can blink an eye Rye and Lacey go from longtime friends enjoying a friendly celebratory embrace to him having her top off and he's suckling on her breasts. In a public place.The sex in this book is pervasive.  There is a lot of it. I would venture to guess that approx. 70% this book is sex related. Either Lacey and Rye are having it or someone is talking about it or they are busily clenching/getting hot/wet/hard thinking about it.Now, truthfully a lot of sex in a book does not bother me. I like and read a lot of erotica. I actually prefer my romances to have open-door sex scenes. So it isn't the sex per se that bothers me. It is the bad sex that bothers me.  This book is chock full of poorly, crudely and rather purple-y written sex scenes.  The sex should have made me hot and bothered on Lacey & Rye's behalf.  But it didn't I kept giggling or rolliing my eyes at them.I could have tolerated the bad sex if the story had been strong enough to overcome it. But sadly there wasn't enough of it to really sink into.  And what there was of it felt full of tropes.Lacey and Rye start out as Lacey insists :""no strings, no rings"" But within one chapter Lacey is fretting about being nothing but a booty call. She's beginning to fall in love but worries about her family and what people will think.As well she should, oddly her family were very resistant even though they'd known Rye all his life.  And then there is a scheming other woman and Lacey's lack of consistency from chapter to chapter.The one bright spot in this book is Rye.  Even through all the alpha-male chest thumping and ""Whose p***y is this!?"" demands, he is actually a pretty good character.  He is gone over Lacey and makes no bones about it.  He wants a real relationship, he shows her in every way he wants her.  He is a decent guy and tries to convince Lacey they have a future.But Lacey falls into one of my pet peeve traps.  While Rye is jumping through hoops to show that he is in this for the long haul, she is distrustful and illogical and really can't see what is in front of her face.  I found her very hard to root for.it is obvious this author knows how to write.  I just wish the story had been more engaging and the sex less pervasive.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17P0272VDQT09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBA6MJC#wasThisHelpful","R17P0272VDQT09","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never read a mm romance before and I think this was a very good book to start with.This one hit all my happy places.  It has two very appealing protagonists who have chemistry to burn and compliment each other wonderfully.  It has really good supporting characters that add to the plot as well as act as interesting characters all on their own, it has an interesting setting, and finally it has antagonists with believable (if stupid) motivation.The book is told from Whyborne's first person narrative.  Whyborne is the youngest son of an incredibly wealthy business magnate.  He has rejected his father's ideas of what he should do with his life, choosing rather to use his formidable intellect to become a philologist at a local museum.Whyborne doesn't have the most forceful personality.  His father is overbearing and makes no bones about the fact that he considers Whyborne a disappointment.  His older brother has been somewhat of a bully. And Whyborne keeps himself somewhat repressed because of his nature.  Suffice to say, Whyborne has some self esteem issues.Griffin is a great compliment to Whyborne.  Handsome and dashing, his bright waistcoats paint him the peacock to Whyborne's more sober peahen (Whyborne always wear brown or grey).  He has the self confidence that Whyborne lacks, and yet he does have his own vulnerabilities which are revealed rather vividly.  I liked how the two slowly came together and how the relationship developed.As far as the plot, it was a mix of gothic horror and paranormal that moved briskly and was really rather entertaining.  As mentioned above I love how the motives of the antagonists for getting involved in what they were doing felt realistic and understandable.I can't not mention the fabulous Christine.  She is an archaeologist who works at the museum with Whyborne.  She is sharp and has lovely pithy observations.  Through her we get to see the frustrations of a smart, educated woman in a male dominated society.  She is also an awesome friend and handy with a gun.  I hope she remains a big part of the series.Definitely gonna pick up the next book if only to see how Whyborn and Griffin develop and to hang with Christine some more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MZF6W43U5NKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHH0YF2#wasThisHelpful","R2MZF6W43U5NKR","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had never used a french press before but my husband swears that the coffee tastes better.

It was very helpful.It took a couple of tries and some experimentation with measuring & steep time before we finally got the result we liked.

"This book was a very nice surprise. It was well written, had engaging characters and a romance that felt naturally occurring. It also had a great sense of place and atmosphere.Zora is a NYC editor at a big fashion magazine who is on an enforced ""break"" from her job because she has been acting erratically. Turns out, Zora is suffering from rather vivid dreams involving an ancestor, a former slave named Julia who lived among and married into the Lakota Sioux 150 years ago. At the behest of her therapist, Zora travels to South Dakota to the Oglala nation to see if she can find out any information with the hopes of stopping the dreams.There Zora meets John Iron Hawk the Chief of Police on the Reservation. He is immediately suspicious of her and her motives having seen too many times a slick rich looking people like her come to the People to do silly articles. But Zora earns an ally in an elder who feels something in her story and is determined to help her seek the truth.This is a romance, but it is more appropriately a romantic suspense because there is a real mystery surrounding the fate of Julia and Zora is placed in jeopardy as she unearths those secrets. Also present is a light dose of the mystical woo-woo.While this story has some of the rather recognizable romance elements (Zora and John's animosity hides attraction) and romantic suspense elements (the bad guy manages to orchestrate things just so in order to silence Zora) the thing that I liked best were the pieces that were not necessarily plot related.There was a nice bit of setting in that the book takes place on a Reservation that that is struggling with poverty and services not being properly funded despite being the site of a thriving Casino that is raking in millions weekly. The frustration of the people is shown in little and big ways. And the results of being at the mercy of leaders who aren't looking out for their best interest is also shown in little and big ways. In the midst of this comes Zora with her poking about and raising hackles.The biggest con for me is the suspense element of the romantic suspense. I don't think the author connected the dots in a believable way. I thought the villain was too immediately concerned with Zora. Her excuse of wanting to track down info about an ancestor from 150 years ago should not have caused the consternation it did as early as it did. We later find out why her poking about was of concern and how a 150 y.o mystery could be dangerous to someone in the present time, but I don't think the road to that realization was as carefully plotted as it could have been.Overall though this was a good story that had nicely crafted characters, an evocative mood and a believable romance","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HMKOB4ROVIO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1HSRVQ#wasThisHelpful","R2HMKOB4ROVIO2","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the blurb that comes with this book doesn't quite get the tone of this book.  I was attracted to it solely on the name of the author and only cursorily even read the blurb.  Unfortunately, imo, the blurb makes it sound like this is some breathless billionaire romance. With Magic!  It isn't.  It really isn't.The book is set in Modern day Houston where history has been slightly altered where people have magical ability. Powerful magic users formed Houses that were headed by the most powerful users in their family known as Primes.In this setting we are introduced to Nevada Baylor, a young woman who is the primary investigator in the PI firm her family owns and runs.  She is given the job to track down the young heir to one of the major Houses and return him to his family before he is killed.  He is a powerful prime who can control fire.  And he fancies himself some sort of anarchist who doesn't want to knuckle down to the man!  Whatever.But Nevada isn't the only one looking for the destructive young man.  Mad Rogan (and he is always called Mad Rogan)  is the Prime of another very powerful house and he has a vested interested in the young man too.  He inserts himself into Nevada's investigation and causes her no end of consternation.  Not only because he is interfering, but also because they are very attracted to each other and she simply does not like him.When I began reading this book I was curious to know how it would be.  I was already very deeply invested in Andrews' Kate Daniels series and also really enjoyed their Edge series as well as a bunch of scf-fi novellas.  Those books all felt very distinct from each other so I was excited to see what new world we would get.This one does not disappoint, although I would say that the tone and setting it is reminiscent of their Edge series.Nevada is a strong heroine to hang a series on.  With the exception of the first chapter and the last one, the book is told from her first person POV.  She is funny and resolute.  She is compassionate, has a very strong moral center, and her number one priority is that she must be able to look at herself in the mirror at the end of the day.  I massively enjoyed Nevada.  She wasn't some major kick-ass heroine and there were times when she felt like she was in over her head, but she was a scrapper!Mad Rogan, though, to me was the more fascinating character.  He and Nevada will undoubtedly get together, but not just yet.  Nevada  and he have chemistry that super leaps off the page.  In fact, Mad Rogan all by himself has such a strong magnetic sexuality that it reaches right through the book and grabs you by the hair.  But he is not a nice person.  He really doesn't care about people like Nevada does.  In fact he finds them easily expendable.  He has a goal and he will use excessive force up to and including torture to get what he wants. However, he does have his own moral code which saves him from being a complete sociopath.  I really liked Mad Rogan.  A lot.  And I am rooting for those two crazy kids.This was a really good book.  I read it in one sitting and I very much looking forward to the rest of the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D8UJAZP7RY84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062289233#wasThisHelpful","R3D8UJAZP7RY84","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this author's Tairen Soul series up through the third book.  While I enjoyed the first two books of the series, my enthusiasm waned during the third book.  I never completed the series because I found the pacing to be somewhat glacial and the villain to be rather uninspired.Still, I liked the writer's voice and was glad to see that she had written a new book completely separate from that other series.First, I must say, I had the hardest time getting into this book.  The beginning of it was full of exposition with nothing that really hooked me into the story.After awhile, though,  I did begin to get interested in the plot because there were moments where I felt the story was beginning to gel.  However I can't say that I actually enjoyed the story.This is a fantasy romance.  If you read for the fantasy parts, you'll find them  ok but nothing really new.  The idea of  Khamsin's Summer Heat melting or thawing Wynter's ice-cold heart is a theme revisited over and over.  There is an enchanted heroic sword whose power can only be unleashed by the real heir to the sword.  There are Priestesses who guard prophecy and speak in enigmatic riddles.  There is a big bad that can only be defeated by the sword (or the power of true love take your pick).The romance aspects, however, come across as somewhat joyless.  Khamsin and Wynter's relationship start with a series of deceptions.  And throughout the story one or the both of them are constantly accusing the other of mistrust and betrayal.  The periods of mistrust are broken up by periods where it seems they are beginning to feel something and open up to each other.  Only to have something else happen that plunges them back into their cycle of accusation again.  I simply could not relax and enjoy the two characters.  I wanted to watch them form a bond and a relationship, but I knew it wouldn't last.  I found myself skimming parts just to get to the inevitable.  To be fair, they were being betrayed left, right and center.  You really needed a score-card to keep up with all the betraying going on. And the bad guys are telegraphed so broadly, it dulled their impact a bit for me.Even so, I was still rather engaged in the plot.  It says a lot about the author's ability to keep the story going that even though I had a ton of issues with the characters and some of their motivations, I didn't want to close the book before the end.Unfortunately the ending rather falls apart for me. It felt all over the place.  And frankly the Big bad they have to fight falls into the same trap I thought this author's earlier series' villain did.  He was just evil for evil's sake.  I had no idea what he wanted except to what be Ice king and kill people?  But if you kill everybody what exactly are you king of?The book had the bones to be an affecting fantasy romance.  I am sure my issues aside, there will be some who will really love it because there is a solid plot and some strong sexual chemistry between Kham and Wynter.  But I just didn't completely enjoy this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZRJV2W3N699P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062018973#wasThisHelpful","R2ZRJV2W3N699P","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"At first I was a little dismayed when I got these.  They felt thinner than the towels I currently have.  I was sure they;d fall apart when I ran them through the initial wash right I after they arrived.But after running them through the washer and dryer, while they still weren't the thick and fluffy towels I have, they did feel softer and more pliant than when I opened the package.I decided to give them to my sons to use in their bathroom.  It turns out they love them.  They are easy to wrap and hitch about one's waist (the boys complain the fatter towels don't hitch well) and they are surprisingly absorbent.  Interestingly, they seem to do best when they are absorbing water, so how relatively thin they feel when dry is a bit deceptive.Also, they do not pill.

"3.5 stars.As I was reading the first chapter of this book, I wasn't sure if I would like it.  It was basically an info dump.  Lots of inner thinking by the heroine, Danica.  Lots of telling us about her.  I fervently hoped the book would not continue in this vein.Luckily it didn't and the story smoothed out nicely.  I began to really enjoy it once Danica and Dex entered each others' orbit on the page.  Their interaction and chemistry was the strong point of the book.  She is front office, the GM of the football team and the person who just fired him.  He is a talent, a hard partying ex-quarterback who is now battling for his reputation amidst allegations of game fixing.The basic conflict between them is well constructed and offers up believable tension and potential romantic obstruction.  I also liked that from a basic personality standpoint they were really different.  I swear if Danica took the Meyers-Briggs, she'd probably be typed at an ISTJ.  She is responsible, capable, focused and able to easily handle situations of stress.  She's also intensely loyal.Meanwhile, Dex would be more like an ESTP.  Funny and charming, yet works hard.  Communicates directly, no hidden agenda, an easy going risk taker who also liked to live in the moment.  But more than anything he just loved football.Really the two of them together was the best part of the book.The other thing I really liked was that football wasn't just wallpaper or a forgettable backdrop for the story.  When I read a sports romance, I like for the romance to also include a good amount of the sport.  Otherwise, what's the point?  The plot outside of the romance was all about running a football team and in Danica's case also about trying to rehab Dex's rep.  Her family not only owned the franchise but were hands-on owners that added to the conflict.  The football was included enough to give realistic flavor to the story yet did not swallow the narrative.Which brings me to the part about the book that didn't work so well for me. Danica's family  was messy enough and interesting enough that they added some layers to the story. And yet... I got impatient with them and the little subplot regarding her ex-husband.  His got a few POV's that felt  intrusive and I found myself wondering what his motives were? I don't think it got answered necessarily well.  Also, everybody seemed waaay to preoccupied with her single state.Otoh, Dex's family backstory was very intriguing and yet the author didn't explore it as much as I would have liked.On the whole, this was a smartly written book with the romantic relationship being the highlight.Review is based on an e-Arc provided by author","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VV36WCJ8U8SQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373863640#wasThisHelpful","R1VV36WCJ8U8SQ","A2GO2DPX0E1NFN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GO2DPX0E1NFN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this because I already had the companion products -- the conditioner and the leave in treatment for thermal styling.  Having had good results using the other two items, I was very curious how my hair would react when using all three as suggested.I definitely say there is a noticeable difference.  The Keratin acts to keep the hair manageable and reduces frizz for a longer period of time.  The smell is lovely and I did notice my hair did not revert as much in humidity.That said, I do have other shampoos I prefer more.

"So I am not a huge gardener or anything.  But we have a pretty nice little plot.  My husband broad forks it to prepare the area for planting.

Not really heavy or durable for hard-packed or more gravelly soils, but works good for the smaller stuff I need it for.I did notice there was a tendency for the handle to disengage.

"I tutor the ACT professionally, and I'm happy to report that this book is a useful addition to the ACT prep marketplace.Each section of the test is covered in a helpful, down-to-earth manner, and the advice is clearly written by an experienced tutor. I also like that the book explicitly refers to the Real ACT Prep Guide and tells readers to practice with it. The review of each section is not (nor do I think is intended to be) comprehensive; serious studiers may want to supplement with books specializing on one section of the test.Due to its length, this book does not have many practice questions. However, this is a blessing in disguise: students should generally only be practicing with authentic (ACT-written) questions anyway.I did like the humor, but at times, it can be grating; some students will be shaking their heads like I did and saying, ""please just get to the point without trying to be funny!"". Don't get me wrong - the humor does, on the whole, make the book more readable than most of its competition.Overall, I would recommend this book for most students: it does an admirable job of explaining the most important parts of the ACT.

"I tutor the ACT and have been doing so for several years. I can tell these cards were written by people who actually tutor the ACT (surprisingly, most ACT prep materials are not). As a product, these cards have some strengths and weaknesses.Strengths: English. Making up nearly half of the cards, the English cards do a good job of presenting many of the skills tested on the real ACT. Since English questions are fairly short, I like flashcards for this kind of practice. The answer explanations are also good.Math: Flashcards are generally a good way to practice math. I don't think the Math cards are as comprehensive as the English ones, but they provide good practice, and again, have good explanations.Weaknesses: Reading. I'm not the biggest fan of the reading strategies on the cards overall. Some I liked, and some seemed a little too good to be true. As you might expect, the cards are too small to test Reading passages and instead just offer strategy.Science: I don't think these cards will add a whole lot to a student's Science ability. Again, flashcards don't really lend themselves to Science passages and questions. I think the strategies would be more understandable if a student had a passage in front of him.Writing: The advice for writing seems tacked on, and is now outdated, since the ACT essay has significantly changed since these cards were published.Overall, if your son or daughter is allergic to books, these cards are a good plan B. But consider the opportunity cost. Students would probably be much better off if instead of using these cards they were using a good ACT Prep book in conjunction with authentic ACT tests. The biggest reason to practice with real tests is question authenticity. The questions on these cards do not reliably duplicate the nuances of real ACT questions.If you'd like more ACT prep advice, you can click on my name and you'll see a link to my website.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19WETITKTV2ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764167685#wasThisHelpful","R19WETITKTV2ZH","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a GRE tutor, so I've read a lot of GRE books over the years. Since this book is from a small publisher, I didn't know what to expect. The book delighted me at times, but overall, it is not a complete resource and suffers from serious flaws.Good stuff: The book has insightful test-taking advice. I especially liked the advice on pacing, reading, and I enjoyed most of the strategies presented in the beginning of the book.The essay advice is very good - much better, in fact, than that of most GRE books. Since this book is inexpensive, you might want to buy it for the essay advice alone.Bad stuff: The book has a tendency to oversimplify verbal technique. The examples used are simplistic to the point of being obvious.There is no discussion or inclusion of Critical Reasoning questions, which make up 10-20% of verbal questions.The book discusses ""author's feeling"" and ""extended reasoning"" questions in the reading comprehension section, but these types of questions no longer appear on the GRE.The practice test has an Issue essay prompt that is outdated, offering a choice of two prompts, neither of which are written in the current GRE style.Practice test question realism is generally poor.The book is completely anonymous. No author, no website, no mailing address.

"I've been tutoring the ACT for 8 years now. Quantity sells, but quality improves scores. Unless you've exhausted all AUTHENTIC ACT practice material, there's little or no reason to use a book like this one.To the layman, the questions in this book might look the same as real ACT questions. As a tutor, I can assure you they are not always the same. There are many subtle differences, and students using this book will be subtly misinformed about the real test in many different ways. Speaking from experience, it's HARD to completely capture the complexity of real ACT questions.The good news is that there are five real ACT tests in the Real ACT Prep Guide, one on the ACT's website, several old ones online in various places, and probably a couple in your high school's guidance office. If you do all these tests, I'd rather see you analyzing and deconstructing questions in them instead of doing Princeton Review tests, since analyzing the real tests will teach you much more about what the ACT actually will test on test day.IF you've not only done but thoroughly analyzed ALL available ACT tests and you need more timed practice, then you could use this book.

"I'm a GRE tutor, and I take a particular interest in this book since the company that writes it (BTPS testing) uses the book in courses throughout the California State University System. Unfortunately for the students taking these courses, the book is one of the worst GRE guides on the market.1. The book is out-of-date. Even though the GRE hasn't changed since 2011, ETS (which writes the GRE) recently published 150 verbal and math questions. These new questions reflect subtle changes to the test (the math is getting harder, the verbal has phased out certain gimmicky questions) that this book doesn't reflect.2. The practice test and question quality isn't very good. Unlike real GRE questions, the question in this book are usually simple and straightforward. Real GRE questions make you use reasoning skills; they make you think. Some of the math questions in the book are good, but on the whole, these are not the questions you want to practice with.3. Essay advice has little substance, and the ""strong"" sample essays are only about 4-5 on the 6 point scale.4. Reading passages are not written in the GRE's style and they're largely way too easy. The book neglects to provide any technique for Critical Reasoning questions, which make about 10-15% of verbal questions.5. Math concept review is very light, and not all concepts are covered. Some concepts that WON'T be tested are covered (calculating standard deviation).6. Perhaps most importantly, this book neglects to tell the reader to use ETS-written materials, in what I can only assume is BTPS Testing putting profits before helping students. Any good GRE book, tutor, class, or course will quickly tell you that the best practice sources are the books published by ETS, which writes the GRE.The only parts of the book I liked were the parts in the beginning with general test-taking advice.Overall, I'd avoid this book. There are many better options on the market. BTPS, if you ever read this, I urge you to re-think the decision to include this book in your GRE courses; in my opinion, you're doing a real disservice to students.

"As a GRE tutor, I've seen lots of different companies' practice material. Kaplan's latest GRE Verbal workbook, like the previous versions, provides lots of practice, but yet is not what I'd recommend for GRE prep.The biggest problem with the workbook is question realism. Kaplan-written GRE questions are usually less complex than ETS GRE questions. Even though there are a limited number of ETS-written questions available, you can get lots of mileage out of them by reviewing them until you can precisely explain your justification for the right answer, as well as why the wrong answers are incorrect. This takes MUCH more time and effort than just doing them, but is also much more rewarding.Another problem with the workbook is the lack of technique supplied for Critical Reasoning questions. The book addresses ""highlighted parts of a passage"" questions, but doesn't offer technique for the strengthen / weaken an argument or ""explain a paradox"" questions. Though the answer explanations explain the answers to these questions, test-takers looking for a step-by-step technique to solve them may be frustrated. The real test will have 1-2 of these questions per section.Reading passages sometime reflect the style of the GRE, but often are much simpler and easier to read. For instance, there is a passage about an Antarctic explorer on pg. 158 that is barely middle-school reading level!The essay advice is generally good, but doesn't offer a lot of options; instead, templates are offered. This is probably ok for average scorers, but high scores may find this section wanting. Furthermore, it is a waste of time to practice with Kaplan-written essay prompts; ETS publishes all possible test prompts on its website for free. The more ETS prompts you practice with, the higher the chances you'll get one on test day that you've already worked with!I did like the sections of the workbook with vocabulary and writing drills. But I'd urge test-takers to consider the opportunity cost of working with this book: the time you spend working on Kaplan questions would be much better spent working on ETS questions.

"I tutor the GRE full-time, and I look at this book from that perspective. Kaplan's latest math workbook is okay if you need to improve your math skill, but there are better options, namely CliffsNotes Math Review for Standardized Tests and the books in the Manhattan Prep GRE series.There is plenty of math practice in this book, but it has two main flaws:1. The review of math concepts is incomplete. The book teaches arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and statistics concepts, but some of the less common concepts are missing. The level of practice for each concept is enough to get people familiar with it but not usually enough to really master it. Remedy: if you're looking for a comprehensive math review, Manhattan Prep (which is actually owned by Kaplan) is MUCH better. (Note to Kaplan: please retire your Kaplan GRE brand and just sell your Manhattan Prep brand. It's so much better in every way!)2. The realism of math questions is, like that of most books, not great. The GRE is a REASONING test in addition to being a math test. Although there are a few exceptions, most of the math questions in this book do not involve reasoning. Whether they're easy or hard, they just involve math skills. Real GRE questions are usually more complicated - they're often more like puzzles - and also reward you for noticing ways to make them simpler. Remedy: make sure your practice includes ETS GRE questions.I applaud Kaplan for trying to make the math questions in the book harder - there are 80 new ""advanced math"" questions. But they're hard for the wrong reasons. The writers of the questions just made them a pain-in-the-butt to solve. Real GRE questions are not like this: they're hard because you have to think logically in addition to using your math skills.Working through this book will improve your math ability, but it won't improve your GRE math skills as much working through other books will.

Kaplan's ACT guide, like its previous editions, provides basic advice for the test, but fails to deliver by a wide margin on its claim that it's ""all you need to get ready for test day.""1. The book doesn't cover many English and Math concepts that will be tested, and those it does cover often do not offer enough practice for students to become proficient. Remedy: get books that focus on just one section of the ACT if you want in depth coverage and more practice.2. The practice question and test realism is not great. Remedy: practice with REAL ACT tests that are published by the ACT, not those written by third-party companies. Real ACT questions are generally harder, more complex, and most importantly, more reliable in terms of duplicating what you'll face on test day.3. The book offers one way to look at Science and Reading questions, but I find that students need to experiment with technique in these sections to find what works best for them. Remedy: be willing to use trial and error to find methods that work best for you.Overall, I'd urge serious students to look beyond this book and to particularly analyze real ACT tests, which are much closer to the real thing than the ones in Kaplan books.If you'd like more ACT prep advice, you can click on my name and you'll see a link to my website.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32EJ7L1SQP4DU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625231415#wasThisHelpful","R32EJ7L1SQP4DU","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been tutoring the ACT professionally for about 8 years. I'm only giving this book three stars because I don't think it delivers on its promise to get students to a perfect score. A much better title would be, ""ACT prep for smart kids who want to improve their scores"".My first area of concern is the English and Math sections. This book doesn't cover all tested concepts (of which there are many) for either section. It covers most of them. How are students supposed to get perfect scores without full coverage?My second main area of concern is question and practice test realism. The writers don't work for the ACT and do not reliably duplicate the nuances and complexities of real ACT questions. Furthermore, they don't point students to the obvious source of better practice material, The Real ACT Prep Guide (published by the ACT).So although this book contains good advice, it's incomplete and certainly not a one-stop-shop for a perfect score. If you REALLY want a perfect score, you'll probably have to analyze several real ACT tests until you can identify what each problem is testing, not just get it right. Additionally, I'd recommend looking for books that just cover one section of the test. These books have a narrower focus and can therefore cover all the little concepts missing from ACT 36.If you'd like more ACT prep recommendations, just click on my name and you'll see a link to my website.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLYHPEP4OOAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=143800625X#wasThisHelpful","RCLYHPEP4OOAS","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tutor the GRE professionally, so I am reviewing this book from that perspective. The short answer regarding whether this book is useful is no. Since ETS makes so many verbal questions available, and since the technique offered by this book is so rudimentary, I don't recommend it.I'll start with technique. Kaplan techniques are simple at the expense of effectiveness. They may work on easy Kaplan questions, but for many, they won't work very well on harder, more complicated GRE questions. For example, all reading comprehension question types are lumped into the same technique. It would be great if it were that simple, but it's not.The practice questions in the book look like GRE questions, but upon closer analysis they are much simpler and more straightforward. There is little point practicing with questions that would be way too easy for the real GRE to ever use.The essay examples provided by the book lack critical thinking, merely presenting one side of an issue instead of analyzing the issue's complexity, counterarguments, and implications of the essay's thesis. These are not good models for your writing compared to the real sample essays that ETS provides for free on its website. Furthermore, there is no good reason to practice with Kaplan essay prompts; ALL the prompts ETS uses are published on its site.The book does have a good vocab / word roots section and some useful writing drills. But instead of using this book, I highly recommend you practice for GRE verbal with ETS questions and books. Try Manhattan Prep if you'd like more robust technique, as well.

"As a GRE tutor who thinks about this stuff for a living, I urge you to get both of these books.Why? One simple reason: these are REAL GRE questions: 150 verbal ones, and 150 math ones.""But wait, Vince! Aren't there way more questions in other GRE books?""Yes, there are. But here's the thing... quality trumps quantity every single time. Real GRE questions are much more convoluted, complex, and nuanced than any other company's. Also, real GRE questions play by the same consistent, fair rules that the questions on the real GRE do. That's why it's so important that these questions are part of your prep.Yes, you may need other sources of questions to increase your experience level (I like Manhattan Prep's).

"As a tutor, I recommend certain books to my students so that they can accomplish as much as possible outside of my office. The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar is the most helpful book I've yet seen for the new SAT (which will debut in March of 2016). Here are a few reasons why:1. The book is comprehensive. I've been teaching SAT prep for a long time, and most of my students are fairly to highly serious about their scores. I'm glad to be able to offer them a workbook that covers everything, rather than one that covers most of the test.2. Practice question realism is very good. It's essential that students get used to the nuances and style of the real test, and unlike books published by most companies, this one aptly mimics the complexities of real SAT passages and questions.3. It's up-to-date. The new SAT writing section is much different than that of the current SAT. This book reflects all the changes we know about right now.4. The book cross-references the College Board / Khan Academy tests, so that students can look up authentic questions on which to practice concepts.The only real criticism I have of the book is the formatting and look - it might be easier for certain students to use if the graphic design and layout were more engaging. But this is easily the best book on the market for students who truly want to understand the material.

I'm happy to say that Barron's new book is a helpful companion to the College Board's revised PSAT and SAT materials.The strengths of this book stem from the fact the author is an experienced tutor. The strategies rang true for me, and I found the answer explanations and insights about the test to be helpful.The practice test question quality is good, and students should find the review of grammar and math concepts helpful.

"As far as one-big-book GRE guides go, The Princeton Review's ""Cracking the GRE: Premium"" is not bad. It will get you familiar with the test. Sound good? It shouldn't. If you want a competitive score, you'll need more than familiarity.Positives:The book is user-friendly, easy to navigate and use. The techniques for verbal reasoning questions are fine, and unlike Kaplan's books, it covers all critical reasoning question types. Math techniques are fine, and the major math concepts are covered. Essay advice is ok, too.Negatives:The book tries to cast the GRE as a silly test that only measures ""your ability to take the GRE"". But if you buy that, you might not prepare as rigorously as you need to: the GRE will test your vocab, reading comprehension, math knowledge, and writing ability, but also your ability to adapt, perform under pressure, and to THINK. Many of these abilities will be things you've developed or can develop further independently of traditional prep.The book doesn't cover concepts very deeply or offer technique options. Lower or higher scorers may be disadvantaged by this. Don't expect this book to get you to a high level in math, for example - you'll need a much more comprehensive review and more practice if you're rusty. The back cover of the book claims, ""If it's on the test, it's in this book."" I would disagree - not all math concepts are covered, and those that are often don't go deep enough to prepare you for harder GRE questions which test those concepts.Finally, the practice question realism is not great. Questions (like those from most prep companies) generally do not capture the real GRE's nuances and complexities very well. For this reason especially, I urge you to practice with official GRE materials.The bottom line: this book is ok if you don't really need a competitive score. But if you do, you may want to do quite a bit more work than this book suggests you need to. The thing that bothers me is this book's marketing: it claims to be an ""all-in-one solution"", but it's just not. I like the Manhattan Prep GRE books when used as supplements to ETS's GRE books.

"I'm a long-time GRE tutor, and I review GRE books to help self-studiers with their prep. Kaplan's latest version of their GRE prep guide, like its previous versions, is a basic primer for the test, but not what I'd recommend. I think it is inferior to its competition in several important ways.1. First, this book is a one-size-fits-all book. But kind of like a one-size-fits all hat, it's not going to work as well for people who are below or above average. If you're starting from a high or low point, this may not work well for you: high scorers need more depth; lower scorers need more technique options.2. Practice question realism is poor, especially for verbal questions. It's so important to practice with questions that capture the nuances and complexities of the real GRE. Kaplan, like most companies, doesn't duplicate these nuances well. In general, these questions are simpler and easier than real questions. So even if this book included access to a million Kaplan computer tests, I would avoid it.3. The book does not adequately cover all the concepts the GRE will present. I am surprised to see there is still no treatment of logic or ""critical reasoning"" verbal questions, and that not all math concepts are covered. Again, bad for you if you want a competitive score.4. The level of depth for math concepts will, in my opinion, not get people to competency in many cases, let alone mastery.5. The techniques offered for math are fine, but verbal techniques are fairly fluffy - they may work on Kaplan-written questions, but I don't think for many they'll work well on more difficult ETS GRE questions.The thing that gets me worked up about this book is not that it's mediocre. It's that it's marketed as the best, most comprehensive GRE prep option. I guess it sells more books to say your book is an easy one-stop solution than to tell people that you may need multiple books and that hard work is required. Also, Kaplan books have a funny way of garnering tons of 5-star ""reviews"", and as a result, millions of people buy them. Whatever prep materials you choose, I suggest researching them in detail.

"I'm a GRE tutor and I recommend this book. It has tons of practice problems for the GRE (obviously). The quality of these problems is quite a bit better than that of companies like Kaplan and The Princeton Review.However, here is my warning: do not let working in this book prevent you from doing (and more importantly, MASTERING) all the ETS questions (in the Official Guide, the computer tests, and the Verbal and Quant practice books). Authentic questions are much more valuable than Manhattan questions; make sure you can do all the ETS questions forwards, backwards, and sideways and that you understand them well enough to explain them to a friend. That will ensure you're really good at the GRE, which obviously only contains questions written by ETS.Even though Manhattan Prep does a better job than most of its competition at writing practice questions, its questions do not dependably have the same nuances and complexities that ETS questions do. So I'd view this book as a supplement to, not a replacement for, real ETS GRE practice questions. If you can't afford both this book and the ETS books, buy the ETS books: quality > quantity.

"I'm a GRE tutor, and I'm reviewing this book from that perspective. GRE For Dummies is a good book to get if you're happy with an average score or you don't have much time to work on the test, but this is not a great choice for people who want competitive scores.There is plenty of good advice in the book about the test, the math, and the essays. But due to the book's length, it will get you familiar with things but probably not actually get you to MASTER those things. If you want a high score, you want mastery, not just familiarity.The practice question and passage difficulty / complexity and the robustness of verbal techniques leave something to be desired. Real GRE questions are harder and more complex than the ones in this book. The technique in this book may work well with its practice questions, but success with real GRE questions will demand better technique and flexibility.I'd recommend the Manhattan GRE series over this book, unless you really don't have that much time to work on the test. Hopefully you do, since for most people, getting ready for the GRE is not as easy as this book would have you believe. In the experience of most of my students, they need much more than a ""refresher"". As with any successful GRE prep, the materials published by ETS should be where you're spending most of your time.

"What makes a great math teacher is the same thing that makes a great math book: mastery of and passion for the subject, and the genuine desire to help. Finding a math book that exhibits these qualities is rare. I'm excited to recommend this book because the reader really gets the sense that the author cares about him understanding the concepts. Consequently, it's a powerful tool for learning algebra.Also, the book is usable. The writing is down-to-earth, clear, and engaging. Inquisitive students will love it.I think this book will be great for smart kids who haven't taken algebra yet, but it's also helpful for those who need to re-learn algebra (for a more advanced class or a science class, or for a standardized test).

"Like Erica Meltzer's The Critical Reader (which covers the SAT's Critical Reading section), The Complete Guide to ACT Reading is thorough and thoughtful. As a full-time tutor, I've read many ACT prep books. This one is an improvement on them for several reasons:1. There's an entire chapter devoted to timing strategy. Since students have different reading speeds and abilities, different strategies must be taught. It's nice to see different options presented, which makes it more likely that your student will find one that works for her. Most books will only discuss one strategy for pacing.2. The book has a great discussion of how to change the way you read passages for maximum benefit. Again, this is done in much more detail than most books and consequently students are more likely to be able to learn how to read more efficiently.3. Advice on how to THINK your way through the Reading section abounds. Using logic to find details and understanding how authors construct passages and paragraphs are discussed in detail. In fact, a theme of the guide is that thinking skills are necessary for doing well - a welcome change from the reliance on ""tips n' tricks"" by many of this book's competitors.The book also deconstructs all the major and minor questions types students will encounter on the test and provides a couple of practice tests. The quality and realism of the passages and questions is quite a bit better than other prep books I've read, and the techniques are more robust.The ACT has recently thrown us a couple of curveballs: a Reading section with paired passages and questions asking about both, and the inclusion of a science-style chart in a passage, so the book could benefit from an update to include those potentialities. I might also like to see more cross-referencing to The Real ACT Prep Guide.

"I write this review from the point of view of a long-time ACT tutor. After a few pages of this book, I realized that the author was an experienced tutor as well. This matters a lot - many ACT prep books are written by committee or by academics with little ACT tutoring experience. This author has done a great job, both in terms of covering the material the ACT presents and giving the reader lots of insightful strategies. To clarify, the strategies in this book are MUCH BETTER than those you'll see in books by companies like Kaplan and The Princeton Review.The only major thing I'd add for readers of this book is to seek out real ACT practice tests to use in conjunction with it. There are five in the Real ACT Prep Guide, one on the ACT's website, and probably a few more at your high school. They, by nature, are more realistic than the practice tests in this book.Overall, this book is a refreshing departure from most of what's on the market for the ACT and is an excellent resource if you're just buying one ACT prep guide.

"I'm an SAT tutor and have been for more than seven years. It's hard to get a competitive score on the SAT for most students, but there are lots of test-prep publishers that would have you believe otherwise. ""The SAT is tough and you're going to have to work hard and prepare extensively to do well"" doesn't sell books. ""The SAT is silly and can be beaten with our clever tricks"" DOES sell...Unfortunately, this book falls into the latter camp. Advice, overall, is light and fluffy at the expense of offering usable technique or rigorous preparation. Perhaps this is because the book was developed by people who were extremely high scorers on the test. I hired tutors for a tutoring company for over four years. High scorers don't always teach well because they so intuitively understand how the test works and that intuition can be hard to translate into useful methods.If you're really, really smart, almost any technique you use will work on the SAT. However, if you're not a genius, you'll need good technique and good preparation - which includes building extremely solid vocabulary, grammar, math, reading, and writing skills. I understand that the book wasn't meant to be comprehensive, but it covers topics so superficially that I don't think it will help most students.The book isn't all bad; there are some useful tips for math and grammar. But bad advice for all sections abounds. The critical reading technique will do almost nothing for most people.Though your teenager may actually read this book, he shouldn't.

"Hello, GRE studier. I'm a long-time GRE tutor. I'm probably more excited about this book than you ever will be, but I hope I can convince you to buy it. I enjoy helping people get good information about the test, especially since there is so much bad information out there.Why is this book essential? So far, ETS has only published four practice tests worth of GRE material, along with a smattering of practice problems. With a limited sample, we can make many conclusions about the real test - but it's always good to get more data. And here it finally is.Careful analysis of these questions will help a lot if you take the time to dissect them and think about what they're testing and how exactly they're written. You could practice with 3rd party material like Kaplan's, but neither Kaplan (nor its competitors) will be writing the GRE you take. ETS will. ETS questions are subtly but significantly different than those from ANY 3rd party. The technique ETS provides is not the best - you can probably find much better technique in Manhattan Prep's guides. But ETS questions are what you want to be using to study.This book also includes 2 new prompts for each of the AWA tasks and sample essays for each with commentary. This is worth the price of the book, since it gives us a lot of new data about what the graders reward.Overall, this is a must buy if you're serious about your GRE score.

"Me: long-term GRE tutor. You: probably someone studying for the test. I hope this review convinces you to buy not only this book, but also to buy the Official Guide (if you don't already own it) and the Verbal Reasoning practice book (both published by ETS). Why? Because I believe these books will all definitely add points to your score. Even if we never work together, I hope you do well.This math book is invaluable for one major reason: there are 150 real GRE questions inside of it. Real questions! Why am I so worked up about them? Well, ETS has been stingy so far in providing GRE practice material. Now, I and you have more ways to get used to the real test. Careful analysis of and practice with these questions helps, and I'll be using them with all my GRE students. This book also includes strategies that ETS hasn't published before - and it tells you which questions the strategies work on. This is great and unprecedented. For more complete technique, you'll probably want to check out the Manhattan Prep math guides.Sidebar: hey, Vince - don't other companies publish GRE practice problems? Yes, they do - but they're pretty much worthless compared to the real thing. Even Manhattan Prep (which I like a lot) doesn't really write realistic math questions (and definitely not verbal questions). Don't even get me started on Kaplan...So, I urge you to practice with and analyze these authentic questions. Carefully reviewing the concepts tested and figuring out what techniques work best will make you much better at quantitative reasoning if you invest the time.

"Like Mike Barrett's SAT Prep Black Book, this book is a helpful resource for nearly any student preparing for the ACT. I'm an SAT/ACT tutor myself, and I recognize that the advice in this book comes from someone who has worked with the test over a long period of time. It's much better than the advice the big test prep companies offer.However, I do have a significant criticism for the book: it makes preparing for the ACT seem easier than it actually is. This is due to the author's focus on strategies and dismissal of underlying skills. The strategies in this book will work well for students who already read at a high level, who have a command of the math concepts tested, etc. But in my experience, even many straight A students do not read well or remember the math they've been taught.So, I recommend this book with the following caution: don't believe it's going to solve all your ACT problems. Read challenging non-fiction, practice math, and learn your grammar. Check out the books for the ACT written by Erica Meltzer and Richard Corn as supplements to this one.

"I've been tutoring the ACT for over seven years. This book, like that written by any third-party, is different enough from the real ACT that it's dangerous. To the casual observer, the tests in this book look like the real ACT. But show them to a good ACT tutor and he'll cringe. There are many significant differences. Some questions are way too easy. Others test things the ACT won't. The passages are written in a different style than the real test. This all matters because to get ready for the real thing, you want to practice with the real thing.So, I urge you to only practice with real ACTs. There are five in the Real ACT Prep Guide, a few online, and probably one or two at your high school's guidance office.If you carefully analyze the questions on those real ACTs, you'll be prepared. If you analyze the questions in this book, your preparation will have holes in it - and you'll be in for some surprises come test day.

"I've been tutoring the SAT for about seven years, full-time. This book is a good addition to most SAT takers' toolboxes, but it's not a complete solution. It can, at times, emphasize technique at the expense of foundational skills (like vocabulary, reading comprehension, math, writing). This emphasis rankles me a bit, mostly because the book claims to be the only prep source you'll need (besides the ""blue book""). That, and the hyperbolic title, should give you a little bit of pause. However, buy the book! Its advice is mostly useful and you'll learn a lot about the test and how to prepare for it. I picked a few things up myself.I recommend this book to students with the caution that they should supplement with other test-prep books that provide more robust skill building. Try those by Erica Meltzer and Pwn the SAT. The exception is extremely smart students - if you're already at a 2000+ level, this book might get you where you want to go. The lower your score, the more trouble you'll probably have using the Critical Reading tips this book offers.In short, the SAT tests both test-taking and fundamental skills. To really get good at it, you'll need a balanced approach. You may have to use more than one prep book... but it's worth it.

"I've been tutoring the ACT for more than seven years, so I've read many, many prep books. Like most of the big prep companies, Kaplan has done an okay job with this book. It has both pros and cons, and might be a decent recommendation for someone who can only buy one other book than the ESSENTIAL Real ACT Prep Guide (which I hope you buy). There are, however, much better books for certain parts of the test written by smaller companies.The English section covers most but not all of the error types on the real ACT, but the explanation level is pretty shallow. Furthermore, the questions do not imitate real ACT questions very well. Instead, I'd recommend Erica Meltzer's Complete Guide to ACT English, which is about 100 times more accurate and helpful.The math section has a solid introduction to techniques and concepts. The downside is that many practice questions are more straightforward than those on real ACTs. A better book is The Ultimate Guide to ACT Math by Richard Corn.The reading section largely has good techniques. Passages and questions don't really mimic the real test that well. Also, certain techniques need more rigor and explanation, for example, how to find a main idea of a passage. If you're a parent even of a student with great grades, you might be surprised that your child doesn't know how to do this.Science strategy is good. Question and passage realism isn't that good. The book doesn't include any treatment of logic or scientific knowledge questions; the real ACT will have one or two of each of these.The writing section is a standout. Good advice about writing the essay and writing in general with helpful drills.Other quibbles of mine include: typos, bad timing advice, practice test realism is uneven. Other good things include: test-taking strategies, helpful breakdowns of concept frequency. So, in my view, it's a mixed bag. I like the Princeton Review book better if you only buy one book. Calling this book the ""2015"" version is a little silly since a. it's 2014 and b. the ACT just rolled out some changes that will begin in 2015 and that this book does not reflect.One last thing: if Kaplan truly cared about raising your score, even though it might sell them fewer books, they'd tell you to get a copy of the ACT's Real ACT Prep Guide or even to just ask your high school counselor for free real practice ACTs. Spend a lot of your time analyzing real tests, which are subtly but significantly different than any third-party tests. It's a blessing in disguise that the online tests for this book don't work right now: avoid Kaplan-written practice tests and get yourself some real ACTs to practice with.

"I tutor the SAT for a living. You'll probably never work with me, but one thing I hope to convince you of is that using third-party practice tests is not helpful and even harmful.Kaplan questions, particularly those for the SAT's Critical Reading section, are inferior to the College Board's in several important ways. They're more subjective, less complex, and in general don't mimic the real test very well. This is a really big deal if you're serious about getting ready for the real SAT. As a tutor, I can spot the difference from 100 yards away. Most parents and students unfortunately don't have enough experience with real SATs to realize this book misses the mark - and don't find out until they take a real SAT.There are about 23 real SAT tests you can get from the College Board's Official Guide, its online course, and just from the internet. Answer explanations are available from the College Board for its Official Guide for free.

"I tutor the GRE and have done so since 2008. I'm happy to report that the Manhattan GRE books are like eight crisp breaths of fresh air compared to their largely mediocre (and stale) competition. For the serious GRE self-preparer, these books, when combined with official GRE material, will take you very far. There are a couple of flaws, but IF you have the discipline to work through eight books (and the cash to afford them), these guides are quite simply your very best bet.The foremost strength of these guides is their comprehensiveness. They aim to cover all the concepts the GRE will present, and I think they do. Most one-book guides can't and don't.The writing is authoritative and easy-to-read. The techniques presented are generally useful and easy to follow. I did notice a couple of things I didn't like: math techniques such as plugging in numbers and back-solving are rarely explained or described. This may be because only the practice sets at the end of each book have multiple choice questions. These are crucial math techniques and should be your first line of defense against many GRE problems. Verbal techniques are good, sometimes a bit oversimplified, and at times perhaps difficult for most students to use (the mantra advice for reading comp, for instance). I'd suggest Manhattan publish a separate math book with a focus on techniques as opposed to concepts, but that might cut into their course sales...Another benefit of these books is that any of them gives you access to six online multistage GRE-like tests, which are useful practice, since there are only two computer practice tests available from the real GRE. Another good addition to these books is Manhattan's famous 5-pound book of GRE practice problems. Manhattan questions are not perfect imitations of real GRE questions, so use them but do not analyze them too much compared to authentic GRE questions.Despite my issue with the dearth of math techniques and my lukewarm feelings about those for verbal, I strongly recommend you get these books early and use them often. These guys know their stuff and it shows. The only sporting thing for their competition to do at this point is to throw in the towel.

"I write this from the point-of-view of an SAT tutor: I've been helping students with the test for over seven years. We tutors typically disparage big companies like The Princeton Review and Kaplan; their one-size-fits-all approach, oversimplification, and poor practice test quality will leave high-achieving students needing more. However, though more rigorous and useful alternatives to this book do exist, it's a good choice if you only want to buy one companion to the Official SAT Study Guide (which is the SAT bible).The main strength of this book is the test-taking and question solving technique you will learn from it. Learning how to do well on the SAT is a lot different than the skills used to do well in school. This book offers easy-to-read descriptions of techniques for all the question types on the SAT. Some of these techniques, particularly those for reading comprehension, do suffer somewhat from being written to work for everyone. Others, like those for math questions, are very good. If you want better techniques, you'll probably have to seek out books that are just written for one section of the test (like The Critical Reader and Pwn the SAT). If you want a score above 2000, certainly seek out those books.Other sections of the book are a disappointment. The grammar section oversimplifies what you'll need for mastery, as does the essay advice. The practice test quality, like that of pretty much any third party company, is not good. Don't use these practice tests, please. The other thing I don't like is that the book insults your intelligence by claiming that the SAT ""just tests how well you take the SAT"". C'mon, dude. I know that pandering to students might sell more books, but the SAT is a good indicator of how well-read you are, how well you can adapt, if you can think critically, whether you can apply your math skills, and of many other qualities. That's why most colleges take it very seriously.Overall, this book does get my recommendation for most students for the strength of its technique and its readability.

"I tutor the SAT for a living and I have done so since 2008. To be blunt, I'm writing this review to try to talk you out of buying this book. In fact, I really think it's disingenuous of companies like the Princeton Review to offer SAT practice tests. Why? The tests are different enough from the real SAT to screw you up - plus, there are so many real SATs available.Real SATs are extremely carefully written and standardized. Though the tests in this book LOOK like SATs to the casual observer, when I look at them I cringe. There are myriad subtle differences between these and the real test: many questions are too simple or straightforward, particularly in the Critical Reading and Writing sections. Math questions are a little better, but they're all over the place, too. Other questions are inconsistent: more than one answer choice could be argued for, concepts are tested that the real SAT won't, etc.The Official Guide to the SAT, published by the College Board, has ten real tests, and there are three more online that you can find for free. If you run out of those, you can buy the College Board's online course which has ten more. Also, the College Board has FREE answer explanations to all ten tests in the Official Guide online [...] In light of this, there is no reason I can think of to buy this book or ANY third party book merely offering practice tests.

"I've been tutoring the SAT for seven years now, so I write this review from that perspective. I've seen a lot of SAT prep books over the years, and this one is pretty much what I expected from a big test-prep company. It does cover most parts of the test adequately, and students who diligently use it will certainly improve. The point I want to make is that the book falls short of its claims of comprehensiveness and excellence.First, and most importantly, there is a big difference between Kaplan practice SAT questions and tests and real SAT practice questions and tests. The latter are extremely carefully devised and edited; they're complex and varied. Kaplan questions (like those of nearly every company) are more straightforward and simpler. This matters a lot in preparing. Sadly, Kaplan seems to pretend the College Board's Official Guide, which contains 10 real SATs (and so you should absolutely have it), doesn't exist, in what I assume is a strategy to sell more Kaplan books,Some of the techniques in this book work well, in particular, the math techniques. When it comes to Critical Reading techniques, Kaplan techniques work well...on Kaplan-written questions. In the wild (when you're taking the real SAT), you'll need more robust,  nuanced, and adaptable techniques and skills.The message I want to get out there is: do your homework and educate yourself about SAT prep and what it takes. One resource I'd recommend checking out is The Perfect Score Project by Debbie Stier - written my a mom who took seven SATs. Despite what many big test-prep publishers would have you believe, picking up one giant book is not going to get most students to a competitive level on this difficult test. Oh, and by the way, if you don't think big companies have ways to pay reviewers to write five star reviews, check out the obviously fake five star reviews for this book...

"I tutor the SAT professionally, so I'm basing this review on my experience teaching the test and on a comparison of it to the other SAT books I've read. It's of average quality and contains a lot of helpful information; but it does have flaws mainly pertaining to oversimplification.First, the good stuff:- the book will get students to a decent level in area like math and grammar due to the adequate coverage of most concepts- the writing is easy to read and down-to-earth- certain parts of the book appear to be written by an actual tutor - these are good spots to pay attention since the writer at these times has ""been there and done that""And now, the not-so-good stuff:- the book never mentions that you should use it as a strategy guide to help with real SATs (like those in the College Board's Official Guide). This is sad. Real SATs are significantly different than those written by Kaplan (or any other company). For that reason, it's ESSENTIAL to practice with real SATs. But I suppose Kaplan would rather not tell you this since you might not buy their books if you buy the College Board one.- on that note, the practice questions and tests in the book resemble real SATs, but upon closer inspection, most questions are less complex and often easier. Not a good way to practice and certainly please avoid analyzing these questions and their answers.- some techniques, particularly those for the Critical Reading section, will only work in a perfect world. On the real SAT, these techniques (particularly those with which to answer passage questions), will not work so well. You'll need more robust, adaptable techniques if you want to handle medium and hard passage questions.- there is a smattering of bad advice amongst the good advice in the book. For ex., the experimental sections recently have NOT looked ""just like"" normal sections; the SAT has been testing its 2016 format on students - which is weird and different looking. Grammar IS arranged in order of difficulty. You SHOULDN'T guess if you can eliminate one choice on a hard question if you have no idea about the other four choices: the SAT is really good at making you guess wrong on those questions.Overall, this book is okay. But if you want to master the SAT as opposed to just get familiar with it, you'll need more. Educate yourself and don't believe the hype - mastering the SAT is not as simple as buying one big test prep book - despite what Kaplan's marketing would have you believe.

"I am a long-time GRE tutor, and I've checked out a lot of what's on the market in terms of resources. Since working with a tutor doesn't work for everyone, I'm always on the lookout for resources to recommend to people who don't end up working with me. This latest GRE guide from Kaplan is of poor quality compared to its competition and I recommend that you avoid it. There are a few things I like about the guide:- the essay advice section has extensive drills on how to improve your writing.- the answer explanations are well-thought out and detailed- there is a lot of material to practice with, both in the book and onlineHowever, the flaws of this book outweigh the benefits, in my view:- practice question quality is average. Questions are less complex and generally easier than real GRE questions.- the book has no logic questions other than the ""two bolded parts of a passage"" questions. This is an egregious omission, since the real GRE will have 1-3 of this type of question per section! (Strangely, the online practice tests DO have logic questions - would be nice if the book had covered them so you'd have strategy for them.)- coverage of most topics is cursory and not good enough for mastery or even basic competency in many cases- Kaplan strategies will work pretty well on Kaplan-written questions, but aren't nuanced or robust enough to handle many real GRE questionsThe fact that this is the #1 selling GRE book confounds me - I assume it's partly due to Kaplan's multi-million dollar marketing machine (and some seriously dubious 5-star reviews - check 'em out yourself). If you're looking for a recommendation, Manhattan Prep writes the best GRE books on the market.

"About me: I'm a GRE tutor and have been since 2008. I can't recommend this book: despite its strengths, there are important concepts the GRE covers that this book completely misses or glosses over. Overall, the coverage of the material is spotty and not as robust as I'd like it to be.Things I liked:- many answer explanations are comprehensive and well-written- the essay section actually has drills to improve your writing (most books don't do this)- the math reference in the back is a good study toolThings that made me literally cringe and feel angry:- the verbal advice and practice tests in the book have NO LOGIC QUESTIONS.(The online tests do, but you never get strategy for them.) You may know these as ""critical reasoning"" questions - they ask questions like ""which answer would strengthen/weaken the argument"" or ""resolve the paradox"". The author(s) did include some ""two bolded sections"" questions in the book, but they completely missed the other types. This is bad for you, since each real GRE verbal section will have 1-2 of these questions.- the math concept coverage is really brief. Not nearly adequate to develop basic competency, let alone mastery.- there's no mention of ETS's ""Official Guide to the Revised GRE"". Though the Official Guide is ESSENTIAL to your GRE prep, I guess Kaplan would rather not tell you about it (since you might buy it instead of their books).You might wonder why this book makes me angry. Well, that's because it's weak, but thousands and thousands of people will buy it, since Kaplan has the marketing budget of a small country and fantastic brand recognition. Overall, there are ways this book will help you prepare, but I'd avoid it if you're in the market for a one-book GRE prep guide.***UPDATE*** Check out the 5-star ""review"" from Elisa S.

"I review a lot of GRE books since I'm a GRE tutor and have been for several years. This one is a good choice if you only buy one supplement to ETS's Official Guide to the GRE (which I hope you have). Several instances of bad advice occur, and the practice question/test quality is average, but overall, I like the book.Good stuff:- test taking advice and techniques are largely useful. In particular, I like the advice to ""walk away"" if you're stuck. (I picture a helpful friend trying to help you avoid a fight: ""Just walk away, man! It's not worth it!"")- the book covers most of what you'll need for math concepts and all of the verbal concepts- certain areas, like the coverage of critical reasoning, are better than the competitionNot-so-good stuff:- like most Princeton Review books, this one implies that the GRE is a silly test and that it's your enemy. But purporting that the GRE ""just measures your ability to take the GRE"" is pandering. Don't believe it. The test measures a lot of different skills that are worthwhile: vocab, reading comprehension, critical thinking, logic, adaptability, prioritization, etc. But it probably sells more books to paint the test as a bogeyman.- in that same vein, the book also says the test should be prepared for ""for 4-12 weeks"". That advice combined with my above complaint might dissuade you from achieving mastery of the concepts. If you want a score that reflects MASTERY as opposed to a decent score, you'll need more time and more than this book (unless you're already really good at this stuff)- essay advice is on the light and fluffy side- practice questions and tests are less complex and easier than the real GRE (this is a pervasive problem in the test-prep industry, though)Remember that knowing a concept vs. mastering a concept are two different things. If you merely know a math concept, for example, you'll get the question that tests it right if you recognize the concept. But the GRE is good at disguising concepts.

"As a GRE tutor, I've read a pretty good variety of GRE books. In their latest ""Cracking the GRE"" edition for ""2015"" (It's May of 2014, guys), The Princeton Review - as they usually do - does a decent job at informing the reader about the GRE and provides usable strategies to help deal with the test. However, in attempting to appeal to a wide audience, the book oversimplifies the process and adulterates its quality.Things I liked: the strategies in the book work. If you're new to the GRE or self-studying, these strategies will provide one way to deal with GRE problems. Maybe not the best way, but one workable way.- The writing is readable and the organization of the book is logical. To be useful, books must be usable and this book is easy to follow.- The book covers all of the major concepts the GRE is likely to present.Things I didn't like:- Like most books by The Princeton Review, this one starts off with the claim that the GRE is a silly test that doesn't measure your intelligence and only measures ""how well you take the GRE"". This is pandering and untrue: I'd argue that many of the things the GRE tests ARE good predictors of your intelligence and ability to succeed in grad school - things like writing skills, vocab, reading comprehension, logic, critical thinking, and adaptability. But it probably sells more books to disparage the GRE and then claim that this guide is an ""all-in-one solution"". The problem is that students who buy into the pandering may be less likely to build crucial foundational skills.- the treatment of most topics is too brief. Those with higher than average score aspirations should supplement with other books.- practice questions are, generally, too easy and less complex than real GRE questions. Some topics are neglected in the book's practice tests (for example, passages with two bolded parts).Overall, unless you're starting from a high skill level, you'll almost certainly benefit from more material and better material than this book offers. One good example is Manhattan Prep - though they break up their GRE guides into eight books (which is expensive), it's also unfortunately necessary. One book just can't do it all, despite what The Princeton Review claims.

"I tutor the GRE professionally and have done so since 2008. If you're new to GRE prep, this book is a good start, but don't think it's a one-stop shop for all your GRE prep needs. It's far from a ""total test-preparation program"": like most things in life, getting good at the GRE is not as simple as picking up one book. With that said, this book will help in many ways. I give it 3.5 stars.Things I liked: - Some strategies are well-explained and useful, in particular, those for reading comprehension. Text completion and sentence equivalence are good as well, those not as robust. Math strategies are solid - particularly the quantitative comparison strategies. - The review of math concepts is largely good, though certain concepts get glossed over too quickly or even ignored (combinatorics). - Answer explanations are thorough and understandable.Things I didn't like:- The quality of the practice questions is just average. Real GRE questions are more complex and varied - particularly the verbal questions. This is important - do not just practice with these questions and expect to be ready for the real GRE. But one area that does stand out to me is the reading comprehension PASSAGES, not the questions. The passages are well-written and representative of real GRE passages.- The essay advice is on the light side - falls short of what you'll most likely need. For instance, very little advice is given on how to construct a body paragraph other than providing examples of them.- The practice test question quality of the online practice tests is unfortunately a bit worse than the book ones.- The book makes no mention of ETS's Official Guide to the GRE, which is (in my opinion and experience) an unfortunate prioritization of book sales over the desire to help students as much as possible. The Official Guide is essential and much more helpful than any third party book. - The title. 2015? C'mon, bro. It was published in April. The GRE hasn't changed since 2011.Overall, this isn't a bad companion to the Official Guide, but you'll need more if you're serious about the GRE. And like I said, it's not as simple as buying one book. No third-party company does a very good job of duplicating the real GRE's nuances - particularly in the verbal section. I do like Manhattan GRE, but many of the same criticisms as above apply - just in different areas.

"I'm an SAT tutor and have been full-time since 2008. I think this book is absolutely great for three reasons:1. The author has found the luminaries in the field (Erica Meltzer, Pwn the SAT, etc.) and tells you about them. Now you know about them and can follow their advice, too. There are countless not-so-good places to find SAT advice, so this is tremendously valuable.2. She's actually walked the walk. This is rare. She speaks from experience, not theory. All her advice carries a resulting authenticity.3. She was able to motivate her son to do well on the SAT and explains how she did it.My job would be a lot easier if all parents had to read this book.

"As a full-time SAT and ACT tutor, I'm familiar with a lot of what's on the market in the way of ACT test-prep materials. It's easy for me to give this workbook five stars; it's not only best-in-class but obviously MUCH more thorough, insightful, and therefore useful than its competition.Since there are so many different ways the ACT tests grammar, punctuation, and rhetorical skills, this workbook is a welcome way for students not only to get an explanation of each tested skill but also to get realistic practice through the accompanying exercises.For the serious student, the book is a godsend if he or she will put in the time to work through it.

"As a veteran SAT tutor, I've seen firsthand that one of the most intimidating aspects of the SAT, for many, is the difficulty level of the vocabulary present in its sentence completion questions. But learning or even memorizing all the words the SAT may test is an unachievable task, and making a noticeable improvement in one's vocabulary can take a long time.The bad news? Most students do need to learn many new vocabulary words and word roots - and there is no shortcut for doing so. The good news? Good technique and high-quality practice material goes a long way. That's where this book comes in.- there's an authoritative explanation of sentence completion technique- the author debunks the dangerous myth that sent. comp. is just about vocab and explains how even students with superior vocabulary skills can and do miss questions- the practice questions are very SAT-like and consequently much better for practice than nearly any book I've encountered- the answer explanations are articulate and thorough- the list of common second meanings of words is very usefulThe book's no-nonsense tone and rigorously explained questions are a welcome change from the flash and lack of substance of books written by bigger SAT-prep companies. This clearly is the labor of someone invested in improving SAT scores. Highly recommended for self-studying students of any level.

"I'm a long-time SAT tutor, and I'm always looking for resources to help my students (and to make me better at what I do). This guide, though not completely comprehensive, is a valuable edition to a student's SAT writing toolbox for several reasons:- no pandering. I like that the author debunks the myth that a student can memorize a series of examples that work for any essay prompt.- good writers and smart students will find their intelligence is respected - instructions are clear without being dumbed down- the writing is down-to-earth and consequently engaging and easy to read- it's not the size of a phone book (like many SAT prep books) - it's easy to get through- the essay and its necessary components are well-explained- many sample student essays are presented, dissected, and gradedThe only area in which I found the book to be a little lacking was its treatment of how to actually write the details and subsequent analyses that make up an essay's body paragraphs. This could be more explicitly explained. However, many students will be able to glean information from the excellent writing in the author-written sample essays and some of the sample student essays.Overall, I think the book is a great resource for students who are smart enough to realize that there's more to writing a good SAT essay than tips and tricks.

"I'm an ACT tutor and have been since 2008. This book is a useful tool for students who want to improve their ACT math scores by getting extra practice. It provides realistic math problems which are organized by topic and difficulty level.Things I liked:- the problems are much like real ACT questions- the ordering by difficulty level makes it easy to start at the right place for your skill level- the problems have detailed answer explanations which often include multiple ways of solving the problem- many of the answer explanations actually teach math and calculator skills- good time management strategies and study strategies are givenThings I would change:- the problems can become slightly repetitive - good, since repetition helps learning, bad because students aren't always forced to adapt that much- problems could be more like the ACT in terms of creativity (though I've never seen an ACT math book which perfectly mimics the ACT's styleI would use this book as a supplement to the Real ACT Prep Guide.

If you are a high scorer, I'd recommend supplementing with the challenging Pwn the SAT. But if you think this book's breadth is a detriment, I'd say you're missing the point. The book is useful for both low, medium, and high scorers because it covers things 99% of students need to learn. Most importantly, it's usable, manageable, and readable.

"Picture yourself in a museum. In front of you is a masterful Jackson Pollock painting. Next you to stands an art critic. You glance at him. He's frowning. ""It's a fake!"" he says. Weird, you think. Looks real to me.The painting is these practice tests. You're you. I'm the art critic. I've been tutoring the SAT since 2008 and have read a lot of different SAT material. One of the most important things for students is that they practice with SAT tests written by the College Board. The SAT writes these tests extremely carefully. The Princeton Review's tests might look the same to the untrained eye, but I assure you they are not.This matters - a lot. The Princeton Review's tests are easier in certain ways, less complex in most ways, and sometimes even test things the SAT won't. Practicing with them is kind of like training for the Superbowl by playing rugby. You'll be in for a surprise when you get to the real thing. This is particularly evident for the verbal questions - the math ones are better but still too straightforward. Now granted, I think 98% of prep books don't write SAT questions well. My guess is that it just takes too much time and effort to really get the nuances right. And quantity sells.So, in my opinion, there is no reason to buy this book, since the College Board makes so many real SAT's available. There are books which offer answer explanations, too.The other thing I don't like about this book is that it makes the claim that the SAT is silly because it just tests your ability to ""take the SAT"" and that it doesn't measure anything important. I would argue that the SAT DOES measure important things, and it measures them pretty well (vocabulary, reading comprehension, critical reasoning, math skills, ability to adapt). I know most people don't like the SAT, but people need to give it more credit. The kind of reading passages on it, for instance, are similar to those you'll have to read in college - and require the same skills (active reading, ability to read for main idea and to understand multiple viewpoints in a passage).I'm giving the book a star for its math questions and discussion of the essay.

"I'm a professional SAT tutor. Here's a quick analogy to help explain this review: me looking at these tests is like an art critic looking at a fake Rembrandt. The critic spots it in two seconds. To the untrained eye, however, the painting looks real. How much is the fake worth? If no one had spotted it, it could have sold for millions. But now that it's exposed, it's almost worthless.SAT tests written by a third party (like Kaplan) are not good representations of the real thing. The differences range from minor ones (too-straightforward math problems) to major ones (verbal questions that are too easy). I always recommend that students use authentic material. Practicing with this book will kind of get you familiar with the SAT, but you'll find the real SAT writes more complex and challenging questions - especially in the critical reading sections. Using this book for critical reading is like practicing for a baseball game with a softball and an aluminum bat.A one-star review may seem harsh, and I'm sure the authors put a lot of time and effort into this book, but I can't recommend that any student use it when the College Board makes so many real tests available.

"I have read many SAT prep books - because I tutor the SAT for a living and have done so since 2008. This book gets SAT prep wrong in many ways.1. The 8 practice tests do not resemble real SAT's. As I tutor, I can spot the differences right away, especially in the critical reading and writing sections. This is BIG DEAL: students who use these tests will find the real SAT different - and more difficult - in several ways. Kaplan's questions are usually less complex than real SAT questions. Even if you buy this book, I urge you to not practice with these tests - use College Board written tests instead. There are plenty.2. Verbal question techniques are oversimplified: ""get the main idea"", ""cross off wrong answers"", ""listen for the error"". There are many smart students who need more explicit instruction for how to find main ideas, determine if an answer is definitely wrong, etc. Also, I disagree with several of the verbal techniques. Mapping a passage by ""circling important details"", for instance, is a bad idea if you want to get the main idea (in my opinion).3. The techniques offered are demonstrated on Kaplan-written questions. It isn't hard to make a technique look useful if you've written the question it's utilized on.4. Some minor things are not accurate - for instance, this book makes the case that the SAT tests trig (??) and double negatives in sentences. It does not.5. The speech bubbles on the side of each page tend to have really obvious tips. The DVD is dumbed down - it will probably insult your intelligence at some point.I did like some parts of the book. The treatment of grammar errors is mostly solid. The math strategies are good.Students who are serious about the SAT should not, in most cases, buy just one book. It's not that easy, though big test-prep companies might like you to think so. Instead, I recommend seeking out more specialized books that focus on one section of the test - these authors don't have to cover everything and thus often do a better job.Also, Kaplan: you're doing students a disservice by not recommending the College Board-written tests as a companion to your books.

"I have been tutoring the SAT for over 6 years and have read a lot of SAT material along the way. Though this book does have some merit, I wouldn't recommend it for several reasons:1. The practice tests are not like real SAT's. The differences are subtle but significant, especially in the verbal sections. This is a major downside: students who practice with these tests will find the real SAT different in several ways - most importantly, Kaplan's questions are usually more straightforward than real SAT questions. Please, do not practice with these tests - use College Board written tests only. There are plenty.2. The techniques presented for verbal questions are oversimplified: ""find the main idea"", ""eliminate wrong answers"", ""listen for the error"". Sure, those methods work - IF you can do them. There are many bright students who need more explicit instruction for how to find main ideas, determine if an answer if definitely wrong, etc.3. The techniques are demonstrated on Kaplan-written questions. It's easy to make a technique look effective if you write the question it's used on.4. Several minor things are incorrect - for example, this book makes the case that the SAT tests trigonometry in math and double negatives in grammar. It doesn't. Certain reading passages are way off SAT style - for example, a passage that looks like it was taken from a science textbook about blood.5. The little bubbles on the side of each page with tips tend to have facile tips. For example, one ""perfect score tip"" says that ""I found that I didn't need to be overly creative to get a good score on the essay. Simply following Kaplan's rough format is enough to get you a good score."". How is that a ""perfect score"" tip?Ok, so what did I like about the book?

"This book is a good supplement to, but not a replacement for, the math review in ETS's Official GRE Guide.I tutor the GRE and my students often need to review math. But if they jump straight to math strategies, they often find they have foundational holes in their math knowledge. This book will help them fill most of the gaps in their math knowledge and practice skills at a basic level. It does a nice job of covering nearly all the math topics tested on the GRE.The book has several issues: some topics explained are not tested (using the quadratic formula and calculating standard deviation), and some topics are tested but not covered (normal distribution of a variable). Also, it's written by a ""math guy"" - and people with backgrounds teaching mathematics, like the author, sometimes explain things in a way that presumes the student understands certain things. Worse, the techniques used are too ""math teacher"" - there are more helpful techniques that the layman can use.The practice questions and tests are way too straightforward - GRE questions are tricker, more complex, and more creative.If you need to brush up on math, this book will help. But you'll also need math strategy and you'll need to practice with authentic GRE math questions (i.e., those written by ETS).

"I've been tutoring the GRE since 2008. Most of the problems I have with this book come from me picturing the average student using it. I am afraid this book will give students a false sense of efficacy for three reasons:1. The Kaplan methods tend to assume the student has certain skills. For instance, the reading comprehension strategies assume students have a good way to get a main idea from a dense passage. In my experience, many students don't know how to do this. The strategy doesn't work if a student can't do part of it - instead, the book should more clearly explain HOW to look for main idea. Likewise, Kaplan advises to ""think strategically"" as part of math strategies. I don't think most of my students can see the logical way to make questions simpler, because many haven't done math in a while. I think teaching techniques is much more effective. Of course it's easy to do a math question if you happen to see the logic behind it - but that won't work for many if not most students on the real GRE's complex, multi-layered math questions.2. The second false confidence booster is the practice questions and tests. They're too easy, and more importantly, too straightforward. Though you might think they're hard enough because they have tough vocab, in fact, the real GRE writes MUCH more complex questions for both verbal and math - questions that are tricky in spite of easy vocab. The reading comp questions are too straightforward. If you just practice with these questions, you will be in for a nasty surprise when you take the real GRE. Admittedly, no one really does a bang-up job of writing verbal GRE questions that are like the real thing - Manhattan Prep is ok.3. The math section doesn't cover all concepts tested. The verbal tests don't even have logic questions! Not good.I did like some of this book. The essay writing drills stand out to me because they will help students improve their writing style and get rid of some bad habits. And the math reference in the back is pretty useful. Other than those, though, I think the book isn't a good resource.

"I don't think any student should use this book to prepare for the ACT. I know that's a bold statement, but let me try to back it up. First, I've been tutoring the ACT and SAT full-time since 2008. I have read a lot of ACT prep material. There are many better books out there. Here's a list of the things about this book I didn't like:- the top 50 strategies list, which many students will read first and study before the test, goes from the obvious: ""get a good night's sleep and eat breakfast"" (duh) to the hard-to-follow: ""relax!"" (it's not always easy to relax even if you want to) to outright bad advice ""read science passages for main idea"". (This doesn't work for most students and most science passages.)- the diagnostic test and practice tests in the book are not good models of real ACT tests. They're usually too easy. To the untrained eye, they might look the same, but I assure you they are significantly different. There is no good reason to practice with them when so many real ACT's are available for purchase (and for free).- the foundational skills (grammar, punctuation, math) provided are cursory and could go much further- the techniques for solving questions are oversimplified and not very effective as a result- the attitude of the book that ""the ACT test writers are evil"" seems like pandering to students - in fact, I think the ACT writers are pretty good at determining if students have certain skills- the organization of certain sections didn't work for me - for instance, English rules are presented as an appendix instead of part of the chapterTo be honest, this book makes me angry - because I know thousands of people will buy and use it because McGraw Hill is a big company with a big marketing budget. There are some useful tips in the book (it's not all bad), but with so many other options, I would recommend looking elsewhere for ACT help.

"I tutor the SAT (and ACT) full-time, so I've read many SAT prep books. I like this one. It's comprehensive and competent. It seems that they worked closely with SAT tutors as opposed to having an academic write it, and it shows. So, do you want the good news or the bad news first? Ok, I'll start with the bad news.- the practice questions and tests, like 95% of those that aren't published by the College Board, do not represent the SAT well in terms of question style and difficulty. This is especially evident in reading comp. and grammar, where the questions are too easy. This isn't because the authors are lazy or incompetent - it's just really HARD to duplicate the nuances of real SAT's. The math questions are pretty close. BUT - do not let this stop you from buying the book. Just practice with College Board tests instead of this book's.The good news:- the rest of the book. It's solid. I like the caution against learning tips and tricks and glossing over foundational skills. That's exactly what I've learned is important (and I learned the hard way).- great sections on planning your studying- the book is well-organized and color-coordinated, and therefore easy to read and use- it functions like a workbook broken up into lessons, many of which are insightful and usefulNow, this isn't my favorite SAT book.

"Since 2008, I have been tutoring the SAT privately, mostly to high-achieving students, so I've read a lot of SAT prep material. Overall, this is a decent choice for a strategy book, but I wouldn't really recommend it if you have the budget to buy a few books.Advantages:- techniques are mostly useful and well-explained- the book's writing, overall, is easy-to-read and engaging- time management and test-taking strategies are helpfulDisadvantages:- the book claims it's a one-size-fits way to master the SAT. Though the book is a jack-of-all-trades, it's a master of none. In my opinion, there are better resources for each section of the test.- practice questions and tests are not accurate reflections of the real SAT both in terms of difficulty and question content/style. This is a really big deal. I strongly recommend you avoid using these questions; use the ones written by the College Board.- the book's focus on ""cracking"" and tricks at the expense of learning fundamental skills can steer students away from putting in the time to learn vocab, math, do extra reading, etc.For those students looking for a high percentile SAT score, I would look for more specialized books written by people focusing on just one area of the test. Books like these tend to be more rigorous, since the author doesn't have to cover everything. For math, try Pwn the SAT or the New SAT Math Game Plan; for verbal, try the books written by Erica Meltzer (for critical reading and grammar). I also like Pwn the SAT essay book.

"I have been tutoring the GRE since 2008. I like this book, but I am only giving it 3 stars for one important reason: the verbal questions are less complex - and therefore easier - than real GRE questions. There are several nuances to the real GRE's verbal questions and problems that this book doesn't capture. To see what I mean, compare the GRE questions on ets.org/gre to the ones in this book.The trouble with practicing with verbal questions that are too simple is that you're not going to be used to dealing with the more complex, convoluted questions that the GRE likes to write. Oddly enough, the GRE doesn't go as crazy with hard vocab as it used to - but it does often write sentences that confuse many of my students even when the vocab is easy. The vocab in this book is hard, but there is a lot more to verbal questions than hard vocab.The reading comprehension questions are better, but obviously you should spend more time with real GRE reading comp questions.The math sections are good - the book goes topic by topic and provides practice questions that are realistic. Overall the strategies the book provides do work.If you buy this book, I would use the verbal questions sparingly as a warm-up, and then spend most of your time with real GRE verbal questions. But go nuts with the math - it will help. Ignore the essay prompts in this book - they are a waste of time - only because the GRE publishes all of its potential essay prompts on its website. If you spend time working on a prompt from this book, it's time you could be working on a real prompt (that actually could be on your real exam)!Those with high score goals, of course, will probably need more than this book can offer - but that's true of pretty much any test prep book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BNICKS8ZANVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307946312#wasThisHelpful","R1BNICKS8ZANVU","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a full-time test-prep tutor, and I've studied at least 12 real ACT tests with students of mine. This book is a good overall guide to the ACT.

This is pandering to people who don't like standardized tests, AND it's a dangerous misconception.

"I write this review from the perspective of someone who tutors the GRE professionally and has done so since 2008. Overall, the book is good, but not great. It's a mix of helpful advice, oversimplified advice, and dangerous advice.Helpful stuff:- most of the DVD. Good tips for time management/test taking. Good, specific techniques for most question types. The presenter is clearly a real tutor and knows his stuff. Easy to watch and follow.- concepts and techniques are presented in plain, helpfully written English- most techniques are usable and effective- vocab is appropriately chosenAverage stuff (the theme here is oversimplification):- practice questions are generally representative of the real test (but sometimes too simple)- math review does a nice job of simplifying things (at the expense of sometimes oversimplifying)- techniques can be a little bit too basic and some need to be expounded upon to actually be usefulBad advice/things that are just wrong:- from the DVD: ""the essay is by far the least important part of the test"". Not true for MANY grad programs.- from the DVD: ""the test is scored from 200-800"" - not since 2011...- the book's title and assertion that the GRE ""just assesses your ability to take the GRE"". If you don't believe the test measures your vocab, math, writing, and reading comprehension skills, and that those fundamentals don't matter, and that you can just use this book to ""Crack the GRE""... then you've just fallen for The Princeton Review's marketing. Unless you have average score aspirations, you will almost definitely need to do MORE than this book suggests.- the claim that you don't need to buy the ETS Official Guide. The ETS book has a ton of real GRE questions that are real, therefore worth your time.All in all, a pretty good book - just be aware of its shortcomings and it can be a useful tool in your GRE prep.

"I'm a full-time GRE tutor, so I bought this to see if it was a resource I could recommend to my students, who often need to relearn a LOT of math. This book is a solid treatment of the math concepts the GRE tests, as well as a decent overview of the different kinds of questions on the test. But, those with higher than average score goals will need to supplement with other books (and of course everyone should be working with ETS's Official Guide).Things I liked:- covers most of the concepts that can appear on the GRE- each concept has a good number of practice exercises of varying difficulty- the 100 ""most important"" concepts list at the back is a good checklistThings that could be improved:- the questions are usually too easy - or more importantly, too SIMPLE - the questions on the GRE are usually more creative and complex, especially at the higher score levels- in my opinion, the time management advice only applies to the top 20 percent of scorers- the book seems to have been modeled on the math concepts that the GRE TELLS us the test covers, NOT on actual observation of GRE tests or practice tests. What the GRE says it will test and what it actually does test are sometimes two different things.So what you're getting is coverage of the concepts you'll need to know without getting the difficulty level or complexity of real GRE math questions. This book will help to a degree, but you'll definitely want to use another source of practice material as well. It's a pretty good resource for those who haven't done math in a long time.

"As an SAT tutor, I'm always looking for resources that my students can use WITHOUT me. For students who want competitive scores, meeting with me once or twice a week isn't enough time to learn all the different math concepts that can show up on the test (unless the student is willing to do a LOT of tutoring). These students need to be doing daily work in areas like math - the question is often finding them a resource that represents the real SAT in terms of the types and difficulty level of questions.This book is a great resource for those students who can already score around 600 in math and who want a score of 700+. It's broken down into 28 techniques, concepts, and lessons that can be considered to be tools in a student's SAT toolbox. The author makes the point that the more tools you have, the more likely it is you'll find a way to solve the problem in front of you. Each concept has several practice questions that range from easy to very hard.Mr. Warner does a nice job of covering the tricky concepts the SAT is likely to present and seems to be basing the book on observation of many real SAT tests. One of the strengths of the book is that multiple ways of solving the same problem are often provided. Another strength is that there are some great calculator tips - many of which I haven't used before. I also liked the way the book is laid out graphically - the different colors and diagrams make it easier to follow without losing focus.Overall, for the student with the discipline to work through it, this book will absolutely raise his or her SAT math score.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25HGVPM4F0L0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481019333#wasThisHelpful","R25HGVPM4F0L0X","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tutor the GRE professionally and I have taken the Revised GRE. I've also written a couple of GRE books, one of which (Barron's 6 GRE Practice Tests) could be considered to be a competitor to this one - so you might want to take this review with a grain of salt. However, this is really not a good GRE math book. I was hoping it would be a more GRE-targeted edition of the fantastic CliffsNotes Math Review for Standardized Tests - which I gave 5 stars to and have been recommending to my GRE students for years.The main trouble with this book is that the questions are way off the style, difficulty level, and even the content that the GRE covers. The book does cover most of the math topic areas that the GRE covers, but I don't think the authors used the real practice tests at all. The resulting practice questions do test the math topics the GRE tests, but in much different ways - usually MUCH easier ways. For example, one of the practice test questions just tests your ability to get the square root of 119. Uh - there is a calculator with a square root button on the GRE now - the real GRE would never write a question like that. The real GRE also doesn't test your ability to use the quadratic equation or calculate standard deviation or variance - but this book makes it seem like it does.I challenge anyone to check out a real GRE practice test and compare the math questions to the practice questions in this book - the differences should be obvious even to the novice.There is also some bad advice about taking the test: ""never spend more than 1.5 minutes on a math problem"". That MIGHT be good advice for top scorers, but for most people - who shouldn't be trying to work on every question - it's problematic since it will spread them too thinly. Even if you're above average, you don't want to spend time working on all the problems in a math section - you should probably make a couple of sacrifices for the greater good.This book does cover a lot of the math the test covers and for that I give it two stars. But there are many better options on the market if you want a book that just helps with GRE math.

"I'm a full-time tutor of the SAT and other standardized tests. Compared to the majority of SAT prep books, The Critical Reader is outstanding in the breadth and depth of its treatment of its subject - the Critical Reading section of the SAT. I was consistently impressed while reading it.

"As a full-time tutor, I've observed that there is a world of difference between students who merely do well and those who strive to be at or near the top of their class. High-achievers have a MUCH easier time getting into competitive colleges - not because they're necessarily smarter, but because their applications can't help but show their desire and drive to do noteworthy things. This book is for those high-achievers and for any motivated student who genuinely aspires to do better in school - whether it's high school or college.Weisman, clearly speaking from successful experience, outlines numerous ways to get motivated, get organized, and to achieve. Students will find it easy to relate to her conversational, friendly advice. Even if they just flip through the book, they'll find lots of practical tips and techniques that they can put into immediate use. This is great, because no one tells students how to do this stuff. High schools certainly don't offer much in the way of study skills or organizational advice. Students either find a way that works - or they don't. This book is a nice way to save most students a lot of time.I might like this book better if it were two books - one for high school, and one for college - but most of the advice overlaps. With that said, it's a great find and should be helpful to those who take the time to peruse it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BMTLYP0SN3EW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402280793#wasThisHelpful","R2BMTLYP0SN3EW","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been tutoring the GRE since 2008, and I've written two preparation books for it (Barron's 6 GRE Practice Tests, and GRE Vocab Capacity). So I'm very familiar with the test (maybe a little too familiar). This version of the ETS Official Guide to the Revised GRE is exactly the same as the old version except for a couple of important things:1. There's a new paper practice test. This is great, since it brings the number of authentic GRE practice tests available to four. The practice tests on the CD are the same ones you can download from the GRE website for free.2. Sample responses to the 2nd paper test's essays are included with grader commentary. This is useful since you can see what the real graders liked and what they didn't.Things I like about this book:1. The AWA (analytical writing assessment) chapter is well-written. Not only does it clearly explain how to score well, but it includes real sample essays (and there are more sample essays + commentary at the end of each paper test).2. The book and CD have real GRE questions and tests (obviously). Using real questions is much more valuable that using those written by a third party because they are always more realistic and therefore are MUCH better preparation for the real GRE you're going to take. The computer tests are exactly like the real GRE I took.3. The book covers all question types and *most* but not all of the math concepts.Things I don't like:1. The question explanations are often inaccessible to the average student, too technical/highfalutin, or too presumptive that the student understands certain concepts. I realize that the book can't explain everything, but more question explanations could be written in layman's terms. Similarly, the math review goes into too much detail about certain concepts and skimps or even leaves out others. There is a dearth of math technique to make problems easier.2. The strategies in the book are not very insightful. Any good tutor or test-prep book can offer more helpful strategies than this book - but I guess we shouldn't expect ETS to give us the best tips on its own test - just like we shouldn't expect the IRS to tell us how to save the most money on our taxes.Overall, this book is essential to prepare for the new GRE, and your time spent with it will pay off. Even if you think you're very good at math, verbal, and/or writing, mastering the GRE demands getting used to its format, quirks, and nuances. Do not let third-party material (Kaplan, Magoosh, etc.) give you a false sense of confidence!  ***Update: you should definitely also buy the additional verbal and quantitative practice books that ETS is now publishing. Real questions are worth their weight in gold.***If you'd like more prep recommendations, click on my name and you'll see a link to my website.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3047R0OKH1GGN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=007179123X#wasThisHelpful","R3047R0OKH1GGN","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a full-time SAT tutor, and in my experience, students approaching SAT math for the first time often try to apply the same math techniques they would in an algebra or geometry class. This isn't always a bad thing, but sometimes, SAT math problems are more easily solved when different, test-specific strategies are used.This book discusses 32 math strategies that work for SAT-style math problems, and includes sample problems on which the strategies may be applied. I really liked the description of most of the strategies, and think that any student who seriously works with this book will improve her math ability. Additionally, the author has a lot of insights about the test that I'm sure come from working with many students over the years.The only thing I would change about the book is its breadth - some of the strategies are a bit esoteric, and may only be useful once in a great while - such as certain geometry strategies. The average student may be a bit overwhelmed - but top math students may appreciate that the book covers so much. I would rather see the book spend more time on the most common strategies and less on the seldom-used ones.Overall, this book is a great resource, and I strongly recommend it for students who are ready to spend the time and effort to improve their mathematical confidence and ability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RY9EZNT2X1V6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468131915#wasThisHelpful","R1RY9EZNT2X1V6","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an SAT tutor, I'm always thinking about ways to teach students math. So I really enjoy when a book teaches me something new.I really liked the author's advice about two things in particular, and I'm going to steal his advice and use it with my own students:1. Do a little bit of math work every day. Such a great point - students will learn much more if they study a little bit at a time vs. spending a lot of time once or twice a week.2. Redoing incorrect problems with a DIFFERENT method. I like this point because students gain confidence from having multiple ways to solve problems - plus, if the first way of solving it produced an error, it may be a sign that the method initially used is not the most appropriate method.Aside from those points, I liked that the book breaks down problems into difficulty level and provides clear explanations of the problems. The only thing I didn't like was that I sometimes didn't think the problems were realistic representations of SAT problems. I would also like to see the author point the student to problems in the College Board's Official SAT Study Guide that were similar. But overall, these are minor quibbles, and the student who uses this book will no doubt greatly improve his SAT math ability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHC602IIA793/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1470002310#wasThisHelpful","R1VHC602IIA793","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a full-time test-prep tutor, and have found that most of my students only have a rudimentary grasp of the many of the grammar rules that the SAT tests. Though many of these students are excellent readers and writers, no one has ever taught them the fundamentals of grammar or explained the building blocks of sentences. Meltzer's book is a fantastic resource since it thoroughly covers all the grammatical concepts an SAT test taker needs to know. Things I liked:1. All error types are explained. Unlike many other SAT books, which gloss over or skip certain errors, this book covers everything with the insight that only comes from long-term scrutiny of actual SAT tests.2. Blue Book (College Board Official SAT Study Guide) questions are categorized. This is important, since students need to be able to recognize the errors in actual SAT questions and can use this book as an index to look up and practice troublesome error types.Things that I think could be improved:1. The book often is dry and utilitarian. It's hard to make grammar interesting, but all but the smartest and most motivated students may find this book difficult to read and use, even though some of the writing is down-to-earth and funny. I think changing the layout, graphics, and look of the book might help.2. Most of the practice questions and exercises do not have answer choices. It would be great if the author had written SAT-style answer choices to go along with the exercises. Of course, students should spend more time with blue book questions than with the questions in this book.Overall, this book is the best of its kind, and is a great resource for SAT tutors and for motivated students.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHFAJ2IF9NHR0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1463599889#wasThisHelpful","RHFAJ2IF9NHR0","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a full-time test-prep tutor. A lot of very smart students come into my office who are acing their current math classes but who are rusty on one or more of the mathematical concepts that the SAT covers. These students also need to learn math techniques that work for the SAT, like estimating, backsolving, and plugging in numbers. Though there are other books that do parts of what Pwn the SAT does, it stands out because it's the complete package. Here are five things I really liked about it:1. It's tailored to smarter kids. The book gets right to the point and doesn't spend time covering the basics of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry that most smart kids know, opting instead to dive into the trickier concepts that many kids have trouble with. It doesn't try to cover every single possible concept (which is good because that can be mind-numbing for students).2. Each concept review is followed by several practice questions, and question explanations are very good (I like the handwritten ones a lot).3. The math techniques are well-described and the use of them is encouraged (I would have liked to see ""being nimble"" and ""guesstimating"" described as techniques and moved to that section.)4. It assigns categories to all of the College Board SAT Blue Book questions.5. It's pretty funny (and the down-to-earth language is a refreshing change from most test-prep books' serious tone).I think the practice questions, overall, are too hard/somewhat unrealistic and that students should spend much more time with the actual blue book questions than with the questions in this book. But then again, no test-prep author can perfectly imitate SAT questions and this book's questions are a good supplement to the blue book for those who want more practice.Overall, this is a great resource for students with a lot of motivation and intelligence - highly recommended for students who are self-studying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29TZUXEIA4ZD7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1467968102#wasThisHelpful","R29TZUXEIA4ZD7","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a full-time test-prep tutor and admissions consultant. In my view, Mr. Carpenter has done a wonderful job in doing what he says he set out to do: creating a concise, useful guide to college admissions for smart kids and their parents. It's particularly helpful for the kids.The book won me over pretty quickly with its insight into several different types of smart kids and their individual strengths and weaknesses in terms of admissions. And I think this book is better than any other I've ever read when it comes to telling kids how to figure out their unique talents and attributes. I love that it essentially tells kids to embrace who they are. One of the things I respect most about the book is that it is not afraid to state what everyone knows but few have the courage to say - some kids are smarter than others - and that the book is for those smart kids.I don't think this book is as perfect as some of the reviews seem to imply. I think the advice on essay writing and interviews is good, for instance, but I think in these areas, Carpenter gives students - even geeks - a little too much credit to be able to figure out everything on their own. For essays, I wish he'd included some common pitfalls (writing about cliched subjects), and for interviews, I wish he'd explicitly emphasized that students should practice mock interviews and maybe that he'd provided some sample questions. For geeks in particular (and I know, since I was/still am one), it is not easy to just ""be yourself"" and be candid during an interview if you're not used to thinking on your feet. The campus visiting advice is missing something I think is crucial - visit when the students are there, not during the summer. It also doesn't seem to emphasize how important it is to visit schools early and often. I hope Carpenter adds more content regarding the above in future additions of the book, since he covers the topics he does treat with kindness, wisdom, and authority.In spite of these minor omissions, this book's insights and merits absolutely make it a worthwhile purchase for parents of any smart kid. Carpenter really gets it, and I think his advice will really make a difference in many kids' lives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JKKSCTF7XJMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005MPFC4C#wasThisHelpful","R1JKKSCTF7XJMT","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Likewise, what good is a book on grammar, usage, and style tips if most people do not, cannot, or will not read it due to its impenetrability?Grammar Girl's book is useful because she avoids the over-technicalities that so many grammar and usage instructors use. When she does need to be technical, she lets the reader know (and often apologizes or adds some humor). The result is a readable, friendly, useful guide to better writing. This book is not a panacea, but it would, in my view, be a helpful tool for almost anyone.P.S.

"I'm a full-time test-prep tutor and have been for the past several years. As such, I'm familiar with the past few editions of the Official SAT Study Guide. The version of this book WITHOUT the DVD is essential, as it's the best source of real, College-Board-authored SAT tests.The only real difference between this version and the non-DVD version is - you guessed it - the DVD. (Ok, there's also a snazzy new cover.) Is the DVD worth the extra cost? Probably not:1. The DVD does have a new practice test, but between the book and the tests the College Board offers online, you'll have about 13 real SATs, which is plenty for the vast majority of students. If you really want one more test, getting the DVD may be worth it.2. The SAT test timer can be duplicated with any electronic timer.3. The math concepts video only explains a few questions.4. The SAT Skills Insight Video and Additional Tools are more marketing than anything.Keep in mind, any information that ETS provides to help you solve SAT questions is not going to be very insightful - after all, the maker of the test is not the source to turn to if you're looking for tips and tricks. All in all, this version looks a lot more like an attempt to make more money for ETS than to provide new, helpful material. I'm pretty sure ETS is banking (pun intended) on buyers' tendency to get the most recent version of any test-prep book. I hope this review gives you some information to help with that decision for this book.If ETS had offered a few new tests on the DVD, it would have been worth the extra money.If you're looking for SAT help or have a question about the test, just lemme know!","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38SAZ4BAC22N6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874479797#wasThisHelpful","R38SAZ4BAC22N6","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a full-time test-prep tutor. Many of my students, particularly my GRE and GMAT students, haven't taken a math class in years. They might have been strong math students at one point in their lives, but if they haven't used the ""math lobe"" of their brains (if there is such a thing) for that long, their math abilities have usually atrophied.I view math skill for standardized tests as a foundation - if a student has a strong foundation without any holes in it, they'll more readily learn how to handle some of the trickier questions that standardized tests can present. But if there are holes in their math foundation - a missing triangle formula here, a forgotten exponent rule there - then those deficiencies will come back to haunt them in the midst of a multi-step problem.That's where this book is so useful. If you do all the practice problems, you'll cover the great majority of concepts that tests like the SAT and GRE will test. Doing the problems is essential - they will give you enough repetition to learn (just staring at a page of formulas isn't that helpful). By the time you're done, you'll have a strong basis for learning the nuances of the test you'll take. This book even has helpful sections for the Data Sufficiency problems on the GMAT and the Quantitative Comparison questions on the Revised GRE.For math review, I'd recommend the exercises at KhanAcademy.org if you're more of a computer learner, but the advantage of this book is that it's easier to find the concepts on which you want to work.

"I'm a full-time test-prep tutor, so part of what I do is help students work on SAT subject tests. I agree with the reviewer who complained that this book hasn't been updated enough. The student who really wants a competitive SAT 2 test score will ultimately be disappointed in this book, since there is only one of each test. If the College Board had deigned to include new versions of all the tests with the new version of this book, at least students could supplement this book with the old version and have 2 tests for each subject.Serious students will have to supplement this book with practice tests written by a third party, which is unfortunate since those tests will not be highly accurate representations of the real thing.I wouldn't recommend buying this new - find a cheaper, older version or a used one (just be careful that it isn't marked up).","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QH5F048BZGVS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874479754#wasThisHelpful","R3QH5F048BZGVS","AKJ7KUSXC1BF0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AKJ7KUSXC1BF0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a full-time test prep tutor, I know that students who take several real practice tests do better than those who don't. Unfortunately, the previous edition of this book only included three tests - so I was happy to see this edition includes five. Take all five of these tests, and you'll be familiar with what the ACT will throw at you on test day. However, don't expect the ACT to give you insightful advice about its own test in the answer explanations - those explanations are usually convoluted and technical.I highly recommend you buy this book instead of books written by test-prep companies like The Princeton Review, Kaplan, and the like.

"My macrobiotic chef friend Juliette introduced me to Quinoa--very useful for someone allergic to gluten.  It's tasty and usually easier to make than rice, and probably lots better than white rice for your body.  Having enjoyed the regular, white quinoa, I tried this one.  It's harder to make as you have to rinse the kernels several times before cooking it and then add the quinoa to boiling water.  Since the kernels are small, you need a strainer (not a colander) to strain them.  More to clean up and they stick to the strainer.  As a retiree, I'm interested in tasty, but easy to prepare meals.  It's maybe not that big a deal, but I don't find the red variety any tastier than the regular, the package is smaller, it's more expensive, and it's more annoying to prepare.

The refrain goes on and on in your head--kind of a happy note despite the kind of negative direction of the lyrics--saying goodbye to a guy who is lying to her since she smells another woman's fragrance on his shirt.

"I was visiting my friend Chris in Phoenix when she introduced me to these towels.  I used them to clean my eyeglasses.  They're as clsoe to cloth as they are to normal paper towels.  They do the job regular paper towels do--and, perhaps, better.  But, they have two special features that put them above the rest--they're softer (yet retaining strength and absorption) and they are perforated to make smaller pieces.  This is very useful for small jobs (cleaning glasses for instance) and saves a lot of waste.

"I usually decline to review an item if there are already many reviews but I will if there seems to be something I can add that hasn't been addressed previously; similarly, I don't reiterate the plot.  This book in Muller's long-evolving series on Sharon McCone is a multi-perspective one in which several characters report from their own perspectives and observations.  This is especially appropriate in this book because Muller is evaluating/commenting on a relative's responsibility to someone who's has simultaneous drug and mental problems.  Even though Darcy is only a half-brother, Sharon pursues him and his kidnappers with dogged determination--though she's unsure of her own degree of responsibility.  It is important to note that Darcy has been in and out of both drug and mental therapy to no avail.  The question is: when/where does the family responsibility end and co-dependence begin?  This is a tricky question and, unfortunately, Muller doesn't really provide an answer, but her travail in addressing this sticky issue is IMHO informative and understandable.  This is not (as extremists might imply) a black and white situation.  In fact, in Nature/Life there are virtually NO such situations!  There are, however, spectra and Normal Distributions which fit virtually everything in Nature (you can, however, create dichotomies artificially -- e.g. computer binary).As for the characters, Darcy isn't likable--of course, and his character is hardly going to ""develop"" in this book.  There are some potential developments in the relationship between Sharon and Hy regarding a possible merger as well as the relocation of Sharon's agency.  But the main character development IMHO is with Mick.  He's at the computer but wants to go into the field.  This reminds me of Gordon Ramsay's visits in ""Kitchen Nightmares"" where people have acquired a restaurant with no knowledge of what they were getting into.  Mick finds out the hard way (as do these foolish restaurateurs) what the real world is like.  This may actually save his relationship with Allison (if you plays his cards right and stays at the computer).There's also a pseudo character development in Gaby.  Though she's dead from the start of the novel, your opinion of her changes as people reveal more and more of her life and personality--kind of back and forth too as she's filled in.There's also a very fine set of scenes with Lisa and Molly worth a laugh and a half.  They're a riot.  Unfortunately, I didn't take any quotations from this book.  Overall, it was IMHO a worthy addition to the series though certainly not one of its best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GWF9Z3871MN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AK2U04E#wasThisHelpful","R2GWF9Z3871MN2","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book includes 6 different reports on mystery stories for 2003 including award winners etc. plus the 32 mystery or crime stories.  It covers a spectrum of sub-genres so there will probably be several provided for the ones a particular reader likes.  As with most such collections, I find there are ones that I found to rate 5 stars, but others that left me cold.  I can usually find a number of quotations for my collection:p. 103: Mat Coward ""Offenders""--All the social graces of a thunderstorm.p. 196: Robert S. Levinson ""Take my Word for It and You Don't Have to Answer""--[He] knew how to get to the bottom of a gin bottle five minutes before the cap was unscrewed.p. 349: Joyce Carol ""The Hunter""--Women are forgiving of weakness if it is a bridge to their strength.p. 352: Peter Robinson ""The Cherub Affair""--I understood the woman's pride was such, she had convinced herself she was without pride.One of the special values to this collection are the small abstracts the editors have provided preceding each story.  I find them helpful in that they usually delineate other works by the author--so, if I like the story, I can read more by the same author--esp. those that have been specifically recognized/recommended (such as those receiving prestigious awards).  While this volume was published a decade ago, its stories are not dated, so it's quite a good buy today.

"THE GOOD--AMS writes very well indeed; his books are consistently well-written IMHO.  Secondly, he uses the books as vehicles to transmit pithy observations and rational conclusions about people and life.  This book is no exception and, IMHO, this raises his works above many other talented authors'.  Thus, he provides much insight and also contributes to my collection of quotations.  For example (from the hardback edition):p. 3: Every love has within it the echoes of past loves.p. 185: Inequality is written into the way the world works...Fate has her own rules of equality.p. 186: 'They were so nasty, weren't they?--The Greek gods.'  'Horrible.  Full of mean tricks and petty jealousies..'pp. 187-8: Young men these days have been encouraged into narcissism...you end up with a lot of self-obsessed young men.p. 212: If weaning from dependence succeeds, it often does so intermittently, and there will be periods of back-sliding, of weakness, when the temptation to do the thing that you know you should not do is just too strong.p. 236: If you're too worried about being kind to people, you end up saying nothing about anything.p. 266: We don't like to hear about ourselves...The truth can be a little creepy, I think.p. 315: We imagine that people know what we're thinking, and they don't.  We misunderstand one another.His works often have considerable humor, though this one seems to have quite a bit less than usual.  Nevertheless: p. 195: Half-price drinks...Full-price hangover.THE BAD--AMS' series' (e.g. 1st Ladies Detective Agency, 44 Scotland St., etc.) usually have at least one major character who is likable, sympathetic, admirable, such as Mma Ramotswe and Bertie Pollock.  Even his series in which the main character is rather silly (e.g. Portuguese Irregular Verbs etc.) one has sympathy for him.  But the two main characters herein don't get much sympathy from me--they're too pathetically passive.  This book consists of two stories, one of mother Amanda, and the other of her daughter Clover.  But its emphasis seems to be on their irrational emotions rather than characterization or character development.  During the 9 or 10 years of the story, Clover doesn't seem to age psychologically beyond the age of 13.  Amanda doesn't fare much better in the book either though I wonder if she's the shape of things to come for Clover.  Like Mother, Like Daughter?  Now, if you like Gothic Novels or Harlequin Romances, you might like this book, but as a man, I found it quite boring--like a bad TV sitcom.  Maybe it was written for teenagers?  But then it would be placed in the Young Adult section, not in Fiction.THE UGLY--AMS sometimes writes about really dumb people and this book's a case in point (I think his Philosopher books may be parodies and maybe this book is too).  How can anyone be as stupid as Amanda?  (with her obvious lies--so she really wanted to be caught for not doing anything?)  Oh, Clover can--with her obsessive fixation on James--who she's hardly seen for a decade but is still mad about--so as to stalk him from Cayman to Scotland to Australia to Singapore.  Guess she never heard that ""insanity is doing the same thing again and again and expecting to get a different result.""  And her decade-long angst goes on and on ad nauseum, ad infinitum!Yet all the characters are paper-thin to cardboard.  It's basically a helium-weight romance about a pair of idiots.  The only real character (though he has a bit part) is Ted.  He's the only one without unrealistic expectations--no wonder ""love hurts"" for the two main characters.  And the 4-leaf Clover ending (which I predicted halfway through the book) was as sappy as it was ridiculous and abrupt.  It seems to me that AMS had an idea for a novel, began writing, and ran out of steam.  He persevered redundantly through an entire book, but couldn't come up with the goods--and threw in an ending--perhaps in response to a publication deadline.  He might have deleted much of the repetition and replaced it with a better ending.  It would have been instructive to see whether Clover's teen fantasy could evolve into a real relationship, but I doubt it could have.  Happily Ever After only happens in fairy tales--but then this book closely resembles one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K492XBEFR1CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307908259#wasThisHelpful","R2K492XBEFR1CI","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As usual, AMS has added another well-written book to his repertoire,  This one's a sequel to ""Corduroy Mansions"" which was somewhat similar to his ""44 Scotland Street"" series except set in London vs. Edinburgh, Scotland.  However, this entry differs quite a bit from any of those prior works in that it is much lighter and much sillier.  I think AMS is attempting satire of espionage and counter-espionage, and for some readers, it's probably hilarious.  But to me, it was too silly.  The Green Man episode was also somewhat disappointing in its methodology and the Ginkgo one was so absurd--especially to someone who watches ""Shark Tank"" on TV.  The whole book, while enjoyable, was just too over-the-top for me to give it 5 stars.  But I can't give it 3 or less because of AMS' (as usual) delightful turns of phrase such as--p. 79: the cascade system [hand-me-downs; re-use]and very profound and insightful comments/observations (which I add to my quotes collection):pp. 62-3: She knew that this was quite simply wrong, but the beliefs instilled in childhood and youth are hard to dislodge, and Marcia had eventually stopped fighting the convictions that lay within her.p. 63: 'I know I'm pathetic,' she once said to a friend, 'I know I should be all independent and self-sufficient and so on.'p. 69: These pigeons had become dependent, they were the unintended casualties of her kindness.  William found himself wanting to warn her of the consequences of her misplaced generosity. [i.e. her co-dependence]p. 78: Bentham's view that the only things that should be prohibited are those things that harm others.p. 80: The parties of others--or those that one doesn't attend--are always so self-indulgent.  For most of us, the knowledge that somebody, somewhere, is enjoying himself more than we are is strangely disturbing.  A common human response is to disapprove, and to try to stop the enjoyment [narcissism]p. 86: There are some people who really need an on-off switch.  I can think of at least three.

"As reputedly the first married couple to write mysteries together, Marcia Muller and Bill Pronzini have again collaborated on a sequel to ""The Bughouse Affair.""  Per the prior book, chapters are headed by one of the two PI partners--I presume each author wrote one of the sets -- for each of the two detectives, but not necessarily.  The characters are not all that similar to Pronzini's nameless detective or Muller's Sharon McCone, so don't expect these novels to reflect their other series.  This series in set in 1895 San Francisco and some effort was taken to add some of the colorful life of that time and place into this book.  There are actually two interrelated mysteries--basically each approached by one of the two detectives: Sabina Carpenter and John Quincannon.  They don't collaborate very much.  Also, there's a somewhat mysterious character calling himself Sherlock Holmes, but he only has a small part to play in this book (unfortunately).This is a light mystery--much more so than the main series of the two individual authors. Interestingly, the two authors have written novels before in which their main characters (McCone & nameless) were both involved: ""Double"" and ""The Dangerous Hour"" (though not involved proportionally).  They also collaborated on ""Beyond the Grave.""  Actually, Muller has authored two trilogies other than the McCone series: starring Elena Oliverez and Joanna Stark which differ considerably from her McCone books.  Indeed, ""Beyond the Grave"" is an Oliverez book--probably the first one they collaborated on.  They have also collaborated in editing a number of themed short story collections such as: ""Chapter and Hearse,"" ""Child's Play,"" ""Kill or Cure,"" ""She Won the West,"" ""The Wickedest Show on Earth,"" and ""Witches Brew.""  I haven't read ""The Lighthouse"" yet so I don't know what form their collaboration took in that book.This particular book is a ""fun mystery"" IMHO, not a thriller.  I found it easy reading and quickly finished it.  It was enjoyable IMHO and pointed to future books in this series--especially regarding romantic interest.  There isn't much romance in this book but the tension between the two main characters is similar to the TV series ""Moonlighting.""  I liked the book, but I've enjoyed some of the authors' books far more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJMYLBHN6OZ4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765331756#wasThisHelpful","RJMYLBHN6OZ4J","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book consists of several parts:270 pages of personal experiences in the village of Auburn during WWII,12 pages on the people in the book,30 pages of Allingham's diary 1940-42,6 pages originally censored at publication6 pages of letters to Joyce Allingham16 pages of notes--listed by referenced page #, (notes are NOT referenced in the text) and7 pages of indexIf you're very detail oriented or you are interested in how it felt to experience WWII from an English village, this book's for you.  However, if you're not so interested, it can be quite trying if not completely boring.  There are some valuable observations though:: England was terribly unprepared for war even after Poland was invaded.  The people didn't realize this for quite some time--having much too much faith in Chamberlain and Parliament.  It makes one wonder if the West is far too sanguine about the rise of Islamists/Sharia in the 21st century.  Perhaps the most important thrust of the book is Allingham's analysis/feeling of the decision to fight/die for freedom/liberty or to accept domination from others inimical to your way of life.There are some notable quotations though:p. 22: The whole generation had to learn by trial and error [because of so many adults killed in WWI]p. 23: The present popular theory that it is a sin to be rich is due, I fancy, not only to the fundamental urge towards universal equality, but also to our passionate efforts at self-defense at that time when it was still a sin to be poor.  [jealousy]p. 89: The art of being governed is to do the necessary voluntarily and in one's own way before anyone starts shoving.p. 120: Nobody must ever be forced into doing good and must only be forcibly restrained from doing evil if he is actively harming somebody else.p. 177: Doubtless any well-armed parachutist could have killed all these dear gallant people.p. 181: Would you rather die, perhaps horribly, than be controlled by a force of which you do not approve?p. 184: I still accepted that mental and moral slavery was worse than death.p. 184: There is a way of living, entailing constant effort, which leads to growth, and another which leads to stagnation and then to rottenness, and finally to the death of one's power of every kind.  There is an up-pull and a down-pull, a building and a demolition, a fecundity and a sterility.  That is true.  That is a fact.p. 190: It is all very well to summon your courage one day, but to keep it sword-bright for a week, or a month, or a year, if no sign of danger materializes is quite another matter.p. 192: Never being able to do anything constructive is a monstrous sort of restriction.p' 270: Avoid all schemes which are based solely on a theory.p. 274: Work for the freedom which means life.  Pray for it, fight for it, die for it if you have to, live for it if you can.

"This book seems to me like an updated cross between Chaucer and Dickens.  Like Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" it's about travelers sharing stories on a trip.  Like Dickens (as well as AMS' ""44 Scotland Street"" series of books) it's broken up into small chapters with episodes concerning different characters interspersed.  However, unlike Scotland St., this book seemed a bit choppy to me--hard to hold my attention and keep the stories in mind.  Of course in Scotland St. the characters interrelate and influence each other due to their propinquity and relationships--this was not possible in this book.  Also, I felt rather let down by the endings of the stories--didn't seem fully resolved to me.  There were a couple of quotes I collected,p. 231: 'Nothings ever really black and white, is it,' he said.p. 240: 'Loving others is the good thing we do in our lives.'I don't usually review books that already have a lot of reviews, but I wish to counterbalance what may be the influence of the Halo Effect.

"This is a very well-written book explaining the basics of the American Legal System including constitutional, civil, and criminal law at a reasonably high level of abstraction.  Obviously, it is impossible for the author to explain all the details in a book of this size but he successfully describes the history of the development of both the theory and practice of law in the US--up to 2005--including numerous important legal cases, both federal and state.  For example: CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY:p. 28: Part of the constitutional scheme is that the federal government is a government of limited powers.  The branches may exercise only the authority that the people have delegated to them in the Constitution.  Therefore, any act that is contrary to the Constitution or beyond the powers enumerated in it is void.p. 32: How do we empower a government to do what we cannot do for ourselves, while making sure that it does not become so strong that it threatens our liberties?p. 32: The framers of the Constitution responded to the widespread perception that the government created under the Articles of Confederation was too weak.p. 89: But this is antidemocratic, isn't it?  In a sense it is.  That's what constitutional law is all about.  The will of a temporary majority, the sentiments of the moment, a vote in the legislature, cannot upset basic constitutional guarantees [but] can be shaped by the temperament of the times as to what rights are fundamental.CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE (IN LIGHT OF THEORY)p. 42:: The federal government is a government of enumerated powers, exercising only those powers specifically granted to it in the Constitution--though we have seen that that limitation is usually more theoretical than real, given the Supreme Court's acquiescence in the explosion of federal authority granted to it in the Constitution--though we have seen that that limitation is usually more theoretical than real, given the Supreme Court's acquiescence in the explosion of federal authority granted to it in the Constitution--though we have seen that that limitation is usually more theoretical than real, given the Supreme Court's acquiescence in the explosion of federal authority.And, some RESULTS of legal practices on society:p. 143: The increase in liability has contributed to a society in which people do not feel responsible for their own actions and all look for an excuse for their behavior and someone else to pay for the losses. In the 'sue-em' society, no one has to bear the consequences of his or her acts anymore.p. 309: Police, prosecutors, and criminal court judges see too much crime, so they tend to see crime everywhere.p. 329: the jury is the conscience of the community in the courtroom.  By bringing in the community's perspective, the jury may do something other than simply determine the facts and apply the law in a neutral way...As one court stated, the jury can act as a 'safety valve' for exceptional cases without being a 'wildcat or runaway institution.' (United States v. Thomas, 1996).It also includes some GENERIC QUOTATIONS for my collection:p. 74: Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote in Whitney v. California (1927), 'fear breeds repression' but 'courage is the secret to liberty.'p. 191: As an old legal saying goes, 'Not even the Devil knows the mind of a man.'And provides some observations relevant to future legal developments:p. 322: As Justice Clark wrote in Mapp v. Ohio (1961), 'Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own law.'I'm not a law student, but I found this book quite fascinating and enjoyable to read.  It read quite fast for me--possibly due to the author's engrossing style.  Highly recommended for both those contemplating study of law and for those desiring to know more about the legal system in which they are necessarily encompassed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R300IRRPPNQFKI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0195179579#wasThisHelpful","R300IRRPPNQFKI","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love this song--which is kind of like 2 related songs in one.  It addresses what it's like to be on your own in life.  I esp. like the refrain: ""Don't go crying to your mama, 'cause you're on your own in the real world.""  This should be the mantra today rather than dependency which seems to be a contemporary political current.  I bet Carl G. Jung would have greatly approved of it--as opposed to infantile grandiosity and the Peter Pan Syndrome.Not only are the lyrics pithy and valuable, but the melody and rhythm are catchy and engaging.  I like playing it and enjoyed watching and listening to Jena Irene sing it with Paramore on American Idol.  I very much enjoyed watching lead singer Hayley Williams dance while singing--she has great moves IMHO.  After I got this song, I listened to other Paramore songs and purchased ""Still Into You"" as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B7W8RXTO058B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C0NFOSI#wasThisHelpful","R1B7W8RXTO058B","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is basically an overview book--as well as an introductory one.  I think it's worth 4.5 stars in that it's so well-written and easy to understand.  It covers a lot of territory (or space if you don't mind the pun) so it obviously cannot go into too much depth.  The author attempts to convey the latest (as of publication date) scientific evidence and opinion as to the nature of various cosmic features.  I like that she is unapologetic about the limitations of our present knowledge while emphasizing international attempts or projects to extend that knowledge.  There are a few probably typographical or printing errors--notably on p. 138 where we sum to a total of 104% and on p. 198 where Einstein apparently received a degree (stated to be in 1905) while his birth date is given as 1914.  Obviously, he was precocious to the max--getting his degree not only before either his birth or conception.  Overall, I enjoyed reading this book very much--and learned quite a bit from it--but it's not at a College level--even for an introductory course.  Nevertheless, the author's definitions of astronomical phenomena are very helpful--as is having an index.  The chapters are short and concise.  I especially found the discussion of dark matter (though very limited by present knowledge of it) quite intriguing.

"A woman hires someone to kill her then changes her mind (after a significant occurrence) and gets a NYC police detective to try and protect her.  The idea may have been original in 1967, but the mystery is a bit thin--more of a thriller than a regular mystery.  The dialog and mores are very dated IMHO, but they do provide some insight into yesteryear.  The book is short and a very fast read.  The ending is rather predicable--a movie style ending.  Fast's mysteries are quite different from his science fiction works.  I did, however, get some quotes from the book:p. 34: Stupidity is not a thing to be doubted.  The whole human race suffers from the particular disease.  It is epidemic and in season always.p. 47: [New York] A city of people who have never given a second thought to being nice.  Oh, they can be a lot of other things, but nice--no, I don't think so.p. 74: Ninety-nine and maybe nine-tenths per cent of everything that goes around as fact is a lie.

"A farmer checks out his aging apple cider and the barn holding it blows up in his face.  After the fire's put out, a body is found in the wreckage--but who dunnit?  This is an interesting mystery by a member of the British Detectives Club (a contributor to ""The Floating Admiral"").  The best aspect IMHO is the juxtaposition of researches by a team of policemen vs. that of a contributing, civilian criminologist--who, of course, solves the intricate mystery.  Much of the mystery can be ascertained by the reader, but the process is worthwhile.  I guessed the culprit pretty early on, but proving it was another matter.  The book is well written in a simple, straightforward style.  It was an enjoyable, relatively quick read.  There were a number of quotes for my collection (from the scientific approach of the criminologist to the policemen):p. 47: Everybody, once they have suggested an explanation of any event, or series of events, has a tendency to interpret any subsequent discoveries they may make in light of that explanation.p. 101: The fatal mistake is to try to twist facts to suit this theory.  Form a dozen theories if you like, but never lose sight of the fact that all of them are merely tentative, and must be modified in accordance with each fresh fact as it is ascertained.p. 122: There were some people who preferred hunting in dark corners to looking at facts written on the wall in front of their eyes.p. 229: You are a victim of the elementary error of confusing ascertained fact with unconfirmed statement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWMAE0LFI8R9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=086220819X#wasThisHelpful","R2TWMAE0LFI8R9","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was perhaps Jena's crowning achievement on American Idol and IMHO showed that she was not only a talented singer but a creative artist.  It's a challenge for the contestants to sing covers yet show some uniqueness.  She certainly did that here--I've heard the original but didn't purchase it.  I don't think it was done anywhere near as well as Jena did it--whether one likes the slowed down version or not, her voice quality was far better than Radiohead's.  Unfortunately, at the end of the competition, American Idol (as in most viewer voted game shows) becomes more a contest between/among the voters rather than between/among the performers.  IMHO Jena outshined all the other contestants due to her creative style, uniqueness, and voice quality--though Caleb shined in stage presence.  A lot depends on the weights a voter has on the various aspects of performances--and how easily/early voters commit to a particular performer--ignoring later differences at times.  I only bought one song this season of American Idol, and this is the song.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N0NDKICU5431/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQHPJLS#wasThisHelpful","R1N0NDKICU5431","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this unusual book--with chapters written consecutively by members of the British Detection Club.  While the styles, of course, differ from chapter to chapter, the authors do provide considerable continuity as well as some twists and turns for the later writers to address.  An appendix provides the authors' explanations of the crime/activities.  I made the mistake of reading them as I went along--i.e. after reading a chapter of the book, I'd read that author's explanation.  I suggest you don't do this as it tends to spoil the continuity and somewhat prejudice your point of view through later chapters.  The appendix is quite interesting--esp. seeing that several authors came up with the same/similar ideas.  However, the final author, Anthony Berkeley, while successfully pulling together the many loose ends (clever, no doubt) deviated significantly from the prior authors--though he probably didn't see what they had written till he'd written his.  I admire his completeness, but I liked the earlier authors' ideas better than his.  So I ended up a bit disappointed at the end.  Still, it's my fault for reading the Appendix early (which I generally do with books to establish the context).  That said, I found the book an excellent experiment by the Club and good reading overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KR9QSPPPRWZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044124095X#wasThisHelpful","R3KR9QSPPPRWZF","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"GENERAL COMMENTS ON SERIESDutch diplomat and sinologist Robert Hans van Gulik (1910-67) apparently wrote 16 fiction & published 1 translation of the exploits of historical Judge Dee (630-700 AD).  He includes a short ""Postcript"" @ the end of most--worth reading 1st--esp. if it's your 1st one--woodcut type drawings/maps which greatly enhance the volumes and, in most novels, a ""Dramatis Personae"" list--especially valuable since it's divided up by case (most have 3 cases/book).  The Postscript to ""The Chinese Nail Murders"" describes the author's approach to them--mostly based on old Chinese documents & their conventions towards magistrates--though he modernizes them somewhat.  ""Judge Dee at Work"" includes a valuable chronology with dates.  Usually a Magistrate spent ~3 years in a district & was then transferred: Peng-Lai=663-6 AD, Han-Yuan=666-668, Poo-Yang=668-670,  Lan-Fang=670-676, Pei-Chow=676-677, and (after promotion) to the Capital=677-700).  Interestingly, most of the books take place during his 14 years (663-677) as district magistrate rather than this book which takes place during his 23 year tenure (677-700) in the capital after his promotion.  But, have no fear, he and 3 of his assistants, Tao Gan, Ma Joong, & Chiao Tai, are pretty much their old selves but with more authority.  I believe this is one of the last van Gulik wrote.THE SERIES INCLUDES:18 Judge Dee books (in alphabetical order with date): Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee (the one translation), The Chinese Bell Murders=668 AD, The Chinese Gold Murders=663, The Chinese Lake Murders=666, The Chinese Maze Murders=670, The Chinese Nail Murders=676, The Emperor's Pearl=668, The Haunted Monastery=666, Judge Dee at Work=663-70, The Lacquer Screen=663, The Monkey & the Tiger=666 & 676, Murder in Canton=681, Murder in Ancient China, Necklace & Calabash, The Phantom of the Temple, Poets & Murder, The Red Pavilion=668, and The Willow Pattern=677.  Of the 18 books one is redundant, one is a translation, and the other 16 are fictional works by van Gulik.  Interestingly, the 1st fiction books (The Chinese ____ Murders) were written in the order: Bell, Maze, Lake, Nail and Gold, but chronologically (in the fictional world) are ordered: Gold, Lake, Bell, Maze, & Nail.  The short stories are chronologically interspersed with the novels.THIS INDIVIDUAL VOLUME: (Others reviewers have already described the plot)Like some modern detective novels, the clues can be subtle and, in this case, based upon certain ancient Chinese customs.  As in other Dee novels, the mysteries tie into past crimes--here by a tyrannical marquis.  Unlike all the other books, Dee works with the military when marshal law is declared and is the only high ranking official who hasn't fled the plague in the capital.  Thus, the courtroom scenes differ somewhat.  As usual the several separate cases (according to the Dramatis Personae) are all interrelated.  Van Gulik often introduces interesting, unusual, and/or humorous characters--here there are dichotomous twins, naked dancers, a seriously enthralled lieutenant, a triumvirate of former rulers--of the old town, a puppeteer, etc.  Several of the books in this series began to be a bit disappointing IMHO due to their obvious repetition of themes, but this one is unique in the series--which I greatly appreciated.  I didn't get any quotes for my collection from it, but overall, I liked it very much.TYPE OF MYSTERY:Dee stories are more straight mystery vs. action/adventure/thriller, though some action does take place--sometimes including personal danger--implied herein due to the plague.  If you enjoy Golden Age Mysteries (e.g. Sayers, Christie, Marsh, Allingham, Tey), you'll probably enjoy the Dee books.  They usually have less social commentary, flowery description, political intrigue & physical action than contemporary ""mysteries"" but do provide insightful cultural descriptions/incidents--perhaps why I like them better--though they're not always historically accurate--per van Gulik's Postscripts.  Unlike the West, most describe the punishment of the criminals.OTHER ORIENTAL MYSTERIES:If you are particularly interested in Oriental mysteries, you might try Ingrid J. (I.J.) Parker's ~11th century Japan Sugawara Akitada mysteries, Laura Joh Rowland's ~18th c. Japan Sano Ichiro mysteries, and/or James Melville's more contemporary Japan Superintendent Otani mysteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6UVS7V5XJHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226848752#wasThisHelpful","R3K6UVS7V5XJHT","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Dee ventures out of the capital on a special mission (unlike the other novels).  As usual the several separate cases (according to the Dramatis Personae) are all interrelated.  Van Gulik often introduces interesting, unusual, and/or humorous characters--here there are coquettish twins, a belly dancer, an enigmatic blind girl, suspect financiers, a Governor and Prefect, a very unusual sea captain, Arab assassins, and a seemingly barbaric folk called Tanka, experienced with poison and strangling, but no hint of the supernatural/magical of some of his books.

"This is a very short novel (184 pages in the hard cover edition).  It features her main detective, Inspector Cockrill who's confronted with first one, and then another murder in which a family member appears to be the culprit.  As usual with Brand, motives abound but opportunities are rare--2, more or less, impossible (locked-room type) murders.  She also interjects bunches of red herrings and emotional complications.  I've only read 4 of her books so far, but I liked this more more most of them.  The characters are a bit more fleshed out and a bit more endearing than in some of her other works IMHO.  Of course, this was written over half a century ago in England and the mores don't map easily onto the 21st century.  But, perhaps, humans haven't changed so much in that time?  The characters don't seem to care a whit for justice and will lie to protect each other or let the supposedly unbalanced member appear to take the blame, etc.--and I'm not speaking only of the actual murderer.  I find that rather appalling myself, but maybe that's just me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FE8L2Z3A1KIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553254650#wasThisHelpful","R1FE8L2Z3A1KIB","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very clever mystery with lots of twists and red herrings.  I'd like to like it more, but I didn't find the characters very appealing and the style didn't engage me very well--I had to plow through it.  Many of the characters are more like caricatures it seemed to me.  Also, while there was some suspense, and I did figure out the culprit and method--I still wasn't sure it was correct because (and I still believe this) there are other possibilities inherent in the plot--kind of like those mystery plays in which the culprit & ending change from performance to performance.  I find this to be rather annoying--and it makes the ending rather dubious (unless and until the perpetrator confesses--but that's really a ploy in this circumstance).Interestingly, Cecil appears in this work--as he did in her first novel, ""Death in High Heels,"" which is referred to in this book.  Brand actually has two detectives, Inspector Cockrill (her main one) and Inspector Charlesworth who appears, apparently, in only two of her novels.  ""Death in High Heels"" is one of the two--he was her initial detective.  Thus, Cecil has met both of the detectives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19R95VNFA62IB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XE5BF2#wasThisHelpful","R19R95VNFA62IB","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some Brands improve with age--I think this one did.  Reminds me a bit of Margery Allingham in that respect at least (she also wrote about dress designers).  This is, I believe, CB's 1st novel.

I've only read one other, ""Fog of Doubt"" which I liked much better than this one.  So if you don't like this one, you might consider trying a later Brand novel.The characters are not deeply drawn though most are appealing.  The mystery was written prior to WWII so the climate and mores differ from today.  Some of their motivations seemed a bit much to me.  The mystery is rather complicated and I think a figure or two (esp. of the dress shop floor plan) would have been very helpful to the reader.

"This is my 2nd Paul Charles but my 1st with Inspector Starrett.  It moves rather slowly, even more than normal for a police procedural, with heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships.  The latter include ones: between Starrett and his team, between Starrett and his girlfriend's family, and (primarily) among the Sweeney family (of the deceased).  The language is sometimes difficult for an American reader with many colloquialisms--some of which are difficult to decipher from the context.  The author is attempting to depict dialect, but I wonder how realistic it is: do people really still say ""Bejeepers"" so much anymore?  I'm soon off to Northern Ireland, so I might find out soon.The mystery is fine though the method is similar to that in ""A Pleasure to Do Death with You"" (the other Paul Charles I've read) and I figured out most of the mystery fairly early (possibly because of the other book).  It did have a couple of quotes for my collection: p. 21: You could flirt for Team UK at the Olympics. &p. 80: You should always be wary of someone who walks at least a step or two behind his wife.I'd give it a better rating if it weren't so slow-paced and if much of the ""activity"" (mostly dialog) didn't seem overdone or extraneous to me.

Firstly, there are obvious errors such as p. 36 ""Inspector Poirot"" (per Agatha Christie, he was a detective but not with the police and not an inspector) and p. 302 where the main character enjoys having the same dollar notes as the cowboys had--older currency in the US were much larger physically than they are today.  Of course, I can overlook such things since the character, being human, can make mistakes.  Secondly, as it's about a Northern Irishman living in contemporary London, an American reader (such as myself) must try and understand various colloquialisms--but this book seems to be loaded with them--and they're nothing like the Britishisms of Christie, Sayers, etc. with which I am familiar.  Also, numerous references to unknown (but apparently real) people.  But, the worst aspect IMHO are the very hard to believe actions of the culprits when they've been caught.  I don't want to put in spoilers so I won't provide detail, but some things in this book are extremely difficult to believe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUD19X33P0C8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802313523#wasThisHelpful","RUD19X33P0C8B","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is reputed to be the first mystery novel (Poe wrote a mystery story prior to this, however).  The Saturday Review said it was ""considered by many to be the ranking detective story of modern times.""  Agatha Christie called it ""one of the best detective stories ever written.""  Dorothy Sayers said it ""ranges from a vividly colored rhetoric to a delicate and ironical literary fancy.""  Pretty good reviews!  It was written in 1913 and many of the great mysteries built upon its foundations.  And, it's a fine mystery--a bit slow at first, but the ending--kind of like some of the very best mystery short stories or the mystery plays where the real culprit is changed from performance to performance.  I have to admit though, that I somehow psyched out the killer early on--without any real evidence to support my conjecture/conclusion--just from having read tons of mysteries I think.Frequently, even in modern times, the detective/sleuth, whether professional or amateur, will reach a startlingly logical and totally wrong conclusion in a novel prior to the denouement and final solution to the puzzle.  It isn't much of a spoiler (especially considering the earlier reviews) to state that this book includes such an arrangement--but it does it very well.  So well that one becomes a doubting Thomas regarding specific interpretations of the facts.  As a former practitioner of Knowledge Management, I have to say that not only facts/data, but also information (organized data including statistics) are not knowledge.  Knowledge includes both information (content) and appropriate context.  This is, perhaps, why in some mysteries the detective (s) seek to find out all they can about the victim and the suspects.  I think we would improve our judicial system if potential jurors were required to read mystery novels such as this one.  It's a bit chilling IMHO.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W13OYQ7BYS3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0486296873#wasThisHelpful","R3W13OYQ7BYS3D","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is an A song to me. I heard it once and downloaded it. I do MP3 songs, not generally albums. I heard it sung on an awards show and bought it at my next opportunity.  I've played it quite a few times since then.  It's different from other songs by either artist but does them both proud IMHO.  If you watch The Voice on TV you'll notice that they are both judges on the show--possibly how they met and then chose to collaborate on this song.

"This is a set of 12 articles (some given as lectures) by C. G. Jung's major disciple M-LvF from 1960 to 1992 and, apparently, a sequel to her ""Number & Time.""  It's much tougher going than some of her later works--e.g. ""Psychotherapy"" or ""Creation Myths.""  The main thrust of the book is her erudite (e.g. regarding quantum physics and world mythology) attempt to relate/integrate Jung's synchronicity to Matter, Time, Jungian Archetypes, etc. as reflected in her very extensive chapter endnotes.  The articles are not in chronological order which would have been: 6-12-2-1-5-3-4-8-11-9-10-7 (dates are provided for each article) which would have been better IMHO (so as to experience the development of her ideas over time), and the editors did not attempt to relate anything in the articles & ignore the tremendous redundancy amongst them.  Major themes include--time vs. space, numbers & archetypes, synchronicity & myth/divination, psychology & physics, order vs. meaning, conscious & unconscious, data & information vs. knowledge & meaning (~modern Knowledge Management).  Her arguments have tremendous breadth as well as depth, some of her conclusions may be astounding for many readers, though a few seem a bit of a stretch for me, & her references to physics greatly support Synchronicity.There are a couple of pages of quotes for my collection, including: [brackets are my comments]p. 29: A hypothesis according to which synchronistic events, being sporadic ""miracles,"" were only a special case of the more general principle of acausal orderedness.p. 72: As Jung pointed out, this is the telling question of our life: whether we are related to something infinite or not.  'Only if we know that what truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interest on futilities.  In the final analysis we count for something only because of the essential we embody, and if we do not embody that life is wasted.'p. 121: Every schematic model clarifies but also blurs in some ways the facts which one tries to describe by it. [analogies aren't identities so they have errors]pp. 129-30: Synchronistic events are not only irregular but even seemingly arbitrary.  For this reason they were in our Christian past called 'miracles' which were performed by either God or the Devil.p. 139: [quoting Jung] 'The brain might be a transformer station, in which relatively infinite tension or intensity of the psyche proper is transformed into perceptible frequencies of 'extension.'pp. 204-5: We know today through the results of modern nuclear physics that strict causality is only an interpretive mode of our intellect, that in nature there are only probabilities...therefore, logically accidents or chance occurrences must also exist.p. 213: Sir James Jeans writes...'Radioactive break-up appeared to be an effect without a cause, and suggested that the ultimate laws of nature were not even causal.' Jung chose for this...the term acausal orderedness.  This is not the same as 'meaning'...'without the reflecting consciousness of man the world is a gigantic meaningless machine for in our experience, man is the only creature who is capable of ascertaining any meaning at all.'p. 304: In physics causality has become only a relatively valid principle and we now only look for 'statistical laws with primary probabilities' as [physicist Wolfgang] Pauli puts it.My favorite two anecdotes regard a patient's dream of a green suit with a black back--when the wearer walks into a black wall he appears to disappear though he's still there--pp. 73 & 138: ""In dying we may only step outside the 'event horizon' [~black or dark star] of the living, but still exist in an unobservable state;"" & 2nd, the much quoted experience of Richard Wilhelm who asked a Chinese rainmaker: p. 161:  ""how he made the rain.  But he answered, 'I haven't made the rain, of course not.'  And then, after a pause, he added, 'You see it was like this--throughout the drought the whole of nature and all the men and women here were deeply disturbed.  It was so bad that it took me three days to bring myself again into order.' And then he added with a smile, 'Then naturally it rained.'""","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSQPRQA8J0B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570626200#wasThisHelpful","ROSQPRQA8J0B1","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the only Crispin I've read so far.  Since there have been many prior reviews, I won't reiterate the plot or most of the comments which have been pretty accurate IMHO.  I think the book was pretty good, but not, as the NY Times Book Review (quoted on the cover) ""Immensely witty and literate"" though it does have some humor even today.  On the upside, it's clever and some of the characters (esp. Nigel and Helen) are quite likable, but the ""detective"" Fen not so much.  As with many ""impossible"" crimes, it's a bit far-fetched (comes with the territory, I think).  The reader is presented with almost all the clues.  On the downside, the author injects tons of Latin/French phrases as well as obscure English words which detract from the tale--though I suppose they contribute to an understanding of Fen a bit.  There are two quotes I liked:p. 148: ""Nigel, mindful of his vow of silence, projected a burst of telepathic applause in her direction.p. 200: If one wasn't a little adventurous sometime, the world would be intolerable.""I'll probably read the book of Crispin's that other folks have recommended.

"I didn't notice that the ingredients list included Sucralose as the 5th ingredient listed out of 9.  I tasted a bag and it was IMHO sickeningly sweet.  I could hardly taste the salt.  Looking up Sucralose on Wikipedia, I found out it has several commercial names including Splenda.  It's 320 to 1000 times as sweet as table sugar.  So they can list it low on the ingredients' list and it's still overpowering IMO.  Yes, it has few calories and pops pretty well (though I had a fair amount of unpopped kernals).

"GENERAL COMMENTS ON SERIESDutch diplomat and sinologist Robert Hans van Gulik (1910-67) apparently wrote 16 fiction & published 1 translation of the exploits of historical Judge Dee (630-700 AD).  He includes a short ""Postcript"" @ the end of most--worth reading 1st--esp. if it's your 1st one--woodcut type drawings/maps which greatly enhance the volumes and, in most novels, a ""Dramatis Personae"" list--especially valuable since it's divided up by case (most have 3 cases/book).  The Postscript to ""The Chinese Nail Murders"" describes the author's approach to them--mostly based on old Chinese documents & their conventions towards magistrates--though he modernizes them somewhat.  ""Judge Dee at Work"" includes a valuable chronology with dates.  Usually a Magistrate spent ~3 years in a district & was then transferred: Peng-Lai=663-6 AD, Han-Yuan=666-668, Poo-Yang=668-670,  Lan-Fang=670-676, Pei-Chow=676-677, and (after promotion) to the Capital=677-700).THE SERIES INCLUDES:18 Judge Dee books (in alphabetical order with date): Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee (the one translation), The Chinese Bell Murders=668 AD, The Chinese Gold Murders=663, The Chinese Lake Murders=666, The Chinese Maze Murders=670, The Chinese Nail Murders=676, The Emperor's Pearl=668, The Haunted Monastery=666, Judge Dee at Work=663-70, The Lacquer Screen=663, The Monkey & the Tiger=666 & 676, Murder in Canton=681, Murder in Ancient China, Necklace & Calabash, The Phantom of the Temple, Poets & Murder, The Red Pavilion=668, and The Willow Pattern=677.  Of the 18 books one is redundant, one is a translation, and the other 16 are fictional works by van Gulik.  Interestingly, the 1st fiction books (The Chinese ____ Murders) were written in the order: Bell, Maze, Lake, Nail and Gold, but chronologically (in the fictional world) are ordered: Gold, Lake, Bell, Maze, & Nail.  The short stories are chronologically interspersed with the novels.THIS INDIVIDUAL VOLUME: (Others reviewers have already described the plot)It's the 16th I've read so far.  Like some modern detective novels, the obvious solution is not usually correct and with this one there's an abundance of both suspects and hypotheses as to the culprit.  Indeed, some early conclusions are quite incorrect and misleading such that, unlike the other seriesworks, Dee resorts to a Nero Wolfe type of bluff-confrontation with the suspects, catching the culprit in a trap set by a turtle--so, ""slow and steady"" won the race.  Indeed the favored dragon boat didn't win the race in this novel.  As in other Dee novels, the mysteries tie into past crimes--especially missing Imperial items (in this case a pearl, in another bars of gold, etc.).  Dee stays within his own district (unlike several other novels) but without his 2 burly lieutenants who are outside the district.  His sergeant has a larger part herein.  As usual the several separate (according to the Dramatis Personae, are all interrelated.  On the other hand, he again employs the King of the Beggars and the wonderful Mongolian Violet Liang who adds humor and spice to this book--it's a shame she didn't have a bigger part IMHO.  It's interesting to me that while Dee is a very conservative Confucian and looks down on both Taoism and Buddhism, in this book he seems more accepting of the supernatural and magical realism.  Having read 15 of his books prior to this one, I was a bit disappointed at the obvious repetition of themes in this one.  Antithetically, I didn't get any quotes for my collection from it.  Overall, I liked most of his other works a bit better than this one, but it's still worth reading.TYPE OF MYSTERY:Dee stories are more straight mystery vs. action/adventure/thriller, though some action does take place--including personal danger.  If you enjoy Golden Age Mysteries (e.g. Sayers, Christie, Marsh, Allingham, Tey), you'll probably enjoy the Dee books--I'll read all.  They usually have less social commentary, flowery description, political intrigue, & physical action than contemporary ""mysteries"" but do provide insightful cultural descriptions/incidents--perhaps why I like them better--though they're not always historically accurate--per van Gulik's Postscripts.  Unlike the West, most describe the punishment of the criminals.OTHER ORIENTAL MYSTERIES:If you are particularly interested in Oriental mysteries, you might try Ingrid J. (I.J.) Parker's ~11th century Japan Sugawara Akitada mysteries, Laura Joh Rowland's ~18th c.

Like some modern detective novels, the obvious solution is not usually correct and with Dee there's a partial solution that misleads you 'til the non-obvious complete solution at the end.  There are also mysteries within mysteries and as here, tie into past crimes.  As opposed to others, Dee is within his own district.  While this one includes only 2 of his 4 assistants, it also includes some scenes with his wives--demonstrating his domesticity and more on life in ancient China.  While it does include the Dramatis Personae, this volume is unusual in that it has no separation of the 3 mysteries--though they are all actually interrelated--but then that's not unusual in a Dee book.  There are also many parallels with other books in this series--but differences emerge as the book progresses.  As usual, Dee is a very conservative Confucian and looks down on both Taoism and Buddhism--but this book goes a bit further in criticizing Tantric Buddhism vs. Fundamental Buddhism.  His attack is mainly aimed at the sexual aspects, ignoring the main differences offered by Vajrayana (mostly Tibetan) Buddhism.  It's unclear whether van Gulik is actually familiar with the various types of Buddhism.  Overall, I liked most of his other works a bit better than this one (though the solution is quite clever IMHO), but it's still well worth reading.A valuable quotation for my collection:p. 131: 'If we ever succeeded in reaching the utmost of what we are longing for,' the judge said drily, 'there would be a sense of surfeit.'TYPE OF MYSTERY:Dee stories are more straight mystery vs. action/adventure/thriller, though some action does take place--including personal danger.

"I like the James Melville Superintendent Otani books--I believe I've read them all.  I'm uncertain, but I think this might be the earliest one.  His later ones show Otani later in life and are more solid mysteries--where the reader can attempt to discern the guilty party (ies).  Still, this one is interesting too.  The setting is post-WWII Japan with Otani being the top police official in Kobe and the surrounding area--the 3rd largest (after Tokyo and Osaka) in Japan--so his title (compared to English mysteries) is a bit misleading--he's much higher in rank than it would appear.  The characters in this book are, IMHO, intriguing--from Japan, the US, Ireland, and Denmark.  It is also important to understand the relationship between the police and the criminal organizations in Japan at that time--more competitors than enemies in some ways.  The Yakusa are frequently in Otani books.  Also, there is, of course, a heavy emphasis on etiquette and formality as usual in Japan (from a Western perspective).  The police procedures are considerably different as well.  So, this is an opportunity to learn about another culture and time.  But, I wouldn't rate the series only on this book.  There isn't, however, a lot of insight into Zen or too much use of Zen terminology here--so don't worry if you are unfamiliar with it--just that zazen is a form of Zen meditation.  The characters are all too human--not at all zombies or automatons (stereotypes do not abound herein).  Overall, it's an enjoyable book.  I hope you like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6Y45YZO2HLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449208389#wasThisHelpful","R3I6Y45YZO2HLE","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike his earlier, more advanced books (Carefree Dignity: Discourses on Training in the Nature of Mind & Fearless Simplicity: The Dzogchen Way of Living Freely in a Complex World), Tsokni Rinpoche (the son of Tulku Urgyen and brother of Chokyi Nyima) covers many basic Vajrayana precepts such as the paramitas (perfections), bodhicitta, tonglen, etc. but in a very down to earth & easy to understand way using a great many personal anecdotes about his own training and experiences as a teacher.  This book is simply & effectively written.  The author embeds a number of Western psychological parallels (e.g. patterns of behavior, complexes) and provides easily understood Buddhist practical practices towards opening one's heart and mind per his own teachers:p. 233: ""He [his teacher Khamtrul Rinpoche] built bridges of the heart.""Relates Buddhism to Western Psychology (esp. Jung whom he quotes):pp. 4-5: A shadow is projected by some source of light, and by recognizing and acknowledging our shadow selves we can begin to trace a path toward the light.p. 10: Real but not True [e.g. his fear crossing a glass sky bridge between buildings]p. 11: A mantra is basically a means of looking with your thoughts and feelings...an opening of a conversation between the heart and the mind.  You can begin by saying something like ""yes, I know that you're real."" Then ask ""are you true? Are you based on present conditions, or are you based on past experience?"" [info.=content=Real vs. knowledge, with context,=True]p. 60: Patterns emerge from social and cultural influence, as well as from personal experiences that, over time, become familiar.  And questioning the familiar is almost always uncomfortable.p. 60: narcissism...is based on low self-esteem and a reliance on gaining a sense of recognition or power through dominating others.p. 159: Speed Limits & news crawlers [activation/arousal theory w/characteristic point--a speed right for you]Wonderfully elucidates (correcting misconceptions) Vajrayana word meanings in a personal way with anecdotes:p. 44: The basic meaning of emptiness, in other words, is 'openness' or 'potential.'  At this basic level of our being, we are 'empty' of definable characteristics. [~the words of Pema Chodron]pp. 66-7: Often overlooked in the instructions of tonglen is that the most fruitful time to practice it is when we're feeling bad about ourselves--when we're consumed by anger, despair, jealousy, or some other negative feeling: we take these feelings and our desire to get past them, as a starting point...Bring your attention to the person or persons who have brought about a painful situation...Breathe in the darkness and pain that may have caused that person to act that way ...Breathe out brightness--the essence of your own spark--and imagine it filling that person with confidence, light, a connection to essence love...Tonglen is not about forgiving or forgetting.p. 108: The idea of extinguishing 'ego' or 'self' or 'I' is inaccurate.

We just need to brush away the residue we pick up along the way.pp. 207-8: Practicing compassion...involves doing things that you don't really want to do... Compassion is not just a feeling; it's an action...a willingness to endure hardship on the behalf of others, which is the basis of relative bodhicitta: Do what needs to be done, even if you don't want to, even if it causes you hardship or pain.His Teaching Methods:p. 56: I need to understand the background, the culture, the habitual pattern, the environment that shapes the lives of the people I teach. & p. 231: I shift my teachings to suit the people sitting in front of me.Personal revelations through anecdotes demonstrating his sincerity and humility:p. 182: I started 'borrowing' books about meditation from the monastery library, which were not part of the tulku curriculum at that point. [a  parallel student?]pp. 205-6: [leaf from Bodhi Tree incident on how he dealt with selfishness vs. bodhicitta]More advanced practices:pp. 186-7: clouds and gaps in thought [while I've done the Dzogchen Sky Exercise, it occurred to me from reading Rinpoche's description that the space and the sky were like those bistable optical illusions such as the 2 faces vs. the vase in the middle where one is black and the other is white.  It also occurred to me that you could do it at night with the stars since stars blink, unlike planets]So, this is a solid introductory or refresher book but also provides considerable exposition on difficult ideas that are, perhaps, not completely understood from other books.  The style is lovely and you can easily tell that his heart is in the right place.Note: words in [brackets] are mine.  As an introductory book it rates 5 stars, but I found his earlier works more enlightening--I wish I didn't have to assign a grade via a highly limiting 5 point system.  Even movies have 1/2 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTI9DCQM21TN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307888207#wasThisHelpful","RFTI9DCQM21TN","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In such cases he generally doesn't have his entire coterie of 4 assistants, but only one or two.  In this book, he's only accompanied by Ma Joong (reminds me of Mah Jong which my Mom used to play) who amazingly demonstrates his gold interior as a foil to his rough and ready exterior.  Both men get involved (in startlingly different ways) with the courtesans of Paradise Island--ancient China's predecessor to Las Vegas.

"It's easy to trace Margery Allingham's development as a mystery writer.  First she published an adventure about smugglers in ""Blackkerchief Dick,"" then her first (serialized) murder mystery, ""The White Cottage Mystery,"" then her first murder mystery with Albert Campion (not the center of the stage though) in ""The Crime at Black Dudley"" (aka ""The Black Dudley Murder""), and then a series of 18 more mystery novels starring Campion (the last, ""A Cargo of Eagles"" which, interestingly, includes smugglers completed by her husband Phillip Youngman Carter).  Along the way, she also published several (very enjoyable IMHO) short story collections (e.g. ""Mr. Campion and Others"").This is a nice armchair or cozy British mystery with little action but lots of thinking and hypotheses.  It reads easily and quickly though it does drag somewhat after the middle--when the characters relocate to the French Riviera.  The reader can figure out the killer, but only after reading the bulk of the book.  Of course, as a novella, it lacks space for a larger character development, and as a between-the-wars novel, it includes far different attitudes (especially towards women) than are observed in the West today.  This demonstrates, IMHO, how western civilization has progressed since then.Its also includes some psychological reasoning as well as a fine quotation for my collection:p. 155: ""A child only knows what it is told.  The difference between God and the Devil is only clear to it because it has been told that God is good and Satan is bad.""  It's unfortunate, IMHO--as opposed to the characters in this book--that most folks don't revisit childish views and opinions and understandings once reaching adulthood.  If they did, there might be far more tolerance in the world.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLN7YE8K5MASL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1448213738#wasThisHelpful","RLN7YE8K5MASL","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After Margery Allingham's demise, her husband Youngman Carter, who did at least to some degree collaborate on her books, completed her last, unfinished novel, Campion #19 and then wrote 2 Campion books on his own.  The first was entitled ""Mr. Campion's Farthing.""  The present volume is his 2nd (and apparently final) work.  It's a good, complex story.  While there is a murder to solve, the main mystery seems to be what Mr. Porteus is looking for.  Unfortunately, it seems impossible for the reader to unravel this on his/her own, making the book something of an adventure rather than a mystery--though it's written in a mystery style.  Call it what you will.  I don't think the style is the same as in Margery Allingham's works, but it's a reasonable replica thereof.  There are differences: e.g. Campion drives a Jaguar in this book.  There are similarities too: Miss Peregrine is a feisty (and IMHO an engaging) lady and Makepeace a humorous, eccentric character.  For Campion aficionados, however, there's no Lugg, Oates, Luke, or (my personal favorite) Amanda Fitton--except for a phone call.  Still, it's an enjoyable book unless, perhaps, you're a purist.  Enjoy!  p.s. unlike the vast majority of Allingham's works, I didn't get any quotes for my collection from this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DAPAI45YUV2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0881847240#wasThisHelpful","R2DAPAI45YUV2R","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Renowned orientalist and former Netherlands Ambassador to Japan Robert van Gulik has now published quite a few Judge Dee novels.  Judge Dee was an historical person who lived from 630-700 AD and served as a magistrate (as in these novels) and later in the central government of the Tang Dynasty in China.  Van Gulik includes further information in his Postscript which I recommend reading first -- especially if this is your 1st Judge Dee book.  It was my 3rd and I like them more and more.  Strangely, there is no obvious copyright date--though the Postscript is dated 30 December 1961.These novels take place earlier than Ingrid J. Parker's Sugawara Akitada series which takes place in perhaps 11th century Japan but they are similar to them to a certain extent--relying more on logic and atmosphere than on a lot of action--thus, they are, IMHO, true mysteries--something like Doyle's Sherlock Holmes or Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe as opposed to Laura Joh Rowland's Sano Ichiro series (around 1700 AD in Japan) which is more action-adventure incorporating some mystery.  Also, van Gulik's works explain the ancient Chinese judicial methods -- rather different than our modern ones.  I find these works, especially this one, to be quite satisfying and enjoyable, and look forward to reading many more.Despite the differences in culture, there are similarities to modernity: logic is, after all, logic.  There's a bit of scientific thinking in this book, e.g. p. 21: ""Once he had established his theory, he adapted every new fact to it, instead of testing whether these new facts should not make him revise his theory.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7T8VS2Y7IVD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0226848671#wasThisHelpful","R3K7T8VS2Y7IVD","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Margery Allingham wrote this, her first novel, at an early age--but she came from a very literary family.  It was written before she tried her hand at mystery novels.  I believe both this and the following The White Cottage Mystery (her next effort which was a mystery) have been unavailable until recently, but Bloomsbury has issued both.  I am about to start the latter (which BTW is pre-Campion).  So, her writing progressed from novel to mystery to Campion mysteries (for which she is famous as a member of the British Golden Age of Mystery.""Blackkerchief Dick"" gets its name from the main character (who is quite a character) who wears a black kerchief over his hair.  Compared to the other characters he's quite a dandy.  The novel, while set on an island frequented by smugglers is mostly about a love triangle--Blackkerchief Dick, his rival Hal, and Anny (the latter two work at The Ship).  It includes a host of characters ranging from very nice to very selfish.I found it a relatively slow read and seemingly somewhat predictable--until the end.  Similar to a mystery novel, there's a twist or two there which I certainly didn't expect.  The light and dark are juxtaposed with fate--including a situation reminiscent of ""Hamlet"" for Hal.  ""The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune..."" apply here.  This fairy tale is more Grimm's than Hans Christian Anderson's.  A quote from the book is also an appropriate addition to my quotes collection: p. 214: ""The Lord gave women tears that their hearts might not break every day.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNK5C2SFRVP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1448207029#wasThisHelpful","R3UNK5C2SFRVP2","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While it's not the fastest moving mystery, I found this book engaging and very enjoyable.  The characters, while something of a parody perhaps, were IHO quite interesting, especially Great Aunt Caroline--see page 14 for a genealogical table of the residents of Socrates Close (the home of most of the characters).  There's also a chart of the rooms of this house and grounds on page 138.  I thought the mystery was clever and the writing very good, if not as beautiful as Ngaio Marsh's.  But, I think its individual claim to fame lies in its psychological commentary or analysis of human faults:p. 73: ""If a man is not worthy of responsibilities at 30 there is very little likelihood of his ever attaining to that station.p. 106: Beneath the rigid bond of repression, human nature had begun to ferment, decay,  to become vile.pp. 198-9: Every man, however, unworthy, can engender an undying spark of affection in the heart of some unlikely woman.p. 282: He was so mentally short-sighted that he was not capable of foreseeing the most ordinary consequences of his actions other than the immediate effect of which he was aiming.  I think his insanity lay largely in the possession of this particular blind spot.p. 289: There is a primitive strain in us all, which makes us a little afraid of the clothes of the dead.""This is IMHO most profoundly obvious in the p. 282 quotation above which, despite the author's seeming intention to apply it only to one of the characters, seems to my mind to apply, in varying degree, to many of us.  I think Jung would say it's an extremely ""sensate"" personality which exemplified this (per his ""Psychological Types"" or The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator).  It points to a lack of vision, associative power, or perhaps the ability to step outside oneself and see what is, without regard to one's own existence.  In any case, I enjoyed Caroline and the book very much--especially as compared with many mysteries being published today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OYJG8SJ2EUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933397640#wasThisHelpful","R25OYJG8SJ2EUK","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a can of Yellow fin tuna packed in olive oil  Yellow fin tastes differently than either blue fin or the albacore (which is what you get in the usual can of tuna from the supermarket.  I've been in aquariums which had profiles of various fish and was amazed how different the 3 tunas actually look in profile.  Without a doubt, I like yellow fin the best.  The Bumble Bee is a high quality product though certainly some folks prefer other tunas and water vs. oil packed cans as well.  I prefer the oil packed because I use the tuna to stir fry--pouring in the oil first, then veggies, and finally the tuna.  Yum!  I would give this product 5 stars for quality, but I'm only giving it 4 because of the price.  I've been eating the Genova brand for quite some time--also Tonno Yellow fin packed in olive oil and about the same quality IMHO.

"The 23rd Alphabet Mystery is a bit slower paced than many of the others--and is longer as well--these two factors go together here.  Kinsey seems less assertive yet quite philosophical herein.  I wouldn't normally review a book that's been reviewed so many times, but I think something needs to be said about the wisdom of this particular work and its treatment of the homeless.  Firstly, Grafton is addressing the homeless as those who choose to be so, not someone who's just lost their home to foreclosure.  What she's stressing is that the chosen homeless have dignity and that our reaction to them has more to do with ourselves than with them--indeed, such reactions, objectively speaking, might appear a bit hypocritical to an outside observer.  Some of her great turns of phrase and pithy philosophical statements (especially regarding the homeless) include:p. 9: Sometimes the import of a minor moment makes all the difference.p. 15: A gloat-worthy turn of events.p. 16: Even for nomad, the urge toward ownership is apparently irresistible.  Regardless, of social status, we derive comfort from our stuff; the familiar ways and weft of our lives.p. 27: Being rule governed, I operate in a world filled with imagining restraints.p. 59: There's something inherent in human nature that has us constructing narratives to explain a world that is otherwise chaotic and opaque.  Life is little more than a series of overlapping stories about who we are, where we came from, and how we struggle to survive.  What we call news isn't new at all...It's folly to assign meaning to every chance event yet we do it all the time.p. 129: This was like winning the lottery without buying a ticket.p. 220: Watching her drink was like watching roses bloom by way of time-lapse photography.p. 226: Being righteous and opinionated reduces everything to black and white; much easier to deal with than all the shade in between.p. 286: Like many whose poor choices have led them astray, he accepted no responsibility as long as he had someone else to blame. [projection]p. 336: Kids are egocentric.  Parents exist for their convenience.p. 473: Do not argue with a lunatic.  Arguing with a lunatic simply ensures that you'll dive into his craziness with him when what you want to do is take a big step back.pp. 482-3: We seem determined to save the homeless, to fix them, to change them into something other than what they are.  We want them to be like us, but they are not.  The homeless do not want our pity nor do they deserve our scorn.  Our judgments about them, for good or for ill, negate their urge to live as they please.  Both the urge to rescue and the need to condemn fail to take into account the concept of their personal liberty, which they may exercise as they see fit as long as their actions fall within the law.  The homeless are not lesser mortals...Why are their choices so hard for us to accept?","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RA33MACBI84V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399158987#wasThisHelpful","R2RA33MACBI84V","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First rate mysteries without the murder--I found this refreshing.  While Amanda and Lugg are lacking in the stories, Superintendent Oates is the main supporting character.  The 13 stories are quite clever and IMHO satisfying, and many are humorous as well.  Campion is in fine form, as stated on page 237: 'You're too bright,' he said.  'You'll blind yourself one of these days.'  The most unusual feature, to my way of thinking, is the relationship between Campion and Oates--perhaps not as warm as some of the later Campion works.  BTW, this is not considered a numbered Campion book, but was published between #10, ""The Fashion in Shrouds"" and #11, ""Traitor's Purse"" -- two of her best IMHO.  Admittedly, if you prefer novels, you might not appreciate this book as much as I did, but I think things should be evaluated within their own context (in this case the short story).  Otherwise, very few books would rate 5 stars (or maybe even 4) vs. Shakespeare or Hemingway etc.For additional Campion short stories, Omnibus #1, The Mysterious Mr Campion, and Omnibus #2, Mr Campion's Lady each have 3 novels plus a Christmas story.  Also, The Allingham Minibus is a collection of Allingham's short stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WCSMJS1RJGOB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140007628#wasThisHelpful","R2WCSMJS1RJGOB","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was my first Martha Grimes book, and I have somewhat mixed feelings about it.On the down side:--it's rather slow moving, especially at first--it has lots of presumably British expressions or word usages that are quite unfamiliar (though I've read all of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Josephine Tey, Ngaio Marsh, P. D. James, and most of Margery Allingham).  ""Polishing the optics"" perhaps means the mirrors?  Closest I could find in my dictionary--seems a stretch to me..--there's quite a bit of snooker specifics especially in the final chapter where it's very detailed indeed.  I haven't a clue about that though.On neutral ground:--the mystery slowly unfolds, but the reader doesn't, IMHO, really have much of a chance to figure it out.  It is, however, rather clever especially if you have some understanding of the British peerage.On the up side:--I actually laughed out loud several times.  Grimes is quite humorous, especially with her dialogue. It's first rate, funnier than Robert B. Parker's (though his is more consistently crisp).--several quotes for my collection (page numbers from the edition given):from Martha Grimes Jerusalem Inn Onyx/New American Library NY 1984--p. 125: Was it a mere coincidence that whenever Agatha approached, one thought of shooting something?  Aunts or antelopes, it was all the same.p. 168: It's amazing, really, how much people think you must know if you know about something nobody else much cares about.p. 234: A dress designed to make its wearer look simple and countrified, as if she'd just come in from milking silver-plated cows.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OJQGPVHR686P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHHDMQ4#wasThisHelpful","R1OJQGPVHR686P","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He is the lead through most of the book and discovers lots of deceptions and creates several explanations.  Of course, Ellery comes in to finish up.

"I greatly enjoyed reading this book--it holds your interest even through the chases, but I think it is a bit hokey.  My two criticisms are:1. I think it borders on cheating to cover the killer's inconsistencies/irrationalities by saying he's insane (but not too insane to cleverly commit murders and stand trial).2. While minor errors by the murderer might very well lead to his/her capture, they're not necessarily sufficient to convince a jury of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  I think there's reasonable doubt here.  I'm certain a good defense attorney could come up with alternate explanations of the evidence despite Queen's statement that p. 231: ""the reader is in possession of all facts necessary to a correct solution of the crime or crimes.  The Egyptian Cross Mystery is no exception: by the exercise of strict logic and deductions from given date you should now be able, not merely to guess, but to prove the identity of the culprit.

"Helen Brann, Parker's literary agent completed a partially written manuscript that Robert B. Parker was composing before his death.  It apparently, needed an ending and editing as well.  How close to final copy it was, I don't know.  Obviously, it cannot be 100% authentic Parker, but she seems to have done a pretty good job.  The writing is close to Parker's other novels IMHO though, of course, readers can take exception to phraseology etc.  No doubt Parker's other works were edited and not merely published from his manuscripts.  The ending is rather abrupt, but some of Parker's other novels ended rather abruptly too--after all, in 70+ novels there was quite a bit of variation.  Indeed, relative to his later style, this book is closer than his early style was--just consider the nature of Spenser and his dialogue.  Of course, purists will object to every variation in jot and tittle, fine for them.  But many will enjoy this book even if it's not 100% Parker.  It would be interesting to know on what chapter the original manuscript ended.  I believe that even die-hard fans will vary in guessing the answer.There is, however, one very great variance from Parker's prior works, a big humanistic change to Hawk towards the end.  Some people will love it as a character development and others may hate it as a variance from pure Parker.  I have no idea if he wrote it or Brann did.  I suspect the latter.  Also, it's rather short--but then several of Parker's earlier works were short as well.  Writers tend to write longer books as time goes on--especially when they become successful.  I've also read the two extant Ace Atkins Spenser books.  The first one, Robert B. Parker's Lullaby (Spenser), was a far cry from Spenserian dialogue--I found that disappointing.This book is far closer to Parker.  However, Atkins' 2nd work, Robert B. Parker's Wonderland (Spenser), was much closer to Parker's Spenser IMHO.  I haven't read the post-Parker Chief Stone or Cole/Hitch books, so am unable to comment on them.  Hopefully, readers find them enjoyable.  Interestingly, Parker himself obviously approved of completing another writer's manuscript since he did so himself with Poodle Springs in which he completed a Raymond Chandler Philip Marlowe work.  Also, he wrote an original Philip Marlowe novel after Chandler's death--Perchance to Dream, a sequel to Chandler's The Big Sleep (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard).  Basically, it's up to you to decide if you want to stick with pure Parker or to seek solace in this book and other authors' continuations of Parker characters.  But, if you don't choose to read them, I wish you luck in finding something as good or better!I did get one quotation for my collection from this book: p. 108: ""You know how easy it is to throw everything away when you never had anything to begin with?""","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CK99EQ7RXR2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399157883#wasThisHelpful","R1CK99EQ7RXR2V","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been drinking various brands of Earl Grey tea for decades, in the States, in England, etc.  It usually taste pretty much the same except for the strength and quality.  I drink tea (except for iced tea) straight up--no sweetener, no milk, no lemon, or anything else in it.  I also like Darjeeling, Green, and Jasmine teas.  I have, of course, had Lipton teas--even in hotel rooms--Lipton Yellow Label Tea Bags 100ct which is the best general type I've had IMHO.  Very nice.  I've also had teas in pyramid bags before (theoretically they should have more surface area and thus more flavor but they don't taste any different).But, I have to say that the product in hand is the strangest Earl Grey I've ever had.  The contents are: ""orange pekoe and pekoe cut black tea, marigold flowers, natural flavors.""  Yet on the front of the box it says: ""black tea made with premium long-leaf Earl Grey with bergamot flavor with other natural flavor.""  So bergamot (the substance that makes Earl Grey unique) is advertised but not listed on the ingredients list--is it an ""other natural flavor?""  Obviously, they use more marigold flowers than bergamot, if they use bergamot at all.  Or, maybe they have a small amount but the marigold changes the flavor?On the bright side, it doesn't taste bad--just strange and not like other Earl Grey teas.  I do like their mentioning that it contains 25mg of caffeine per serving and 115mg of flavenoids (compared to 58 in orange juice, 11 in pomegranate juice, and .4 in coffee).  Wow, I didn't know coffee had any in it.  Yay coffee!  As for Earl Grey, I'll stick with my Amazon Twinings Earl Grey Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)--a fine tea at a great price and it is made with ""black tea with bergamot flavor.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AI8OMRU7G1PA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DUQDIJG#wasThisHelpful","R2AI8OMRU7G1PA","A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HQ8RTAJYEUJO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically, it's a can of nice quality albacore tuna with some pieces of jalapeno pepper in it.  I wasn't surprised that the heat was not overwhelming.  It does taste very good--I ate it straight from the can as a snack--didn't really need to drink much liquid with it.  The oil seems good as well.  It seems a bit pricey though.  You can easily buy canned tuna and a jar of jalapeno peppers... Still it was an enjoyable experience for me and, IMHO, an interesting idea.  But, I mostly stir fry using canned tuna or salmon and add my own jalapeno (and other peppers) and lots of veggies--so it won't help much for that.  But, as a snack it's quite nice.

"I wear make up pretty much daily, and I have always loved using liquid liner, but I can never find one that is both affordable and actually works well. This liner by XTAVA is perhaps one of my favorites I have ever used. I am not a pro at using liquid liner, but I find this one to be very smooth and it really goes on easily even for newbies.The color is a little dark for my complexion, but it really has to be because of the way liquid liner works. This goes very well with XTAVA mascara, which I happen to use in my daily routine and love.When applying this liner to your lid, you don't want to over correct too much. It will glide on easily and personally I think you should only use it for your top lid, and then use a pencil liner for your bottom lid. The ""brush"" is small and great for wings and angles and designs.

"This book is a humorous account of 13 love affairs, most of which ended badly. At least that is my interpretation. The author gives a historical run-up to the subjects in the stories, which does help to better understand what happened during the relationships and why they failed. Some of the stories I already knew about such as Lucrezia Borgia, Oscar Wilde and Nero, but there were a few nuggets that were worth learning about. Unrequited love must have worked for some of the subjects who went on to write or do great things. Some of the participants were just plain weird and one wonders how they were able to attract a lover at all. The book is a fast read, great for passing time while traveling or waiting somewhere.

"What a pleasure it has been to read this novel. I had never read a novel by Sandra Dallas before, but I will be avidly reading her others. This novel was so utterly satisfying that she is now one of my favourite authors and I've added her website to the links on the side of this blog: http://greathistoricalfiction.blogspot.com.Brilliantly researched, Sandra captures the essence of the times and the numerous hardships faced by women of all ages. The stories has roots in the historical past - she studied the plight of midwives who found themselves face to face with the law when a birth went awry. There is a strong tone of doing the right thing, no matter the injustices the main character faces. The protaganist is a woman called Gracy Brookens, a skilled and respected midwife. Clearly unselfish, caring, and dedicated to helping women, there is much to laud in this character. Courageous and determined, she faces adversity in a way that is startling stoic.The prose is lovely and flowing, and the descriptions perfect - enough to bring the scene to life without slowing the pace. Although on the surface, this novel looks like it might be purely historical or women's fiction, there is a mystery at its heart, a bonus to an already rich tale. I admire Sandra Dallas' talent and am eager to read more of her novels. Thorough enjoyable! 5 stars and more!Thank you to the author and publisher.

"I love this tote! I am thoroughly enjoying carrying this bag. It is made of a high quality synthetic leather of sturdy thickness that is nice and soft to the touch. Everything about the bag screams luxury, including the silky lined interior. to experience this luxury handbag. I chose the navy blue bag so that it will look dressy even when wearing my jeans. The exterior is easy to maintain - just a quick wipe and it will be clean!The inside is nicely lined in a thick silky polyester material. No flimsy fraying lining in this tote - that's for sure! There are two open pockets on one side made for sliding things into it like keys, or phone. Simply slide these items into the pockets and they will be easy to find. A full length zipper at the top safely closes to secure the contents. There is a nice sized zippered enclosure on the outside too - another place for keys or phone.The bag is a nice size, can hold plenty, and the straps are comfortable when hanging over your shoulder. Its sturdy construction ensures it will last for a long time.This is the second product I've received from Hynes. I also have the emoji backpack. Both products are greatly beloved and I'm extremely impressed with this company. I love all their bags. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBYKKR4D24UKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QV8A1GS#wasThisHelpful","RBYKKR4D24UKF","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A great Xmas present to purchase online on Amazon!I'm really enjoying my latest toy. It's the Inateck Marsbox Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Speaker. I've become a big fan of Inateck Products because this company delivers on high quality at an affordable price.This bluetooth speaker has a built in FM Radio and a built in microphone so when I am busy at my laptop or making a craft, I can dial my phone handsfree!What I love most is that it has a really long battery life, which allows me to move the speaker from bedroom to kitchen to garage easily without any trouble at all. This is great when I'm in the kitchen as I can listen to an audio book as I'm busy working.What my husband loves most about this speaker is that it is very, very loud and powerful. And I truly mean this. Incredible sound comes out of this compact little box. As with other Inateck products, it is very easy to pair with your devices. When it is in use, there's a lovely blue light that shows its operating. The speaker comes with a well laid out instruction manual that makes it easy for even those who are technology challenged to follow.Everything about this speaker screams quality. It is of a nice weight, not flimsy at all. In fact, it has a rubberized feel and is very stable wherever it is set down. The black/red color is stunning and it has large buttons that are easily visible with maxiumum accessiblity. The power cords that come with it are sturdy and covered in an enhanced material that protects the actual cord. They come beautifully wrapped and are red and black in color. The product comes with an aux cable, micro USB cable, a felt carry pouch and a user manual. The battery on this thing is rated for 10 hours minimum which is very good as wellI'm an avid Netflix watcher and one of my favourite luxuries is to sit in bed and watch a movie or a tv program on my tablet. Hence I keep the speaker on my bedside table and prefer the sound from the speaker than the sound that comes from my tablet. And as stated earlier, I also love listening to an audio book with the Marsbox.I have easily connected the Marsbox to my Samsung phone, my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab, and my iPad mini! When my phone rungs, I can answer the call and speak and listen through this speaker. I don't know how I ever lived without it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R328T160TCGYED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9PWVDW#wasThisHelpful","R328T160TCGYED","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Season 3 Namaste Yoga DVD continues witht the same levels of excellence as the earlier version.

The sessions are:Soften the EdgesAlign your AxisWarrior WisdomRelease and RestoreCreate your CalmReflect and ConnectThese sessions are each 22 minutes in length, providing enough workouts for the week to do something a little different each day. I do one session before bed each night. Like all Namaste DVDs, this particular one has stunning visuals, lush music that relaxes as well as entertains, awesome production quality, and is led by a leading yoga practioner. The movements flowed nicely from one pose to another, and each session was easily adapted to my own strength and level leaving me plenty of room to grow and become more adept at each pose.Namaste Yoga is perfect for all skill levels and well worth the time. Everything about these DVDs is classy, beautifully rendered, and expertly taught. These are the DVDs to get if you are interested in embarking on a yoga regine!

"There are countless benefits to yoga, and researchers hail its numerous, powerful benefits. I am a 56 year old novelist, so I spend long hours each day at my desk. I embarked on a yoga program to stretch and keep my muscles limber. Namaste Yoga is a world leader and innovator in yoga with a strong reputation in the field, so I felt that their videos were the best way to begin. And I am pleased to say that I was right!  Visually stunning, the Namaste Yoga DVD narrated by Kate Potter is wonderful for beginners like me. The video has 6 segments/poses: exalted warrior, sun moon, firebird, gate opening, dancing sun, and half moon. Each segment is 22 minutes long. The beauty of this yoga instructional dvd is that my body was challenged, and the more I practice, the better I get. There are no poses that caused me to lose my balance or over-worked my muscles. There is both a warm up and cool down phase. Along with my time in the gym on the treadmill and some weight training, this yoga dvd has been a wonderful addition to my work-outs. Kate Potter's soothing voice, gentle style, set against beautiful backgrounds and relaxing music, makes practicing yoga a wonderful gift to myself. I look forward to the end of the day, as I do the program right before bedtime. Not only am I relaxed, but I feel calmed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I7OY72GIER46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JEJQ20#wasThisHelpful","R2I7OY72GIER46","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Antoinette May has re-envisioned Mary's life in a most comprehensive and compelling way. She brings to life the famous poets who were integral to Mary's life, namely Percy Bysshe Shelly and Lord Byron. In doing so, she shows us the darker side of these famous men, their human failings as well as their genius talents. The writing of Frankenstein is not foremost in the novel. Rather, the reader discovers the elements of Mary's life that gave rise to novel and the monster's creation.What I enjoyed about this novel is that the characters were presented without prejudice, leaving the reader to decide whether they liked them or not, including Mary. Secret affairs, obsession, friendship, and debauchery line this novels pages, demonstrating their effects upon the main characters. Congratulations to the author for writing such an indepth biographical fiction novel about this fascinating woman's life.

"Shriver has to be the most uniquely fascinating book I have ever read. It is vastly different, unclassifiable, and intensely entertaining. The back cover blurb aptly describes what the book is about, but it does little to express just how charming this little book truly is. Its pages are filled with quirky characters, outlandish situations, a protaganist who is a loser in real life, but who readers ultimately fall in love with. The books beauty is in its simplicity - easy to read, brief, witty. I definitely recommend this great little book, especially for readers who want something unique, whimsical, enchanting!

"The Visitant by Megan Chance is a delightful gothic tale set in Venice. Elena Spira travels from the U.S. to Basilio Palazzo to work as a private nurse for an epileptic man named Samuel Ferber. The mood is set with the crumbling palazzo and its location in a less than desirable, neglected area of Venice ripe with crime and plagued with filth. Further, an old aunt and a female servant and their suspicious, untoward behavior adds curiosity and tension to the story as it progresses. Once there, Elena encounters an impoverished nobleman named Nero Basilio (whose family owns the decrepit palazzo). Seizures, ghost sightings, addiction, family secrets, and loyalties are revealed throughout. The ending was definitely an unexpected surprise. This was a truly enjoyable cozy gothic mystery.

"Whitney and her cousin own two restaurants that are failing. As she struggles to keep them afloat, her attention is drawn by an old hotel she has inherited and her elderly, ailing stepfather who lives there alone. Could the hotel be sold to prop up her restaurants and save them from failure? When she arrives, she discovers old letters that when pieced together, provide her with details of an old romance and a long buried secret.Whitney is the protaganist and there are two men who she becomes embroiled with - each with different intentions regarding the hotel. All the characters were well drawn, their personalities and motivations clear throughout the tale. I especially enjoyed the cantankerous stepfather, Clyde, who evolves with the story. He added loads of fun and frustration. The real root of the story, however, are the letters. They were well done, revealing bits and pieces of the historical mystery as the story unfolds. Brilliant! And like all good novels, there is a love connection too that was really well done and comes about slowly, realisticaly. My favourite part of this book is the surprise ending I didn't see coming.Yup, there is definitely lots to like with this book.

"Review by Mirella Patzer - http://www.historyandwomen.comThe exotic setting of old China has always fascinated me. This novel is set in the Qing Dynasty of the 1880's and opens with the execution of 7 year old Sai Jinhua's father. Her mother was a concubine who died in childbirth. Her father remarried, but he has been executed for political reasons. Unwanted, Jinhua's stepmother sells her to a brothel where she will live until she is old enough to begin work as a prostitute. The life there is very harsh and Sai Jinhau is subjected to having her feet bound. At twelve, Sai Jinhua loses her innocence and joins the other prostitues in their work. The novel follows her life and her rise when she is sold to Hong, a Chinese Diplomat who is beguiled by her resemblance to his first wife who committed suicide.  Together, they travel to Vienna where Jinhua is a novelty. There, she experiences freedom and knowledge and gains self-confidence. But Hong dislikes her newfound strength and empowermentis and more and more he keeps her locked away from society.Nicely researched, I thought the complexities of the Qing Dynasty were aptly described. The early life of this poor orphan who faced such horrendous circumstances was fascinating. I found the first half of the book unputdownable, and the pace slowed a bit thereafter, and I became a bit detached from the story. Some of the magic was lost, but the story still held my interest enough to get to the ending. A nice novel that swept me into a time and a world of long ago. A fascinating woman of history indeed!Thank you to the author and publisher.

"This is the opening book in an exciting new trilogy entitled the Abraxas Chronicles, and it is a true stunner. The opening sentences hooked me until the story's ultimate conclusion. All the elements I love are included: an old abbey, a gothic feel, a multi-layered romance, murder, and an exciting plot! The secrets of an ancient old cult thrust the lives of three young persons into peril and force their separation, affecting them each in diverse ways. It was all so very fascinating and intriguing.Beautifully written, brilliantly plotted, this is a must read, especially for fans of Ken Follett, or aficionados of books set in the medieval era. It is much more than a murder myster, much more than a saga, much more than a romance. It is rich in every way. Loved it! Will definitely read more from this author. You should read it too!

"In an exciting new trilogy, Author Elizabeth Chadwick brings to life Eleanor of Aquitaine. The first book, The Summer Queen, covers her life through the 2nd crusade to the annullment of her marriage to Louis VII, king of France.The Winter Crown is the second in this tremendously vivid and engaging trilogy.Being a woman in the 12th century was fraught with turbulence. Arranged marriages for political reasons, the duty of bearing sons, ever constant warfare, intrigues of courtly life, and dangers of childbirth. These were the everyday fears women faced, especially Eleanor of Aquitaine.One of the most powerful women of her time, she was the daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Poitou. Not only was she a woman of great beauty, but she inherited immense wealth, making her one of the most sought-after women of her time.When she was fifteen, she married Louis VII of France, a young price of her own age. When his father died, they were crowned King and Queen. They reined for fifteen years with Eleanor being the smarter one with a stronger, more vocal personality. During that time, Eleanor proved semi-fruitful. She provided her husband with two daughters, but no sons.Eleanor was not afraid of war. In fact, she convinced her husband to initiate a crusade into the Holy Land and rode proudly at the front of their army. Her failure to provide her husband was one reason their marriage failed. It was annulled and Eleanor's vast dowry lands in Aquitaine and Poitiers were lawfully returned to her. She was thirty years old, still beautiful, still wealthy, and highly desirable. She soon came to the attention of Henry Plantaganet, the grandson of England's King Henry I. He was twelve years younger than Eleanor when they married. Her lands brought power and greater wealth to England, even more than that of her ex-husband.Despite their stormy marriage, Eleanor provide herself a very good breeder, providing her husband with several sons, two of which would be destined to become English kings. All the while, she ruled her own lands and was a strong participant in English politics. Because of her love for the written word, she helped give light to Courtly Love.As the years passed, her marriage deteriorated. She became a great adversary to her husband and even encouraged and supported her sons in a revolt against him. All their best efforts failed and her husband captured and arrested her. He kept her in custody in strict, less comfortable conditions in a monastery at Fontevrault, Anjou. She spent what remained of her life there and died at the age of 82 in the year 1204.Elizabeth Chadwick continues this spellbinding tale of one of the most renowned queens of medieval times - Eleanor of Aquitaine. Her story has endured over the centuries, and has been immortalized in movies and books, but never before has there been a more indepth recreation of her life than this trilogy by this most beloved author. The Winter Crown picks up where The Summer Queen leaves us - Eleanor is newly married to the king of England. Full of conflict, Chadwick brings to life their tumultuous marriage clearly shows the strength and tenacity of this famous queen.Although it is not necessary to read the trilogy in order, I highly recommend you do so to get the full history of this fascinating queen. Readers areeagerly awaiting the third book, The Autumn Throne, which is currently in the writing stage - it will definitely be worth the wait!I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review through Netgalley!For the full review, including video and links, please visit http://www.historyandwomen.com/2015/10/she-wolf-and-queen-crusader-eleanor-of.html","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RL4XRHG3KXZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402296819#wasThisHelpful","R1RL4XRHG3KXZG","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Sisters of Versailles is a biographical fiction novel about the five Nesle sisters, four of which became the mistresses of King Louis XV. They are Louise, Pauline, Adelaide, Hortense, and Marie Anne. The novelist did an excellent job of recreating the grandeur of the 18th century French court of the ""Sun King"". She aptly describes the lush glittering palaces, luxurious gowns, the cruel and painful intrigues, and disturbing cramped living conditions some of the lesser members of the court endured. The novel is written in the first person point of view of the sisters, which clearly brought to life their personalities and differences. The characters each developed uniquely, brilliantly, and in sometimes unpredictable ways.As with all biographical novels, there are times when the pace slows a bit, but in this case, the interest in court life kept me reading with keeness. This is the introductory book of a planned trilogy about these fascinating sisters, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next two installments, which swill bring to life some of the king's more notorious mistresses.Thank you to the author and publisher.

"All the Stars in Heaven is a rich novel that sweeps the reader into the golden age of Hollywood. Numerous famous actors and actresses make an appearance in this tale. Young is a young actress who falls in love with Spencer Tracy. Among the famous personages is a young nun by the name of Alda who has her own tale to tell which is interwoven between the pages.The novel is on the longer side at approximately 450 pages, but well worth read. It is a well written tale with plenty of historical detail that is colored with the author's interpretation of Loretta Young's relationships. I could not help but fall in love with Clark Gable. Adriana writes him just as I imagined, a lovable, handsome rogue with plenty of humor and spirit, a womanizer, but one who is higly adorable. I fell in love with Clark Gable through and through. I was glad I read the book on my iPad Kindle app because I kept stopping to query photos of the people and places mentioned in the book. It helped cement the story in my mind while lending it a whole bunch of credence.There is a ton to like about this story. Never rushed, but vivid, I adored the story very much, even though I experienced a bit of sadness that Clark and Loretta were never meant to be. A very good novel to savor!

"Sara Donati's latest novel is set in the late 1800's in New York City. At the heart of the story are two women, Anna and Sophie Savard who are both doctors specializing in women's health. Along with their passion for their work and the women they help, they both struggle to survive in the male oriented occupation amd the social norms and prejudices of the time - namely, against contraception and abortion, no matter the reason.This is a long novel - about 700 pages or so. But don't let that distract you. Contained within every page are a barrage of historical details, accurate and relevant to the times. It is very much a novel about women's struggles and their fight to seize control of their own health. And although this character driven novel is not fast paced, it is nevertheless engrossing and a manual of learning for this very tumultuous time in history. Sara Donati includes numerous real, notorious characters of the time in addition to the well-crafted fictional ones. Her research into New York City before the turn of the century is definitely vivid, accurate, and compelling, as is her portrayal of doctors, nurses, and the health system of the time. All this makes this an important historical novel that not only entertains, but teaches us.The characters face plenty of hardships and there is the plight of three orphaned Italian children forcefully separated by authorities. The main characters show compassion in coming to their aid and searching for the lost children. And of course, there is a love story too, some midwifery, and the rise of some women out of slavery. Yes, there is a lot going on, which makes this novel truly rich and compelling. Truly, this is historical women's fiction at its best and I highly recommend it.Thank you to the author and publisher.

"The Gates of Rutherford is a family saga of the Cavendish family. It is the third book in the series following on the tales of and Rutherford Park (Book 1) and The Wild Dark Flowers (Book 2). I had no opportunity to read either of the earlier books, and although I wish I had read the series in the order they were meant to be read, I was still able to follow along despite the references to the earlier plots.Rutherford Park is a stately manor. The story takes us into the lives and loves of the Cavendish family, with all the rank and pomp of the nobility vs the working class just like the tv series Downtown Abbey. The story highlights the struggles of a noble family to adjust their lives in the face of the upheaval caused by World War I. It clearly depicts the erosion of societal ranks and the struggles the gentry faced as they tried to cling to what remained of their fading lifestyles. Elizabeth Cooke brings her characters to life with brilliance, aptly describing love, loss, and the horrors of war. A nice historical saga of a family torn between the future and the past.Thank you to the author and publisher.

"As a long time admirer of author Anita Davison, I was happy to read Murder on the Minneapolis, an historical cozy mystery. Flora Maguire is a young governess charged with escorting her employer's young son, Edwqard, back home to England via the oceanliner, The Minneapolis. It is the ship's maiden voyage and most of the passengers are wealthy, except for Flora. Once on board, she meets Bunny Harrington, a well-to-do young businessman who deals with automobiles. When Flora discovers the body of a man at the foot of the companionway, she is embroiled in the mystery and is determined to find out what happened.This story had a bit of everything - atmosphere, mystery, romance, and suspense. I was kept guessing until the end as to the murderer and their motivation. Set on an oceanliner afloat in the international waters between North America and England, I found the story unique and intriguing. There were plenty of fascinating charaters that kept me interested throughout - a matronly ascerbic socialite, a steely doctor, and a headstrong captain, to name a few. All scenes were vividly described. The succinct writing made for a fast pace with plenty of conflict and mystery. From start to finish, I was thoroughly absorbed in the story. This is definitely a 5 star cozy mystery! Highly recommended. Thank you to the author and publisher.

All these subplots are slowly weaved together to create a wonderfully creative gothic style mystery that kept me madly turning the pages.I've never read any books by this author, but I will in the future because she has hooked me with this one. She is an adept author who knows how to keep conflict and mystery building from beginning to end. Her descriptions of characters and surroundings are vivid and easily envisioned while reading. I especially loved the complex characters because they are never what they initially appear to be. If you love great villains, one you truly become emotionally involved with, then this book will surely satisfy. This is a wonderful mystery and you don't need to read the earlier books in the series to enjoy it. Highly recommended.Thank you to the author and publisher.

"The Dress Thief sweeps readers into the heart of Paris during the rise of the fashion industry - from the fashion designers to the manufacturing to the runway. From the very beginning, one cannot feel anything but sympathy for the plight of Alix who lives in poverty with her ailing grandmother, Meme, but who possesses powerful dreams to one day become a fashion designer. She is befriended by a young man named Paul, also poor who cares for his younger sisters. It is Paul who entices her into becoming a thief - whose contacts get her a job at a leading fashion house where she is to copy the designs prior to their launch for reproduction in the United States.Alix has a secret benefactor, a wealthy Count, who has taken care of her through the years and who has an unclear connection to her Meme and her dead mother. It is this connection which causes him to be the victim of a blackmail plot in which Alix finds herself involved. Lives are at risk until the blackmailer can be identified and stopped. With several antagonists and suspicious characters, there are plenty of surprises and twists throughout. I found myself becoming emotionally involved with strong impressions regarding each character.Natalie Meg Evans has a strong understanding of the fashion industry of the era and this comes through in her sharp writing. This is a very long book at approximately 592 pages. Although the plot slows a little in the middle, there is plenty of story to keep the reader interested. It is not a story to be rushed - rather, it is one to be savoured for its wonderfully rich descriptions and details. It is no wonder this is an award winning book!Thank you to the author and publisher.

"I have been using this belt for over a week and I'm definitely enjoying it. I take it with me to the gym and wear it during my 30 minute weight work out and then for an hour on the treadmill. It easily holds my Samsung Note 4 (which is one of the biggest phones on the market) along with my keys and note cards where I keep track of my work-out. I like the belt much better than the arm cuffs for the same purpose because it can hold my keys too and does not restrict my movements when it is around my waist. There are numerous pockets and slots that can fit credit cards, documents. so it makes it ideal to use as a money/passport belt for travelers. The product description is exact and it is identical to what is advertised. It does not cause any sweating and does not stick to my skin while working out. I wear it over my tee-shirt, but can easily be worn under clothing depending on the wearer's preference. I can throw it in the washing machine, or hand wash it in the kitchen sink if I'm in a hurry. It dries fast. I also found that it gives my back a little support when I'm working out which I definitely like. It fits to size, but can easily be adjusted.Product received in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT4QT0BKME4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ZZSPKO#wasThisHelpful","RT4QT0BKME4S","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When it comes to stories set during World War II, I am always more interested in those that focus on the plight of the civilians rather than the military experience. This is why I was drawn to this novel as it reflects some of what my own family experienced before my parents immigrated to Canada. The story is set in the north east area of Italy in a city named Fiume which became part of Yugoslavia, or today's Croatia. Through the experiences of two families, the author does a great job of introducing the hardships the civilians faced living under the auspices of danger and war and occupation. The loss of home, displaced refugees, unbearable acts of terror and cruelty, and the severe hunger caused by enemy seizures. It is how many Italians of that era found themselves contemplating relocation as refugees to safer havens such as Australia, Canada, or the U.S. In this novel, it is Australia they seek.Through the eyes of the protagonists, Ettore and Contessa, we experience the danger, the many kindnesses, the poignanat and painful moments of war. These characters represent thousands of Italians forced to flee their beloved homeland.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the effects of the war, along with the history of how that area of Italy was affected.This novel is definitely a worth reading, especially for those whose roots are deeply embedded in Italy, like me!

"As I began reading this novel, it became immediately apparent why this has been a #1 Bestseller on Amazon. Based on a true story, author James D. Shipman has brought to life an utterly compelling protaganist by the name of Joseph Forsyth. The plight of this character from his childhood throughout the novel is at times heart-wrenching, victorious, and amazingly impressive, a very true and believable hero.The characters in the story are so real, so believable, I could not help but become totally engrossed in many conflicts and trials they faced during the Civil War era. More importantly, the author has introduced the plight of the Irish immigrant who fled extreme poverty only to find themselves face to face with prejudice and new hardships.More importantly, this is a story about a man of honor and great character, one who earned his respect and teaches us all what it means to truly be of high moral standard, perseverence, tolerance, and many more lessons.

"I have lots of devices - my Samsung Note 4, an iPad mini, a Samsung Galaxy tablet, a kindle, an iPod. And when the grand-kids stay over, I can add their iPads and mp3 players to the list. So I need lots of chargers. This power bank has 3 ports and a super fast charging depending on the size of the device - i.e. the smaller the device, the faster the charge. It has Auto IC which intuitively identifies the device and knows the speed it requires to charge. It is the size of a normal eyeglasses case, but a little heavier as it is made of sturdy plastic/metal. It fits easily into my purse and I take it with me whenever I travel. To charge it, you will need to plug it into a USB wall charger or your computer. Once charged, there is an on/off button on the side which illuminates 4 blue LED lights on the front, which also tells you how much charge the device has - 4 for fully charged and 1 for running out of charge. I really like the built-in torchlight. To activate it, all I have to do is press the on/off button two times in quick succession. It's really great to be able to depend on a device for a quick charge!

"I love a book that has many plot twists! And there are many in this novel! Each character kept evolving, and this kept me guessing as to what would happen next. A mother's lie, a father's denial, and the quest for revenge combined to make it a difficult story to put down. The novel is set in the early 20's, shortly after the First World War, a time of great upheaval and societal changes. The theme of abandonment by Rachel's father was rather poignant, as was the anger experienced that set her off on a course of revenge. Despite the need for vengeance, Rachel still came across as likable. The more she learned about the people involved, the more she became diswayed. In short, she had a strong conscience. As the story rushes to the climax, there are several shockers that change the protaganist's motivations. I loved this romantic, suspenseful family saga that often left me breathless. Well written!

"I am thoroughly enjoying these Mpow headphones. Can't rave enough about them. The pairing was simple and fast on both my iPad and Samsung phone. The controls are simple. On the earphone itself, allI have to do is move my finger from top to bottom to control the volume or right to left to change tracks. Love the bass and the sound is clear and rich. it seems Mpow thought of everything, including the long play time before having to recharge. It's a whopping 12 hours! I've charged it up and have yet to run out of playtime. Once I adjusted headphones to my head, I found them very comfortable.I've been using them at the gym while on the treadmill listenting to audiobooks. They stay on very well.I haven't had the opportunity to use the detachable cable to directly plug into airplanes or stereos, etc. and with the 12 hour battery life, I don't think I'll even have a need for it. However, I'm glad they have been provided, just in case.The headphones came charged up right out of the sturdy box which I kept for future storage.This is my latest, most favourite toy and I'm loving the exceptional sound.

"I own several Mpow products and am always pleased and impressed. The Mpow 40W 5-Port High Speed USB Charger is another excellent product from this conscientious company. I love the fact that there are 5 ports and they all can be considered high speed. This charging unit is highly intelligent as it will detect the device you are plugging in and will safely charge it at the fastest maximum charging speed. There is a flat, matte, rubbery feel to the case which makes it safe to place on wooden worktop without fear of scratches. It comes with its own detachable cable and warranty which assures a 45 day money back promise and 18-months of worry-free use. It's a nice size (easily fits in the palm of my hand) and therefore easy to travel with. I use it to plug in my Kindle, Samsung Note 4, iPod, and iPad Mini all at the same time. All charged up very fast. What really impressed me however, is that the charger will adjust to a slower charging speed when your devices are fully chargedf or if there is a problem with too high or too low voltage.

"In this dark book, the author delved deep into the inner thoughts and motivations of Elizaveth Bathory, and in this he excelled. I much preferred to stay with Elizabeth's point of view rather than switching back to a modern day descendent. But that's because I'm a purist when it comes to historical fiction and I tend not to be fond of books set in both present and past times. Codrescue does not shy away from the brutality, superstitions, terror, and beliefs of the time including the animosity of the people towards the wealthy nobles. There is much violence in this book, and that must be expected. The murderous acts are chilling and graphic, so brace yourselves. Not for the feint of heart, that's for sure, but Elizabeth's story is all about the murders, and cannot be writtenw without it. The author did a ton of research and this is definitely one of the strengths of this book. The world continues to be fascinated with this notorious woman and this is one book that definitely portrays her accurately, giving readers a glimpse as to what evil lurcked in her mind and heart.For the full review and a brief bio on Elizabeth Bathory visit: [...]","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZFH9GV2KN7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YO78SUE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZFH9GV2KN7R","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have used memory foam on my mattress, but never in pillow form. But now that I have tried this pillow, I know I will never go back to regular pillows again.

Yet I've slept on it for a week now and I love how it fits the contours of my face when I lay on it. This pillow has eliminated the need to sleep on two pillows. This plenty provides plenty support. Due to its firmness, I was also worried that it would make my ears sore when laying on it, but I was wrong there too. It fits so perfectly and feels so comfortable when I sleep.

It covers all the famous opera singers and composers, as well as some Italian history. It is evident the author did a great deal of research and is passionate about opera and Italian life. At times, there were many sections that read more technically instead of prose-like, and this made the story flow more like a creative non-fiction book than a novel. But the bones are great.

"There is lots to love in this exciting new novel set in America's gilded age. A very wealthy, aged widower has decided to marry a very young woman and leave the bulk of his estate to her, and he has summoned his lawyer to officially change the will. Of course, this stirs the ire of the man's adult children who are both plagued with severe personal problems. And why is the patriarch marrying such a young woman? Because his dead wife insists upon it. Of great suspicion is the fact that the dead wife is being channeled by the young fiance's sister.Slowly, suspicions arise as secrets are unravelled in this suspenseful story. Nicely written with plenty of plot twists, there is much here to hold your interest from start to finish. A great book to cozy up to!Thank you to the author and publisher. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HDZJLAJRPJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062375857#wasThisHelpful","R4HDZJLAJRPJ9","A3685FII0CT06P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3685FII0CT06P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Calling this ""cool comfort nylon"" is silly. It's red nylon over neoprene. It is going to hold in heat and is not cool... except in way it looks. Heat stroke is a risk at our San Diego vacation home so we probably won't use it when we train dogs there in the summer. I will say it looks great and the reflective material all around the piping and straps is sensible and will increase dog and handler visibility. The location of the buckle will make it impossible for your dog to lay on the one side comfortably and the adjustment slide could be under the belly or on the other side, giving your service dog limited options for laying comfortably. One can remove the slide and sew the strap to the desired length to eliminate the second issue. I would recommend using a collar with this so when your dog needs to lay for more than 10 minutes, you could remove the ""vest"" so he/she can be comfortable. We already ask a lot of service dogs by requiring them to pay attention (most pet dogs sleep about 20 hours a day). Many service dog are not of ""working"" breeds so the stress of working can have an ill effect on their health. The best way around this is to consider your pet's needs and comfort level while working. Providing comfy gear, something soft to lay on (if not a well-furred, sturdy dog), plenty of water offered frequently, booties (if the ground is hot), shade on warm days, and of course our deep appreciation is the best way to ensure their longevity and continued service. Service dogs will do anything to keep their handlers happy so please do your part to be sure your dog isn't over doing it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R01X1SYZIAIU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ES3VYY6#wasThisHelpful","R3R01X1SYZIAIU","ABQVDKWU40G0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQVDKWU40G0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I used the contents of one capsule to pack the 2cm deep puncture wound and rubbed some of the powder into  other punctures which were less deep the covered with bandaging. I also ingested 2 capsules 3x day for 5 days and there was no sign of infection. The wound healed with minimal scarring so I am pleased with the results. I'm a fan of Nature's Way Goldenseal Root capsules and always have them in my cabinet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ZB8NJUUD8F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00125Z3GI#wasThisHelpful","R12ZB8NJUUD8F4","ABQVDKWU40G0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQVDKWU40G0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The one star would be for the nice look of the ""fabric"" (plastic suede) when it is absolutely clean. As soon as a little drool or grease gets on it, the smudges are super obvious and it looks gross. Pet fur also sticks to it so it needs to be vacuumed, not just brushed off. Our ""true microfiber"" (a very different and much softer human-grade microfiber) dog beds are wonderful at repelling fur, and are nice, soft and warm to the touch. This material feels firm and cool and our pets will much prefer the beds once we cover them with microfiber or fleece blankets. The bed is not waterproof as was advertised at the time we purchased ours. It is extremely difficult to get the bed back together after washing. Sadly, washing this bed often is absolutely imperative if it will be used by a dog with saliva, coat oils, or fur. It would probably be a much better cat bed since cats typically do not have oily fur and most cats don't drool or get muddy paws. Our one cat has used this bed on occasion after coughing up a hairball in her own bed and having nowhere else to lay, but she doesn't prefer this bed. None of our little dogs or those of our guests, love this bed on it's own. Granted we have a nice variety of beds so there are lots of options to choose from and this one is not  popular at all UNTIL, I fold up a fleece blanket and place it in the bed to soften it up. It is fairly rigid, which is good for looks, but not for comfort. As the other reviewer stated, this bed would be good for a pet with arthritis who might like to curl up but would have trouble walking on a squishy-soft surface.Red Dingo Dark Brown/Light Brown Pet Bed, Donut, Small","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXZ9X7050GXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088KIKTM#wasThisHelpful","RAXZ9X7050GXQ","ABQVDKWU40G0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQVDKWU40G0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just know that this harness is a deep bubble gum pink. I feel like the image may be purposely altered to give a pleasant dusty rose or non-obnoxious pink color. We're making it work, but it's really too pink to complement any natural dog fur/hair tones.These are a much simpler product than Buddy Belts yet these continue to rise in price to match the price of Buddy Belts. I'm not seeing the craftsmanship here that I see in the Buddy Belts. For sure the Buddy Belt is better engineered and better looking. That considered, the tendency for leather to stretch makes the ChokeFree perhaps the better harness if one always applies it to the dog in the same direction (one side designated as the right side and is always on the right side of the dog). Because it's only one thin layer of leater (the metallic ones, being excepted), it will soften up and form to the dog more quickly. This means it will be a more comfortable harness for some dogs. However, the thin single layer of leather invites greater risk of breakage. Some of our dogs hate the buddy Belt and will reluctantly accept the ChokeFree. One thing that for me is a huge plus with the Buddy Belt is that it is actually is easier to put on and take off despite it having a metal buckle The leash can remain attached to the Buddy Belt at all times which saves us time as our dogs' harnesses are removed as soon as we get home and we like to store them attached to the leashes. With the ChokeFree you have to remove the leash each time you take it off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176MWS3CJ3TNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3PHRO4#wasThisHelpful","R176MWS3CJ3TNE","ABQVDKWU40G0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQVDKWU40G0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sizing is off and it's not very stretchy but feels so soft. I bought this thinking it could fit one of our chihuahuas or a kitty. It's not stretchy and though the neck and chest of the pets in question fit within the size chart guidelines, this did not fit them (couldn't even get it on) my suggestion would be to add at least 3"" to the pet's neck and chest measurements and order the size that would accommodate that. If you're looking for the sizing chart it's there in the images (not obvious when shopping on a smartphone).

"We own several buddy belts which cost about as much as these. The Buddy Belts are a more detailed design and involved more leather and hardware. I like that the buddy belt has the leash O-ring in a position that the leash doesn't have to be detached and reattached each time you take the harness off. With the ChokeFree, you have to remove the leash each time which for us is a burden because we are harnessing and walking several dogs several times a day. Granted the way it's designed will ensure that the hook and loop closure cannot come completely undone which adds an additional amount of safety. Our dogs have managed to get one or both legs out of these. However these seem to be better tolerated than the buddy belts (our dogs hate putting on the Buddy Belts). These are not escape proof and should only be used with dogs who are trained not to bolt. If your dog is a bolt risk, use this and a martingale and attach the martingale ring to the leash as well. Adjust the martingale so that it won't choke the dog if it's pulling but will prevent escape should your dog slip out of the chokefree harness. If anyone knows a completely escape proof dog harness, we'd love to know about it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH3DRWMKPMLX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A3PHXQ6#wasThisHelpful","RH3DRWMKPMLX9","ABQVDKWU40G0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQVDKWU40G0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really great product. I am an efficiency fanatic so I love non-toxic products that don't need rinsing or other extra steps. This is one step- just apply it and leave it- or wipe it, whatever you wish. It's so easy. No odor, no irritation to pets, no accidental bleaching of your favorite clothes, and no whining housekeepers with sensitive skin. Needless to say we love this!Everyone knows silver is a potent (perhaps the most potent?) antimicrobial available. I haven't heard of a single pathogen that can survive being hit with this strength of ionic silver solution. I recommend  PureGreen24 to every germophobe, and to anyone who might have a weak immune system and a legitimate fear of microbes.When left on surfaces, this solution has a residual effect of at least 24 hours. I imagine that it actually lasts for months, but they don't want you to know that because you'd use less. When they make antimicrobial socks and such, they add silver to the fibers and that lasts for months/years and hundreds of washings. If silver embedded in a fiber can last for years why wouldn't this product have a residual effect when left on a surface without rinsing? One wouldn't have any idea where the silver residue was and where it might be wiped away so to be on the safe side, use this daily if you have a germ concern.Tip- When you add this to your bottle of dish soap and apply to a sponge, the sponge is dissinfected in the process of washing your dishes. The sponge will retain antimicrobial activity if you don't rinse all of the soap+silver solution out of it. I use Dr Bronner castille soap and PureGreen24 (4:1) as a dish soap. I love knowing if there is any soap residue (a risk with castille soaps), it will be safely antimicrobial.Tip- If you want to be really careful about germs, you can do what we do and pre-treat your kitchen and hand towels in this. I just dip the washed (still damp) towels, into a bucket filled with 1 cup of this and 3 cups water, wring out well and put them in the dryer. When they are dry, I have antibacterial/anti-viral towels (and the dryer, if it wasn't already, is totally germ free).Tip- This is a great roach control product as well and won't harm your pets/kids. A lot of people don't know that many insects, roaches included, need bacteria to survive. Use a dallop of soft food (like meat baby food or hamburger), mix it with the puregreen24 in this solution. Leave a tiny bit out each night and after a few nights the roaches will be eliminated. Tf your pets happen to eat the roaches (Dead or alive) there is no risk of poisoning from the PureGreen24 (unlike toxic roach baits).We also recommend using it on hot spots and itching bug bites. We dilute it 1:3 with purified water if the skin is broken as the acid could sting. Then again, sometimes the sting of an acid will remove the itch of an allergic hive. If you are inclined you might experiment carefully with using this product on itches and wounds. It works better than the home made ionic silver and vinegar solutions we have tried over the years.I gave 4 stars, not 5, only because of the price. It is FAR cheaper than mesosilver silver products (I'm thinking of their oral solutions and spa dissinfectant), and it's impossible to make .03% ionic silver (300PPM) at home, so this is a good buy for us. However, I still feel it should be less expensive. It isn't hard to make ionic silver in a production facility and the citric acid added isn't valuable.

"The collar looks just like the photo and I am pleased with the white paint which has held up for a month. The paint will wear off wherever it rubs against anything metal, of course, but I expected that. The leather is so thin that I was able to easily stretch the collar with my hands an extra inch in order to put it on the dog we purchased it for. He has a 15"" neck. This collar arrived in a size suitable for necks up to 14"" and after a quick stretching it fit him just fine. After about a month of use (5 minutes a day, at most, of being used with a leash) it stretched out another inch or more on it's own. We now have to use the 3rd hole to keep it from looking droopy. We put this on a medium size dog who is off leash for 95% of his walk, so most of this stretching is occurring during short periods when a leash is attached and he isn't a puller. It is not safe for a dog that pulls or any aggressive dog as it would easily rip.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PU0MH5IOJ8VI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068ZMIG0#wasThisHelpful","R1PU0MH5IOJ8VI","ABQVDKWU40G0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABQVDKWU40G0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just took my miele into the shop because the motor died. The machine isn't old and has only had 450 sf of space to clean weekly. It was running fine until I started buying knock off bags. I started to notice stronger odors when housekeeper was vacuuming. Eventually it just died (it was on it's 5th 3M Filtrete bag) and when I took a look, the bag was in place perfectly but the inside of the canister was very dusty, even had sand sized particles. So dust got through or around the seal of this bag, into the inner canister, through the cheap secondary filter, and into the motor in abundant quantity. I am waiting to hear if the Miele-authorized repairman can fix the motor (he said it doesn't look good). I am hoping 3M will step up and cover the repair or the cost of replacing my vacuum. At the very least, I'm hoping they will find out what flaw caused this issue. Please don't use these if you notice any dust at all inside your canister.

"Absolutely delighted with this crib. Not ridiculously heavy nor too light. Easy to assemble and easy to adjust the crib height when baby is old/tall enough to pull themselves over the railing.The big bonus here is that it has one removable side to convert to a toddler bed when a crib is no longer appropriate. This is actually a really big deal to us. When my first daughter was ready for a toddler bed, she was really sad to leave her crib, so we found a way to make it a toddler bed.This one does that easily and is set up for it. And yes, once it's a toddler bed you CAN put the rail back on to become a crib again.If this isn't your favorite color choice, it's available in several other colors to suit your nursery.I will be interested to see later on how well the powder coating finish holds up when baby starts chewing on the rails, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AZLE26IL0X9S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011O3ELQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1AZLE26IL0X9S","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The sound on these is wonderful. I have other high-end sets from different companies and can't tell a significant difference between this brand and another quality head set. But there IS a substantial difference in sound quality between these and your average $50 set. Very substantial.I'm not much for vanity products and won't endorse a ""high end"" product simply because it bears a name. These are just plain comfortable and very easy to set up for blue tooth. Despite saying that they are compatible with Iphones, pads, etc, they do work just fine with my last-generation Kindle Fire, even with the blue tooth.And if you spend a lot of time with ear phones on, this is one investment you should make for your long-term hearing. Clean sound is far less damaging to the ears than ""dirty"" sound with a lot of other static and background noises.

"Much better than my $20 a dozen bar mops. I purchased a mega-pack last year of all whites on a friend's recommendation. They were ok at best. They dried well, bleached okay, but looked shabby after just one washing. These towels have a better quality edging with a full, finished seam. I am not exaggerating when I say that my previous bar mops started to unravel at the first washing and I was often cutting loose strings off of them.These ones have a thicker cotton with a bumpy texture that seems to grab water more readily.In fact, I put one on my kitchen counter and tested it next to a microfiber cleaning towel. I poured one quarter cup of water across the surface of each. This cotton towel grabbed most of the water on its own and I didn't have to continue rubbing the counter with the still-dry parts of the towel. The microfiber felt much wetter to the touch and let a lot of water go through to the counter. These grabbed most of the water and let very little pass through. The microfiber spread the remaining water on the counter. This towel actually continued to pick up water even after I poured 1/4 cup of water onto it.

"I can't say that I will be using these as dish towels. It might be a mental hang-up, but microfiber-type cloths in my experience have mostly been used for cleaning. I can sort of see why. I got these towels and a set of all cotton bar mops on the same day. The cotton bar mops, quite frankly, did a much better job of absorbing water and quickly. These took a little longer, felt ""wet"" to the touch when the cotton ones felt only a little damp (like the water stayed on the surface rather than sinking in) and proceeded to spread water around on the counter while the cotton ones picked up the remaining moisture. And I started by pouring about 1/4 cup of water across the surface of each towel.They one place they out-performed the cotton towel was in scrubbing. There was some sticky residue on my counter from mixing sweet tea that came up more readily with the scrubby-type fibers when the cotton left some sticky behind. So, I will probably be using these for house cleaning, but not likely for dishes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EO3M1BV5B4DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXTUXHG#wasThisHelpful","R1EO3M1BV5B4DA","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am consistently impressed with the quality of toys from this company. This one is no exception. While the tea set isn't as ""cute"" as some of the the frilly, super-girly sets we've ordered in the past, this one was no less well received by the children. It's the only tea set that came with cute littel pieces of ""toast"" and a caddy of tea leaves, which they absolutely loved. That was probably the real standout feature. My kids used to take my tea bags and pretend to brew them in their glass tea set, but the cute little tea caddy and ""leaves"" just added to their creative play. Sometimes those little changes make a world of difference. I, personally, like that they set has a bit of weight to it, like a glass set rather than a light plastic one. It makes it seem just a bit more real and the kids are developing hand strength and dexterity in a way that light plastic toys to not encourage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKOJYYW3PV8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013VKSVSS#wasThisHelpful","R1QKOJYYW3PV8W","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very well-made and generously portioned sweater. My nearly 10-year-old daughter has a very athletic build and generally finds a standard size 10 a bit too tight. Even most 10-12's are  just barely right for her in the arms or legs. This sweater fit her quite comfortably with plenty of length in the torso and arms. She is, by pediatric standards, on the tall end of the growth chart, so we often have to buy her one size up in clothing for length.

"This concept really didn't impress me when I first saw it. But my kids have gotten HOURS of entertainment from it.Like most ""kits"" that come with paper, there's nowhere near enough to last for more than one or two play sessions. You can, of course, buy from the company at a ridiculous price, or make your own squares using a paper cutter (which we did).The colors are easy to use (not too hard to squeeze) and layer well on top of each other.Some paints tend to just muddy and mix together. I guess the extra air flow from the spinning helps these to dry quickly so they do layer on top of each other to make interesting designs.You can adjust the speed to change the patterns. The instructions have lots of little tips and tricks for creating various patterns and ideas.Although it's designed for older kids, my 5 year old was able to use it with a little instruction.I am also surprised that it cleans up so easily, which is wonderful. The paints come out of the machine with just a little water and a rag.The paints DO last for quite a while, but with 3 kids, we had to order more just a week after they started using it.Definitely a great gift for kids.

I was suspicious that these would be no different than standard Avery printer labels, but I was wrong.They are substantially thicker/more durable than the office-type labels.They ARE waterproof. Unlike the office variety which smear ink when damp.They have a stronger adhesive which makes them apply well to things like plastic bins and spray bottles (which is primarily what I wanted them for).

"This toy was received with great anticipation at our house. And it is definitely a lot of fun. But for the nearly $100 price tag, it's seriously lacking in durability and practicality.While the picture shows 2 small children jumping together inside, that is more fantasy than reality. There is very little actual jumping area inside the ""ring"". Half the fun of this activity for my kids (and many others I've seen) is jumping together with a friend or two. There simply isn't enough room here. They would have to stay very carefully in one precise spot and jump only up and down to avoid smashing heads with the other jumper. If you've ever watched kids in a large bouncer, you would realize that is simply not how the y like to play in them. Because of these limitations, they lost interest after a very short time and didn't ask to go back. In the larger bounce house we used recently, we couldn't tear them away from it.Another weakness is that you can't anchor it anywhere, so a good wind would remove it quickly. We thought of setting it up on our enclosed porch, the the directions specifically say not to set on cement. And probably for a good reason. The sides that appear to be there for protection are just additional balloons tied together with string the thickness of shoe laces. They make the appearance of adding safety (giving a clear visual, border) but when our larger child of nearly 50 pounds actually bounced into one, the entire bounce house started to tip over with the child.My final comment is that you need a high pressure air compressor to inflate it. Ours took close to an hour. And air compressors have different sized fittings. This does not include a compressor, which you will need to have if you purchase one.There is no way a person could simply blow this up by mouth, in case you're wondering.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP6093JR6ZJLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERK8WWC#wasThisHelpful","RP6093JR6ZJLT","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find the pre-freezing ""cup"" concept with these incredibly annoying. I ordered this hoping that we had gotten a machine that would grind standard ice cubes. Not so. It came with a couple of custom-sized bowls to freeze water in. It creates an ice hocky puck that fits neatly into the grinding shaft. And because there are only 2, it requires some preplanning, freezing, emptying and re-freezing if you want to make cones for an entire family. It did grind well, and easily into a very nice ""shave"" that my kids loved. But it only grinds thoroughly for about 80% of the block then requires some fussiness to get the remaining parts in at just the right angle to shave into cones.For the price of this snow cone maker compared to the other 5 star rated one I have, I feel like I'm paying a lot more for the snow man head and arms, which make it impossible to fit in an upper cupboard anywhere in my kitchen. For the additional price, they could have at least included a substantial number of paper cones rather than requiring you to purchase an add on pack almost immediately.While it does the job quickly and relatively quietly, I find the necessary pre-planning and space mongering highly annoying.Unless your kids are absolutely nuts about Olaf or you're giving this to someone with lots of cupboard space, go with the smaller model from Hawaiian ice.

"I am new to the world of lego. This book is almost overwhelming. My imagination has been stretched, and I'm sure my childrens' will be, too. I set the book on my desk to read/review but the kids kept running off with it. Go figure. Now all they keep asking for are legos for Christmas.I love the way they designed the book. It has categories for themes of ideas, which is pretty clever since kids will probably build in themes. It opens with an introduction spread with the various types of blocks and how to connect them. It gives basic measurements and geometric information.From there, the theme centered directions look like this:OUTER SPACE: robots, forklifts, doors and walls, a lab, aliens, space plants, scenery, spaceships and so forth.MODERN METROPOLIS: Basic buildings, museum, roofs, cars, furniture, plants, farms, lights, signs and fruits and veggies, etc.THE WILD WEST: Wagons, scenery, cavalry fort, jailhouse, saloon, steam train, old mine, riverboat, outlaw hideout and more.FANTASY LAND: A fantasy house, fences and pathways, waterfall, tree slide, castle wall, towers, catapult, etc.THE REAL WORLD: A cell phone, bathroom, gingerbread man, baking items, popsicle, candy, ""box of chocolates"".Each picture is not a step-by-step but gives a general idea of how to put it together. Several of the more complex ones gives a pulled-apart image so you can see how all of the items fit together. At the back of the book is a breakdown of all the kinds of bricks available.This is a truly impressive collection of ideas. Certainly a great place to start inspiring imaginations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R389JUHITYP009/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465437886#wasThisHelpful","R389JUHITYP009","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great balance between mousse and gel. Not to thick or too thin. I used about 3 pumps for my mid-length hair. I didn't do the recommended curl method, simply because I didn't have time. I have naturally wavy hair that usually falls flat with gel or gets greasy looking with mousse (and stiff). This product was perfect. It gave me a soft ""scrunch"" curl with a nice, soft texture. Not stiff, not greasy. It did add a little bit of shine to the lower strands that are generally a little dry looking from frequent hair coloring.Generally speaking, I just don't bother with most hair products after the first time or two because of how they leave my hair feeling (or the horrendous perfume smell).

"I had given up on hanging files years ago. Just absolutely frustrated and annoyed with the support frames that were constantly giving out, lifting off the drawers when I pulled the files and flopping all over the place. I went to a standing pocket file which also has its drawbacks. My husband, however, insisted on keeping our overflow files in a hanging system. Since I still needed to interact with said system again and again, I thought I would try this frame and I'm glad that I did. It is weighed enough to stand on it's own outside of a file cabinet or set down inside of it. It did go together pretty easily and doesn't wobble easily like the frames I've used in the past.

"I am really enjoying this study. It is set up to be a group study, but works as an individual study, as well. There is a lot of depth to the subject of being ""set apart"" and some practical applications of how we do that. Most of the scripture passages for study are printed in the book itself, but there are suggested additional readings that you can look up yourself. You read a small passage then answer a few questions about each passage. And it covers some interesting parts of the O.T. that you are not likely to have studied elsewhere.In a culture where Christians are looking, acting and sounding more and more like the rest of the world, the subject of being ""set apart"" is highly relevant. It's harder than ever to be ""in the world but not of it"" in my opinion. The culture shift just in my 40 year lifetime has been profound.This is just a study of a different flavor. When so many subjects have been addressed to the point of overkill, being holy is one that I think we need to take a closer look at.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVFAFZAXCQPT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426778422#wasThisHelpful","RVFAFZAXCQPT7","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My only previous experience with baby washclothes were those tiny little half-tissue sized things from Gerber. They were super-soft, so we tolerated them for baby's comfort. But saw these and wanted to know if they would be better. They are MUCH better and for little more money than the ultra-thin rags we used on our own kids.These actually look like a quality wash cloth with a super-soft texture, vivid color and size reasonable enough to wrap around baby's limbs or belly while washing.

"This is probably the most user-friendly and cost effective high chair I've ever seen. The dishwasher friendly tray is wonderful. From experience, I know that washing those things in the kitchen sink usually results in water being sprayed all over the counters.The seat is comfortable and nicely padded with a full harness system for holding the youngest eaters who cannot hold themselves up for long.The wheels make it really nice to pull to the table for feeding when the chair is out of range (but baby will eventually push away from the table with their feet, so you have to keep the feet turned away from the table itself).The wide base is nice and sturdy. It doesn't feel like it could tip at any moment (like one I had).The ability to convert this to a chair booster and high chair simultaneously is just awesome. No need to have 2 accessories in the same kitchen.The colors and neutral, mocha-like. More contemporary to an adult decor rather than looking like a giant child toy in your kitchen.It doesn't fold up as small as some others we've used, but that's a very small gripe.

"I got the mobile tonight.  I love it!  It's easy to put together and take apart.  I love the idea of the soother being able to be separate  from the arm.  The mobile only lasts about 5 months, so the separation of the soother from it allows it to be used a lot longer.  The mobile/animal hanger part can be removed and put on a stroller, ensure longer use if the child still likes it and/or, can be transferred back and forth between the mobile and stroller.  There are 3 options of sounds:  White noise, music, and county sounds, such as crickets.  There are 2 levels of volume for these.  There's a remote that comes with it. The remote changes the song and turns the mobile back on.  The downfall is that it doesn't turn it off.  The machine will automatically turn off after a few hours, it says.  Also, I'm not sure of the point of being able to change the lullaby, unless the infant gets calm to one particular song.  As far as hooking it to the crib, I feel it's top heavy and leans forward too much. It's held on by a rubber strap.  I tried tightening it as much as I could, but it's still unstable.  It leans forward and if you accidentally bump it, it moves a great deal.  I'm tempted to just put the soother on the bookshelf and not use it as a mobile.  I will have Jason try tightening it and see what he thinks tomorrow.  Overall, if we can get it tightened and more sturdy, I'd give it 5 stars.  If not, 4.  It's a great idea, they just need to come up with a better system to latch it onto the crib.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI4TRFMPG57A4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8VQ4AW#wasThisHelpful","RI4TRFMPG57A4","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has been a God send. I have a husband who is mild-mannered, has a gentle spirit and doesn't fit the masculine Hollywood stereo type. To make matters worse, he works in a prison where he is constantly insulted, questioned about his sexuality and has wondered, ""What's wrong with me?"" Naturally, as his wife, I tried to assure him that what was ""wrong"" is our society, not him. But one person's assurance only goes so far.I requested this book for him. I cannot say anything specifically about the content, but I can say this... He is not much of a reader, but this book has been moving around with him. He even took it on vacation. And I'm hearing a difference in the way he perceives himself. It seems like the author's perspective has helped to reassure him that Christ-like masculinity is not the same as movie-masculinity. And just as much as women have struggled for not feeling like super models, men seem to struggle with knowing whether they are ""manly"" enough. The push of feminism has certainly not helped that. Men are treated as inferior in so many scenarios. I am grateful that someone tackled this issue.

"I have purchased several of these Vtech tables as gifts. The brand is more reasonably priced than the better-known baby company products such as Fisher Price, but the quality is the same. In some cases, I have noticed the Vtechs are easier to assemble. They are very user friendly for set-up and attaching the legs took only seconds. They still remove easily, as well. The toy is sturdy and does not tip easily, which is a concern when you have a little one putting their body weight on it. And the variety of toys built in is very nice. It allows for pushing, sliding, turning, and flipping. When baby isn't big enough to stand yet, you can lay the toy on the floor and let them play with the board sans legs, which is a nice feature.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23E3SG9FOKMWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y53UVIO#wasThisHelpful","R23E3SG9FOKMWZ","A1JOANG98KBFKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JOANG98KBFKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're kids are fascinated with ""Brave"" but aren't up to a REAL bow and arrow, this one is a really fun start. Kids love the noise it makes when the arrows are released. The fact that you don't have to reload after each launch just makes it that much more fun.Of course, the distance they say they shoot is a maximum with the right amount of pull and just the right everything. But it does go pretty far. The kids were pretty impressed overall. Aim isn't terribly accurate. This is definitely for ""fun"" shooting, not target practice.

"I LOVE leap frog. We've been really pleased with the quality of their products, their customer service and even their free trial products.

That's really not all that bad considering how frequently they abandon their Kindle downloads and go looking for new games.I am really glad that they can still enjoy the games without the cards and ""pad"" that come with this.

Both are available in the section of your store where you purchase craft paints and brushes.These look high quality and really add a classy touch to your gift.

"I wasnt going to leave a review for this horrible product but since the manufacturer keeps sending me emails bugging me to do so I will.  It is not as depicted in their promotional information or the picture on this site.  Its shown as having a rigid, open loop in which you can place your leg and with the help of the flexible hand strap you can lift up your leg.  The problem is that there is no loop.  It came flattened in a box and at first I assumed it had been flattened for shipping purposes but no matter how I try to bend it into the rigid loop they advertise it will not bend in that way.  When I tried to use it what happens is after many gyrations and an inordinate investment of time I can manage to get most of my foot into the ultra skinny flat opening but then when I try and lift my leg with the device my foot slips out either completely or Im barely able to hold at least my big toe in the loop as I try and lift the leg.

The main character is a cartoon illustrator whos the product of a black woman and an Irish man so hes very light and often not recognized as being African American though thats the identity he internalizes.

"It has a padded back for comfort.  Its lightweight.  Its complicated.  There are instructions on how to unfold it and use it in multiple ways and the instructions are necessary because theres nothing intuitive about this backpack which is what I find lacking.  Apparently theres a way to to strap your smartphone (assuming you have such a thing) into a velcro compartment and let it record something for some reason.  Why not just hike and enjoy the scenery?

Its a great idea to have them soft sided and foldable which makes it easier to tote them and to move offices or office configuration.  Another nice feature is the clear clip that allows the user to attach the pieces together.

A long time FBI officer is called back into the Mexican drug scene to hunt down an old enemy.

"Ive never been fascinated by pirates but after reading Kurson Pirate Hunters thats changed.  I am interested in history and Kurson brings lots of that alive in Pirate Hunters specifically the history of the golden age of Piracy in the 17th century around Hispaniola (now known as Santo Domingo).  At that time it was a Spanish colony but the French and English were there in abundance as well for the lucrative trade opportunities.  And where lots are goods are being moved youll find those who want to exploit the situation for their personal gainenter the Pirates.  Bannister, the English pirate at the center of this book, was an unlikely villain.  Hed been a loyal English merchant sailor for all his life.  His motivations and his background make history come alive as does the modern day search for his sunken ship Golden Fleece and its treasure trove of history.Pirate Hunters is also the story of two men whod been devoted to underwater diving for most of their lives.  Matera and Chatterton were relentless in their search for Golden Fleece.  The story rocks back and forth from their personal stories, their professional backgrounds, a paper chase in many of the worlds legendary libraries, and their love of diving.This short book is over way too soon.  The only negative about it is how tiny the maps are.  Its all but impossible to read them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2YUQTP2ZCU6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400063361#wasThisHelpful","R1E2YUQTP2ZCU6","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasnt sure what to expect with the biography about the legendary pimp Robert Beck.  On the surface it would look like our world views, his and mine, would have no meeting place.  Wrong.  Beck lived in many of the key cities in the 30s through the all important for counter culture 70s when black Hollywoods exploitation was at its peak; Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles.  These cities were abuzz with racial unrest.During these times but most importantly during his childhood he grew up in the only sections of town designated for African-Americans to live as dictated by white society.  As he looked around Beck saw that it was the pimps who always seemed to have money and status so that is the profession he decided to study and pursue.  For obvious reasons that career choice didnt work out so well but along the way he began to reflect and write about his experiences on the streets.  The pimp tradition included the pimps gathering on corners and talking smack about one another in rhythm and rhyme.  Through his writing this tradition became the key to Slims fame.  The pimp toasts led to our current day rapping.  An art form is born.  Robert Beck is a tragic but interesting writer and so is his life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1OLP4Z11NQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538340#wasThisHelpful","R2J1OLP4Z11NQI","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Cabbies can have a unique take on locals because they become so familiar with the area and its citizens and sometimes its cuisine.

"After seeing former CIA Deputy Director and Author Michael Morell speak on a news show I sought out his book though with some reservations.  I worried it would be too overtly political, too technical or just plain boring.  None of my fears turned out to be valid.  The writing is amazing; very clear and engaging and most important Morell always brings the individuals personality and character to the forefront which makes their motivations clear and no matter how unsympathetic human.Obviously this is not a book that will help its readers sleep well at night other than to know there are some very capable people standing between America and some #(!* scary folks.  One of the most instructive chapters was toward the end where Morell provides a mock (but true) terrorist assessment similar to what he and his cohorts give to the President.  It helped me gain a handle on whom and what we are dealing with.  Im sure Morell is a skilled writer on his own but I have a feeling his co-author, Bill Harlow, provided some excellent input because the book reads like an all too real thriller.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22NEODVWL89P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455585661#wasThisHelpful","R22NEODVWL89P8","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wish book jacket blurbs would not compare books to other books or authors or at least not make unwarranted hyperbole.  Innocence is touted as Chandler-esque.  I didnt see it.  The writing is not similar to Chandler at all other than seeing lots of people in a negative light.  In Innocence all the characters are flawed.  The action in set in post World War II Czechoslovakia so theyre all influenced by the Soviets worldview and no one feels free to be honest about who they are and what they want out of life.  Of course most of their desires are dark indeed.When two murders occur in and around a local movie theatre everyone tries to cover their behind even if theyre not guilty.  Maybe I should say not guilty of murder because they all have secrets better left hiddensex with underage people, husband on death row for crossing the communists, affairs with married men, and those are just some of the highlights.

"Alexander Rose goes through three key battles in American history, Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Iwo Jima, explaining the specific characteristics of each one.  Its an impressive effort.  He does a good job with the details about Bunker Hill and Gettysburg it becomes belabored however with Iwo Jima his writing is inspired.  I read the first 50 pages or so of the earlier battles and became bored so I moved on to the next battle.  I couldnt stop reading when I hit the World War II section, the details are fascinating, the pacing is good.  He explains how, at least by 1944 and 1945, the men felt they were there to do a job like any other job with the reward of going home in one piece or mostly one piece as their reward.  Prior to this time the military had a lot of career military men and hyper patriotic types reacting to the outrage of Pearl Harbor.  Neither is better or worsejust a different outlook and motivationIn all three war zones the men were innovative and learned to change tactics depending on their enemys actions and the terrain they fought on but at Iwo they were inspired probably because they were so often cut off from command and had to independently improvise.  Also, the mortality rate was s quick and high that they had to continually incorporate new soldiers which also led to changes in tactics.  Unlike the earlier battles there was a racial component to the war with Japan and Rose addresses that.  I forced myself to go back and finish the Bunker Hill and Gettysburg sections but they didnt sing for me.  Id give those sections three stars and the one on Iwo five stars.  That section alone is well worth the price of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0VZCHNFHEVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553805185#wasThisHelpful","RZ0VZCHNFHEVK","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

No matter how careful you are to get them sealed you can still have surprise messes or spoiled food.  The zip prevents this.I know theyre more expensive than some other bags but when you factor in how much food you wind up throwing out when its not been stored correctly when using other bags these make sense.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRAQ99T0TRBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E0FZQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3TRAQ99T0TRBY","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a balanced account but thats fair.  The author is entitled to her beliefs and world view.  Elliott carefully goes through the serial killer Michael Rosss life and his crimes as well as his mental state and capacity.  She also retells as much as is known about the crime committed on each of his many victims.  This part of the book is excruciating to read however I respect that she did it.  Each victim deserves to be accounted for along with their fear, and often their rape and murder.  Strangely this is not the most painful part of the story. For me I was more offended with all the empathy she wastes on Ross.  To be fair she also gives the victims families and others associated with Ross equal empathy.Elliotts writing is clear and articulate and sheds light on some of the intricacies of our judicial system as well as Rosss psychopathology  As much as I disagree with Elliotts stance I feel I came away from her book more enlightened.  The Man in the Monster is a horrible subject told well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6VX07S3WK72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420490X#wasThisHelpful","R2A6VX07S3WK72","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its fairly easy and intuitive to put together though the instructions are helpful if you get stuck.  Its surprisingly light weight.  Its made up of one long twist screw rod, three non-moveable rods, and one smaller non-moveable rod which is included in case you have an extra tall ceiling.  The rods fit into one another and the baskets with their infinitely adjustable screws are easy to install and move around depending on your showers lay out.  One nice feature is the two add on pieces that fit onto the baskets that can be used to secure razors.After initially putting all the parts together I found it awkward to move it to my shower and to get the twist section at the right height to make it stand up securely.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K4Q3RQ8X4LZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SN3FBZA#wasThisHelpful","R3K4Q3RQ8X4LZX","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Governors Wife is charming in part because it has such a retro feel though its set in current day Chicago, IL.  If cell phones and computer research and use werent included in the plot it would easily be possible to imagine that the action takes place in the 30s or 40s.  Michael Kelly is an ex-cop turned PI and its impossible not to equate his worldview with Chandlers Philip Marlowe.  Hes pessimistic.  Kelly is more erudite with his love of ancient Greek literature and how it informs him about his cases but is environment and the corruption he finds in the big city are similar to what Marlowe encounters.  Sadly its all believable.Uncovering the characters motivations is the key to the plot and the psychological underpinnings lead to a surprisingly satisfying conclusion.

"Leaving Before the Rains is a roller coaster of a memoir.  Alexandra Fuller was born and lived most of her early life in southern Africathrough civil war and harsh, unpredictable weather on an isolated farm with an eccentric hard drinking sanity challenged and challenging family.  Then she married and moved to the US with her risk taking outdoorsman husband Charlie and things calmed down and got even crazier.I loved the tone of Fullers book.  Its irreverent and frank in a stark way.  She doesnt hold back and I found myself crying through sympathetic tears.  Her style is breezy even when shes describing some pretty horrendous experiences.  Im used to reading accounts of Africa that focus on the beauty of the scenery and the wildlife and she includes that but she also talks about rabid dogs, big cats and hippos and elephants that can attack out of nowhere if you startle them.  The river currents and their beautiful falls can also be deadly even if you know what youre doing as Charlie did.  When she moved to Idaho she was confounded how alone yet not alone she was.  In Africa there was little and sometimes no accessible emergency infrastructure.  You and your family had to deal with emergencies on your own at least until you can find your way into a city and diseases such as yellow fever and malaria are ubiquitous.  Strangely though emergency services in the States were a phone call away and the care could be excellent and affordable it wasnt always and emotionally, when tragedy strikes, you can still find yourself alone.  Fullers story is sad and glorious and revealing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36IY17ZXST6WE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594205868#wasThisHelpful","R36IY17ZXST6WE","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I dont love the color or pattern of this curtain or mat but thats a matter of taste.  The curtain is a nice blend of cloth like material and plastic and it has strong, well reinforced hook holes.  The hooks themselves are adorable.  They are a coordinating pink and button like in appearance.  They too seem strong and balanced enough to hold the curtain firmly in place.The bath mat is another matter.  Again the pink/fuchsia color is unpleasantly bright and it is flimsy without a strong backing that would have helped hold it in place on potentially slick bath tiles.

"Gates characters are often New England academics, creative folk, intellectuals or intellectual wannabes.  Hopefully that wont be off putting to some because they are very real and almost uncomfortably honest in displaying their foibles, there are drugs and drinking and hard blue grass guitar strumming.Gates was a former Newsweek staffer were he wrote about music and books so most of his stories have multiple references to literature and classical, jazz, and bluegrass music which I found enjoyable though probably too many of the references only brought vague recognition for me.  Another theme Gates hits hard is dysfunctional or flat out unworkable relationships.  The good news is he doesnt leave his readers with a sense of despair because his insights have depth and hope no matter how broken or lonely his characters are.  His male characters were more effecting than his female ones.  I found myself enjoying his writing almost despite myself.  If you begin to wonder why some of his stories give you a sense of dj vu its probably because theyve previously appeared in literary journals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWRMTRJHCSXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351534#wasThisHelpful","R2CWRMTRJHCSXK","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For some reason I keep returning to World War II in my reading life.  I want to know the why of it, how it could have happened.  Hitlers Germany seems almost too horrible to be true.  I suppose my World War II addiction is a way of avoiding the nightly news and the daily fresh news it brings with the slight comfort of knowing that World War II happened so long ago.  When I read about Shepards new book I determined I wouldnt spend the time to read it yet in the end I did.  Im glad I did.Its the fictional account of some real life people.  Janusz Korczak was a Jewish doctor living in Warsaw Poland when the Germans marched in and forced all the Jews into a policed ghetto.  Aron was one of the orphaned children Korczak rescued.  I know this sounds grim and of course it is however a large part of the book, which is told from Arons point of view, focuses on how he and his resourceful friends became smugglers in an effort to feed their families.  Theres lots of wry humor that accompanies horror but this is what their lives have become as things daily become more desperate in a way thats not immediately apparent.  Less food, families and strangers forced into overcrowded apartments, disease, lice, people disappearing never to be heard from again, etc.  Yet Korczak keeps begging his fellow captives for money and food in order to keep his orphanage afloat and they give it.  To help with this he organizes and puts on plays starring the children as a means to lighten peoples lives and let them know his kids still need help.  Shepard writes with a touch of humor which actually makes their nightmare situation more real.  It doesnt matter how many accounts of World War II youve read.  Youll still want to read The Book of Aron.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2799OUC4FVUQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101874317#wasThisHelpful","R2799OUC4FVUQS","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Margaret of Anjou was French and married to Henry VI who was the contemporary King of England.  She was also the mother to a child, Edward, who she hoped would someday secede his father.  The problem was that Henry VI was ill and lay in a coma like state while Richard of York ruled.  Henrys Lancaster clan was symbolized by a red rose and Richards clan by a white rose.  Iggulden writes and interesting and often exciting tale.  Though lots of the action takes place on the battlefield I was afraid Id be bored but he writes a detailed account of war with lots of buildup and back story.  Hes also surprisingly neutral which gives the action veracity.  Iggulden includes several pages outlining the historical goings on and where he consolidates events he explains how and why.  Dont be surprised that the subtitle Margaret of Anjou doesnt fully describe what you can expect to read in this book.  Women werent the main players during this period and Margaret, though an interesting player is not central to the action.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY1MF4M106FAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165371#wasThisHelpful","RY1MF4M106FAG","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It has all the usual things weve come to expect from Lonely Planet travel guides such as great maps, highlights of the most sought after sights, brief histories, etc.  The downside is that there arent as many gorgeous pics as usual however thats remedied by over 1,000 pages of text that supply many tips and insights into travel in France.  When I fantasize about an ideal trip to France I think art museums, cheese and wine and thats all included.  Another thing that screams France to me is history and thats all here but Lonely Planet also talks about new architecture, thoughts, and the modern world which is eye opening.Lonely Planet guides are always good at giving a plethora of hotel and restaurant available in your chosen destination and France is no exception.  They include price info and amenity facts and often link you to a website address.  Most key areas have detail maps.  One feature I love is some key sights like the Louvre for instance has a museum map with details of what floor and where you can find key famous art works.  Are you looking to see the north rose window at Notre Dame?  Or the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles?  The Venus de Milo or Mona Lisa, or maybe Jim Morrisons grave at the Cimetiere du Pere Lachaise?

"Im appalled.  Im appalled because The Professor in the Cage is written by a learned man who has a hankering to understand and participate in smacking another man around in the ring.  The problem is that anyone who is a man or knows men or boys knows that a lot of them want to and are proud of standing up for themselves and that means at times that theyre not overly concerned about whether they are hurt or hurt others.  The good news is Gottschall has done a good job of analyzing what makes men aggressive and why especially in his historic perspective.  The bad news is how depressing it is.  He posits that in the absence of women and children men resort to primitive one ups man ship.What is horrible to me personally is how violence is almost glorified.  Whats even worse is that I came to understand how some of this might be hardwired and almost even necessary.  Ive always admired geeks, the men who think first and then act.  Have such men always felt less than the guys who lead with their brain damaging fists?  Youd think that someone whos a professor would have no need to bare his knuckles.  I must be wrong.  According to Gottschall all men feel the need to defend at least themselves no matter what the cost if only to test and/or prove themselves.  I truly hope this is not the case but Gottschall makes a good case that this is the case.  Have fists, will travel either in the gym or the classroom or the boardroom.  The best part of The Professor in the Cage is the historic perspective and Gottschall's presentation and his thoughts on that.

"Ive tried to read Nemirovsky before but couldnt finish but Fires of Autumn was excellent.  It begins at the start of World War I and concludes with the Second World War.  Its about three interlocking families, the Jacquilins, the Bruns, and the Humberts.  All are lower middle class Parisians and live close together and visit often.  A child from each family grow up together but in adulthood their lives swerve in different directions while their families stay acquainted.  Bernard Jacquilin enthusiastically enlists at age 18.  Renee Humbert and Therese Brun become nurses though for different reasons.  Renees motivation is more social but Therese wants to feel useful as she awaits the return of her soldier husband.Nemirovsky gives readers a riveting account of the time, especially the 20s, yet her themes are universal.  Her themes are the importance and influence of family and background, the meaning of love or even the questioning whether it exists, and the devastation and personal cost of war.  I was very struck by what a generation who were involved in two major wars...potentially close to a decade of combat involvement or at home trying to exist while worrying desperately about loves ones at the front.  Fires is a short novel with a big impact... Im going to have to hunt down the other Nemirosky novels I previously abandoned and try again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S2KRQ7EVAI2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1101872276#wasThisHelpful","R3S2KRQ7EVAI2V","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ghost Fields is one of those books that you set aside any other book youre involved in.  One of the best things about Griffithss main character archeologist Ruth Galloway is the science.  Oddly this is probably one of the least science intensive in the series but that doesnt slow things down.  DNA links the ancient and current population to the local gentry; the Blackstocks.Griffiths keeps us guessing who the bad guys/girls are though youll probably guess long before the end of the book.  Her characters are so charming and idiosyncratic thats its difficult not to love them.  The main love story continues and the cute kid reads as real rather than overly sappy.  Ruth seems like someone you know or would like to know.  Hard to put down.  By the way if you havent read all the books in this series dont worry about picking up this most recent book.

"Swift returns to his perpetual themes of loss and what its like to be different.  Oddly one of my least favorite stories in the book is England but other than that there wasnt a clunker in the book.  Most are short and he gets to his point in very few pages.  Theres an undercurrent of emotion but its restrained which makes the tales more effective.  He comes to the point slowly but it has an impact.  Most of the narrators are male but are still universally relatable.Some of the stories are dark but the violence takes place offstage so to speak or its merely implied.  War and military men are featured as well and again the violence is hinted at though the impact on their loved ones emotion of their loss or potential loss or sometimes just physical or mental damage is explicit and heartbreaking.  Along with this comes perceived betrayal.  Did the widow already have an intimate relationship with her next husband before she loses her current beloved?  Has the soon to be single woman relieved when her soldier is killed at war?  Betrayal is usually just a blind with the theme of loss having the pride of place.  Swift is wonderful at capturing a childs viewpoint as well.  He isnt a cheerful writer but hes compelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73TGSXUV407W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=110187418X#wasThisHelpful","R73TGSXUV407W","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is my first introduction to Bretts writing and while I feel he writes well I was lost despite the introductory material thats included at the beginning of the book.

"Like so many people Im in love with Morrisons writing.  What youre about to read is biased.  Morrisons style has changed in her last three books or so.  Shes gone from highly metaphorical to a more grounded, and some might say accessible, more mainstream, style*.  I like both approaches.  As always she writes about racism and how endemic it is and how grounded in economic reality it can be.  She always writes about family emotional ties and how those ties can transcend blood and race yet cant escape being tied in together.The main character is the daughter of a light skinned woman who panics when her child is born too dark.  In her mind she practices tough love in order to prepare Bride for the discrimination shell face in the world.  This is a blessing and a curse because it causes Bride to become creative in order to achieve in her career and find love.  Her name marks her as a blank slate in need of defining herself.  She finds heartbreak as well as love and success.  Ultimately, like most of us, she finds her place in the world and some happiness.  Bride moves from the perpetually standing on the cusp of fulfilling her dreams and living in partnership with others into engaging life in earnest.*I think Mercy is her last book in the older style.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25N25MEXHR8NY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307594173#wasThisHelpful","R25N25MEXHR8NY","A3EXIZWHSNVNME","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EXIZWHSNVNME?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this colander at a discount in exchange for sharing my experience with it, whether positive or negative, in a review. I've had another colander of the same size for over 20 years and thought it was time for a new one.One of the things that I liked about this one is that even though it's the same capacity as my old one, it is a little shallower. I find that easy to work with.The holes are pretty small so don't let pieces of whatever you're straining out easily. The handles and base seem very firmly attached and the metal is shiny. It looks very nice. The handles, being plastic, don't get hot.I was disappointed, though, that the handles don't appear to be rubber as advertised, or at least not what I think of as rubber. They seem like hard plastic. I think rubber would have been a little nicer to hold with wet hands. The hard plastic has some rough bumps in it -- they are small but the perfectionist in me is a little bugged by it. One of them, on the inside edge is rough enough that I think I will try to file it down.I should also mention that because it is fairly lightweight, it is easy to lift. The base is also a little taller than my previous colander, which gives it a little more room to drain into the sink.Overall I'm pretty pleased with this colander. If the handles had been a little better I would have rated it five stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JR886EBPE5GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RDFKBK#wasThisHelpful","R1JR886EBPE5GM","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free, so that I could try it out and share my experience with it -- whether positive or negative -- in a review.I actually got it for a family member's house after discovering, after a shirt lost a button, that they didn't have needle and thread to sew it back on! That's just not right -- every house should have basic sewing supplies. So I was hoping this would be good quality and would give them a complete sewing kit so they can make small repairs in the future.I was pleased to see that the kit was very complete. It actually has everything they need, plus some. It sure beats those tiny little kits -- these are actual spools of thread, rather than a short length wound around a piece of cardboard like other kits I've owned. And there is a lot more included than with other kits I've seen -- there are 18 spools of thread in various colors, and even a crochet hook and knitting needle. There are many sizes of needles and a selection of large-headed pins (easy to hold onto). There are buttons and safety pins, tape measure, and a metal thimble -- and more.I am pleased with the quality of this set and felt really good about gifting this and my family member was overjoyed with it. She couldn't get over how much was included. Glad I took a chance on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V83S1N3TYUN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015L46N96#wasThisHelpful","R3V83S1N3TYUN2","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free set of lights to try out, so I could share my experience, whether positive or negative, in a review. I'd never seen lights like this and wasn't sure what to expect, but I decided to take a chance on them.I'm glad I did. All 8 are connected together in a string. and the lights travel up and down the length of each one, changing color as the go. They way they cascade is really mesmerizing. The colors are bright and saturated.My husband was impressed by them, too, and we have put them in our front window, where they can be seen from the street and really grab attention. (We've already begun decorating for the holidays! Though they are perfect for that, they are fun for any time of year and I expect to bring them out for other occasions during the year.)I also tried them gathered together like a bouquet in a vase and they were lovely like that too.Very glad I took a chance on these and I would really like to have more, to create a string which will span an even greater length.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UTOE0808Z09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYUEMKO#wasThisHelpful","R8UTOE0808Z09","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received free socks to try out so I could share my experience -- whether positive or negative -- with them in a review. I really needed some warm new socks and hoped these would fit well and be comfy.They succeeded on the first count. My feet are size 10 and these went on easy and fit very well. They could also fit a smaller foot -- or a larger one. They have the right amount of stretch.And, they are as comfy as I'd hoped. The wool / polyester / spandex blend is very comfortable and not at all itchy. They are thick enough -- but not bulky, just right.I got hte Wave"" design.

"I received a free shaker to try out, so I could share my experience with it -- whether positive or negative -- in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect, as I hadn't heard of this company before. But I decided to take a chance because I needed a shaker of this type, and I was attracted to the design.When it arrived I was pleased to see that the colors are vibrant and the vintage-inspired graphics are cool.  It looks better in person than in the photo. And  no way does this go missing in the cupboard; it's big, bright and easy to spot.This shaker actually holds more than I need it to -- but that's certainly not a bad thing. It is a good weight, stainless steel -- thick enough to be very sturdy but not so thick that it gets to heavy with seasonings in it. The top twists smoothly on and off and the holes are a good size. It seems to have been thoughtfully designed and manufactured, and built to last.I am kind of a perfectionist and always cast a critical eye over the things I use and review -- and I always point out any issues I find and rate accordingly. I was pleasantly surprised by this shaker, though, and can't find anything not to like about it.

"I received these mailers free to try out so I could share my experience in a review, whether positive or negative. I've been selling online for about 15 years now on various sites, including my own, so I go through a lot of shipping supplies and was curious to try these.I sell items made of fabric -- vintage fabrics and trims, and occasionally clothing or scarves. This type of mailer works well for those items because:-- It's light weight and doesn't add much in postage costs.-- It's plastic so it protects from moisture / rain / snow / postal carrier's coffee, etc.-- It closes securely so protects the contents from loss or damage.-- Adhesive mailing labels stick well to them.I also use these to give extra protection to items inside a box -- so in case, for example, the postal carrier leaves the package out in the rain or snow and the box gets wet, the contents inside will be protected.I'm pretty picky about the things I use in my business, but I can't find anything not to like about these.

"I received a free set of these to try out so I could share my experience with them in a review, whether positive or negative. I wasn't sure what expect as I'd never used anything like this before and wasn't familiar with the company.The ones I received were a little darker in color than the photo here -- but that's perhaps just due to my monitor settings. The colors are still bright and very noticeable. That's good because if you use them on checked baggage, or even a carry-on, the color makes it easy to distinguish from other bags.The velcro is very strong and keeps the wrap fastened securely. I sew a little and always notice construction details on the sewn items I use -- these are well-made with straight seams and heavy-enough thread.I have tried these on a big duffel bag and also on a tote bag I use a lot with stiff plastic handles, which get uncomfortable when it's loaded. They worked well in both cases. The neoprene adds some cushioning, making them much more comfortable to hold than the bag's own handles.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and point out any issues and rate accordingly -- but couldn't find anything not to like about these. My husband and I will continue to get a lot of use out of them on our various bags when we travel, whether just for a weekend trip or farther away.

"I received a free set of these to try out, and to share my experience -- whether positive or negative -- in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect, since I hadn't used this kind of pony tail holder before and wasn't familiar with the company.I first noticed that the colors were true to the photos. There are no seams -- the ends are secured inside a faceted bead which matches the color of the pony tail holder. Each holder is spiraled. My hair is pretty straight, and very long; most pony tail holders (and barrettes) slide out after a while.These are plenty wide -- I can wind one around my hair 4 times. Unlike most other pony tail holders I've used it stayed put really well -- probably because of the spiral; it's not just smooth like a plain band. That is a big plus for me. They also don't pull my hair when I'm taking them out.The colors are good -- the set I ordered had a few bright colors, plus black, dark blue, brown, and beige -- they coordinate with just about everything in my closet. I would like to have more in the brighter colors.I can't find anything not to like about these pony tail holders -- if I had to nitpick, I guess they could be a little shorter in length -- and am very glad to have found them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIHQBOBW75ZTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PIKOU6#wasThisHelpful","RIHQBOBW75ZTB","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wasn't familiar with this brand and wasn't sure what to expect.As it turns out, I'm glad I took the chance. The tweezers are very nice quality. The pointy ones are very sharp, as they should be. And the slant-tip ones -- the style I use every day -- are very precise. I was able to get both coarse and fine hairs with them. I need to pluck daily and find that these do a really good job. I found them easy to grasp, too.I would give them five stars, but I am deducting a star for the case. It is nicely designed. But the one I received was a little grubby. The white leather outside had grey smudges on it, and the white binding had black in it (maybe smudges from the black ink from the logo that's printed on the case?).So, it doesn't look great. But the zipper is good and the elastic that holds the tweezers in works well.Overall I'm pleased to have this set.

"I received a free flashlight to try out so I could share my experience with it, whether positive or negative, in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect from it. But we live in a windy place and we can count on the power going out several times during the fall and winter months.In addition to the power going out we like to do DIY projects where we often need some extra illumination.I found that this flashlight is good for both of these purposes. The small size makes it easy to slip in a pocket (or purse, or bag). It is very compact, and takes one rechargeable battery (which is included). A charger for the battery is also included. But if you don't want to use the rechargeable battery, you can use a AA battery instead. It's nice to have the option.Though the flashlight is small, it seems very solidly built, of metal -- aluminum -- not plastic. There is nothing flimsy about it.The light is very bright -- for such a small flashlight it really throws quite a lot of light. I like that the LED light draws little power and last a long time while still being very bright.There are two other features not found in most other flashlights I own -- you can twist to focus the light on a narrower or wider area. It is also water resistant -- so if I have to go out in nasty, rainy weather (liwve north of Seattle and get a lot of that here!) I don't have to worry about if it will keep working.I always cast a critical eye over the things I use and review -- and don't hesitate to point out any issues I find and to rate accordingly -- but there's nothing I don't like about this little flashlight. I like having a powerful light that's compact enough to keep in my pocket and can be used in man situations.

Makes it easy to spot when I'm looking for it, too.I like to do DIY projects; this is so great for getting down and working on the interiors or undersides of furniture, or down below the sink.

"I received a free scarf to try out so I could, optionally, share my experience with it in a review. I hadn't heard of this company before and wasn't sure what to expect from the scarf.I usually think of silk as being very soft and smooth, but this is a little different. It is a loosely woven fabric which gives it more texture than most silk scarves. It has a very organic, natural, feel to it and is obviously handwoven rather than mass-produced. I really like that.Despite having some texture, it isn't at all scratchy; it feels really nice against skin. The ends are hand-knotted; each fringe is about 3 inches long to the tip of the tassel.I got the green scarf. The color is exquisite, with gradations from a light, fresh green to a darker hue. I'm fair skinned with pink tones to my skin and this really flatters my skin tone.

"I received this item free for a no-obligation review. I really wasn't sure what to expect from it as I've never had this type of thing before.I got the Istanbul print, which is really pretty and the colors are quite true to the picture. I live in a windy place -- and it's especially windy this time of year -- so I primarily got it to wear around my neck.There are no seams; it's seamless all the way around. I like that because there are no seams to scratch the sensitive skin on my neck, and there is no front or back. There are also no logos; it's just the print which I like a lot.The ends do roll a bit, a little annoying but not a deal breaker for me. I think it's just how this type of fabric (microfiber knit) behaves.

"I received a free sample to try out so I could share my experience with it in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect. Here's what I found.It is a heavyweight black glass jar, with the white logo (super cool logo) and the ""Dope Turtle"" name on the back.What sets this apart from other jars is its weight, and its quality. It is nicely made and perfectly smooth -- the top is nicely finished plastic, and it twists on and off with no hesitation or catching. So easy. But it also fastens really tightly.So, given how secure it is, it keeps the scent of your herb inside the jar where it belongs. No one is going to walk into the room and know what you've got in there. :-)Not only does it keep the scent from getting out -- but it also keeps light and air from getting in. Light and air will deteriorate almost anything given enough time, and plant matter is especially vulnerable. So the black color -- aside from looking good -- actually serves a function. It protects from UV rays.It's also a good size -- holds plenty!It feels substantial in the hand, too -- and the thickness of the glass makes me feel confident it's not going to break easily.

"I received a free sample to try out, so I could, optionally, share my experience with it in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never had anything quite like this before, and wasn't sure to expect from this brand, either.It is a bright green! It's a fun color but also practical because it's very easy to see in a dark purse or pack, or in the car's console.I have used a number of power banks / portable chargers before and like to keep one with me for those times when my phone's battery is running low and I'm not near an outlet or don't have time to wait for it to charge up. This has plenty of juice to charge a small device like a phone or tablet. It is compact so travels well in a bag or in the car without taking much room.But this power bank isn't like others, because it also has a light, and a humidifier. When you turn it on, the humidifier draws a little water from the small chamber near the top of the unit, and sends it out a valve on the side, ina very fine mist. Really refreshing on a summer day, or if you just feel warm and want a little refreshing spritz. It is a very fine mist so even though the water chamber is small, the water lasts quite a while. The light is blue and shines through the water. Really pretty!This is such a unique item and one that I find very useful. I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and point out any issues, and rate accordingly -- but couldn't find anything not to like about this. I've had it for almost a month now, and am really getting a lot of use out of it; it has a home in my purse right alongside my phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MQ78996IK8AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151DU9EC#wasThisHelpful","R2MQ78996IK8AF","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free so I could try it out, and share my experience in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect as I haven't used a headlamp before -- and this brand was unknown to me.It is quite adjustable to the right head size. I'd worried that it would be heavy -- but it isn't really; it didn't weigh me down. I found it quite comfortable and it stayed secure on my head.We do a lot of DIY projects and sometimes it's hard to get a regular flashlight to point just at the right place. This is great because the light shines exactly where you're looking.By spinning a ring around the light, you can also adjust it into a wide or narrow beam. And, there are 3 modes: regular light, brighter light, and flashing light.It is really good for tight spaces, and projects where your hands are occupied with something else. I wish I had had one of these years ago. I recently cleaned 2 sets of dusty old antique drawers. This allows me to see into the dark recesses, underneath the drawers to get it looking good again. I'm planning on replacing a bathroom faucet, and this is going to be helpful for seeing the plumbing under the cabinet.My husband says it's good for working on the car -- he can get a good, strong directed light under the hood where it's hard to get good lighting.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and always point out any issues, and rate accordingly -- but couldn't find anything not to like about this headlamp. It is well-made, makes my life easier and I am glad to have it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PQ0YPFCR8VSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RV6AWOU#wasThisHelpful","R3PQ0YPFCR8VSM","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free sample to try out so I could share my experience in a review. I've used many Lightning cables over the past couple years, some much better than others. I wasn't familiar with this brand and wasn't sure what to expect -- so I was curious to try it, and hoped for the best.Turns out, this works really well.It seems like I'm forever rummaging around in the car searching through our console, glove box and my purse, for my Lightning cable. This is super easy, because it's small and can just be clipped to a keychain with a lobster clasp. And it's useful not just in the car; as long as I have my keys with me I have a cable. This is such a simple solution to the problem. It takes very little room.This cable is MFi certified (I double-checked on Apple's website that it really is) meaning that it will continue to work through future iOS updates and won't eventually throw errors like the non-certified cables often do.It is well-made and charged my Apple devices quickly, no problems at all. The design is really clever and I wish I'd had one of these long ago. I'm glad I took a chance on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G8F7NDDB6T1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XXLMDHQ#wasThisHelpful","R2G8F7NDDB6T1I","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free set of headphones so I could share my experience with them in a review. I really wasn't sure what to expect as I wasn't familiar with this brand of headphones. I've used quite a few in the past and some have been better than others. I was curious to see how these would compare.Turns out, this is one of the better ones I've tried. The sound is remarkably good, especially in this price range. Most of the others I've tested are very bass-shy. Not these. Not expecting these to have much bass, I was surprised that they did. Wow.I first played one of my favorite Bob Dylan albums -- I've been listening to it for 30 years now and know every note by heart. These headphones did right by it; those notes sounded just like I expected them to. I then listened to the new albums by Prince and Janet Jackson, then Jack White, Beck, Miles Davis, Jefferson Airplane, Uncle Tupelo and the Grateful Dead. Quite a range of musical styles and it all sounded great.The sound is very clear and doesn't distort at higher volumes. Midtones and trebles are clear and true. And the bass...amazingly to me it's really good.Some attention was given to aesthetics with these, too. The red and black is very attractive, and it comes in a matching carrying case. The carrying case zippers shut to keep them protected. I also found these comfortable to wear, and to adjust. A little more padding might be nice, but that's a nitpick.I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but music is important to me and I think life is too short to listen on tinny headphones. If you are into really high-end audio gear you will probably want something else. But for the rest of us, these are an excellent pick. I always cast a critical eye (an ear!) over the items I use and review -- and point out any issues I come across and rate accordingly -- but I couldn't find anything not to like about these. They are my new favorites.Update: These sure block out a lot of sound when you have the sound cranked up. I was rocking out, while doing some housework in the entry of our home, while wearing these. My husband came through the door, slammed it, tried to talk to me -- very loudly -- (I had my back turned) and when I finally turned and saw him, I must have jumped two feet high. He said he couldn't hear what I was listening to. So they block sound pretty good both ways! :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GQDGUSRVGXFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016V277VK#wasThisHelpful","R1GQDGUSRVGXFD","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free set of these, and wasn't sure what to expect, quality-wise as it was my first experience buying knobs of this brand.When I first took them out of the box, I was confused because they didn't look clear and the edges looked indistinct. But -- then I realized that each is covered in a thin layer of protective plastic. Once I pulled that off, wow! They were crystal clear and really sparkle! And that is what I wanted. At the widest edge the cut isn't very sharp but I don't find that very noticeable. The silver finish is very good.I had two purposes in mind for these -- a small antique cabinet which I painted last summer needed new knobs. These are the right size and, I think, just the right finishing touch. Its original antique knobs had gotten chipped over the years and these are a good replacement.I also have a small wooden freestanding cabinet I use in a bathroom -- replacing the old drawer pull with one of these gave it an instant makeover. My third project was replacing the worn wooden knobs on an old maple hutch I've been meaning to refinish (in the meantime these gave it more energy). The hutch is what the photo below represents.If you have thick doors or drawers you may need to buy longer screws. Each screw is 1 inch long and will go into the knob as much as 1/4"" inch. So it is ideal for 3/4"" inch thick drawers / doors, or just slightly thicker.I am happy to have these and they worked really well for my projects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13OOI52LKVXCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GPAUS6U#wasThisHelpful","R13OOI52LKVXCJ","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently was given a free bottle of this to try out, so I could share my experience with it in a review. Honestly, it's kind of hard to review because it's hard to tell if it's working or not.But -- I ran across a web article about how most people are at least somewhat deficient in magnesium, and the symptoms of magnesium deficiency sounded very familiar to me, because I had many of them. I haven't been tested by a doctor but figured it was worth trying magnesium.As of yet I haven't seen any big changes. But I imagine I probably need to take it longer -- probably need to get through the bottle - to give it time to work. I'll give it a fair chance.The capsules are lightweight, not too big, and easy to take. (That's good because I have a hard time with big, hard pills -- and this certainly is not one of those.) They don't have a strong, obnoxious odor -- it is mild.The jury's still out on this, but given everything I've read about it I feel good about taking it and will continue to do so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N0A0PRW3X2ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSZ4PIQ#wasThisHelpful","R1N0A0PRW3X2ZF","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received the book for free, so I could share my honest opinion of it after reading it. As a web developer I've read a lot of technical books over the years and was curious to see what this one was like.I'm a longtime web developer, building sites mostly on WordPress, which runs on a database. Though I can find my way around the WordPress database, I have never really studied SQL. I don't like having that gap in my knowledge and wanted to get up to speed.The author writes pretty well and starts from the beginning, explaining what a database is. From there he explains the basics of SQL, walking the reader through the various topics using a widely available Microsoft Access sample database as an example.Honestly, the book didn't answer all my newbie-type questions and I have looked up some other resources (available online) as I try to learn this subject. But it does bill itself as a beginner's guide and at only 54 pages of text I didn't expect great depth anyway. It is, as the title suggests, a place to start and covers the topics it addresses pretty well. I found it useful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24W4DF89DLC3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1508767483#wasThisHelpful","R24W4DF89DLC3C","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free easel to try out, with no obligation, so I could relate my experience -- good or bad -- with it in a review. I make collages, and also like to display framed art and prints and own several types of easels. I was curious to try this tabletop easel out.When it arrived I was surprised at how small a size it folds to -- very compact. It could fit in a tote bag or a backpack, and also stores easily (as someone with less storage space than I would like, I appreciate that).It is fairly lightweight. So it's easily portable, if you need to take it to a show or class or presentation. I'm just using it at home for now, but it's nice to have the option.It is quite sturdy.If I were putting the easel in a situation where it would be heavily jostled I might go for a heavier duty one -- but for other purposes it works nicely. It can hold up to 5 pounds, quite a lot for its size.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and point out any issues and rate accordingly -- but I couldn't find anything not to like about this easel.

"I received a free bottle of spray to try out, so I could share my experience with it in a review. I've used two other scents of Mask before, but not this one. The first bottle we got is all but empty -- we use it almost every day -- so I was curious to try this one to see if it would be a good replacement.I didn't know what to expect from ""Santorini Breeze"" -- and have no idea if it smells like a Greek island (though I like to think it does) -- but it does smell really pleasant, and fresh and cleanAs we discovered with the other two bottles we have had, a little of this spray goes a long way. We do just 4 spritzes into the toilet bowl before, well, you know, and it forms a barrier that nothing can escape.I was skeptical but it really does work. Although I think this scent doesn't work quite as well as the other ones we've used from this company. Close, but not quite.The bottles of spray have lasted quite a long time for us. We have one in each of two bathrooms -- neither of which has really good air flow -- and it has really helped; it just keeps those nasty smells from wafting up.

"I received a free pack of these to try out so I coul share my experience in a review. I have tried other cable clips / cable dots before but not this brand, and wasn't sure what to expect.They come in a pack of six. I received two black, two blue, a green and a purple one. They are very lightweight, and unlike some others I've used, can each handle three cords.The first thing I did was stick one to my laptop. I am not crazy about the placement of the power cord on my laptop -- it's on the back on the right, and I plug it into an outlet that is to my left. So the cord often droops down or gets in the way -- and I have tripped on it more than once when I get up. I stuck a cable clip to the back of my laptop near the bottom of the cover opposite where the cord plugs in and it keeps that cord out of the way. Perfect.I also put two in my office, where charging cables tend to fall down and I have to get on my hands and knees and search for them behind the desk.Do note that the sticky mounting foam on these is not repositionable -- so be sure you have it in the right place before you put it on. (If you goof, and you have some mounting tape / foam around the house, that could easily be used, though.) I learned this the hard way.I really like these -- they are light, soft, and it is easy to get the cables in and out of them, yet they hold them snug enough to keep them in line.

"I was given a free jump rope to try out so I could share my experience with it in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect, as I wasn't familiar with this brand and was curious to see how it would perform.This is the third jump rope I've owned. The first I bought at local sporting goods store, but it turned out to be much too long (I'm 5' 5"") and not adjustable. The second looked much like this one and was adjustable, but the rope itself was a little stiff.So I was curious to try this one out, and it turns out that it was a good choice. The handles are comfortable to hold and the foam means they don't get sweaty and slip out of my hands. It is adjustable to the right length. And the rope itself is softer and more flexible than the other one I bought recently -- it straightened out pretty fast after I received it.So, after three jump ropes, we have a winner!

"I received a free diffuser to try out, so I could share my experience with it in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect as I've owned quite a few oil diffusers and some definitely work better than others.This is so easy to set up...in a nutshell, you basically fill it with water, add a few drops of essential oil, turn it on and it's good to go. If the mist is turned on, it goes continuously; you can  set a timer for increments from 30 to 180 minutes A border of lights toward the bottom can be turned on or off.I've owned this for several weeks now and have been using it in at the edge of a living room, near a bathroom; it gives a relaxing scent (I've been using lavender or green apple) and can be smelled across the room. It would be good just about anywhere, though! I love the way it smells when I pass by.Two changes that I would wish for:- A volume control, and a selection of sounds to choose from. The sounds are birds (maybe seagulls) and waves. But you can turn the sound on or off.- White. I would really prefer white over the black. Black is inconspicuous, though. But I think white is a little more cheerful.I should also mention that while you can run it for quite a long time, it doesn't take as much space as other diffusers I've used. So, it's good for those of us who are pressed for space, as I am.I am glad to have this diffuser and will be getting lots more use out of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ITTI9DCYJRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9JPYJ0#wasThisHelpful","R5ITTI9DCYJRZ","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free keyboard to test out and to review. As a web developer, I've used a few Bluetooth keyboards before and was curious to see how this one would compare.I like to use a keyboard with my tablet -- not always -- but depending on what I'm doing, it can be easier. So I got this to use with the tablet; it is the perfect size for that. I do prefer a full-size keyboard but when I'm working on a tablet this is the size I want. It is comfortable to use, and pretty quiet, too. They keys are very responsive.It paired super fast with my Kindle HD 8.9"" -- I was up and running in a few seconds.Backlighting isn't a necessity, but it is nice. Sometimes I'm working in low light conditions and it really helps me to see what I'm doing. And, of course, it looks cool!The ability to choose the light color is great -- though I usually just have it set on a favorite color. To change the color you hold down the key with a lightbulb icon on it, and move the up or down key. It's really easy.Though it is pretty light weight, it certainly doesn't feel flimsy -- and it seems well-built, with no construction issues. It is easy to carry in a laptop bag or backpack without adding a lot of bulk or weight.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and always point out any issues I discover, and rate accordingly -- but I couldn't find anything not to like about this keyboard.

I wasn't sure what to expect -- I've had a lot of tea strainers over the years, but this design was new to me. I was curious to see how it would compare to others I've used.It's stainless steel a polished, shiny finish. The lid twists off and on. It is lightweight but sturdy; It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy like others I've used.This one is also notable because it has a flat bottom and sits at the bottom of the cup. This is great because all the tea stays submerged.The holes are very small so it gives a nice clear cup of tea without leaking loose bits of tea into the cup. It holds plenty enough for a cup of tea with room to spare.It also washes up well. Being stainless steel, it can go in the dishwasher but I find it easier to just give it a good rinse under the kitchen faucet.I have tea strainers which are cuter than this -- but this one sets itself apart because of its thoughtful design; it gives me great cup of tea.

"I received a free set of these so I could try them out, then share my experience in a review. I have owned a lot of string lights over the years but hadn't had any by this company so wasn't sure what to expect and was curious to try them.The rattan lights are so pretty. They are about an inch and a half across. Half are a creamy white and the other half are a deep reddish brown.The light is beautiful as it shines through them; it is just warm and something about it just reminds me of fall. Though they could easily be used any time of year I'm thinking about incorporating them into my Thanksgiving decorations later this month.There is also a bonus string of teardrop shaped lights, made of bright gold mesh. These are so pretty! There are only 10 lights -- but the length makes it perfect for winding around a smaller wreath, around a small mirror, or to decorate a table or mantel. I'm using them on a table in the entry to my home and it just looks so festive when you walk in! It also occurred to me that they would be good in my office, where I have little space but still like to have a few decorations for the holidays.But these aren't holiday lights, per se -- they can certainly be used anytime.

"I received a free meter to try out, and to share my experience with it in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect, as I hadn't heard of one of these before. But we have a few houseplants -- and several outdoor plants in pots -- but it's sometimes hard to know if we're watering them enough, or too much.

I don't know what I was expecting -- maybe to have to wait a minute -- but it registered immediately. That plant, an African violet, was in the clear. So we moved on to a cactus (didn't need water). Everything we tried it on, it registered how we expected it to.And then, we tried it on a problem plant, a tiny seedling we've been trying to grow indoors (a souvenir of a recent road trip to the redwoods). We have done that successfully before with a similar seedling, which grew to over 5 feet tall -- but this one just didn't seem to thrive. Despite our best efforts, it hasn't looked very healthy lately. This meter showed us why. We didn't realize how much we were over-watering it! Every day this meter showed that the soil was absolutely saturated, even when we hadn't watered it every day. We have backed off on watering it -- checking every day or two with the meter -- and it's looking a little better. Very happy about that!On the back of the package are lists of the moisture levels for various plants -- so if they are under the stated levels they should be watered -- and if they are over the level you should back off a little bit.

"I received a free sample to try out and review. I wasn't sure what to expect, as this brand is new to me. My husband and I like chai a lot, often order it out, and occasionally make it at home. When we make it at home, we usually get Oregon Chai, which is a liquid in a carton. This was our first time making it ourselves from loose tea.When we opened up the package -- which was a little bigger than I expected -- it smelled wonderful, very rich. Before brewing, we shook the package a bit to make sure the spices were mixed in pretty evenly.Afterward, we mixed the brewed tea with a little milk. I loved the way it tasted -- mild but still unmistakably the flavors I've come to associate with chai over the years. You can vary the time the tea is steeped, and/or the amount of milk used, to get a stronger taste if you like. I've tried it a few ways and found a combination that I like very much.Something I haven't seen on other teas -- the bag even has the date that the tea was harvested (a few months ago).I like being able to make real chai at home, without resorting to the premixed liquid stuff! And I love that this is the real deal, imported right from India using an ages-old recipe. Overall we like this tea very much and would happily buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27TH577LOBAVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q6FM6GY#wasThisHelpful","R27TH577LOBAVH","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free shower head to try out so I could share my experience with it in a review. I hadn't heard of this company before and wasn't sure what to expect.I got this to replace a 10-year old shower head which had finally begun to leak. Even the hose had begun to leak! So I was looking for a new one.The pieces screwed together in just a couple minutes. But I ran into an issue with the mount. I didn't realize, when ordering, that the mount has to be permanently screwed into the wall. I had a few problems with that concept:1. The mount doesn't look all that heavy duty -- what happens when it wears out (as I'm sure it will after a while) and I'm left with holes in the wall? Other shower heads we've had have screwed right into the shower plumbing that comes out from the wall.2. We have a fiberglass shower enclosure and I am not comfortable with drilling holes in it.I do like that the mount swivels to adjust the angle -- but unfortunately in our situation I'm unable to use it.When I put this in our existing mount (for our Delta handheld shower head, which needs to be replaced), it didn't really hold it at quite the right angle.The shower head itself is nice looking, a very clean combination of white and chrome. Looks clean and contemporary. And, it screwed  onto the hose easily. Though I can't comment on durability, it seems well made.It only has one setting, as opposed to my old shower head that had 7, but Purelux does sell a 3-function shower head which is a nice option to have.This didn't really work out for me but if you have a shower where you can screw a mount into the wall and need only one spray function it may work for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98OAOHSU55Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012O5TLXK#wasThisHelpful","R98OAOHSU55Q3","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free set of lights to try out and share my experience in a review. I've owned many string lights over the years but none by this company, so wasn't certain what to expect and was curious to try them.The lights are a warm color, and the way they shine through the creamy white rattan balls is so pretty. They are about two inches across.They could easily be used any time of year but they really light up a dim fall day. I already have them decorating a table in my living room -- and they are also going to look great during the holidaysThere is also a bonus string of pierced round silver lights They are silver and very shiny -- and unlike any lights I've seen before, they have jingle bells in them. I think they would be perfect wrapped around a wreath on a door so they jingle when it's opened There are only 10 lights but the short length makes it perfect for a 10 or 12-inch diameter wreath, or to decorate a small display or centerpiece. (And my husband had the idea to drape them around his neck when we go to the local annual Christmas parade!)Each set takes AA batteries -- the small set takes 2, and the rattan set takes 3. The silver ones have a constant light, but the rattan lights can either shine constant or flashing lights.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use in my home, and review -- and point out any problems I encounter, and rate accordingly -- but there's just nothing I don't like about either of these sets.

"I was given one of these lights to try out so I could share my experience with it in a review, without obligation. I'd never seen anything like it before and wasn't sure what to expect.Now that I have it, I'm charmed by it. It comes nicely boxed with an instruction sheet - but it's so simple instructions aren't really needed. If it's off, touch it once and it comes on at a low level; touch it again and it glows a little brighter.It is ideal for keeping at the bedside, because it comes on with just a light touch. It's easy for a small child to do -- or an adult -- or even someone who is ill. You barely need touch it and there's the little bird lighting up the night.The light is meant mostly for children, but I'm a middle-aged woman and just want to keep it for myself. :-)It's also easy to carry with you if you want to use it as a lantern; there is a little white hook on top and it doesn't weigh much. A child can easily carry it.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and point out any issues I discover, and rate accordingly -- but I can't find anything not to like about this light. My family finds it quite charming.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SX69RE84EYV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Z95Q86#wasThisHelpful","R3SX69RE84EYV2","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a free light to try out so I could share my experience with it in a review. I wasn't sure what to expect as I've never had a clip-on LED light before and wasn't really familiar with this company either. I've had it for a couple weeks now, and here's what I found.When it arrived I was pleased to say that it was in a really nice box. Not a big deal, but it does show some care and attention to detail. (And it is appropriate for gift giving).The back of the base slides off so you can insert AAA batteries. Up top, there is an on/off -- low --- high switch. I like that it has two brightness settings. At night when it's dim, often I don't want to wake myself up so ""low"" is what I want. But ""high"" is good for when I plan to stay up reading in low light for a long time.The neck is flexible so you can put it in whatever position you like. The base slid securely onto my Kindle HD 8.9"" and also onto my new Acer laptop. (See the photos.) It slides on and off easily but stays pretty secure when it's on due to a little rubber on the inside surfaces.It isn't an overwhelming amount of light but just enough for some extra illumination, to shed a little light on whatever you're doing. The lighting in our house isn't ideal and I really like to haveThough I haven't had it a real long time, and can't speak to battery life yet, I do like that these are LED lights so draw little power and should last a good long time. The construction of this little light is pretty solid too.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and point out any issues I discover, and rate accordingly -- but this is a nice little light and I just can't find anything not to like about it.

"I was given a free pair of thest to test out. I've used quite a few Bluetooth earphones by now, and was curious to see how these would compare.Though they look a little large, they actually fit on my ears fine without falling out and without hurting them as some others have done in the past.The visual design of these is very nice -- the black plastic is faceted. Because of this detail I think these may appeal more to women than men. (I'm a woman and like it.)But, how do they sound? Well, pretty good. Like most Bluetooth earphones in this price range, they are a little bass-shy, with better treble and midtones. But I don't necessarily need a very deep, booming bass directly in my ears either, so it is OK -- and not a major factor anyway with most of the music I listen to. These sounded great with jazz playing over them; I also listened to some singer-songwriter tunes, and a little classic rock. Overall I was pretty pleased.These are beautifully packaged (so, quite giftable) and also come with a velveteen drawstring bag for storage.

"I received these free to try out so I could share my experience in a review. After years of using cheapie drugstore tweezers, for the past few months I've been on a quest to find the perfect tweezers, so I was curious to try these.The case is good, as it keeps them from getting knocked around and potentially damaged in my already too-full bathroom drawer. It's a soft black faux leather.The pointy one is meant for ingrown hairs and I haven't had occasion to use it. The flat-tipped tweezers are all right but this style isn't my favorite because it isn't precise enough for fine work. They will grip several hairs at once if that's your goal (beware of catching skin though).The slant-tip tweezers are fine.

"I received a free foot massager roller to try out, so I could share my experience with it in a review. I almost declined it, as I was a little skeptical that it would work. But my curiosity won out, because I have recurrent nerve issues (numbness and tingling) in my feet -- and my husband is on his feet a lot at his job and comes home with feet in need of a little TLC. We have had it for almost a month.This massager is well-sized. It is wide enough for even wide feet and the nubs are sized to be effective but not uncomfortable. On one end the nubs are larger which is great for massaging aching heels. If you don't want those on your heels you can turn it around so that roller faces the front where it is easy to avoid altogether.I really felt this more than I thought I would. I have recurring issues with numbness and tingling in my feet (I don't know what causes it -- but it's not diabetes) -- and that had been going on for a couple months when I first tried this massager.I actually noticed somewhat of a difference -- noticeable but not huge -- after using this the first time. Now, I don't know if that was just a coincidence, but maybe stimulating the nerves in my feet was helpful. Since I have been using it (which, admittedly, is not every day) I have noticed some gradual improvement. Again, I don't know if it's due to the massager, or just natural (as these foot nerve systems tend to come and go for me).But at the very least it sure feels great. It is stimulating and relaxing at the same time. You can control how intense it is by how hard you press your feet on the rollers (or if you wear socks or not).My husband has been using it occasionally to massage his aching feet and just likes the way it feels, especially on the balls of his feet.I should also note that this is made of solid wood, and is well made with no splinters or other issues. It doesn't feel at all cheap; care has obviously been made in its construction and I expect it will last a long time.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and always point out any isuses I discover and rate accordingly -- but really can't find anything not to like about this foot massager. While it hasn't worked miracles for us, we have definitely experienced some benefits, and I am glad that after my initial hesitation, that I took a chance on it.Overall, we are really pleased with this massager.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VMM43OUL8VEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SMJIYNG#wasThisHelpful","R1VMM43OUL8VEA","A1AQTH32IQ5JM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AQTH32IQ5JM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free diffuser to use so I could share my experience with it in a review, with no obligation. This was my first time using one and I was curious to try it out.This diffuser creates a nice soft light, which is so useful in particular situations.

Having a diffuser like this allows you to manipulate the light and shadows for better photos.It is very lightweight and pretty compact, so fits in a camera bag easily. It folds flat, and has its own soft case (which adds almost no bulk). The zipper on the case works fine. All the pieces are made from lightweight nylon (I think it is nylon).

"I received a free laptop cooling stand to try out and to share my experiences in a review. I wasn't familiar with this company or its products before, so was curious as to how it would work.I have an older HP laptop that gets insanely hot. It actually caused a big red spot on my leg from using it on my lap! And sometimes it gets so hot that it just shuts itself down without warning. That is so annoying. So I hoped that this would help.It does. The four fans keep the laptop from overheating. And the bottom of the laptop isn't in contact with my leg so no possibility of it affecting my skin. The stand doesn't weigh much and is comfortable on my lap; keeps both me and my laptop from overheating.It also has a wicked design!

"I received a free set to use so I could share my experience with it in a review. I have used a lot of chalk markers over the past year but hadn't heard of this brand before. So I was curious to give them a try.I use chalk markers on windows to decorate for holidays, to cheer on our fave sports teams -- and also sometimes to leave messages on the mirror.Most of the chalk marker sets I've used have six or eight markers -- this one has ten. It is great to have the additional colors. Bright colors are always great, but this one also has black and brown -- which are so useful! The only other thing I would wish for is a deeper blue (like a navy or medium blue).These are easy to start, and the color is excellent. The color flows really easily.I like that they have a reversible nib. And they have something  I haven't seen in other sets -- 2 extra nibs.

"I received a free set of these to try out, so I could share my honest experience in a review.  We like tea at our house and have quite a variety of tea infusers, some which we like better than others. So I was curious to try these out -- I haven't had silicone tea infusers before and wasn't familiar with this company, either. Here's what I found.The halves pull apart easily and the opening is wide enough that it's easy to get the tea into them.I found that when I set it in a mug with a wall of standard thickness, they sit far enough up that the water doesn't cover all the holes. But I don't need to fill it up with tea to the top of the holes anyway. With a thin-walled tea cup, they sit down a little farther (because of the thin edge, the cup goes all the way into their armpits).It looks like a happy little guy dangling his lower half into a hot tub. Too cute. My husband thinks they are fun, too. This is not a necessary item -- but sure does inject a little fun into something that's usually just functional.They wash up well, too -- still look like new.

"I received a free light so I could use and review it. Though I've had solar lights before, this was my first experience with this brand, and wasn't sure what to expect. Here's what I found.When it arrived, I was surprised at how small it is -- but it does shed a lot of light.

"I received a free ring to try and review. The whole concept of silicone rings is pretty new to me -- so I was curious to see what this ring would be like. I admit, I was a little skeptical.I ordered the camo ring in a size 9. It arrived in a ring box, a nice touch. I noticed that the edges are really nicely rounded -- and it fits exactly like a size 9 should. It is comfortable on my hand, too -- not too thick or bulky It moves with my finger, it doesn't constrict it.I got the camo color, which is a soft blending of white, green, and brown. It is maybe a little more casual than the rings which are one solid color.I always cast a critical eye over the items I use and review -- and always point out any issues I discover, and rate accordingly -- but I couldn't find anything not to like about this ring.

"I've heard a lot about the benefits of turmeric / curcumin for quite a long time now and a few months ago tried it for the first time. My husband and I have been taking other antioxidants (especially resveratrol) and anti-inflammatories, and I appreciate that about turmeric too. But it's also been claimed that turmeric helps protect against cancer and heart disease, and even possibly Alzheimer's.I'm certainly no doctor and only know what I've read on some websites; it's not definitive.But heart disease and cancer run in my family, and I am interested in reducing my cholesterol. I have the beginnings of arthritis and have some other inflammation issues which I really want to get under control. So I began taking it last summer.I've been experimenting with different turmeric supplements. But this was my first experience with this particular brand. I was drawn to it because it includes bioperine (black pepper extract) which makes it easier to absorb.I found the capsules easy to take. They are pretty light and go down easy for me, which is a good thing because I have a difficult time with big hard pills (and this isn't one of those). Unlike other turmerics I've had this one also has black pepper extract which makes the turmeric more easily absorbed.Like many other supplements, I don't have hard evidence that this is working. But I feel good about taking it and will continue to do so.I received a free bottle to try out, and so I could leave a no-obligation review afterwards.

"I received a free money belt to use so I could share my experience with it in a no-obligation review. I have had a money belt before but was unfamiliar with this brand and wasn't sure how it would compare.It's not like those old fanny packs from days gone by -- while it is also compact, it's got a low profile. No one need ever know you're wearing it. It is an unobtrusive way to take money, phone, and other essentials with me when taking a purse is impractical.My husband and I like to take walks in the woods near where we live, and on the beach. I don't want to lug a big purse with me but still want to take some things along. and also on the beach. This is what I need.It is very adjustable and fits my size 14 waist just fine. The pouch itself is nicely designed with quality zippers. Both compartments have plenty of space, for money, phone, comb, etc. I like having more than once compartment so money can be kept separate. The mesh on the back is breathable and soft on the skin.I'm more or less a perfectionist and sew a little, so always notice how well sewn things are stitched. This is well made, with quality materials and thread. Due to its construction it appears it will live a long time.I'll continue to get a lot of use out of this for walks and longer trips, too.

"I received a free wig for a no-obligation review. I don't often wear wigs, but have toyed with the thought so this was a good opportunity to try one out.I got a blonde color which is a lot of fun because I'm a brunette and haven't actually been blonde since college. The color was a rich blonde which I found really attractive. The length is great -- most of the way down my back (much like my real hair). The bangs were kind of heavy, but after styling them a bit I decided I liked them.The cap is adjustable -- around the bottom are little ribbons sewn in, and hooks that you can hook into them to adjust the sizing.

"I was sent a free squeezer to use and review so I could share my honest experience with it in a review. I was curious to try it out and see how it worked.In case you're wondering how it works -- you cut your lemon or lime in half, then put the flat side down (counter-intuitive, isn't it!) over the strainer side. As you squeeze the handles together, the fruit gets turned inside out into the bottom of the strainer, pushing the juice out.I found the handles pretty easy to grip and to squeeze together. It is sized for a lime or a smaller lemon. It's really too small for some of the very large lemons we get (but we tend to slice those, anyway). For the smaller lemon or lime, it works great -- and is sized just right for cuties or clementines and those sort of smaller citrus fruits, too.Citrus season is fast approaching and though I'm using this for lemons and limes now, I'll be getting more use out of it as the smaller orange-type fruits fill the grocery stores.The stainless steel is shiny, and the squeezer seems very solidly made; given its construcitonn, I would be very surprised not to get many years of use out of it. I'm glad to add this to the gadget drawer in my kitchen and am kind of wondering how I ever did without it.

"Spectacular television!  Hands down, the best show we've seen in years -- a heady mix of reality, history and gripping fictional narrative.  Don't be put off by subtitles.  There is absolutely zero degradation in the enjoyment factor from the show being presented in German.  What you get is 100% authenticity.Granted, I'm a total sucker for East Germany/Stasi/country-in-a-bubble-and-on-the-brink tales.  I'm of the opinion that The Lives Of Others is one of The Top Five Movies of All-Time.  I eat up books like Red Love: The Story of an East German Family and Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall. But take that history and mix it together with Golden Age of Television alchemy from co-creators  Anna Winger & Jrg Winger? Magic.  The high point: Northern Wedding, the 4th episode.  You'll never see anything better.There's so many good performances it seems ridiculous to list them all.  I'll just give one special shout-out to Sylvester Groth as Stasi manager Walter Schweppenstette.  Just so good.  There's one wordless scene that summed it up for me -- he's watching a show featuring this East German band of ersatz western rockers & does this small little jig in his office.  Just the brilliance to pull that off.  It conveyed so much about his character.Plus, let's not forget about the soundtrack.  It's an absolute blast.  The team that curated it deserves an award alone for good taste.  And that starts with the selection of Peter Schilling's under-rated classic ""Major Tom (Coming Home)"" that is draped over crackling good opening credits that reek of 1983.  You'll want to breathe deep to gather it all in.  if you told me I could watch an hour of those credits on a loop, it'd pay to go see it.What's next, Anna and Jrg?

"Brilliant work -- ought to be required reading.  Starting with the small, beleaguered, now-downtrodden town of Portsmouth, Ohio, author Sam Quinones weaves a tale of dual scourges: over-prescribed Oxycontin and low-priced black tar heroin. The first rising from the East, the second from the West, they meet in the middle of the country in towns like Portsmouth and Columbus and simply take out communities en masse.Quinones tells his tale with a novelist's flair for narrative and an investigative reporter's eye and nose for a firecracker of a story.  In addition to the sordid tale on the streets where most of the disspiriting events play out, he takes us inside the corporate roots and strategies of Purdue Pharma (producer of Oxycontin) and hills and villages of Xalisco, Mexico (where black tar heroin is cultivated and distributed).  One fascinating part is when the Law of Unintended Consequences plays in a slow-motion car wreck: when federal authorities step in to make Purdue reformulate its product (to address the full, rapid release that comes from crushing the pills), vast swathes switch to the Xalisco-sourced product.  The results are not pretty.Despite the soul-sucking subject matter, 'Dreamland' a rollicking good read.  I learned so much from reading this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11T2J4RPFBT3X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJZVD52#wasThisHelpful","R11T2J4RPFBT3X","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Ugly Game"" recounts the feverish efforts of The Sunday Times' investigative journalists Heidi Blake and Jonathan Calvert to piece together the tale of Qatar's successful efforts to buy the World Cup for its country in 2022.  Provided safe-room access to a mountain of electronic data by a still confidential source, the veteran duo go into a bunker for months sequestered from family, friends and co-workers.  The goal: assemble this almost insurmountable trove of firsthand documents into a blockbuster narrative. The Sunday Times aims to publish just before FIFA-dom assembles in Sao Paulo for the self-congratulatory circle jerk that was WC 2014.  Mission accomplished: when the story hits the press on June 1, 2014, the authors report that they ""felt like they had detonated a nuclear bomb from [our] dark little cluttered bunker in this anonymous British suburb.""The book's hero/anti-hero is Mohammed bin Hammam, the Qatari business magnate and long-time FIFA ExCo member. He's a classic behind-the-scenes fixer/facilitator.  Never fully acknowledged by the Qatari ruling family that spearheaded the bid, it was bin Hammam's largesse, wiles, indefatigable spirit and  -- most importantly -- understanding of the way inside an ExCo members' hearts (and there's only one way) that won the day.As I write this review, news has surfaced -- knock me over with a feather -- of Germany's bribes to secure the 2006 World Cup.  Blake & Calvert also pack in other well-known tales: that South Africa out-largessed Morocco to secure 2010; that Russia used its oil wealth and oligarchic class do to the same for 2018 rights; and that Qatar knew the score and simply resolved to outpace the other bidders on this same metric to lockdown 2022.As the authors conclude (referring to the thoughts of a confidential source:) 'As far as he was concerned, Qatar had secured the 2022 tournament simply by playing the corrupt FIFA system, and who could blame them? What Qatar did, he said, was they excessively applied the rules of FIFA. They always did that. What they did was the way in FIFA. They were playing by FIFAs unofficial rules.The most delicious part of the book: reading the parts about the duplicitous, scheming, supremely machiavellian Sepp Blatter and -- instead of experiencing a sense of rage and swallowing a mouthful of bile -- smiling with the knowledge that great American Loretta Lynch and her federal counterparts in Switzerland have taken the measure of this almost comical villain. [You can just about picture him stroking his pet cat in his secret lair on these pages.]The book concludes right before Lynch launches her first dramatic strike.  When Blatter's hall-of-mirrors, pious performance gets to be too much, Blake quotes herself as saying ""This is too ridiculous for words...[t]he man has become some sort of ludicrous parody of a dodgy dictator clinging to power.""  The authors then write that 'It would have been funny if it wasnt so deeply insulting.' Indeed.  But knowing what comes next makes this book oh so satisfying.  The Ethics Committee -- a body of Blatter's own disingenuous making -- has hoisted the boss on his own petard.Every fan of football needs to read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13SEBAX80EX0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501131494#wasThisHelpful","R13SEBAX80EX0Z","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We came here after 'Srugim' and 'A Touch Away.' We needed something lighter after the emotional body blows delivered by the devastatingly sublime 'A Touch Away.'  'Like a Fish Out of Water' delivered the goods.I'm surprised the creators didn't make a short mini-series out of this concept. Its' a delightful tale of Israeli assimilation featuring Tal Lifshitz, a classic Israeli beauty, as unmarried Anat, and Esteban Gottfried, as good-hearted Argentine immigrant Marcelo, a most unlikely and unexpected suitor.  It's got the usual rom-com tropes -- their unplanned first meeting, her initial distaste, his unflagging spirit, her seeing through his ungainliness and language barrier, her long-suffering parents (oh, the burden of an unmarried daughter).There's kind of an in-joke here: Ms. Lifshitz is a casting director by profession (IMDB notes she played that role in the production of ""BeTipul"" or ""In Therapy"" as you would know it, the Israeli show that started the great wave of Israeli-inspired imports).  For ""Fish Out of Water,"" I imagine a scene in which the showrunners say ""Get me Ayelet Zurer!"" Failing that, they look at Ms. Lifshitz and an idea springs into their head ""Hey, Tal..."" Indeed, she's every bit the beauty of the Ice Princess.  The in-joke's extended further when you watch a plot unfold that includes casting agents, Marcelo's struggle to get roles (mostly due to his work-in-progress Hebrew) and Anat's assistance with his read-throughs.  This is art imitating life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AL2HNOXFOFQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D54N0X2#wasThisHelpful","R1AL2HNOXFOFQB","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Deep Down Dark' is a spellbinding tale, woven intricately and expertly by Hctor Tobar.  His first triumph was to win the confidence of ""Los 33"" and earn the right to tell their official story.

"Kingpin is a rollicking good read made even more enjoyable by the author's scrupulous attention to detail.  I work in the payment card industry and can attest that Kevin Poulsen gets all the facts right when he lays out nuances of things like how the Card Verification Value ('CVV') and CVV2 work as well their benefits and shortcomings.  He also gives a spot-on discourse on EMV towards the tail-end of the book.  I can only assume that his discussions of other aspects of the carder underground are equally redolent in good scholarship.  As testament to that assertion, you need look no further than the enthusiastic review by hacker extraordinaire Kevin Mitnick, which you'll find as a spotlight review on these pages.Another thing that makes this book work: the inherent likability of its protagonist, Max Butler, aka, Max Vision.  Nefarious financial crimes aside, the reader is left with the distinct feeling that the author likes his subject.  He certainly respects his hacking skills and audacity.  And what Butler pulls off on these pages is nothing but breathtakingly audacious.  That likability shows off at the end, too: even Max's hunters -- expecting a dark, vile character -- are struck by just how taken they are with him.

"God's Slave (""Esclavo de Dios"") is another compelling release from the good people at Film Movement.  The film's inclusion into that series is no doubt down to the rising talent that is director Joel Novoa.  His fingerprints are all over this film.  It's a surging, driving, building piece of work.  At 90 minutes, it plays out more like a taut, well-crafted TV movie than a feature film.The film hopscotches around the globe: its first scenes are set amorphously in the Middle East; a few decades pass and sleeper agent Admed (an excellent Mohammed Alkhaldi) is embedded in Caracas; a few years later, Ahmed's call to duty comes and he's shipped to Buenos Aires.  This befits the production of the film itself: co-Venezuelan/Argentine by heritage, its star a Caraquenian of Middle Eastern descent.What's most interesting: Fernando Butazzoni's script fashions a story around the real-life bombings of the Israeli embassy and AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires (1992, 1994 respectively).  It does this in an oblique manner, but it uses those events to craft its movie as a fictional backstory.  It's a fascinating technique.Along those same lines, the other part of the film shadows actor Vando Villamil as investigator David Goldberg.  It's never quite said overtly, but Goldberg is Mossad 'boots on the ground' in B.A.  As he tracks down threats, the sleeplessness and obsession starkly etch themselves on his face, frame and broken homelife.  It's not paranoia that has him that way. Reality does.This is a director to watch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIL4KWA82Z7A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ38LRI#wasThisHelpful","RXIL4KWA82Z7A","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't recommend Lev Golinkin's memoir highly enough. It's a beautifully told story, one that carries extra resonance these days with a new generation of refugees making their way across Europe.The book starts taking readers through Golinkin's family's brutal upbringing in Kharkov, Ukraine.  Belittled, berated and objectified with hatred, Golinkin's family has its Jewishness almost literally beaten out of them.  As Golinkin writes:""The reminders of being a zhid still came, at school and in the yard, but over time something else began to creep up on me, in addition to the fear. I considered the bullies lucky: they only had to see me once in a while; I had to live with myself every day. I envied them.""By the time they left -- along with tens of thousands of other Soviet Jews during a brief window of Glasnost-produced loosening -- it wasn't religious freedom that Golinkin and family sought:""What my family and many families like mine desired was peace of mind, not a synagogue. We wanted freedom, the freedom to live our lives without trembling, and naturally we, like our innumerable predecessors, cast our gaze across the Atlantic.""This skillfully produced and assembled work has four main parts: the family's life in Kharkov; their journey to America (could be a movie in itself -- indeed, its indelible images are seared into Golinkin's mind's eye for the next two decades); Lev's upbringing in America (I loved his passages about Boston College to whom he seems truly indebted and grateful); and a subsequent trip made back through Europe 17 years after his seminal initial passage.  It's that last part that gets to the emotional core of the book: he goes back and tracks down all the people that played a part in making that trip a reality and thanks them.  It's a beautiful thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCEVFL7MPL9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537778#wasThisHelpful","R2UCEVFL7MPL9K","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The excellent, heartrending movie springs from the singular vision of writer/director, Rama Burshtein.  One of the few devoutly Orthodox women making films today, Ms. Burshtein brings a unique perspective to this project.  Her deep, rich understanding of this community shows in every frame.  Her camera shows us all the small rituals, all the social interactions and all the layers of complexity and meaning that make up this devout corner of Judaism.Hadas Yaron - a secular Jew in real life - does a wonderful job here portraying the frum, flowering sister.  There's an important age gap here between Ms. Yaron's Shira and older sister Esther (the choreographer Renana Raz doing one of her occasional screen turns).  Esther is the beautiful older sister (""The most beautiful person in the world"" as an adoring Shira refers to her at one point), Shira always the notably younger ""little sister.""  These dynamics are important because when tragedy befalls Esther, our little duckling Shira is slowly thrust into a role that at first seems very unsuited for her.  Neither she nor the audience can at first accept her as Esther's replacement.I loved the casting here. Irit Sheleg and Chayim Sharir are superb as parents Rivka and Aharon.  They are bulwarks of the community and love both of their daughters equally.  [Wow, I just learned that Ms. Sheleg is Dana Ivgy's mom, WHAAAAT??]  The amazing Purim scene -- with Sharir literally heading the table and Sheleg looking on in the background and basically running the books...that scene alone -- an incredibly deep, rich dive into tradition -- is worth the price of admission in this movie.  It's a superb piece of filmmaking from Rama Burshtein.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPN5VA0V3UXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESJ0EDW#wasThisHelpful","RGPN5VA0V3UXH","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first full-length feature from writer/director Talya Lavie presents a unique take on conscripted service into the IDF from a female perspective. The result is a Heller-esque tale replete with absurdities and inanities of military servitude.  It took a woman to tell this story.  Unlike other military movies, this one is almost entirely female - other than two smaller parts that come to mind, girls rule here.Lavie's script stitches together three loosely connected tales: ""01: The Replacement""; ""02: The Virgin"" and ""03: The Commander"". The constant in the three stories is the presence of Dana Ivgy as Zohar. Ms. Ivgy is a personal favorite dating back to Broken Wings. She's a great actress and an arresting on screen presence even when dressing down or meant to be bristly and difficult like she is here.  Ivgy shines brightest in Lavie's 2nd story as the title character.The movie' surprise, though, is Nelly Tagar as Daffi.  She plays a big part in the first story, ostensibly training her replacement as she angles for reassignment in Tel Aviv. Tagar is a naturally gifted physical comedienne with fun, expressive eyes.  Her ability to cry on contact plays a big part in the story and to watch her to do it with aplomb -- and have you chuckle at the results -- is a real treat.  I was saddened to see her not appear n the second tale, but excited to see her return in the third and finale story, whose title -- The Commander -- is a neat little head fake from Lavie.The third star turn in the film is that of Shani Klein as Rama, a commander and boss to Zohar and Daffi.  I really liked Ms. Klein in this role.  Her Rama is a thin sheen of bluster with a sensitive core underneath. Zohar doesn't see it, but the audience can.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DO7A25FLHPV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCXFJDE#wasThisHelpful","R3DO7A25FLHPV4","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of Lawrence Wright's work.  I loved ""The Looming Tower"" and ""Going Clear.""  This memoir was re-published in 2013, twenty years after its initial publication.  Wright mentioned the book during a fascinating appearance on Alec Baldwin's podcast, ""Here's the Thing.""""In the New World"" held special fascination to me because he grew up in East Dallas no less than five miles from where we live.  His passages on the Kennedy Assassination and Dallas' heavy burden ring true.  If those parts of the Wright's book held you in thrall, I recommend you to Dallas 1963 by Bill Minutaglio and Steven L. Davis.Other favorite parts of the book: Wright's time at Tulane (50-yard-line memories...& you still owe Dionne Warwick $20, Larry); his period teaching in Egypt; his reminiscences of Watergate's effect on the country; and a nuanced look at Jimmy Carter, the first leader Wright thinks of as ""My President.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MVCB765HLJSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345802950#wasThisHelpful","R3MVCB765HLJSV","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"'Last Tango' is one of my favorite shows - it takes a stumble at the outset of Season 3 but ultimately wins out thanks again to the writing prowess of series creator and workhorse Sally Wainwright (she's written all 18 episodes to date) and the show's power axis: the dynamic duo of Sarah Lancashire  (Caroline) and Nicola Walker (Gillian). These two are joined through the late-in-life union of their respectively widowed parent (Caroline's Mom + Gillian's Dad).As first conceived, the show was about those two - Derek Jacobi's Alan and Anne Reid's Celia.  Now though, the series clearly flows through the daughters.  Wainwright''s talent is that she gives her characters big, meaty one-on-ones.  No quick-hit, made-for-TV fluff here.  When Caroline and Gillian talk, it goes on.  And on and on - often seven or eight minutes of riveting conversation.  Both have a lot to deal with in Season 3 - Caroline, alas, has to deal with a tragic loss (frankly, I thought this was a cheap trick by Wainwright -- too soap opera-y and out of character with the tone of the rest of the show). Her acting has been been better.Gillian, meanwhile, prepares for her wedding with Robbie -- a decision covered in decades of complexity, backstory and emotional entanglement Short story: Robbie is the brother of Gillian's ex, Eddie, now deceased...in Season 3 we get additional layers of information about Eddie's treatment of Gillian and Robbie's implicit knowledge of what was happening.  A lot of this information starts tumbling out as the wedding hurtles near.  How Gillian acts out is  among this season's highlights.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PW45PTZZBWVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010LJMA4S#wasThisHelpful","R3PW45PTZZBWVK","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This brilliant show is scandalously under-reviewed on these pages. I love Israeli movies and Israeli TV.  I've seen heaps of it.  It's a country that punches far above its weight when it comes to quality productions.  [Ask the showrunners for Homeland, In Treatment and Hostages, among the various worldwide adaptations of Israeli product.] But believe me when I tell you that nothing can prepare you for power of this can't-take-your-eyes-away, real-to-life Romeo and Juliet-like saga as it plays out over eight, crisply told parts.  It''s not just me: ""A Touch Away"" (Merhak Negiha) took Israel by storm when it aired in 2007.  It's last episode was - at the time - the highest-rated drama ever on Israeli TV.The storyline brings together two at-the-time under-represented groups on Israeli TV: the ultra-orthodox and Russian immigrant communities, here represented by the Berman and Muntz families respectively.  Forced by economic circumstance to live across the hall in substandard housing on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, the heart of the tale is that of star-crossed lovers Zorik, head wage-earner for his Moscow emigre clan (his parents and sister arrive as the story opens), and Rochale, daughter of devout parents Shmuel and Leah.When Zorik first catches a quick glance of Rochale behind a quickly opened and then closed door, he's literally rocked backwards by her beauty.  You will be, too. You will have your breath taken away by Gaya Traub.  The thin walls, back-to-back bedrooms and Zorik's late night bass-playing help build what is at first an unspoken bond.  What helps seal the relationship: Zorik listening and comforting when no one else will pay attention to Rochale when she attempts to come to the assistance of close friend, Ita, newly married and beaten by her husband (a chilling, dead-eyed performance by Nitai Gvirtz).Just as good: the tale of the Zorik's family, especially Jenya Dodina as his mother, Marina.  She's fabulous as a histrionic, self-absorbed but ultimately loving and endearing matriarch, at constant odds with her exasperated daughter (Lucy Dubinchik, flashing fierce, beautiful eyes).  Her unruffled, patient husband, Sasha (a regal Slava Bibergal) is the story's unsung hero.The Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak is a hall-of-mirrors reality for the immigrant Muntzes: squeezed out of Moscow for being too Jewish, they're shunned and abused in their new community for not being Jewish enough (indeed, graffiti at one point accuses them of being Gentiles).  As Sasha tells his erstwhile friend Shmuel in the penultimate scene: ""I thought you were different."" Sadly, not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MWPM05TAMX3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0PG42M#wasThisHelpful","R2MWPM05TAMX3G","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've raved about writer/director David Trueba's film to so many people, I've probably started turning them off.  But that won't stop me from doing it again here.  This complete surprise of a movie -- I defy you not to be moved at the end -- dominated Spain's Goyas.  It's easy to see why.  It's cinematic magic.To be upfront: Like many others, I worship the canon of John Lennon.  So, to see that someone crafted a film out of Lennon's time spent in Almeria in 1966 to film ""How I Won the War""...well, that's enough to shoot any fan steeped in the arcania of Beatles history into fits of joy.  And, moreover, the main narrative -- that of Javier Cmara's character driving to meet Lennon so he could get him to translate Beatles lyrics (supposedly the impetus for all Beatles releases after that to include lyrics) -- is based on a true story.  As is the backstory that Lennon conceived one of his masterpieces, 'Strawberry Fields Forever',  while in Almeria (a fact known not even to Richard Lester who directed ""How I Won the War"" and was thrilled by Trueba's film). Well done, David Trueba!But even non-Beatles fans will love the movie.  My wife falls into that category.  Trueba hooks them, too, because he's stitched together an equally compelling story parallel to the Lennon tale that provides the backdrop.  It's a classic road trip tale: Cmara's Antonio plus passengers Beln and Juanjo (a fetching Natalia de Molina and impressive newcomer Francesc Colomer), each running away from repressive situations.  All this plays out against the background of a gray, severe Spain of the Franco era.  Indeed, the hues and stringency of Trueba's film could not be more different than the colorful explosions of Almodvar, what first springs to mind when western audiences think about Spanish cinema.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2P1HU95WJGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH1JOJS#wasThisHelpful","RV2P1HU95WJGC","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a shame Amazon doesn't offer the third and final season of 'Srugim' as a Prime streaming option like they do for Seasons 1 & 2.  I had to go to a competing streaming service (let's call it 'H') to see Season 3.  I was happy I did and got to spend 15 more episodes with these fascinating characters.  Thank you, co-creators Laizy Shapiro and Hava Divon, for the creativity and production skills that brought these lives into my life.  I really feel like I know these people.Again the five leads -- Yael Sharoni (Yifat), Tali Sharon (Hodaya), Ohad Knoller (Nati), Amos Tamam (Amir), Sharon Fauster (Reut) -- are superb.  Of special note, the Yifat/Amir relationship -- strained at the end of Season 2 -- is strong and vibrant here. Well, strong even in spite of Amir's pre-baby extended walkabout stroking baby goats in the Negev (the weakest storyline in Season 3).Unexpectedly, Season 3's best storyline belongs to Knoller's Nati.  Painted heretofore as a rather self-centered jerk who quickly works his way through one woman after another (all of whom are beautiful, intelligent keepers), Nati falls hard for Tehila, played wonderfully as a quirky hippie with an intoxicating, crooked smile by Dikla Elkaslasi.  You can guess the set-up here: the tables are gonna get turned on Nati.  Still, it's a beautifully told story.Another compelling part of Season 3's Nati arc: his suspension after being accused of negligence in death of an elderly woman, Mrs. Schwartzman, under his care (he's a intern at a local Jerusalem hospital).  This despite the tenderness and attention he lavished on her during her convalescence.  Their scenes together are touching. The payoff: when Nati is called to Schwartzman's lawyer's office.  Nati, freaked and on a bad run, figures he's getting sued.  The truth is something far different.  Even though my wife and I guessed what would come, it was still for me the single best scene of the season. If you can keep it together during this scene...you can't be human.I can't end my last review of Srugim without giving a shout-out to Sarah & Shayna, the two girls who co-authored the awesome, unofficial companion blog, Srugim Recap.  As fun and fulfilling as the show is, the humor and insight of these two made the whole experience two or three times better.

"My wife and I absolutely love 'Srugim.'  We can see people tune out when we start raving about it and recommending it.  Sorry, not into 'GoT' or 'Breaking Bad' or anything so violent and widely beloved.  I wish we could convince and win over more people to watch this superb production.  The quality hasn't dipped at all here in Season 2, a testament to co-creators Laizy Shapiro and Hava Divon and a superb staff of writers (led by the co-creators themselves).  They've developed five leads which such fleshed-out and carefully crafted personalities that you'd swear you knew these people.Each of the five leads -- Yael Sharoni (Yifat), Tali Sharon (Hodaya), Ohad Knoller (Natti), Amos Tamam (Amir), Sharon Fauster (Reut) - continue to turn in excellent work.  They're joined this season by Uri Lachmi, excellent as Natti's younger brother, Roi.  He takes part in the season's single best storyline: his tortured, self-flagellating, conflicted courtship of Reut, the understated beauty of the female trio with her arresting eyes.The only downer for me about Season 2: how unlikeable Yifat and Amir are -- both to each other and the audience -- at the end of Season. This despite the brilliant spectacle and joy of their marriage capping their unexpected pairing at the end of Season 1.  Yael Sharoni as Yifat is the beating heart at the center of the show so it suffers notably when she turns unhappy and hectoring.  [Lucky for us, the pair turn it around in Season 3.]One final observation: Tali Sharon looks astonishingly beautiful and radiant throughout Season 2. [In Season 3, she's post-real life baby and showing it.]  I defy anyone to watch her here and not be smitten...even when her character is exhibiting the most maddening of her introspective, morose, self-centered traits.  As Reut says: ""You know, Hodaya-land.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R375957MUSBXJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTP1BJW#wasThisHelpful","R375957MUSBXJ3","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We love Romain Duris and have thoroughly enjoyed many of his films including Paris, Heartbreaker, L'Auberge Espagnole and its follow-up Russian Dolls...and most emphatically ""The Beat that My Heart Skipped.""  ""The Big Picture"" is another winner in that stretch.  Even when Duris' characters are not fully likeable (and he definitely straddles the line here), you find yourself rooting for him.This well-plotted thriller is adopted from the novel of the same name by Douglas Kennedy.  The life of Duris' Paul Exben -- already in tumult due to an impending breakup of  his marriage and ownership changes at work -- takes a sharp, shocking turn for the dark and desperate thanks to a fit of anger that goes horribly and tragically wrong.  A quick thinking Paul ""solves"" the bloody aftermath but at the expense of his normal life in the environs of Paris.  He ""Splits"" (pin intended) for Croatia.  Can Paul make a clean getaway or will his past catch up with him? Watch to find out!Good here as always: Niels Arestrup, whose character may not be the drunkard he appears on first glance.

"""Drama High"" is an enthralling read.  I highly recommend it.  Writer Michael Sokolove has placed layer upon layer of brilliant writing into this work.  Headline writers have tabbed this book to be about a ""real-life 'Glee'"" or ""'Glee' meets 'Friday Night Lights'.""  Those are too pithy and don't do justice to the book's impressive scope, depth and emotional resonance.Ostensibly, Sokolove's book is a paean to his former teacher, Lou Volpe, retiring after four decades at his post as drama teacher at Harry S Truman High School in Levittown, PA.  While the book focuses on Volpe's career as its touchstone, so many other excellent themes here including: the role of arts programs in American high schools; the effect of budget cuts; theater programs' position in lower- to middle-class communities; the regression of the middle class; the roots, struggles and perseverance of Levittown; Volpe's family history and sexual identity; the stories of Volpe's ex-wife and now-adult only child; the business of high school musical; the kids' stories, motivations, fears and dreams...and so much more.Lou Volpe is an American hero.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R7CPYQZKJF99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632804#wasThisHelpful","R3R7CPYQZKJF99","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If the Obama/Raul Castro thaw in relations continues at its current pace, Julia Cooke's book -- in the oeuvre of the American observer noting the etched-in-amber life of Havana's exhausted residents -- could be one of the last of its breed.

She writes about the small, not the big, shadowing and recounting the lives and struggles of a dozen of so companions and friends of friends.

"I adore this show from Garry Trudeau, Elliot Webb and Jonathan Alter. It's drenched head to toe with insider jokes about life inside the Beltway, but has enough intelligent adult comedy to appeal to those who aren't political junkies.  I suspect Mark Consuelos (excellent as the Marco Rubio-esque Andy Guzman) speaks for much of the cast when he says that his work on the show is the best role he's ever had, hands down.The four leads are fantastic: John Goodman (the beating heart of the show) as Sen. Gil John Biggs (R-NC); Matt Malloy (a Trudeau veteran from Tanner '88) as Sen. Louis Laffer (R-NV); Clark Johnson as Sen. Robert Bettencourt (R-PA); and Consuelos/Guzman (R-FL).  Each has meaty, compelling storylines, many times ripped from the headlines. Calling for an end to the Cuban embargo for example? Nice idea, President Obama, but Sen. Andy Guzman beat you to it.Equally good are the staffers. Like real life, the star wattage may come from the personalities on the Senate floor, but what makes the town work are the staffers.  Standouts are the four chiefs of staff: Alicia Sable (as Tammy Stackhouse) in Gil John's office; Natalie Gold (as Katherine Sims) in Guzman's; Brooke Bloom (as Julie Carrell) in Laffer's; and Kobi Libii (as Aaron Stimson) in Bettencourt's.Finally, the lagniappe: excellent star turns. Word clearly spread after Season One that this show was a bipartisan hoot.  Everyone seems to want in on the deal.

It becomes a taut, seat-gripping drama that will have you holding your breath and rooting for everything to turn out well for our protagonist, Malika, winningly played by newcomer Chaimae Ben Acha.The best scenes are the most intimate ones: that of Malika and jaded drug mule Amal (Soufia Issami). Writer/director Sean Gullette has us right in the car with these two as they embark on a risky trafficking journey.  We see Mailka from Amal's front-seat perspective and vice versa.

She's a writer and editor by profession though, so 'Train' is no flying blind leap into a new career.  The writing and plotting here is ingenious and first rate.Were someone to tell you about the literary device employed here --- three first-person voices, alternating by paragraph, over different time periods -- you might think, jeez, that sounds hard to follow.  It's not. You pick up on it right away and get immediately into the flow.You can almost see the cinema version of the book in your mind's eye as you blitz through it.  So, no surprise then to read that Dreamworks preemptively acquired the rights to Hawkins' work late last year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRYWMKP4QMDDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9B7IKE#wasThisHelpful","RRYWMKP4QMDDR","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent piece of investigatory journalism from ESPN The Magazine's Senior Writer Brett Forrest takes us inside the shocking world of international football (i.e., soccer) match-fixing. There are two main threads of the story: that of the main chaser, Chris Eaton, one-time Melbourne cop turned Interpol sleuth; and that of the most notorious of the fixers, Wilson Raj Perumal, Singapore's ""Kelong King.""  Though Forrest came to the story by way of Eaton (who, post-Interpol, did a stint with FIFA as its chief security officer and now sets up office at the Qatar-based International Centre for Sport Security), what's notable about the book is his access to Perumal, whom Forrest tracks down in Hungary.  In his Acknowledgements, Forrest notes that ""Perumal earns my gratefulness for his courteous recollections.""Beyond the cat-and-mouse aspects of the book, Forrest's work is notable for its descriptions of how the spectre of match-fixing permeated the game's highest levels.  It's a perfect storm of the ascendancy of Chinese wealth (a country of serious gamblers), the rise of Internet bookmaking sites (creating market-making and transborder cash flow) and strapped international federations hungry for cash.My favorite passages of the book weren't directly related to either Eaton or Perumal.  They involved Carsten Koerl, founder of Bet to Win, later renamed to Bwin, one of the foremost Internet bookers (and coincidentally a prominent sponsor of many top-flight clubs).  Koerl went on to found Sportradar (and later Betradar), whose speciality is in spotting games whose betting action -- as compared to expectations -- made them outliers and possible fraud cases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5G9PMQLFJTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062308076#wasThisHelpful","R3H5G9PMQLFJTH","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This excellent, thoughtful book from John Browne mixes parts of his personal history with stirring, well-crafted passages detailing the author's current passion project as founder of The Glass Closet.  That organization seeks to convince business leaders that ""any policy that fosters an inclusive environment makes good business sense.""  As Browne says:""Paul Reed, my former colleague at BP and now a senior executive there, puts it best: `I don't want people saving a quarter of their brain to hide who they are. I want them to apply their whole brain to their job.' Inclusion creates a level playing field, which allows the best talent to rise to the top. Respecting diversity of sexual orientation and gender identity should therefore be recognised as a matter of strategic importance to every company competing in the global market for talent.""Browne further relates what Peter Sands, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank, said to him:""[Sands] explains that being trapped in the closet is `miserable for individuals and bad for business. In a world where business success is all about unleashing people's creative energy and imagination, it makes no sense to cripple so much talent.' The evidence points in one direction: people are more satisfied and more productive when they can bring their whole selves to work.""That's really what this book is about: issuing a call for inclusiveness that allows talent to flourish and personal productivity to be realized, regardless of sexual identity.  Browne's thesis is that achieving these goals is going to take a combination of ""clear and consistent tone from the top...accompanied by stories that make the issue real.""Browne's asks that ""[e]mployees who have come out...talk about their experiences, because there is nothing more effective than real-life examples at dispelling fears.""  The author's call is tinged with regret that he did not have the opportunity to be one of those examples on his own terms.  Instead, he was famously and publicly outed.In this book, he recounts his life over that tumultuous period.  The pain is still clearly raw.  While he lays his soul bare, those you looking for real dirt from Browne will need to look elsewhere.  The Glass Closet is not that book.  Consider ""The Glass Closet"" making up for lost time: this John Browne confidently looks forward, not backwards.  His book is a spirited, well-reasoned call for ""leaders who have a deep understanding of authenticity, and for the emotional and human investment that is required for LGBT employees to feel comfortable coming out at work.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TJW0WQFZERQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ3AERW#wasThisHelpful","R17TJW0WQFZERQ","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're like me, you'll enjoy the 'approachability' of this book -- it's an engaging read, told like a guy regaling you over a pre-dinner beer about the unlikely, fascinating path that led to ZenDesk's ultimate sucesss.  Not ""unlikely"" in the sense that writer Mikkel Svane (& co-founders Alex Aghassipour + Morten Primdahl) were lucky or undeserving.  Rather that they started their journey in Copenhagen (Svane recounts the abysmal state of the VC industry there when they started out), picked a mundane corner of IT (their genius was to make the mundane exiting...help desks: who knew?) and spent a good period of their early years being ignored (or worse) by the VC/IT kingmakers.  By going direct to users (one of the first to perfect that now pervasive model) and getting bottom-up support in companies, the founders were able to persevere and win their seats at the table.I love this passage from Svane early on in the book, laying out his basic premise on work (and life)...""For me , finding true Zen in building a company has been the realization that almost everything is difficult. Most things are complicated. People are imperfect and don't always act rationally. Relationships are hard. If you want to make something look easy, you have to put a lot of effort into it. Only by embracing the fact that nothing is easy and that the most important things are so incredibly hard can you approach work (and life) with the right humility that can set you up for success.""Well said.Much of this book's success goes to its co-writer (the 'with' person), Carlye Adler.  Much as she's done to great effect with Marc Benioff (a big personality if there even was one), Adler has succeeded here in getting Svane's personality on the page.  She's crafted a compelling story.One side note: it's interesting to note the dissonance between what Svane has to say about life and work in Copenhagen (he's almost clawing to get out at one point) vs. its #1 position on many ""most livable cities"" lists, most notably Monocle where the city has topped the table in 2013 and 2014.  My takeaway: It all depends on what you're measuring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31J61N8GAXZ59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PNJYLMG#wasThisHelpful","R31J61N8GAXZ59","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This very readable book is notable in that it makes the mundane -- the prosaic matter of a checklist -- fascinating and essential.  Dr. Atul Gawande expertly details surgery's aversion to adopting simple checklists to minimize avoidable mistakes. That's due to that profession's adherence to the now outdated master surgeon/hero model.  Gawande -- in a position to make this claim definitively -- posits that the vast complexities of the job far outstrip the abilities of any one person to master it all and remain error-free.Gawande brings in excellent case studies of the building and aviation industries.  In both cases, he does boots-on-the-ground reporting about how checklists work in those professions.  Of building, he notes that the era of the ""master builder"" faded long ago -- projects just got too complex.  Decision-making and responsibility got pushed downwards and out.  Gawande sits in the trailer office of one such complex undertaking and watches with fascination as it all comes together.Likewise, the examples pulled from aviation are equally compelling.  He takes us through the industry's relentless dedication to continuously improving checklists for all matter of situations that a pilot may encounter.  These run the gamut from the mundane to the almost unimaginable.  Of special note, Gawande's work was published shortly after US Airways ""Miracle on the Hudson."" He takes us through checklists' role in that event.  Indeed, pilot Chesley Sullenberger is on record as fully deflecting the ""hero"" appellation bestowed upon him by the press.  He instead credits ingrained checklist-driven routine and a well-prepared crew.There are lessons in ""The Checklist Manifesto"" that can be applied readily by people of every profession.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8RW9R99062/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030V0PEW#wasThisHelpful","R8RW9R99062","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We saw ""1,000 Times Good Night"" as part of the wonderful Film Movement"" program.  It's one of their strongest entries to date.  The film is a fascinating production: conceived, produced and directed by Norwegians (with a premiere there); starring French and Danish leads whom the script -- not attempting to hide their provenance -- has settled in Ireland; featuring Irish children of the French/Danish parents; and with filming split across Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Morocco (as a stand-in for Afghanistan) and - most notably - Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya.Sound like a recipe for a mess? Well, against the odds, no.  This film -- a brilliant creation from writer/director Erik Poppe -- is a gripping, relentlessly watchable affair.In Poppe's script, we're confronted with the question: how does home-life go for the photographer whose life work is spent in conflict zones?Answer: not well. Juliette Binoche's Rebecca suffers through a near-mortal shock in Kabul.  Post-trauma, she tries to leave her adrenaline-fueled life behind and work on domesticity.  At loose ends and a relative stranger to her kids, she's coaxed into a visit (as a guest of an NGO) to a refugee camp in Kenya.  Terming it a ""safe camp"" from her experience, she convinces husband Marcus (great, taciturn performance by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) that she'll take daughter Steph (Lauryn Canny - all that is good about Ireland) along for bonding (& to ace Steph's school project to boot).All I'll say here: does NOT go according to plan.Ultimately, at movie's end, Rebecca ends up back in Kabul.  Watch for the subtle, powerful ending, beautifully underplayed by Binoche.  I'd seen her on some 2014 Best Actress lists for this performance.  She needed to be on more.  She remains one of the world's finest actresses.The DVD's extra features are superb...plan on spending an additional 30+ well-invested minutes consuming those.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL797KLNZAEP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OL2KOFE#wasThisHelpful","RL797KLNZAEP9","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Released ever-so-briefly in the US under the title ""Paris Follies,"" we saw French release ""La Ritournelle"" in Australia under the name ""Folies Bergre,"" which appears to have been its original working title while under production.  It's a charming French comedy starring legends of French cinema Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Pierre Darroussin.  Despite their lengthy, contemporaneous careers, ""La Ritournelle"" marks the first time these two have worked together.  Here, they play a long-time married couple working agriculture well outside the bustling cities we are more accustomed to see depicted on-screen.Darroussin's Xavier clearly adores Huppert's Brigitte, but their farming life - steers, animal husbandry and manual labor - isn't the stuff of smouldering passion.  In the screenplay, we see Brigitte's head turned, first by young party guest Stan (Pio Marma - excellent recently in Aliyah (English Subtitled)) and then by a cosmopolitan Dane, Jesper (Michael Nyqvist of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (English Subtitled) fame).  These two events play out during a two-day jaunt to Paris by Brigitte, ostensibly to seek treatment for a rash.  Xavier, sussing out events but not correctly interpreting them fully, catches Brigitte in the company of Jesper.  You'll want to see the movie to see how it all plays out.The movie's best scene by far: Xavier surprising son Grgoire (Clment Mtayer) by dropping in on his acrobatics class.  Earlier in the film it's been established that Xavier's approval of his son's chosen career path is grudging at best.  Seeing his son in practice though...I can't fully describe just how sublime and intelligent Darroussin's performance is here. He lets the audience see subtly how profoundly affected he is by the mastery of Grgoire's routine. It's a superb piece of acting.  I asked my wife about the scene (she'd seen the movie separately) - she nodded vigorously and said she ""bawled my eyes out."" It's that good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6MWEV04O7SJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBAGPHA#wasThisHelpful","R6MWEV04O7SJG","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We watched Three Worlds (original title: ""Trois mondes""), a taut, well-plotted French drama conceived by writer/director Catherine Corsini, as part of the Film Movement subscription service.  It's a great way to see foreign films that don't often get a fair chance here in the US.  That's certainly the case for Three Worlds: it never got a chance here, playing only in one theater.  Now's your opportunity to see it in video or, better still, Amazon Instant Video release.  It's compelling watching well worth your time.The cast here is first rate, starting with the beautiful and talented Clotilde Hesme, who made me a fan with her winsome, girl-next-door performance in The Grocer's Son (English Subtitled).  Then, we have Raphal Personnaz, the ill-fated center antagonist/protagonist who panics and flees after a hit-and-run and spends the rest of the film attempting to salve his wracked conscience.  He's definitely a personnaz of interest in my book after seeing this film.  [Yeah, couldn't wait to use that lame joke.]The film's ""third world"" is fleshed out by Arta Dobroshi as Vera.  This striking Kosovan actress plays a Moldovan immigrant to Paris.  Her world and that of Al's (Personnaz's character) are brought together brutally by the accident in which Vera's husband is mowed down in the street.  The glue between the two is Juliette - witness to the incident - who forms unlikely relationships with each side of the triangle.You won't rest a moment while watching this film.  It starts with a super high energy scene of drunken ""boys' night out"" revelry and never lets up.  And, about that scene: hats off to Reda Kateb here for his portrayal of Al's friend and co-worker, Franck.  He brings a level of malevolence and intimidation here adds a extra shot or two of tension to every scene in which he appears.

"""The Everything Store"" is a wonderfully reported book about an ""abjectly miserable"" place.  I've been an avid reader of Brad Stone's work at Newsweek and now Bloomberg BusinessWeek.  He's taken his experience of 10+ years of covering the Amazon beat and written his compelling warts-and-all history of its mercurial, relentless founder, Jeff Bezos and the pioneering e-commerce company he envisioned and birthed at the very start of the web's era of commercialization.It's notable that the first spotlight review here on this page is penned by one of the book's early protagonists, Shel Kaphan.  By most accounts, Kaphan was Amazon's first employee.  By Kaphan's account, he's a co-founder (and, by Bezos' account, he's not, which tells you a lot about Bezos).  Kaphan says that the book ""...describes not only Amazon's ultra-hardball business practices, but the better aspects of their services and products as well. To the extent of my knowledge it is a pretty realistic account, though necessarily incomplete.""  Exactly: it encapsulates both the good and the bad of the company.  He's also spot-on that Mackenzie Bezos' ill-conceived one-star review only serves to boost the book and underline its integrity.As a fan of the company, it was dispiriting to read extensive accounts of what a harsh, Darwinian place Amazon is for its employees.  The ""abjectly miserable"" expression comes from one of its employees, noting that Amazon had to resort to remote development centers because word had flooded the Seattle area about Amazon's true nature.The company takes on the personality of its CEO - though no doubt brilliant, visionary and successful by most measures, Bezos is repeatedly described here as an executive who openly disdains people who don't meet his exacting standards and ""uses up"" those that do.  Indeed, the book is replete with tales of short tenures by exhausted key contributors and targets of his well-documented 'nutters.'That aside, hard to dispute the guy's track record.  It's an amazing run.  His combination of smarts and guts plus his resolute desire to be a technology company not a merchant are what led to initiatives such as AWS and Kindle.  Stone's recounting of how AWS came to be is stirring stuff indeed for anyone in the IT industry.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29H310RG87LJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWQW73E#wasThisHelpful","R29H310RG87LJQ","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like your movies where something big or meaningful has to happen, else you think ""it's boring,"" ""it's dull"" and ""nothing happened, so we walked out,"" then steer clear of ""Land Ho"" as it won't be your cup of tea. But if, like me, you appreciate small, quirky films that resemble real life inhibited by characters you could surely meet in daily passing, then this winning little film is just the ticket for you.  A few months after seeing it, I find myself thinking about it quite a bit and end up smiling thinking of the sweetest parts of it.I joked recently that the film's credits include the line ""Filmed on location in Kentucky and Iceland"" and that was the only time in recorded history that that sentence had been assembled.  It speaks to the inventiveness of the script devised by co-writers/co-directors Aaron Katz and Martha Stephens.  Retirees and former brothers-in-law (and still friends) Mitch (Earl Lynn Nelson) and Colin (Paul Eenhoorn) meet up in the former's Kentucky residence.  Mitch springs a surprise on down-in-the-dumps Colin, proposing a trip to Iceland to push him out of his rut.From there, 'Land Ho' follows these two around Iceland in their rented Range Rover.  Indeed, nothing much happens...but that's entirely the point. It's two guys of a certain age bonding and living their lives.  The third co-star at this point is Iceland, its vistas and stunning backdrops captured in vibrant color by cinematographer, Andrew Reed.  A natural reaction to this film should be to put Iceland on your travel agenda.Nelson and Eenhoorn are fabulous here.  Nelson is a doctor-turned-actor.  His lack of formal training in the arts is clear here. That's part of the charm.  He makes up for it with his boisterous, larger-than-life personality.  I have to believe that the Earl Lynn Nelson we see here is exactly what you get in real life.  Who wouldn't want to be friends with this guy?The acting chops come from Eenhoorn playing the reserved, taciturn Colin.  Of course, part of that taciturn nature is imposed upon him by Nelson's Mitch, whose boisterous love of life is manifested by a running commentary on just about everything that crosses his path or mind.  However, the movie succeeds on the strength of Eenhoorn's gentle change and his ability to express intimacy after the pain of a recent split.  It's credit to Eenhoorn's considerable skill as a actor.I can't talk about this film without noting the Katz & Stephens' brilliant use of Big Country's ""In a Big Country"" to drive home two key parts of the narrative.  First is to back a montage depicting highlights of the guys' trip, most notably a scene on a beach with dark sands.  I later read an interview in which the stars said they showed up to film at that beach and encountered brutal winds that whipped sand into their faces. The planned scene was impossible.  However, the footage Katz and Stephens collected of the stars laughingly leaning into the elements is a perfect complement to the jolt of energy that ""In a Big Country"" delivers.Then, in a Sgt. Pepper's-like reprise, the song appears again right at film's end as Colin and Mitch, resplendent in a spa's white robes, make their way around a pool edge - the stars, captured in slow motion by Reed's camera, their white robes offset against the scene's vibrant blues, the attention paid to them by the young girls in the water as they pass, ""In a Big Country"" building to its exuberant fullness of noise...well, that's just a great piece of moviemaking.  I defy you not to be smiling when the credits roll.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPHKISXCLS2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHWN3II#wasThisHelpful","R3DPHKISXCLS2O","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Countdown to Zero Day"" is a phenomenal piece of work from Wired reporter Kim Zetter. It performs the difficult feat of being rich in technical detail while possessing the steely narrative spine of a first-rate thriller.  By doing so, I've no doubt that it will win over both the digital technorati as well as the fascinated layperson.It's an astonishing story: how Stuxnet -- the world's first fully unleashed nation-sponsored cyber-weapon -- got built, weaponized and distributed. The great unseen actors in the story are the groups that envisioned and created the weapon.  Zetter's reporting makes it all but certain that Stuxnet and its offshoots were co-parented by US and Israeli government-sponsored organizations.  But Zetter's book's heroes and protagonists are the weapon's hunters, notably Symantec & Ralph Langner's small German-based industrial control system team.As Zetter adroitly points out ""[t]he attackers had no doubt assumed, even counted on, the Iranians not having the skills to uncover or decipher the malicious attack on their own.  But they clearly hadn't anticipated that the crowdsourced wisdom of the hive -- courtesy of the global cybersecurity community -- would handle the detection and analysis for them.""Far from losing steam, Zetter's work remains compelling throughout its entire 406 (hardcover) pages.  She's sublime when discussing Stuxnet's longer range implications, starting with the fact that ""attacking Iran made it harder [for the US] to condemn other nations for cyber transgressions...As the party that fired the first known digital weapon, the US was no longer in a position to preach abstinence to others.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETJ8M7DX7D6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KEPLC08#wasThisHelpful","R3ETJ8M7DX7D6K","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""I Must Say"" is why they invented the audio book genre.  I'm sure Marty's book [dead tree edition] is a wonderful read, but you're missing out big time if you don't experience his memoir by listening to him narrate his own work.  In a word: fantastic.  You simply can't imagine a better way to spend eight hours and forty minutes of your valuable time.Not only do you get the author jumping into character as Ed Grimley, Jiminy Glick, Jackie Rogers Jr., Nathan Thurm and others as you'd fully expect, you also get drop-dead perfect impersonations of Bernie Brillstein, Robin Williams, Eugene Levy and countless others.  [His Williams recollections are especially poignant.] Short has a ton of stories - all engagingly told. It's one thing to remember everything (and, yes, he cops to a prodigious memory --- he seems to recall every little detail of every story that matters), but another thing to unspool them all in such winning fashion.  The stories never flag, never fail to amuse.Part of Short's motivation here in writing this book: to pay tribute to his late wife, Nancy Dolman, who passed away in 2010 after a long bout with ovarian cancer.  He says such beautiful and moving things about her here.  It's not just eight hours of jokes and funny stories here.  We get to hear about Short's daily life and the act of making a life.  It's evocatively written and stoically recounted by the author.  Again, maybe good on the page, but absolutely unmissable in audio format.By the way, the title is part of the joke: you know from early on that Short is far less than the ego-filed star.  He's by all accounts a humble and generous friend, beloved by a wide circle.  Vanity Fair's David Kamp (Short's writing partner for this book) wrote a story about him last year that was telling.  The article relates:""[Steve] Martin noted that Nora Ephron--who, in the meticulous instructions she left before her death last summer, dictated that Short speak first at her memorial service, ahead of Meryl Streep, Mike Nichols, and Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson--referred to Short as ""the best person."" ""Not the best person at something,"" Martin said. ""Just `the best person.' Period.""""That's the Martin Short on display here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUSQQY2TG7ID6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HU5KLPW#wasThisHelpful","RUSQQY2TG7ID6","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This purposefully absurd, delightful movie deserved a bigger audience. The always likeable Nick Frost is excellent here, especially when playing against Chris O'Dowd who's in top form here as Frost's co-worker and office cad.  There's one completely over-the-top dance-off/confrontation between the two that takes place in a parking garage...well, I can't accurately convey the sheer goofy hilarity of this scene.  Suffice to say these are two gifted physical comedians pulling out all the stops.  It's like 'West Side Story' meets 'Strictly Ballroom.'It's 'Strictly' that kept springing to mind when I was watching this film.  That's very high praise in my book.  In 'Strictly,' Baz Luhrmann (in his audacious debut as writer/director), folded sequences of sheer slapstick hilarity inside of his real dance movie.  And here in 'Fury,' it's the same deal: comedy aside, Frost took his entre into the world of Salsa very seriously.  The excellent ""extras"" package show him arduously learning the craft of salsa dancing over seven months of lessons and workshops.  Frost says in an interview that he didn't want the type of movie where ""they showed my top and cut to someone else's bottom."" All the steps, lifts and twirls here are his.  It's clear from the Extras that that effort won the respect and admiration of his instructors and the real salsa aficionados called upon to fill out the movie's final rousing scenes.All this and Rashida Jones (radiant and beautiful here), too?

"I'm not a big science fiction reader but I bought into the backstory behind this book:  Andy Weir is a software engineer who -- having been rejected by publishing houses when attempting to go the traditional route -- self-published his book on his website in serialized fashion.  The groundswell of ardor for his work led to deals, in turn, with Amazon (as a $0.99 offering), then an audio house, then finally Crown Publishing for a ""traditional"" book release.  The love for Weir's effort reached such a fever pitch that it's a forthcoming movie with Matt Damon...a sentence that almost reads like a cliche.As expressed on the these pages by countless others, the science here is brilliant.  The book is really a tutorial on how a mission to Mars could work wrapped inside a compelling novel.  The science has to be airtight given the reading audience's attention to the details of the how-tos.  In the paperback version, Weir mentions that he worked out his own orbital paths and ""[wrote] my own software to track constant-thrust trajectories.""  That's the type of guy we're talking about here.  It's a deeply impressive piece of work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JI0LRX58Z9JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMXBDMA#wasThisHelpful","R1JI0LRX58Z9JR","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I watched ""Aliyah"" as part of the Film Movement series.  As is the case with many of these films, this debut outing from director/co-writer Elie Wajeman was a small and pleasant surprise.The title of the film is surely meant as a joke: it is hardly religious with drugs, violence, Paris' seamy underbelly and crime playing notable roles in the plot.  Indeed, one of the script's recurring themes is just how unlikely the concept of Aliyah is for Alex, the lead character played by an excellent Pio Marma.  Barely aware of his Jewish roots (he has to scramble for proof), his hastily devised plan meets with skepticism and borderline disdain by the people in his life.  As the film goes on, we see that - far from any religious stirrings - Alex's 'plan' is in fact more of an escape from bad choices and an unrelentingly needy and flailing older brother.  Despite his bad choices, Alex's life looks positively brilliant next to that of Issac's.  Cdric Kahn is fantastic in this role - you can almost smell the desperation on him.Complicating the matter of departure: Alex needs a significant amount of cash to invest in a restaurant in Tel Aviv.  It's been well-established by this point that this is not your typical wage-earner.  Alex knows only one way to earn this money in a short period.  The paradox is, of course, that this path out gets him even more enmeshed in what's he's ostensibly escaping.Moreover, there's the small matter of a nascent relationship with Jeanne, a strikingly beautiful Adle Haenel.  She's attracted to him specifically because of his complications.  I think Wajeman uses Jeanne to show us just how ill-fitting a prospect Aliyah is for Alex.  As in: Who would give up this?As if to drive home the point, Wajeman presents a jarring juxtaposition between Paris and Tel Aviv.  While this isn't the glossy postcard of France's capital, the film does present it as a thriving, vibrant metropolis full of energy.  What we see of Tel Aviv from Wajeman's lens is telling: in very short order we see overcrowding, heavy military presence, homelessness, unsolved immigration issues and sub-standard housing...not to mention Alex's massive assimilation issues.  He speaks not a word of Hebrew.  Wajeman seems to be saying: here it is, dude.  What do you think?","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB4GRKY2P62ZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009W4BRJ8#wasThisHelpful","RB4GRKY2P62ZS","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gobbled down Lisa Genova's excellent novel in one three-and-a-half-hour plane ride.  It's a realistic, sobering look at the insidious effect of early onset Alzheimer's on its victim and her family.  In this account, the impacts of the disease are incremental...and then at all at once. The resonance reflected by the many reviews of people on these pages in similar familial situations speaks volumes as to the true-to-life verisimilitude of Genova's story.I was impressed with the scientific background that she's packed into the text, from the accessible discourses on the genetics of the disease to the counseling and detection sessions she conveys in crisp back-and-forth dialogue.  By making Alice's husband and son both biologists, Genova is able to plop in the realities of genetics in a conversational style.  I wasn't aware of the advances in linking certain gene deformations to the certainty of Alzheimer's until reading this book.  On the diagnosis parts, the sessions with counselors and specialists reek of the truth of what those encounters must be like.  They're unnerving.One final note: I did find myself thinking of Pat Summit a lot.  Alzheimer's doesn't care if you've reached the peak of your profession or have been lauded throughout your career for your sharp mind and keen intellect.  Like Genova's Alice Howland, Summit's case reveals this disease to be an equal opportunity inflicter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRUVQ07L7KSJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NLKXK2#wasThisHelpful","RRUVQ07L7KSJ4","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What makes 'Dallas 1963' unique is what it's not: an attempt to solve or unravel the Kennedy Assassination or unspool a particular theory.  What it is: a brilliant recitation of what Dallas was like from the period of January, 1960 through November, 1963, and how the city's agitated state of ""indignation"" (a word used frequently throughout the text) led to the moniker ""City of Hate.""This work by Bill Minutaglio & Steven L. Davis ought be required reading for all current residents of Dallas.  When I first moved here in the mid-eighties, my Massachusetts Mom fairly shrieked ""But they killed Kennedy!"" My wife got the same reaction from her Mom.  That's the history that Dallas has had to live down for now just past 50 years.  The Dallas of today feels so...different.  We have a ways to go, but this is an international city now with large, diverse communities. I think of the large groups of migrs that call Dallas home now - Russian, Indian, Mexican - and how taken aback they'd be to understand in detail what the atmosphere was like here leading to 11/22/63.The pacing of the book is spectacular.  In 1960, the authors go month by month...then week by week...then day by day.  Until, finally, on November 22nd we get an almost minute by minute breakdown of the events.  As a Dallas resident, you're imagining the route in your head as Minutaglio & Davis take you through every right and left turn from Love Field to downtown and, fatefully, past the Texas Schoolbook Depository.  Even better: I listened to the Audible audiobook which features a positively electric reading from narrator Tony Messano.Less than Jack Kennedy or even Oswald and Ruby, this is a book about Dallas' other influencers at the time, most notably the troika of Gen. Edwin Walker, Dallas Morning News chief Ted Dealey and Neiman Marcus's CEO Stanley Marcus.  What really comes through is just how in-the-grip America was of fear of Communism.  In the minds of people like Walker and Dealey, there was only one form of patriotism then.  If you weren't that model, you were - in their minds - treasonous. [Note the book's cover.]  Marcus, by comparison, attempts to urge Dallas' spirit to a better place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NK0FPASQTVDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HAAWAVK#wasThisHelpful","R1NK0FPASQTVDG","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fascinating book from top-notch investigative journalists Mark Hollingsworth and Stewart Lansley is a good compendium piece to contemporaneous works like The Oligarchs: Wealth And Power In The New Russia by David Hoffman.  'Londongrad' takes those works and focuses the action totally on London and its environs.  All the usual players are here: Abramovich, Berezovsky (this book was published prior to his death by his own hand), Deripaska, Khodorkovsky and some others...but mostly in regards to how their evolution and machinations since the creation of the oligarchic class in the Yeltsin era has swept waves of change through the UK.Indeed, where the book shines is in its depiction of how attitudes went from curious fascination on the parts of most Londoners (the well-documented cartoonish amount splashed on mega-yachts, obscene overbidding on trophy properties, garish parties, etc.) to the sudden realization of how this new superclass of migrs has directly impacted their lives.  To that end, the Litvinenko case was a game-changer: the shock of the reality that the Russian state (as is alleged) would traffic deadly polonium into the heart of London to kill a critic.  Hollingsworth and Lansley's narrative on the Litvinenko case is fascinating.  I've read Alexander Goldfarb's Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB and feel like 'Londongrad' is an excellent second take at these events.The other way the new Russian Wave has affected Londoners: the cost of living.  This new super-rich class has pushed the traditional upper class out of its typical nesting spots in the city. The butterfly effect of the movement has spread waves of dislocation and change throughout London and beyond.  All of that is well-documented here.  The authors spend time with the estate agents who service both the 'dispossessers' and 'dispossessees.'","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG32RJGED3DNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0007356374#wasThisHelpful","RG32RJGED3DNX","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of Jhumpa Lahiri's work most notably her outstanding novel, The Namesake: A Novel, and her short story collection Unaccustomed Earth (Vintage Contemporaries).  No one today writes or speaks so trenchantly about the Indian diaspora.  Despite being born in London and raised in Rhode Island, she seems to get the experience of the 'Indian expatriate in America' down to her bones.  Her exquisite writing and storytelling chops only add to that.'The Lowland' is another winner.  If I told you ""I read this book about the Naxalite Movement and its impacts on Indian society and families...you should read it,"" you'd probably find a way of fobbing me off. But Ms. Lahiri has a way of getting that history lesson across to her readers by cloaking it in the tale of how those events play out in a single family. The meat of the story spans over 50 years.  As her skillful hand shows, though thousands of miles away and generations removed, this one small family still deals with the fallout of a single, tragic event that rocked a small Indian town in 1971.There are three different stories here woven into one.  First you think, ""this is Subbhash's story.""  Then, unexpectedly, it becomes Gauri's story.  And then finally, too, it becomes Bela's story, too. To tell you the relationship between three is to maybe tell you too much. Jhumpa Lahiri's stories are the tales of lives played out in the real world. You can't go wrong investing the hours to read her work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AKBIJKFFWWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307278263#wasThisHelpful","R3AKBIJKFFWWT","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We received this movie as part of the Film Movement series.  We've encountered a lot of unexpected, small-wattage international gems that way - 'Teddy Bear' from Denmark as a notable example.  ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" was another pleasant surprise.  We'd seen the trailer, which frankly seemed to reduce expectations.  But the film experience itself easily surpassed those. Writer/director Arvin Chen has come up with a small gem here.And, for anyone with a fear of 'foreign' film who thinks they won't relate to something from Taiwan: Chen was born and raised in California, attended USC, wrote the first drafts of the film in English.  The themes he explores here are universal and transportable across cultures.Leads Richie Ren (Wei-chung) and Mavis Fan (Feng) are likable presences.  Fan's background as a singer is put to good use here in the neat dream-like sequence that gives the film its title.I really liked Kimi Hsia as Wei-chung's little sister, Mandy - beautiful eyes, comedic delivery, involved in what I thought was the film's neatest trick: imaginary repartee with the star of a maudlin love story who has jumped off the screen and to her side as she wallows in abject self-pity during a pre-wedding break-up. Sounds treacly. It's not. Writer/director Chen plays it for a spot of fun and gets the tone of it exactly right than to Ms. Hsia.  We need to see more of her.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ISM4F2LUHDAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPWWCJK#wasThisHelpful","R2ISM4F2LUHDAX","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We binge-watched this excellent FX series in the matter of a couple of nights. It's based on 'Bron,' the Danish/Swedish original in which a body is discovered on the inter-country border on the bridge connecting those two countries, thus forcing cooperation between their investigative forces. This US version has been transported in a very imaginative way to the US/Mexico border by a crack team of writers. A similar adaptation took place in the UK. In that series, the body is found in the Chunnel and ropes in France.I love the work of Demian Bichir. He's outstanding here. Diane Kruger is equally sublime.  Her character, Sonya, exhibits Aspergers-like thinking and actions. In the wrong hands, acting this out could look rather foolish or ham-handed on camera.  Ms. Kruger pulls it off beautifully. You feel for the way she can't feel. Her work is artfully juxtaposed by Bechir's Marco, whose knack with people is established early, and by Ted Levine's Hank Wade, Sonya's boss, whose soft spot for her goes way back. Turns out he's the one who's basically got her through life thus far.The real revelation here is Matthew Dillard as reporter, Daniel Frye. If you just know him as Shaggy, prepare to be duly impressed. I especially loved the chemistry between his character and the cub reporter played by Emily Rios.The success of the show has fueled a second season. Season one's end sets that up perfectly as a distraught Marco begins to seek out revenge for the tragedy that has befallen upon his family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HQXNWLY2AQP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECHBSP8#wasThisHelpful","R3HQXNWLY2AQP1","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've seen the first two installments (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset) of this intoxicating talk-fest from writer/director, Richard Linklater, you are pretty much obligated by law to see this third one. It's the darkest and most intense of the three, but no less winning and likable.Co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have been credited as co-writers on 'Sunset' and 'Midnight.' It's clear that they know these characters, Jesse and Celine very, very well, giving them tremendous depth, complexity and back-story.  I love the way on each of these two later films how three creators plunge you right into Jesse and Celine's lives, then slowly fill you in on the details of what's transpired in the intervening years since the last installment ended.Often, this storytelling is done via exceptionally long, word-packed passages in which the characters do nothing more than interact with each other. Most notable: a single extended scene - easily more than 10 minutes in length - in which the two characters walk down a path and chat amiable.Then, by contrast towards the film's end, there's a devastating scene in which the two converse in a markedly different tone in a hotel room.  I'd been leery of seeing this scene as I'd been warned of its intensity and I have such good feelings towards these characters. Regardless, it's great movie-making...and bold stuff from Delpy, who really gives it everything during these climactic moments, both emotionally and physically. Though still beautiful, she's not afraid here to show us what a natural aging process looks like.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35UML2QW6E9JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJTWK0U#wasThisHelpful","R35UML2QW6E9JB","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always enjoyed Katie Hafner's writing.  Now, for the first time in book form, she's turned the spotlight on herself.  This memoir proves once again how the most professional, successful talents can succeed through raw determination, grit and hard work....in spite of the often shocking handicaps they're handed early in life.Hafner describes a childhood that you'd wish on no one - a household torn apart by divorce, she and her sister subsequently stripped from an alcoholic mother, thrown into a trying Brady Bunch-style blended family. After years spent trying to reconcile her conflicted feelings about her mother, Hafner's book details her attempts to bring her now aging, solitary Mom into her house in San Francisco.  [Hafner's Pro Tip: Mixture of a mom with no filter and a 16-year-old, hormone-fueled daughter is maybe not such a hot idea for the generation in the middle.]I'm struck by how artfully this memoir is constructed: While most of us would have written it chronologically, it hops back and forth between present and past, each visit to the past clearing up and filling in the ""whys"" for the events happening in the here and now.  Like, for instance, I pieced together early on that this still beautiful, talented woman has been married four times and wondered ""how on earth??""  As the story unfolds in her skillful hands, it suddenly seems like the most, understandable natural progression.

"'Young Money' is an enthralling, exquisitely researched piece of work.  I think a lot of people would come into this book believing that the protagonists would - on the whole - be a rather insufferable lot...masters-of-the-universe-in-training and all that.  Nothing could be further than the truth.  What Kevin Roose presents instead is a hard-working, talented, conflicted, introspective group thrown into the cauldron of Wall Street's extraordinarily trying ""two and out"" intern program while simultaneously trying to feel their way into adulthood.  What differs with this group is that they're forced to navigate this extended frat rush at the very moment while Wall Street is trying to sift through the debris of its 2008 crash.  The result is a fascinating tale. Scoff if you may, but in Roose's compelling hand, it's hard not to shed a tear at the way he brings the story to a close for a couple of his subjects.Roose points out one positive outcome of the crash: while Wall Street will always attract the hard-core finance types (like the 'Black Diamond' student group he visits at Harvard), it also over the years pulled in talented would-be biologists, mathematicians, engineers and doctors, seduced initially by Wall Street draw and then trapped by the Golden Handcuffs.  Roose notes forcefully what's been lost by a process in which, for example, greater than 50% of the Princeton graduating class ended up in finance --- students giving up dreams, professions missing out on good talent, society getting lopsided by 'distributors' dominating 'creators.'  The crash has caused a major rethink by 21-year-olds that is borne out by statistics - finance isn't the draw at the margins that it was six-plus years ago.  Watching and documenting the frustrations of his book's subjects, Roose makes a forceful case why this is a good outcome for all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FX3YOKIQ3PZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO7GH54#wasThisHelpful","R2FX3YOKIQ3PZZ","A2QHM5HBSIXRL4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We saw '2 Autumns, 3 Winters' as part of the excellent Film Movement series.  It's a winning little film that succeeds despite itself.  It feels at times like a parody of a French film: characters talking directly to the camera, baring their feelings (typically, deeply introspective); depression and ennui; perennial art students who appear to be underemployed well into adulthood.However, writer/director Sbastien Betbeder ultimately triumphs: he keeps the length of this work to 'feels right' 91 minutes and delivers some likable characters.

"We saw this sweet, small French film (original title ""Et soudain tout le monde me manque"") as part of the Film Movement series.I'm a fan of French cinema even though many of the works can be deliberately difficult to navigate. Not so with 'The Day I Saw Your Heart.'  If you like Mlanie Laurent -- and it ought to be a crime not to -- you'll especially enjoy this film. Despite a definite downer of an event near the end, it will leave a smile on your face. And, it's one those films where you wake up the next day, re-consider it, and think, yeah, I definitely liked that film.  Two days later, that feeling will grow on you again.I especially loved one of the story's main concepts: that Michel Blanc, as Laurent's character Justine's Dad was such a good guy and so well-liked that all of Justine's many exes remained firmly in his life, well after she'd moved on from each of them.  The full extent of those relationships becomes clear at the movie's end.  It's a beautiful scene.

"Interesting and effective. Mixes up easily in 16 oz of water. Cold water is recommended -- this stuff has an interesting kind of vaguely cotton candy taste, along with a weird little tang or tickle which prevents you from enjoying the flavor too much. I was out doing yard work when this arrived and had worked up a pretty good sweat and was tired when I wrapped things up and came in. I drank some plain water and sat for a while, then made a sandwich and ate that then mixed up 16 ounces of this and tried it. Definitely hits the spot, these kind of drinks aren't supposed to taste good when you're not in need of them. But when you need them, they taste pretty great. Interesting product.

"Ideally sized case -- not too big. I'm comparing this Asus unit to a homebrew PC I put together using a full-size case. Now I find that The Asus will fit beneath some kitchen cabinets from the non-kitchen side of the counter and the full-sized case will not! It's a far more sophisticated looking PC because of its size. Not horsey looking (like my homebrew).Looks great. Everything is all put together. I'm used to assembling PCs on my own from various parts. This is luxurious and easy in comparison! It looks great and fits in a home or office environment. ""YEAH WELL MY HOMEBUILT COMPUTER HAS BITCHEN BLUE AND GREEN LED FANS, MAN"" Yes, so it does. As I was saying, this Asus desktop looks sophisticated, which inspires confidence.A turnkey computer, no strife or troubleshooting. That was a real treat. It boots via a big silver power button on the front. There is not a switch to fumble for on the power supply. The rear connections are comprehensive and easy to work with. There are two USB 3.0 connections on the front of the case.I have not been a big Windows fan in the past (user since 2.0), and I've got to say that Windows 10 is much better than I expected it to be. There have been a few bumps in the road, such as spending an hour trying to grasp why the screen saver won't come on, but I gather that's just the lay of the land with Windows. Coming from a Mac, it sometimes feel a bit rough or even barbaric, but nothing like the train wreck of Windows 8.Aside from the OS software, which is not an Asus product, I haven't had any issues whatsoever. Setup was swift and painless. The sound is very good thanks to the Asus audio software. I'm working on figuring out how to connect the rear audio jacks to my home stereo. This shipped with a mouse and keyboard, which was thoughtful. I used the monitor from my Windows 7 build, though it's tempting to buy a larger monitor to use with this desktop, which I am quite impressed with.The on-board graphics card is adequate, though I understand that people that play hard-core PC games might want to consider upgrading the video card AND the power supply. For my own fairly simple game uses and office/business functions, the hardware is more than enough.Being a Mac user, it's hard to accept that I'm using a Windows PC and enjoying it. Everything is very snappy thanks to the SSD and 8GB of RAM. My kid has a gaming PC we put together and he kind of looks down on this desktop, but this unit is quite affordable compared to the stack of parts we bought to build his computer. Two different animals.This is the nicest PC I've ever used. It looks great, it runs everything I can think of without any issues -- the third-party driver issue is something I guess Windows users deal with, it's something I haven't encountered before. There's a little digging and research involved to figure out how to make things work the way I expect them to work, but no real complaints. I had a Windows 8 computer and it was really frustrating, I couldn't figure it out. Windows 10 is a big improvement.The perfect home PC? Yes, that would be fair to say. Everything an average user would want or need, with a little space to upgrade this or that if you need hopped-up graphics or something like that. I am genuinely impressed. A really solid PC right out of the box, ready to roll. Zero headaches. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REDVTX51ZQ8PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QVM2AY#wasThisHelpful","REDVTX51ZQ8PQ","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BIG. Colorful package, beautifully produced and professionally designed. That inspires confidence. Neatly packaged, well-documented. Easy to assemble.This has FOUR separate filters. Or, as the manual states, four STAGES of filtration:First stage: The Pre-Filter which traps above 10 microns particles like human and animal hair.Second stage:  The Active Carbon Filter has powerful odor removal benefits and pre-cleans the air before it reaches the HEPA filterThird stage: The True HEPA Filter captures 99.97% of airborne allergens down to . Three micron particles in the air including dust, pollen, pet dander, virus, bacteria, mold, exhaust and moreFourth stage: The Exclusive Patented Nano ""Captur"" technology ""permanently destroys Formaldehyde, the most harmful indoor pollutant and a human carcinogen according to the WHO.""We have cats and, more to the point, live about 1.5 miles downwind from a freeway. I've experienced the endless grit that collects in our garage from so many rubber tires abrading themselves on the concrete freeway surface. I'd rather not run that crud through our lungs. Which is where air cleaners come into play.The first air filter device I bought was after a serious brush fire here in San Diego. The air was thick with smoke, everywhere. There was no escape from it. Your lungs ached if you went outside. School was cancelled. We just sat inside and tried not to breathe more than was necessary. The local stores were sold out of air filters, they just sadly shook their heads when I inquired. I ordered one from Amazon and was happy to pay for ultra-speedy delivery. The difference in air quality was immense.About four years after that, there was ANOTHER big brush fire, and the air filters made an enormous difference in our interior air. That first one was a circular Honeywell filter (Honeywell10500 Envirocare) which lasted a while but died when it was accidentally dropped.I bought three smaller Honeywell devices (Honeywell HHT-011), one for each bedroom, and a fourth (Honeywell Desktop HEPA Air Purifier, 16200) for the living room, all of which lasted quite a while. We have a Claritin CAP529-U, which up until I got my claws on this Rowenta device was the largest air filter we had. We also have a smaller ""desktop"" Holmes HAP9240 air filter which I have particular fondness for and a Holmes HAP9414-UA which functions well, but is a goofy football shaped filter that doesn't exactly blend in with its surroundings.My point being that I'm a firm believer in air filter devices, clean air is right up there with clean water in my book. Worth investing in. No one in my house suffers from allergies or anything like that. I just like clean air. It's a big deal to me.This device claims to ""capture 99.97% of pollution with True HEPA filtration including dust, pollen, pet dander, virus, bacteria, mold, exhaust and more"" which is pretty impressive.Rowenta, it says here,  started out in 1909 in Germany. I'd never heard of them before, but apparently they manufacture a large line of products.The neat thing about this Rowenta device is that it provides ""Smart Sensors"" which detect particulate matter in your interior air and automatically adjusts the air filter settings. There's a novel blue-purple-red set of lights which report on the quality of your interior air. There's also a filter change indicator onboard and a ""Night Mode"" to keep sound from the device down while you're sleeping. I actually like a fan running at night for the soft background sound it makes. Nice detail, anyway.First impressions are that this device is BIG and built like the proverbial battleship. Setup was easy, first unpack the four filters and then assemble them from the center out, starting with the ""Nanocaptur Filter"" which addresses formaldehyde in the interior environment, then a HEPA filter, then the Active Carbon Filter, and finally the Pre-filter for dust, hair, fur and lint. Everything snaps together with zero frustration.Everything fits beautifully with zero slop. This is easily the nicest air filter I've ever seen. It runs quietly and seems quite powerful. Moves a lot of air through the filters. My kids don't comprehend my interest in air filters and our water filters, but clean air and water are about as essential as anything can be in my humble opinion.A sensational addition to your home. A serious appliance, not another desktop hey-look-I'm-cleaning-the-air fan and filter. This thing is profound. I am impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JEDF2T2I8YOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SYDF0K#wasThisHelpful","R3JEDF2T2I8YOZ","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Small and sexy like some kind of classic 1960s Japanese sports car. James Bond would use a laptop like this one.Weighs next to nothing (2.6 lbs). Dark, smooth metal finish. Pry it open, there's a surprisingly large trackpad (4.5 x 2.5 inches) and a responsive keyboard. I wish the keyboard were backlit. Surprisingly comfortable keyboard. You click the bottom of the trackpad, which took me a minute to figure out. I have big hands and didn't have any trouble using the keyboard.This thing is so small and sleek that it reminds me of jewelry. Especially the very tiny power and HDD indicators, set in the front edge. Clearly visible, but out of the way and ultra-sophisticated in appearance. The whole laptop is groomed and polished, nothing clunky about it.On the left side there's the power plug socket, volume control, on/off, a Micro-SD card slot, Micro-HDMI port, a USB 3.0 socket and a USB 3.1 Type-C socket. On the right side there's the 3.5mm audio jack and a USB 2.0 socket.Packaging and initial setup is as smooth as silk, totally professional and seamless, no bumps in the road, no weird stuff. Cohesive and enjoyable.Windows 10 is quite nice! I am happily surprised!  There's a new browser called ""Edge"" which is impressive in that you can annotate, draw, and type on web pages, make notes on a web page as if it was paper. Very clever. I was not happy with Windows 8 and it looks like Windows 10 has addressed complaints people had with that OS iteration. I'm usually disparaging of Windows at best (user since Win 2) and this is actually not bad at all. Kind of a nice surprise.I very cautiously opened the laptop past 180 degrees very slowly. This did not feel natural or advisable. But it works great! You can use laptop mode, ""tent"" mode, ""stand"" mode and ""tablet"" mode with a virtual keyboard that appears.  The ""stand"" or ""easel"" mode, where you'd have the keyboard rotated to make a stand would be useful for presentations. Folding the keyboard all the way around behind the screen would give you a tablet. I'm actually kind of interested in using this in tablet mode streaming a movie from Amazon while on the treadmill. Have to use a bungie cord to secure the device, I guess.The touchscreen feature has a fairly extensive set of motions which I will need to use the included cheat sheet to learn. This is terra incognita for me. The whole touchscreen concept is kind of baffling at this  point in time.Connectivity is good, completely transparent. You may not want to run Photoshop on this device, but for general use, it's more than adequate, more than fast enough. It comes with a 64GB flash drive which is mighty snappy.I am VERY interested in finding software and a style that might work with the touchscreen to draw on. Electronic paper?! Sign me up. I'm not sure this is possible or if it would work that way, but I want to find out. I think this is just a daydream.Setup with painless from start to finish. Battery charged up in no time.The big-as-they-could-make-it display (1366 x 768) is saturated with color, very impressive. The sound is surprisingly good for the size of the laptop. I can't imagine how they achieved that. Now I'm reading that there's custom software onboard called ""Asus AudioWizard EQ software"" which delivers the sound via one of five preset modes. Nice touch.Overall surprisingly fast and powerful for its size. I'd read a complaint about the screen resolution not being up to 2015 standards but I certainly have zero complaints. It looks great and this is as powerful as any other modern computer I own and the form factor will make your jaw drop. I was expecting a kind of glorified tablet, but this is a full-on computer, no compromises or apologies. And the thing is you're not going to be lugging around a battleship-sized laptop. That's heavy baggage. This will fit easily in a backpack. Which means you'll take it with you when you're out of the house. Perfect size. Looks professional. You would not be embarrassed taking this with you to a business meeting. Charge lasts a surprising long time.Gorgeous little laptop, sexy as can be. Small and powerful. Can you imagine such a device back around, oh, 1995? Laptops weighed 15 pounds back then and could barely load a spreadsheet. It pains me to say that this little gem is as well put together and functional as a MacBook. I never thought I'd say that about any PC.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYKSADMD2GDUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014854RBK#wasThisHelpful","RYKSADMD2GDUI","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Truly gorgeous hardware. I was expecting flat chrome, it's more of sophisticated brushed surface which is really nuanced and rather stately looking compared to the cheap H*me D*pot hardware this is replacing. The subtle reflections are really appealing. This is beautifully designed and functional. Not terribly difficult to install given a cushion to lie on as  you tighten the fittings under the sink. A camping headlamp is really useful for this task IMHO.Compared to my old, squat, ugly bathroom fixture, this is like royalty. Makes the entire bathroom look a lot better. The height of the faucet is brilliant, and the paddle-like Hot/Cold controls are easy to operate even with wet or soapy hands.

"Big, substantial steam iron. Looks great. The water tank, however, is made of a dark plastic material that's impossible to see through, so it's difficult to know how much distilled water to add. Use only distilled water, it's a big deal.The B&D D3040 has a stiff tail coming off the rear end which holds the power cord up, a real plus. Instead of a dial, it's got a button that lights up LEDs indicating which fabric range temperature you've got it set at. Once you've added enough water (see above comment) it produces VOLUMINOUS amounts of steam, which I like.The face plate has deep channels for steam to escape and it's a fairly small footprint, which is a good thing, easy to maneuver.For comparison in the photos is an older steam iron I bought which has a translucent water tank, so you can easily see the water level. It also has a retractable cord, which is handy, but the cord is floppy and tends to get in the way when you're ironing. Compared to the Black & Decker, the steam volume is a bit on the anemic side (but that lime green is so cool!).The Black & Decker is a sensible, no-nonsense steam iron with all the fabric temperature settings you could want. A first-rate iron, if not for the somewhat weirdly hard to see water fill level.UPS delivered this by tossing it over my front gate. Fortunately, it didn't seem to be damaged. A decent iron would make a nice gift for a child who was moving into their own apartment or starting a new job. Ironing isn't a lot of fun, but it's a lot less odorous when you have a decent iron to work with, and this is more than a decent iron.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LJPS9S9B3SH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R3LJPS9S9B3SH2","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very lightweight. Sound is passable but not great, probably because you don't have a rubber earpiece jammed in your ear canal. Reasonably detailed sound but I find I keep fiddling with the right earbud -- can't quite get it where I want it. Seem to most accurately reproduce midrange sounds. Treble is a bit tinny, but, again, that may be due to the way the earbuds hang on the behind-the-ear plastic piece. I wear eyeglasses and the over-the-ear things do not interfere with my eyeglass frames. I'd reviewed a jam-it-in-your-ear set of Panasonic earbuds a week or two ago which had far superior sound, but they were more expensive. These are more than OK.

Still not wild about the fragrance but this product does a nice job keeping your hair looking good (I've got long hair).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQ7RLZIHMG6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0UK878#wasThisHelpful","RRQ7RLZIHMG6S","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was provided with a sample of this product at no cost to review it.They had me at ""lime green"" -- I *love* lime green, and the photos of this product don't do it justice, the photos are more of a green-yellow-green while the genuine article is a BRILLIANT pure lime green, nearly electric green!!! It's BIG AND HEAVY, plenty of heft. Very flexible, populated from edge to edge with thick, stubby rubber fingers. There's a lip that runs all the way around the mat.It's got an awful rubber smell right out of the (triple!) bags, but I've scrubbed it and I'm waiting for it to dry. I've got a spot in my kitchen right in front of my aquarium (you don't have an aquarium in your kitchen? why not?) where I conduct most of my kitchen business, preparing meals, emptying wine bottles, et cetera, and this is going to fit perfectly. No more wandering cutting boards! And it's large enough to collect glassware waiting to be washed.I like the material a lot, both the weight and flexibility, but the COLOR really carries the day -- fantastic splash of color that lights up your kitchen. Very clever product. When the smell is washed off, it'll be perfect! Quite tickled with this item.

"Details matter, and Slumberjack sleeping bags pay attention to all of them. I had a Slumberjack sleeping bag I took with me on a trip to Europe THIRTY years ago (!!!) which lasted and lasted through car camping and Cub Scout camping trips. So I was very happy to see this sleeping bag offered for review -- my daughter has outgrown her kid's sleeping bag. And when you're younger having a decent sleeping bag makes travel a lot easier (sleeping on friend's floors, etc). The channeled zipper is a really nice touch, it's no fun having a cold draft make your teeth chatter when you're outdoors. The pillow pocket is a clever idea. Yes, it's hard to roll up a new sleeping bag. Stick with it. The stitching in particular tells you this is a quality product. When you're camping you don't want to realize that a cheap sleeping bag with poor attention to details is not a good buy! This is not a toy, this is a high quality sleeping bag which you will use for years and years to come. It comes with a good quality stuff sack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZY3PP2YABK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA4I422#wasThisHelpful","R3TZY3PP2YABK2","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm impressed! Much better than I expected, starting with fragrance. I thought it was going to be really heavy-handed and perfume-like. The scent is actually agreeable, and leaves your skin smelling nice if you stick your nose right to your skin and sniff, but it doesn't radiate fragrance. I was dubious that the shampoo+conditioner thing was going to work, and it works quite well! Better than a separate conditioner! AND it works as a body wash! the stuff is a translucent deep blue, which is kind of trippy looking. Overall I'm really impressed, this stuff is much better than I expected on all three features -- cleaned my hair and left it surprisingly manageable, plus it cleans your skin and leaves you smelling very nice, but not flowery!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KZ3NBZG1GDBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T9R1VPS#wasThisHelpful","R1KZ3NBZG1GDBV","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A truly classic product. I remember my mother using it. It's more economical to buy the 200 ft roll. Ever notice that there's a dull side and a shiny side? It's actually TWO layers of aluminum foil, and if you're interested in Dutch oven cooking, try putting a sheet of Reynolds Wrap SHINY SIDE UP below your bottom coal layer -- it reflects more heat that way!The product is perfect and I could go on for some time about the nearly endless uses for it. Tenting meat once it comes off the grill is an obvious one. It handles leftovers well (aside from really spicy food, which melts it), is what you want to keep food warm or cover a roast or turkey once it's browned enough for you, you can hang a piece from the rabbit ears on your 1950s era television for better reception... double-wrap food going into the freezer but LABEL IT, would you? Otherwise you end up with a chest freezer full of mystery parcels.The one complain I have about Reynolds Wrap does not have to do with the product, but with packaging, which up until a few years ago was fairly substantial and strong enough to hold on to the roll of foil! Then it was made lighter and cheaper and it didn't hold the roll and really fell apart by the time you got down to the core of the Reynolds Wrap. When I opened the shipping box of this review item, the box was broken open on both ends! The lightweight cardboard they use for the package isn't strong enough to have the push-in die-cut tabs hold the roll. I had actually e-mailed Reynolds about this a few years ago. The box isn't strong enough. Make it like it used to be. It used to be perfect.I think there's a market for somebody who could make a decent cardboard box for Reynolds Wrap. Seriously. I would buy one and use it.This is a product you NEED in your kitchen. It's that simple. There is no substitute. I have nothing but good things to say about this product. And thank goodness they haven't gone insane and tweaked their packaging art or colors over the years. Perhaps they realize there is no need to change this absolutely beloved and iconic product. But, guys, spring for a decent box, would you?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VPWDP0L7MW5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNT0Y2M#wasThisHelpful","R3VPWDP0L7MW5A","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOVELTY is an often overlooked feature of life. And this product is most definitely novel! An automated cat litter box? Who thinks up these things!? AND IT WORKS! My cats are fascinated by this thing. Putting it together was something of a puzzle that my daughter and I worked out. The instructions leave a bit to be desired, but eventually we got it put together.Sure enough, 15 minutes after the cat has vacated both itself and the little box, a motor crawls the length of one side, pushing a metal screen, which then dumps its load into a narrow tray for disposal. Very amusing to watch in operation.  A little weird sound, but not terribly noisy. It's a little longer than our other litter boxes. No cover. But the cats use it and watch it carefully as it harvests their deposits. It's difficult to say who is the most amused, the cats or myself. The color is battleship grey and it ships with a supply of long, thin bags meant to contain the collected deposits along with a very nice ""litter catching"" kind of carpet.A genuine novelty for you and your cats. I'd never seen anything like this before. And it appears to work fairly well!---A couple of weeks later: This automatic litter box has no cover, which is kind of an issue. It's not super efficient at cleaning urine clumped litter at the bottom of the tray. The noise is  a little odd late at night and my cats are highly suspicious of the device when it goes through its  cleaning cycle. Might be a cat-eating monster. Overall, and it pains me to report this because I do admire the gadget quality of this thing, it's not a particularly robust solution.  A cover would help a great deal, but the wire fence that collects deposits isn't aggressive enough to be effective. It is quite a novelty, however, and that's worth something.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDUVTECQB1Q3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QU6C3TO#wasThisHelpful","RHDUVTECQB1Q3","A3T1LD0C65QCWK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3T1LD0C65QCWK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
