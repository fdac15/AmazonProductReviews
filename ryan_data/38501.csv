"Nice mats that do what they are supposed to do - help release foods from you cookie sheets.  You also have the advantage of not having to wash those nice cookie sheets unless of course you dribble something onto the edges when loading the mats.  Never have used one of these before and I'm happy I bought them because it cuts down on cleaning and assures me everything comes off the cookie sheet in perfect condition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB8AVHUKO6UQ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00629K4YK#wasThisHelpful","RB8AVHUKO6UQ2","ABVCQPI1GMONN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVCQPI1GMONN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really like this stuff - makes cleaning the iPad easy along with my iMAC and my MacBook Pro.  My laptop sits in my kitchen and it is amazing how much greasy film seems to settle on the screen so I clean that screen regularly along with my iPad.  Eight ounces will go a long ways and last a long time.  Takes only a small 1-2 pump spray onto a microfiber cloth, yes you will need one of those microfiber dusting cloths, to clean each screen.

"Or anything else you wish to lay some weight onto when cooking.  I use this press mostly for floured bacon, paninis and sometimes chicken.  I have found that the size is larger than some of the other presses out there and a bit larger than a Lodge press that I've used for years.  The Lodge is heavier but smaller so depending on what I'm making will determine which press I use.  This one works very well when making two sandwiches at the same time and fits nicely in a Lodge cast iron 13 1/2"" fry pan or even the 8"" size.  Nice press and I'm happy with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ1CTMNOOVZ2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000DDVV9#wasThisHelpful","RJ1CTMNOOVZ2X","ABVCQPI1GMONN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVCQPI1GMONN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This pizza cutter can really cut through a super large pizza in a hurry.  Nice and sharp and does not take a lot of effort to use.  My only recommendation would be to use a cheap wood chopping board that you slide your pizza onto because you can nick up a good board when you rock and roll this guy!  Love this pizza cutter, does take up some room in a drawer so keep that in mind as to where you plan to store it.

"Every time I make tofu I'm always amazed what happens when you add the Nigari - pure magic!  I make about 8-10 pounds of tofu at one time which is 25 cups of soy milk (made from scratch from 6 cups of soaked beans) using 8-10 tsp. of Nigari coagulant and I get the most beautiful fluffy curds to press into blocks.  I find the flavor of the tofu is sweet and natural without any nasty lemon or vinegary flavor that you can get when using lemon or vinegar.  One pound of Nigari will last me maybe a year or more so I have lots of tofu in my future to eat....love the stuff!  Will buy again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VKKFK2P0R6AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019L8KUG#wasThisHelpful","R1VKKFK2P0R6AS","ABVCQPI1GMONN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVCQPI1GMONN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the title says, I was curious about his product and whether I might like it.  It's a very interesting ""sugar"" made from the juice of the coconut palm tree NOT the fruit!  Has a taste unlike anything I've ever tasted, anyway that I can remember, except maybe sugar that has been burned!  It does not taste like brown sugar, date sugar, white sugar, raw sugar and it definitely is not a neutral flavor.  Do I like it?  Not really,  because it leaves a peculiar taste in whatever you eat or drink - sort of spoils the flavor of the drink or your oatmeal or whatever you put it on or in.  If this doesn't bother you and you don't care about tasting the original flavor of what you are eating or drinking then you might find this to your liking.  I will use the sugar until gone, sparingly, but I won't buy it again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSQI806FS20UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TGH4CK#wasThisHelpful","RSQI806FS20UT","ABVCQPI1GMONN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVCQPI1GMONN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love these bottles.  I first bought them one at a time but then finally decided to buy a whole 12 pack.  I transfer milk, cream, buttermilk, kefirs, juices, teas and even keep one filled with water on my night stand.  I have never used them to can with so I can't speak to how well they work but they are wonderful to get all those nasty plastic/cardboard containers out of my refrigerator and look so much better on the table - I'm fussy about those things - and I love that icy cold liquid that comes out of them too.  If you have a need for this many glass bottles for liquids then by all means go for it because they are a much better price when you buy them in bulk.

"March 4, 2014  UPDATEI bought this large 16 oz. bottle on January 27th, 2014 for $69 from Amazon and based on the reviews currently running (July 2014) on this product I would be cautious in buying again especially since $80 is a lot of money to wind up throwing out.  I believe I might have received an older formulation and therefore my stevia seems to be fine.  Here is a list of the ingredients as per their label on the bottle I currently have:Stevia Extract (Stevia rebudiana) (leaf)What is NOT in the bottle:soy, yeast, gluten, wheat, milk, synthetics, artificial colors or flavors, msg, preservatives, saccharin, aspartame, sucaralose, or artificial sweeteners.If they have changed the formula since January, then my review is based on the bottle that I purchased in JANUARY 2014.  There are no alcohol extracts or corn sweeteners in my bottle of Stevia either - NONE!  Here is a phone number if you wish to contact the company regarding their current formulation:  800-753-4372 (HERB).  The company is located at 2220 West 2nd Ave. #1, Eugene, OR  97401,[...], info@nunaturals.com.I DO AGREE with many of the reviewers here that this stuff does NOT taste all that great on food!  I've tried it in a variety of solid foods and I don't care for it.  Where it shines is in smoothies, iced drinks like tea, blender made ice creams and some fruit juices otherwise I use Splenda (wish I didn't have to but it's that or sugar).January, 2014 originally posted review.Have been using this product and buying in the 1 oz. size (5 or more at a time) for about a year.  Do the math, it is SO much cheaper to buy in the 16 oz. size.  Save your little bottles and refill when you need to.  Okay, the Stevia is fantastic in drinks, smoothies, ice cream but I don't like it on my oatmeal (not sure why) but it leaves a funny taste in my mouth but in my tea I love it.  Since drinks are really about all the sweet things I eat - or drink in this case - this is a wonderful substitute for using sugar or any nasty artificial sweeteners.  I'll continue to buy as long as I can get the larger 16 oz. size and there isn't anything now wrong with the current formulation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K27F8973XUZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HC0OVG#wasThisHelpful","R1K27F8973XUZQ","ABVCQPI1GMONN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVCQPI1GMONN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Packed from beginning to end with lots information on the why's and then the how's of eating and making fermented foods.  I have made sauerkraut and the fermented salsa so far working with both a brine and then the whey method for the salsa.  The salsa tasted like regular fresh homemade but with a pronounced tang.  So far I've only managed to get 2 weeks of fermenting on my cabbage before I've run out of jars in the refrigerator and have to break into another 3 liter jar that is fermenting (3L will hold approx. 3 heads of cabbage shredded and packed) - it's that good.  Have to make more and faster.Side note for information sake.  I've been making my fermented foods in 3L glass jars with the bale and rubber gasket method that I learned about on MOFA (Maine Organic Farmer's Assoc.) and figured it sounded like a less expensive and easier way to go rather than spending big bucks for a fermenting crock.  Check them out and you decide.The only recommendation I can seriously make about buying the book, is to buy the book,  skip the e-book download if you are really serious about using this information.  I bought the e-book and have been about to pull my hair out on a few occasions using it on my iPad.  The pages DO NOT CORRELATE correctly with the numbers so finding a page is very difficult, search pages do not go to the correct page or read it with a pen and make notes.  You will want to refer back and forth when you are reading descriptions of recipes, making Simple Brine, etc. and try to find them, eeeeck!  Buy a used book because you probably will be using it enough that it will be fairly used and loved before you know it anyway and only slightly more than the e-book.Great book, full of tons of information, easy to read and understand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROSUY64NBPTI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E36E7JW#wasThisHelpful","ROSUY64NBPTI3","ABVCQPI1GMONN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABVCQPI1GMONN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great beginner program for a kid that wants to learn the basics.  The free version has some great videos that describe the most basic strategies in a very funny and entertaining format.

"I ordered two of these so my sons could play together.  This one was far less expensive, but at least as good as the ones from the zoo and Disney.  The bubble mix blasted out bubbles quickly, without getting all over their arms and hands, and when it ran out, I used plain old bubble mix, or just a dash of dish washing detergent in water with some glycerin.  Glycerin seems to be the magic ingredient that makes bubbles strong, and the $5 bottle I bought from the bakery aisle has made gallons of bubble mix.Anyway, this light up gun makes a great whirring sound, works well with my homemade bubble mix as well as the store bought stuff, and was definitely worth the few bucks I spent to buy them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HYJOM6N6WFHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004D5EMD4#wasThisHelpful","R3HYJOM6N6WFHP","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The ships are cheap plastic that you cut off on a grid, and the various pieces that stick out make it hard to put pegs in the spots surrounding the ships, or to put the ships next to each other.  The peg holders don't close well, so pieces will fall out unless you put them in a plastic bag.  One player has red ships, so the red pegs didn't work well to mark ""hits"".

"We have been using Funtainers for over a year, and decided to add two more to our collection when I saw this great design.  It is holding up well in the dishwasher and my sons love them.  Instead of boring sandwiches, we pour hot water into the thermos to warm them up, then heat up leftovers and put them in.  The food is still piping hot at lunchtime, but if you don't heat up the thermos, the food will cool and grow bacteria.This will not fit in a standard child's size lunchbox, so make sure you order check the dimensions and buy the appropriate size lunchbox.These don't leak, even when tipped on their sides, but I am a little annoyed that I now have three different types of Funtainers and the tops are not interchangeable.

"My son loves face paint, so I bought this because just about every design requires a nice thick white coating or lines somewhere in the design.  Unfortunately, there is no way a little kid is going to sit still long enough to apply multiple layers of white, and even when I just did one quick layer, it smeared off onto his clothes (or my clothes!) as he ran around.I finally did some research and discovered Wolfe face paint - it's the brand generally used by professional face painters and it quickly spreads a nice thick white that doesn't smudge.  Snazaroo is a nice, inexpensive brand and easy to apply, but for white, I suggest splurging on Wolfe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHFJIWTF6OBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6W2GW#wasThisHelpful","R1KHFJIWTF6OBI","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After buying a knock-off cheap loom that broke, I caved and bought the original version of this.  While the plastic hook is nice, the new metal hook, which we just got, is a nice upgrade and this is a few bucks cheaper than the $20 I spent at the peak of the Rainbow Loom craze.  If you haven't tried the loo yet, you are in for a treat.  It's a really soothing, relaxing activity, and the patterns and designs have moved far beyond bracelets.  I just saw a dress that made a fortune at auction made completely on a Rainbow Loom!The rubber bands are also higher quality than the cheaper knock off brands, but be warned: no matter how careful you are, you are going to find these bands everywhere!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKI5WPXIBG96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K18YIOU#wasThisHelpful","R2YKI5WPXIBG96","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a winner for the right crowd.  Much like chess, this isn't a game where its worthwhile to teach someone all of the rules and details if you only want to play this game one time.  The game forces everyone to manage through limited constraints and adjust as the situation rapidly changed.  If that excites you, buy this game.  If it sounds frustrating, you will beg someone to take over for your game within two rounds.  The Dominant Species fanatics in our group have careers in design, consulting, IT and manufacturing.  The psychiatrists and artists don't seem to enjoy it as much.I recently attended a game for new players.  The first round, as we tried to understand the mechanics, took forever (again, think about how long your first game of chess took).  We were a pretty lighthearted group, so everyone brought their different styles to it.  One person simply wanted to control the spread of glaciers, another added new lands, another wanted to get as many new species as possible on the board, while another tried to adapt to the rapidly changing planet by increasing their food choices - and all of these were equally great strategies.As the night went on, we realized no matter what you had planned, circumstances change and you need to adjust your plans.  This is why the first few rounds took so long, because when our plan disappeared, we had to learn to adjust.  But by the end, we were all laughing and enjoying the fact that no matter what had happened earlier in the game, there were always plenty of opportunities to come back from a tough spot - and that's pretty rare for a board game, since most have a leader pretty early, then the game chugs along on autopilot.We all had amazing moves and horrible ones, and it was nice  to have one person somewhat familiar with the game to guide us through.  There are quite a few Youtube tutorials that can also help.  It took us four hours to play, but I'm fairly sure it will only take 2-3 hours moving forward, and once we get a bit more practice and calculate the running scores more quickly, we will be even faster.  We also really enjoyed chatting about the game as we played, which probably slowed us down even more.Overall, I can see why this game is addictive for certain personality types.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRJ6F8TCTO5JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0045WCG8I#wasThisHelpful","RRJ6F8TCTO5JJ","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wolfe face paint is the best face paint on the market.  It stays bright and thick for hours, and with just a spritz of water, goes on well with a sponge for full coverage or with a brush for fine lines.  Once it dries, it won't rub off on clothes, which is fantastic. The white and black are generally used by just about every professional face painting company I have asked. This set is a great variety of  the basic colors you can use to all of the most popular looks, and this amount (30g of each color, plus the case) will allow you to paint hundreds of faces.  A little bit of this stuff goes a very long way.Buy this if you are looking for a good variety and have no color preferences, but if you want some flexibility, check out other suppliers that will allow you to customize your colors for a slightly higher price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FYY8834K5N90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DC477OI#wasThisHelpful","R3FYY8834K5N90","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This toy, when complete is amazing.  There are enough characters to conduct some truly great play fights between the opposing sides, and there are plenty of moving parts and vehicles to keep kids entertained for hours.  That huge lion mouth is a drawbridge that opens and closes.  There are weapons on the sides that shoot little sticks several feet.  And (my personal favorite), there are motorcycles under waterfalls that fly out on rails, pushing the waterfall out of the way as it rolls out of the temple.Of course, you have all of the good old fashioned lessons that are built into any Lego set.  Patience, attention to detail, and most importantly, a willingness to tear apart your hard work if you did something wrong and need to try again.

"This toy is fantastic.  My kids always loved playing with this at other homes, so I finally got one.  I have watched kids ranging in age from 1 to 8 waiting in line for a ride.  I'm generally pretty risk averse, but this toy is fairly low to the ground, does not move very quickly, and the dip seems to really thrill the kids.  After all of the hours I've watched children play on this, I have never seen anyone fall off.  Also, since the ride is very quick and the car is easy to push back up, three or four preschoolers can easily play on this together without fighting.This is a pretty big toy, so for most people, this best fits outside, where the kids will also run up and down the hills and scoot the little car around.  If your ground isn't perfectly flat, the toy seems to work well anyway.  It's light, and my kids have moved this thing all over my lawn.  Like all Step 2 products, it's also incredibly well made.  Even though this toy is usually outside, I haven't heard of a single person who threw their roller coaster away because it broke.  Instead, they get passed down over and over again as kids sadly realize their legs are too long to even try riding this thing anymore.If you want to get a young child a gift they will adore and their friends will adore, buy this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYFA47C7C48EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005KBVD#wasThisHelpful","RYFA47C7C48EN","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The pad seems a little too sensitive and flashed in and out of various programs and the home page if my fingers got anywhere near the mousepad but chalked this one up to user error and figured I would eventually learn to type without my hands approaching the space bar.

I even prepacked snacks for the kids to make it easier to pack for lunches, and use this to fill thermoses so the screw top threads don't get dirty when the lid goes on.

"On impulse, I bought a bunch of looms for Christmas from a brick and mortar store (An amazon prime member went to a store?  Unbelievable, but true.) the kids were thrilled to open and use them, but within a month, they were all broken.  So I came back here to wonderful Amazon to buy the real ones.  They are so much sturdier they are even heavier than the cheap knock-offs.The kids all love them, it's not tv or a video game, it's quiet and calming and the little kids are very proud to be able to make gifts for loved ones.  As fads go, this is one to jump on.  Let's hope they transition to a crochet or knitting fad because those little bands are everywhere!I ordered this from Amazon last week, and it's the real one.Edit: Rainbow Loom has updated their product with a metal hook instead of a plastic hook.  The new hook is really nice, so its worth paying an extra few bucks for the newer kit.Please ""like"" this review if you found it useful so others will see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSKBB9FAO5HHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DMC6KAC#wasThisHelpful","RSKBB9FAO5HHU","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Like many other reviewers have stated, the worms die. (Btw, the kit doesn't include any worms). Worms like darkness and only sneak up to the light to grab food, which is decaying plant matter. So if you really want your kids to keep worms, get a five gallon bucket or a rubbermaid container and drill some holes into the side and bottom (put something underneath to catch leaks), then have the kids shred cardboard boxes and/or newspaper for bedding, and throw in your veggie scraps - about a 50/50 mix between paper and food is great. Then throw in worms. When your kids want to see the worms, grab a piece of the cardboard out and it will have plenty. if you really enjoy it after a few months, get a worm composter, or get a second holey bucket, fill with fresh stuff and the worms will migrate to the new food and you can toss your wonderfully rich worm compost (that will still have some worms and eggs) into a garden.Toy worm farms and ant farms are far too sterile to support bug life and you will end up with very disappointed kids that feel like they failed. If you make the cheap composter, your kids will get to see the circle of life, and it will even cut down on your trash!If this was helpful, please ""like"" this :)","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD7NX39E1ENH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00114Y8D4#wasThisHelpful","RD7NX39E1ENH7","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these from a neighbor because i thought they would be a great addition to our magnatiles and didn't realize how small they would be.  After the fatalities, and the final recall of magnetic buckyballs, it seems its not a wise idea to have strong magnets near children, because even ten-year-olds have eaten the buckyballs.  These are not just a regular choking hazard - if a child swallows two of these, they need to get to an ER to see if they can be pulled out, either through the throat or surgically.  I can't trust that these won't be swallowed, even by a guest, and if they are swallowed, the kids might not tell me since these seem harmless.I'll let my husband take them to the office - maybe they will make a fun desk toy.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IP4A3E223L9G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000IOK5I0#wasThisHelpful","R2IP4A3E223L9G","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In the last two days, we have spent hours making dozens of things.  From a flood detector, to a motion sensor and am radio, every contraption has been exciting to turn on, and all of us know far more about electricity, light, sound and motors.My only complaint is the guidebook.  I wish they made it more basic, perhaps with flash cards to explain each piece so you wouldn't have to flip through the book.

"My two boys (6 and 2) love these.  The soft clicking as they snap together is such a soothing sound, and unlike Legos, these some apart with a good push.  Since I feel like our house is quickly becoming a Lego museum full of masterpieces that my kids never want to dismantle, I appreciate the fact that these are actually fun to knock down.There are only four large squares.  As I watched my son open it and start to build a box, I was worried that he would be frustrated by the fact there were only four large squares and a cube needs six. But he immediately realized he could snap together four small squares to make a large square, then snap together two small triangles to make a small square!  Everything that people have written about the open ended play, spacial awareness and educational value is totally true.  It's a great lesson in shapes, but lead to my only issue with these.But only complaint is about the long triangles, and I can tell this is going to drive all of us a little nuts.  When put together, they ALMOST make a circle.  Literally, it is a crack away from a huge gorgeous circle.  There are 360 degrees in a circle, so can't imagine why they wouldn't have made these exactly 30 degree angles to all fit together.  You can't even shove another piece into the gap, and the magnets aren't strong enough to allow us to pull them together into a bowl.  I'm going to put away half of these pieces so my kids stop trying to ""solve"" this challenge.My other suggestion is to buy a light box as a building surface.  They are pricey, but if you are already paying over $100 for these, look into a light box for the amazing effect of glowing pieces.  The light box is also so attractive that it encourages them to keep the pieces there, instead of scattered all over the house.If you found this review useful, please ""like"" this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REUSY2A4E1SIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000CBSNRY#wasThisHelpful","REUSY2A4E1SIY","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have two little boys that would grind down all of our pencils if given an electric sharpener.  But those plastic ones crack too easily, which can leave a blade exposed (!) and are hard to hold.  Frustrated, I looked for the metal sharpeners I had when I was a kid and here they are!  One sharpener lasts for years, and if, after a few years, the blade is dull, you can replace the blade, so its pretty environmentally friendly too.  The little dents make them easy for small hands to hold.This is the safest way to let children sharpen their own pencils, because the razor is sharp enough to do the job well, but the entire container is strong enough to safely secure the razor in a way that the child can't cut themselves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DCDYKNHWRRGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001BYK7MK#wasThisHelpful","R2DCDYKNHWRRGR","A3JVYKAWHZK4QX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JVYKAWHZK4QX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This ladies watch is a VERY large design from the face piece to the wrist strap.  The watch face has a diameter of 36mm - if you look at the pictures on the Amazon website, they show several illustrations to help buyers visualize the difference between the different sizes.  The 36mm size is quite large - in fact, it is nearly the size of my husband's watch.  The watchband is slightly wider than 1/2 inch.  If you are small boned, I think this watch will swallow your wrist and you should look for a smaller design unless you prefer a really large statement timepiece.The design is gorgeous - the crystal pieces brilliantly shine and give the watch a luxurious feel and look. The pictures on the Amazon website perfectly illustrate the detail of this watch - it looks like a piece of fine jewelry.  I have a 6-3/4"" wrist and I had to remove 2 of the links to have this watch fit better (and I still have about 1/2"" width looseness after these two links were removed so the fit is now perfect).Although I'm not usually a fan of watches that don't have numbers the entire way around the watch-face, since this one has 6 large roman numerals  (rather than the typical 4) - it's easier to read the time.This watch arrives beautifully packaged however if you are giving this as a gift, there are several pieces of cling plastic (to prevent smudging when being packaged) that you will want to remove before presenting your gift.  The Lucien Piccard brand has a 5-year warranty.I am hopeful that the gold plating over stainless steel is durable and holds up through daily wear - if it wears prematurely, I will update this review to include this information.  This watch is truly beautiful - provided you are in the market for a large bold design, I don't think you will have any regrets over this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A75AMLAV917C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXI5CY#wasThisHelpful","R1A75AMLAV917C","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Horrible - I am stunned by the favorable reviews for this product and I've been scratching my head wondering if I possibly received a ""bad batch"" however I rather doubt it considering that it's a case of 12 with 3 different flavors.No, I did not expect this to be a sugary flavored sparkling water (it only has 10 calories per bottle and I prefer low calorie drinks) however I did expect that the ""flavors"" would actually resemble the fruits that they represent.  I cannot distinguish ANY of the individual flavors (Blackberry Pear, Raspberry Watermelon and Mandarin Lime) and each flavor tastes very artificial.All three of the flavored waters list only 4 ingredients on the bottle:  carbonated water, organic cane sugar, certified organic natural flavors and citric acid.  They are very carbonated (not a complaint merely an observation) but the taste of all 3 flavors is absolutely terrible (some of my tasters actually spit the product out rather than swallowing it - it was truly that offensive tasting to some people).  NO ONE in my family will drink these Sparkling waters and they leave a strange aftertaste in your mouth.  I don't want to belabor my point but I actually looked the product up on Amazon just to ensure that this wasn't a mixer of some sort that was supposed to be used in conjunction with other ingredients - it's not, it's a stand-alone beverage.I'd strongly recommend trying a single bottle (if you can find it locally at your grocery store) before buying the case to ensure that you like the taste.This was shipped in perfect condition.  It was packaged very securely and although these are glass bottles, they rest securely in an egg-shell like cardboard packaging material to ensure that they will not break during shipping.  That is about the only redeeming comment I can make about this product.","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IW6O7MV29TQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSW3AQW#wasThisHelpful","R1IW6O7MV29TQQ","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There squirties are adorable and are the perfect size for toddlers to grasp and play with.  Like any type of squirting toy, mold can (and will) form on the inside through time.  I find that the easiest way to sanitize these toys is to use a bleach solution every few days and allow this solution to remain inside the squirties for a few minutes.  I then squirt out the bleach solution and rinse it out with clean water.  This takes several minutes but I'm assured that the babies are not placing bacteria and moldy toys into their mouth.The tubes are seperate rubbery plastic that the 4 animals sit in.  You will therefore receive 8 pieces with this set.  The animals (owl, bee, puppy and monkey) have little indentations on the sides of their round bodies where your child can put their fingers to more easily squeeze them.

"We have a 150 pound dog who is about 20 pounds overweight.  We like to have occasional treats to give him to reinforce good behavior and to bribe him when he is over-excited. When you have an over exuberant large breed dog, getting him back in line is like trying to wrestle a bear.  Having some tasty treats handy can gain his compliance pretty quickly.This treat is small (roughly 1""x1"") and crunchy.  The real beauty is that they are only 19 calories, gluten free, and made WITHOUT meat by-products, wheat, corn, soy, artificial colors or preservatives.My dog loves these chicken/turkey sweet potatoe bars.

"This bag is warm but bulky.  I had a devil of a time pulling it free from the stuff sack and once free - it puffed out and is very soft and fluffy however this also makes it a total pain when trying to compactly re-roll it to fit back inside the stuff sack.  You will want to purchase some type of sleeping bag strap to cinch the bag tight before trying to place it back in the stuff sack (or skip the sleep sack all together once you use the straps).  Otherwise, you will be rolling and squeezing, re-rolling and compressing, until you finally realize that unless you plan on rolling this bag up with two people where you both are pulling it taunt and using your knees to compress and push out all the air - it simply will not fit back in the stuff sack.This sleeping bag is reasonably priced and it is long and wide - feels very comfortable, even without a pad.  I like that you could zip two same-sized bags together to accommodate two sleepers.  The color is attractive without being so feminine that it would emasculate men if they needed to use this bag (and it can accommodate sleepers up to 6"" tall).The draft tube is a nice feature to prevent air from leaking in through the zipper.  The zipper however constantly gets caught on the silky material inside of the bag (opposite side of draft tube).  Zipping and unzipping is therefore challenging - I only unzip this as far as needed to crawl inside and then I use 2 hands, one to pull the zipper tab and my other to push the material flat so that the zipper doesn't get caught.If you are a hardcore hiker/camper, I think that you'd prefer a more compact sleeping bag.  In addition, the rectangular bag is a common design however the mummy sleeping bags are warmer in colder weather.  Yes, you can cinch the top closed in this bag however since it is not in the shape of your head, I feel like I am smothering in this sleeping bag when I pull the top partially closed to keep in the heat.This is a nine bag for warmer temperatures (for me - no cooler than 40 degrees) and for recreational campers (i.e.:  you drive to a site and pitch a tent) however in my opinion, it is too thick to make it practical when you are hiking and you are trying to conserve space while carrying your other gear and it's not as warm as mummy sleeping bags.  In addition, the catching of the zipper drives me a little crazy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8KRK2ZZZ42GM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA4I40Y#wasThisHelpful","R8KRK2ZZZ42GM","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids enjoy making these clings but I personally hate the mess.  Once the gel is poured into the mold, the tiny jar needs cleaned out.  You have to use paper towels to wipe out the interior and the lids however they are such teeny tiny containers that they are difficult to clean (and they have to be cleaned before you make another batch).  DO NOT make the mistake that I did by throwing the jars in hot soapy water to clean them - this just makes even more of a mess as the gel residue gets slick and simply balls up on the plastic and is almost impossible to remove.  You can also simply let the residue harden in the jars and then peal it out - I find that is the easiest solution when we are finished using this game.The instructions claim that the materials that made the clings could stain.  We only use this product under a piece of large flat cardboard.Once the cling gel is made, it sets up quickly so kids have to be really quick about pouring the gel into the mold.  The instructions claim that it must be used in 5-minutes but I think it's significantly less than that.  When we tried to make 3 colors to swirl the colors in several molds, the first color we made was already half-way hardened in the jar after all 3 colors were made (which was under 3 minutes - and the hardened color was then unusable).  Each jar of cling gel is enough for only one of the included molds.  Swirling colors is really a ""learned"" technique.  We've tried it several times and the results have been rather ugly but filling a mold half-way with one color and then a different color for the next half looks pretty nice (we just let the colors gently blend in the middle by merely running together).Filling the jars with the 2 mixtures to create the clings is difficult as the first gel that you squeeze in the tube is clear.  You're therefore squeezing this CLEAR liquid into a tiny CLEAR jar until it reaches the ""fill-point"" which is identified with CLEAR lettering and a CLEAR ridged line of where you need to stop (do you get my drift?).  I feel like I need to use a lighted magnifying glass to help my kids accurately fill the jars and even when you add the ""color"" gel, it sinks to the bottom so you are still trying to gauge if you've added enough of the colored mixture by assessing if the clear liquid has risen to the next letter and line which is (you guessed it) more CLEAR lettering (Agh.......if only they included bottles that had black lines on them so you didn't have to squint to see the fill lines).It's an interesting concept but it's a rarity to get the clings to remove from the molds without having slightly torn edges.  Having said that, they are not ""perfect"" clings but my kids think they are AMAZING and immediately placed them on our windows throughout the house and in their bedrooms.  They cling well to windows and you can rinse them off when they get dusty (or if you drop them on the floor and they pick up lint) however the longer they are hung on the windows, the less flexible they become and they loss some of their cling stickiness.  They tear REALLY easily and I actually ripped one in half while trying to re-position it on our window.I should also note that my kit was missing one of the jar lids so Crayola's quality assurance is slipping a bit (you can't use the jars without a lid so we have to rotate and share lids).  I only note this for information purposes - this problem didn't negatively impact my rating.The refill kits for the clings is pretty expensive (like half the price of the toy itself).  Additionally, there is no way to store everything back in the box after it is assembled and you cannot remove the orange ""activator chamber"" (the directions suggest that once it snaps in place that removing it will probably break it) so it doesn't fit in the box well which could lead to some pieces getting lost.  Sigh.....I really wish that manufactures would consider permanent storage (sturdier and slightly larger boxes) when they package toys that have many pieces so they could conveniently be placed back in the box.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UFDCW52UQOTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFWP2XE#wasThisHelpful","R1UFDCW52UQOTF","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This operates like a glorified magnetic drawing board.  It didn't take but a week before this toy had dent impressions on the screen and some of the magnetic filament was permanently marked on the bottom of the screen and could not be erased.  The small computerized screen (black imagery on a gray pixel background) is fairly hard to see since it does not light up (and it's very difficult to see in low-light).  The crisp images on all the photos is an over-representation of the clarity of the images that you'll see.  There are buttons for multiple activities (lessons, drawing to music, guess the picture).  Unfortunately, many of the spoken directions or instructions for the lessons are so long that by the time this is finished, my niece (who is almost 4) totally lost interest in the activity.  This is not a stand-alone system where the device recognized right and wrong answers - you'll need to shadow your child while they are involved in the lessons to ensure they are accurately following the instructions (this isn't a complaint - merely an observation).  My niece did like the drawing to music feature.  A pack of stencils is included with this product for children to practice tracing images and these stencils are stored in the back.  The 2 magnets that came with the game also fit securely in their slots so they wouldn't easily fall out.  With all the ""high-tech"" educational technology that is available for kids - these activity centers seem really primitive.  If I were considering buying something like this, I'd probably pass on the ineffective low-tech computerized aspect and opt for a better quality magnetic table for drawing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUE4UA49C9ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUZH4LK#wasThisHelpful","RIUE4UA49C9ZQ","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fold up design allows young users to help when carrying their equipment to and from the field (it's very lightweight).  Assembly is easy.  Once the 2-piece blue base is put together and the bendable rubber hinges are attached, you CANNOT take the two pieces apart to store it back in the box (if you were interested in doing that).  When folded up, the bat and tee fit inside the base and the balls fit somewhat snugly in the ball openings.To lock the 2-piece blue base into its open position, you turn a plastic knob clockwise to lock the base in the open position and counter-clockwise to unlock it.  The image of the lock which shows which direction to turn the knob (clockwise or counter-clockwise) is almost impossible to see because the color all blends together (its blue on blue - you really can't see it unless you tilt it to the light).  In addition, when you fold these two pieces to turn it into the carrying case it wants to stick in the open position and one of the two latches on my product was loose and it wouldn't stay locked when it was in the fold-away position.As previously mentioned, once this fold away batting tee is assembled, it will no longer fit in the cardboard box.  I would have much rather had this product arrive assembled (which would have only required the box to be about 1-/1/2"" wider but it could have also been about 3"" shorter.  That way you would have the option of keeping the sturdy box, fold everything up, and then place the folded unit inside the box during longer storage period (such as through winter to keep it clean).This is an average batting tee set with an above average price tag (I would have pegged the price to be around $12-15- it's actually double that).  The brightly colored tee screws into the blue base and if your batter misses the ball and hits the tee - it's going to tilt over because the base is not weighted (not a complaint - just an observation).  The MLB sticker on the bat was peeling off right out of the box so the bat will be without its sticker in very short order because what kid can resist pulling at something that is peeling off (I've certainly never met any).  This is simply not worth the bloated price of $30 and unless the price reduces, I would recommend that you look at different models as I think you'll be disappointed (you can probably find the Little Tikes T-Ball set for half this price at most Department stores - without it being on sale).Good luck shopping and PLAY BALL!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR95SIGGO6U6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YRA3H4U#wasThisHelpful","RR95SIGGO6U6G","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This software is fairly easy to use and installation was fast with the included disk.  Although not all the features in this software are intuitive - once you do figure them out, it makes sense and is easy to replicate.The biggest new features include text wrap and and ""Magic Move"" tools. There are on-line tutorials if you are on the fence as to whether this software is for you before you make the commitment to buy.  Text wrapping is a cool feature where your text instantly wraps inside any chosen shape.  The biggest drawback to the text wrap is that there is not a spell check.  Magic Move feature allows users to select what you want to move (or delete) and the software will fill in the background with the simple click of a button.  It takes a little practice to get the hang of how to use this feature but once you figure it out - the result is pretty cool.  In cases where you have the perfect picture ""except for....."" you now have more editing power to truly achieve that perfect image by sliding subjects closer together, removing unwanted distractions (i.e.: maybe the dog photo bombed your picture, etc).I like this software.  If your editing is basic and you don't think you have the need for text wrap or magic move - you might want to consider the prior version of this software (it'll cost less yet still have most of the quality editing features that you'll like want and need).","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FI5B70KIMJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60EW#wasThisHelpful","R3FI5B70KIMJ6","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again.....what was old is new again (my 11-yr old loves this binder).  This is a nice conversation piece for young/new star war fans.  It really is cool that rather than simply having images of the main Star Wars characters, that the images represented are image outlines that include an assortment of descriptive words for each respective character (i.e.: for the image of Yoda, his face is made up with the words: Great Jedi, Master, Yoda, light saber, Force, leader, warrior, and many more).This binder is basic but it serves the purpose.

"This shirt offers a classic flannel look but to achieve the crisp look in the photos - you'll definitely need to touch this up with an iron after EVERY wash.

"This battery operated turtle is so loud!  When you push the button on the bottom and the turtle begins to move it's legs and crawls (or swims) it sounds like a cheap wind-up toy.  I'm actually stunned by the overwhelming positive reviews of this toy with no mention to how loud it is.We have owned several Little live pets (and we loved them); this however is by far the worse sounding.  I like that it's waterproof and you could put it in the bath tub or swimming pool however there is nothing realistic about this turtle since it emits such a large mechanical gear winding sound.  It looks adorable however however it's appearance is greatly over-shadowed by the grinding mechanical noise when it moves around.If your child is young (age 3 to 5) or has never owned any Little Live Pets then perhaps they won't mind the ruckus this toy makes.  My 9-year old lost interest in this really quickly and suggested that we give it to her 4-year old niece.The plastic tank is well designed and the only thing you really need to be mindful of is to not fill it too full with water or it will leak out the vent holes on the top when the turtle begins splashing around.  The lid can also be a diving area when it is fully opened.You can get this toy in a variety of colors: pink, green, light blue, dark blue with a star on its back and yet a darker blue with swirls on its back.  The turtle is small (roughly 5"" long and 2-1/2"" wide) and the swim tank doesn't take up a lot of room (8"" L x 6"" W x 4"" high - not including the height of the handle if it's upright).I personally think there are a lot of mechanical pets on the market that are far superior to this one. Having said that - if your child loves turtles, they may think this is the best toy ever and if it is priced under under or around $20 then I think you're getting a toy that is in line with the quality.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1US5WNHYHW63M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA91ZHI#wasThisHelpful","R1US5WNHYHW63M","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice concept however the product I received may have been defective.Two cars are included, one with a girl driver and one with a boy.  The car with the girl driver consistently drives off the track prior to reaching the bottom (it must be weighted incorrectly or perhaps the wheels are misaligned however when comparing the cars side by side - they don't look any different so it's puzzling why this one doesn't work properly).  The boy driver stays on the track without any problems (which of course gives my son and husband great pleasure and makes my daughter irritated).  In addition, the top handle that is twisted to collapse or expand this product does not stand upright on my produce - it tilts at a significant angle therefore I also believe that this piece is defective.The process of collapsing and expanding this product is not quite as intuitive nor as smooth as other Play-Stow-Go products.  You basically put the toy on a flat surface and pull upward on the handle (while holding down on the base) and rotating the handle clockwise.  You'll hear clicks as you are doing this and as the Amazon product illustrations clearly outlines, there are 4 sets of red arrows that you want to align.  Once this occurs - your ramp is fully extended and ready to play with.  You will twist counterclockwise to prepare the toy for storage.  The cars ""park"" on their side and securely rest on 2 tabs to keep them in place while in storage.  The images of the boy and girl (or the opposite side which are stickers of kaleidoscopes) rotate as the cars race down the track.The toy also incorporated a ""press and go launcher"" at the top of the ramp.  Users can place the rear wheels on the yellow launcher pad and then press the yellow button and the car will race down the ramp.  There is a gate at the end of the ramp so toddlers have the option of having the gate down to stop their cars at the bottom, or have the gate up so the car continues to race forward.Noteworthy also is that there are several stickers on this toy (each car has stickers on each side and there are 2 stickers on the top handle) so if you like to occasionally soak toys in a water/bleach solution to sterilize them, you won't want to do this as it will eventually deteriorate the stickers.Had my product not had the defective car and if the handle wasn't defective, I would have rated this a 4 star product.  It simply doesn't have the same sturdiness of some of the other Play-Stow-Go products.  The portability of this product however is wonderful and I really look forward to seeing how other toys are being re-created to incorporate space saving ideas.I included a photo of my product so buyers can see how the top handle/garage wall leans.  If your product does this, I believe that it is defective and you should return it for replacement as all the images online and in the instruction manual illustrate this part of the garage as standing straight up (not leaning).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332RO9EA8XE8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENR4C#wasThisHelpful","R332RO9EA8XE8T","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The collapsible design of this product makes it very appealing for parents on the go.  All of the plastic shapes fit inside of the sorter and the kitty head flips down so they do not fall out when being transported.  There is also a handle incorporated that also looks like a tail.  There are no stickers so when you need to wash off this product - you can simply soak it in the sink with bleach and water to sterilize it  without worrying that sticker embellishments are going to wash off.  When expanded, the flexible rubber sorter base is almost 4-1/2 inches high.This is an excellent toy for toddlers and it's suitable for boys and girls.  The pieces are brightly colored and each of the 4 shapes is a two piece unit that can be either put together and placed in the sorter as one piece, or separated and inserted individually.  In addition, each piece has a textured image of an an animal on top with their corresponding food on the other matching piece.The 2 piece connectable shapes include:Light blue circles with a kitty and fishPink hearts with a mouse and cheesePurple triangles with a bunny and carrotYellow stars with dog and boneThe bottom snaps open and as your child's fine motor skills develop - they will eventually be able to open this on their own to retrieve their pieces after they have sorted them.This is an excellent toy that is educational and offers convenient collapsible storage for parents who will not only appreciate the space saving features but will also appreciate that all the pieces fit inside the kitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35VW4CLV6A5GU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLENR2O#wasThisHelpful","R35VW4CLV6A5GU","A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UUI7PFQ5FU4E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lorde and her music have fascinated me for months. There is a certain quality to her music and persona that is compellingly mysterious. She first piqued my interest when I learned that she was mocking Bieber and his kin, then caught my ears with her song Buzzcut Season (this soulful sound is coming from an 18-y-o?!), and then once I saw her ecstatic dancing in the video for Yellow Flicker Beat my attention was now fully rapt. Who is this person and what is she trying to do with our attention???Before I start proffering opinions, its important that we lay some facts on the table:-- Lorde is 18. There is some skepticism about her age because she does not seem that young, but whats undeniable is that she was in high school until last year.-- Lorde is outspoken about popular music and societal values more generally. Ive already mentioned the Bieber criticism. She also did a unique/cool thing of posting a photo of one of her magazine glam shots next to an un-photoshopped version of her un-made-up face (with less-than-pristine skin), presumably to say something about the unfair expectations for beauty we impose on [young] women via celebrities.-- Lordes music is largely written by *her* (in collaboration with Joel Little), which is noteworthy because nearly every other popular musician outsources their songwriting to dance-pop factories.-- Lordes lyrics mention almost none of the things typical of popular music: I dont remember hearing the word boy in any of her songs, and she rarely even sings about love. Even dancing only comes up in the context of alone.Those are the things we can agree upon. Its now going to get messier as we dive into the question that haunts me.What exactly is Lorde trying to do with our attention? I dont know. I cant tell. Someone please explain it to me. All I can do is eliminate possibilities.She is clearly not just trying to earn the entertainment dollar like other popular musicians, because otherwise she would have outsourced her songwriting to the dance-pop factories. Neither does she seem to be trying to break any musical ground. Although she is critical of Bieber et al., and although her lyrics are very atypical of popular music, her sound is very much consistent with the electronic/hip-hoppy/soul-singing feel that predominates today. She doesnt even seem to be trying to shake or inspire us. Her music is pleasant and enjoyable but doesnt seem to aim for moving or provoking us. She doesnt even seem to be trying to say anything in particular. If there is a message or core belief that runs through her songs, I havent found it.Its clear that Lorde has seen the vapidness of popular music and popular culture more generally, and has shown the courage to criticize it and to forge a different path. But until someone convinces me otherwise, Im going to assume that Lorde doesnt currently know what path she is trying to forge. She knows she wants to divert from the Bieber path, but she doesnt seem to know in what direction she wants to head. It seems that shes just going with the flow, making music because she likes music and shes good at it and because why not? Which is perfectly acceptable for an 18-y-o. We cant reasonably expect an 18-y-o to have figured out her core values/beliefs and to know what to do with the giant responsibility that has been thrust upon her via her popularity as a young person. But then again, we cant reasonably expect an 18-y-o to be as independent-minded or as soulful-sounding as Lorde, either. (""I am only as young as the minute is full of it."")The bottom line is that I believe Lorde is awesome and awesomely talented, and I love that she is independent enough (at 18!) to mock Bieber et al. and to write highly atypical song lyrics, but her directionlessness distresses me. It distresses me because I believe that if she had a direction (an anchor, a purpose, a core set of beliefs/values), she could have Madonna-level influence to drag us as a society away from Bieber values. But she can't drag us anywhere unless/until she knows where she's headed.We need you to save us from Bieber values, Lorde. Please find a direction. We are counting on you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UQ5NXH5I736A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJU8ZIG#wasThisHelpful","R1UQ5NXH5I736A","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scott Adams is brilliant and entertaining and persuasive and successful, and I believe he had generous intentions with this book. He wanted to give back by sharing brilliant advice about how to hack your life to be successful like him and thereby live a better life. I am not being facetious when I call Scott Adams or his advice brilliant. He truly has a top-percentile IQ, and a lot of his advice truly is brilliant (see, e.g., systems vs. goals). So why the 2-star review?This book assumes that success (or ""winning big"") is basically the same as a well-lived life, or at least that the two are highly correlated. It sounds like Scott's fundamental approach to life is to maximize his probability of, e.g., syndication, movie contracts, high-charting books, highly profitable start-ups. Life Philosophy = Optimize Success!, where success seems roughly to mean money, fame, and influence. And this book is his way of saying, Look people, I can show you how to live a better life by increasing your probability!To be fair, in one chapter, Scott writes about his belief that the meaning of life is to be useful. Being useful is the only thing that has given him real satisfaction, he says, which is why being useful is his primary motivation for writing this book. But based on all the other chapters, it appears that ""being useful"" to him only means helping people to optimize their probability of money, fame, influence, etc.It's our default human tendency to want to ""win big"" and make a name for ourselves and earn loads of money/influence/power, and to desperately hope that others will respect, desire, and like us. We all know the dangers of these types of desires, of being too ambitious, too competitive, too attached to worldly goods and external validation: it has been codified as myths, proverbs, clichs, epigrams, parables. It is the skeleton of every great story. And yet Scott Adams seems to assume that such default human desires are not only not dangerous, but actually fundamental to a good life, the motivating principles behind which we ought to organize our lives. Optimize your probability!, Scott Adams keeps telling us.If you are looking for career advice from a very clever person, then I moderately endorse this book so long as you keep in mind that ""clever"" is not the same as ""wise"" and that ""winning big"" is not the same as ""living well."" If youd prefer guidance on how to assimilate your desires for external success into a larger life (and what exactly a ""larger life"" looks like), then I would strongly suggest that you give the ancient philosophers a try (Plato, Aristotle, Buddha, Confucius, Epicurus, Epictetus, Seneca, and/or Marcus Aurelius) or start with an excellent primer called Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations: Ancient Philosophy for Modern Problems.(P.S. - There are better things to life than optimizing probabilities.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K796CFL93LW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846919#wasThisHelpful","R1K796CFL93LW3","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1. Did it excite you intellectually? Did it give you a buzz in the brain?2. Did it move you emotionally? Did you feel a mild exhilaration or a tumult in the soul?3. Did it inspire you to pick up 3+ related or similar books or otherwise learn more?4. Did you find yourself thinking about it or otherwise influenced by it 3+ months after you finished reading it?For this book, my answers are yes, sort of, yes, and most definitely.This is, without doubt and without exaggeration, one of the most important books I have read. (I read 4-7 books per month.) I picked up the book not because I had any particular interest in ancient philosophy but rather because I came to admire and respect the authors writing through his blog (which, by the way, I recommend as highly as the book). Rare and precious are writers who are both thoughtful and eloquent, and even rarer and more precious are thoughtful and eloquent writers who write about the big questions. Questions like, what should I be doing with myself and why? or how should I understand and orient toward things like pleasure, friendship, nature, death, and politics?I loved that the author did not try to prescribe one answer but rather outlined several prominent philosophies and the merits and limitations of each, thus freeing us readers to construct and strengthen our own worldviews by drawing connections and addressing holes or weaknesses.As illustrated by the stories of modern people using ancient philosophy in dire circumstances, there are real and substantial benefits to practicing philosophy. And to practice philosophy means much more than thinking abstractly about truth and altruism and free will and AI and other such hooey. (That is unfortunately what academic philosophy has become, but it is not what it meant to the ancients.) To practice philosophy means, firstly, to decide what it means to live well and why. Then it will often involve using spiritual exercises (e.g., meditation or journaling) to get to know yourself, change yourself, become wiser, and to endure, flourish, and resist.I cant promise that this book will be nearly as important/influential for you as it was for me. If youre just looking for a summary of ancient philosophies as a quaint history lesson, it will work fine for that. But its unlikely to do much for you unless (1) you feel that your life might be lacking a sense of meaning and/or a structure for why and how to live and (2) you are a thinking/analytical type who isnt content to accept just one schools dogma as the be-all-end-all answer.FYI, according to his blog, the author is working on a second book about transcendence. I have never felt so inpatient for a book to make its way to shelves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PHV5E69VAG8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608682293#wasThisHelpful","R2PHV5E69VAG8J","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Q: How do you get smart people to say beautiful things?A: Make them explain themselves to children.For example:How do you fall in love?You don't fall in love like you fall in a hole. You fall like falling through space. It's like you jump off your own private planet to visit someone else's planet. And when you get there it all looks different: the flowers, the animals, the colours people wear. It is a big surprise falling in love because you thought you had everything just right on your own planet, and that was true, in a way, but then somebody signaled to you across space and the only way you could visit was to take a giant jump. Away you go, falling into someone else's orbit and after a while you might decide to pull your two planets together and call it home. And you can bring your dog. And you can bring friends to visit. And read your favorite stories to each other. And the falling was really the big jump that you had to make to be with someone you don't want to be without.

"Ludwig is twisting in his grave at the fact that this is currently the top-selling classical album. Any classical aficionado (ahem, snob) will look at the selections on this album and call them safe, vanilla, uninteresting. Make no mistake: This is an unabashed attempt to profit on the already-ridiculously-profitable Fifty Shades brand, and to do so by selling widely appealing (i.e., ""vanilla"") music.But this album wasn't made for classical snobs. It was made for people who want some musical mood enhancers for their reading experience. And for that, it works. You will certainly get a better Fifty Shades reading experience through this album than you will by, say, turning on the radio to Maroon 5 and Ke$ha and Flo Rida.The music on this album has a subtle, emerging intensity, a mysterious allure with a vague suggestion of danger.

"The best way to get a taste of this book is to click the link ""Search inside this book."" The publishers graciously offer an in-depth preview.This isn't the best book to understand Warhol or his work, nor is it intended to be. (I recommend Andy Warhol: Living Art for a good primer.) Rather, this book is about Warhol's ""reach"" and ""influence."" In particular, this book acts as a visual archive of non-Warhol works that seem Warholian in nature. It's one-part analysis and four-parts coffee table book.I'm not sure it's fair to say that Warhol ""influenced"" the works presented this book. I think it'd be more accurate to say that Warhol's work from the 60's and 70's remains so relevant and resonant - consider consumerism, the cult of celebrity, issues of sexual identity and gender - that many of the works after Warhol unintentionally look like Warhols.

"It's hard to describe Del Rey's music. It's a fairy-dusting of harp laid over top a hip-hop cadence.

She neither soothes nor satiates, but she certainly warrants our attention.---Technical note: This album has such poor reviews not because of the music but because of missing tracks.

It has fantastic essays.The essays are ordered chronologically which is nice but kind of unnecessary since even the old essays still read fresh. One essay about the perils of technology rings just as true today as it did 80 years ago.The choice of essays can be fairly critiqued as heavy on race & gender issues, as not really ""the best,"" or as just plain seedy since Joyce Carol Oates picked one of her own essays. But in the end it doesn't really matter.

"I urge you not to heed the angry one-star reviewer who had his undies scrunched by the fact that, faced with a looming deadline, SnagIt didn't help him make a perfect triangle. If ""SnagIt didn't help me make a perfect triangle!"" is the worst complaint anyone can levy, then you're in for a delightful deal.I am a generally bitter, cynical person who shakes his fist at every technical inefficiency. I tell you that in order to give this next sentence more weight: SnagIt is a rare software product that has satisfied me all the way to a big, teethy smile.The one-star reviewer says that SnagIt isn't good for business users, but that's exactly wrong. Outside of Microsoft Office, SnagIt is the software I would least like to do without at the office. You've likely felt what it's like to be stuck in a series of emails in which people who are inept with language flail around trying to make sense of what the other is saying. What you might not have felt is the sweet relief when, in 72% of those cases, the issue can be painlessly resolved with a picture and a bright red arrow.SnagIt is delightful in many ways. It settles email logjams. It spruces reports. It captures images as well as video. It lets you match colors from the image with a dropper thingy. It pours you a cup of tea and asks about your day. (Kidding, but I wouldn't be surprised if it offered that in version 12.) It is so easy to use, so convenient and efficient, and there are so many things you can do with it.

"This book was exactly what I was looking for: A primer on Warhol that gives the gist of his background, his failures and accomplishments, and the world's response to them. It is well-organized and  topically well-proportioned. It offers both the complimentary and uncomplimentary views of Warhol.Any good book will leave you with more questions than you started with, and this book certainly did that for me. In particular, I'm left wondering whether Warhol was a Da Vinci-like genius or whether he was, as Capote suggested, a business artist with no talent except at selling himself. I have no doubt that Warhol's work was ""the perfect mirror of our time"" but I haven't yet figured out whether that was intentional. Or whether it matters that it was/wasn't intentional.After limited exposure, I'm leaning toward the conclusion that Warhol had an exceptional eye for aesthetics but that he didn't intend for his works to say anything more than, ""look, isn't this pretty?"" He probably didn't intend for the Campbell's soup cans to mock societal values but rather just to show that with a few touch ups and color alterations the can is quite lovely. On the one hand, I find that lack of profundity disappointing, but on the other hand, I'm interested to learn more about Warhol, to find out whether this man who produced such extraordinary images truly lacked any kind of intellectual curiosity.I'm left chewing on this bit of Warhol philosophy: ""I think the less something has to say, the more perfect it is.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4QM4HJOCOZVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3791338145#wasThisHelpful","R4QM4HJOCOZVW","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Medusa was the second chapter, and her reflections ended this way: ""the man cries out at my beauty and then his tongue and face and chest and arms and thighs and his toad-headed serpent all turn hard forever the clearing before my cave is thronged with them my admirers, but my children are my true loves rooted in my brain and gathered sleeping against my face muttering sibilant dreams of love.""I was hoping, from that point on, the book would tend more to the ""sibilant dreams of love"" side than the ""toad-headed serpent"" side, but it didn't, at all. Mid-way through, I had to pause to make sure I wasn't reading his other book, Intercourse: Stories.

"Parts of this book are quite powerful. There are certain images and certain words that pack enough metaphor to knock you off your feet. That's a rare and precious thing, especially in graphic novels. Graphic novels are extremely hard to do well because they require the author to master illustrations and prose and storytelling. Most are lucky to do one of the three.After the 89th page, I was convinced this book was going to be rare and precious. The first 89 pages are about meeting and eventually falling for Cati, and then about meeting and struggling to bond with her 3-y-o HIV-positive son. I really thought this was going somewhere, that it would be about the struggle to become a father and a husband amid a grim, looming reality. In one scene, the 3-y-o is shown attaching himself to the author at a party, a moment that was both innocuous and heavily charged with meaning, when the author didn't have to ""choose"" to become a father-figure but rather was anointed one.At this point I am not even half-way through the book and my eyes are running. I am loving this book and can't wait to finish it. This explains my massive disappointment with the final 100 pages, in which the 3-y-o becomes essentially irrelevant and the story instead turns to condoms... and then to woolly mammoths. I am still struggling to understand how the author could find such depths within the first 90 pages and then turn the next 65 pages into a discussion of the mechanics of contraceptives, and then follow with 20 pages of what amounts to philosophical nonsense while seated on top of -- randomly -- a mammoth. The first 90 pages were filled with such warmth and poetry and metaphor, and then it somehow grotesquely flopped into cold philosophical abstraction.

I happened to like it-- it fits with the narrative.Some reviewers have criticized this book for not being as political or as interesting as his later books, and I agree that this isn't the best place to start, but I strongly disagree that this book is ""disappointing"" or ""uninteresting."" This book captures more than one man's experiences in one city in China. It captures the widespread ethos of the West, which, if you could encapsulate it in a word, might be ""boredom.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OURZYC2USHEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770460799#wasThisHelpful","R3OURZYC2USHEZ","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Werner resisted this book for a long time. The images in his films should do the talking, he says. I agree, but hoo boy is it great to have some of Werner on the printed page, if only because it helps us to see the images in three dimensions.When asked how he dealt with the immense drama involved in making Fitzcarraldo, Werner responded, ""I had a clear perspective and I was fortified with enough philosophy to get through it.""As far as I can tell, there are only two living people ""fortified with enough philosophy"" to not just deserve but require your undivided attention. They both happen to be filmmakers. One is Errol Morris and the other is Werner Herzog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IP3QKGLV6C9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571207081#wasThisHelpful","R2IP3QKGLV6C9W","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the back of the book, Chuck Klosterman described My Friend Dahmer as ""not just a heavy story about a disturbing teenager to quench your dark little desires. It is about a lot of other things that matter much, much more: the institutionalized weirdness of the suburban seventies, what it means to be friends with someone you don't really like, a cogent explanation as to why terrible things happen, and a means for feeling sympathy toward those who don't seem to deserve it.""But this book is almost precisely the opposite of what Klosterman described:* ""A means for feeling sympathy toward those who don't seem to deserve it"": The author outwardly contradicts this as early as the third page, saying that Dahmer was a ""monster"" (the classic term to dismiss someone as inhuman) and a ""twisted wretch."" ""Pity him,"" Derf says, ""but don't empathize with him."" Forget sympathy, the author doesn't even want us to *empathize.** ""A cogent explanation as to why terrible things happen"": No cogent explanation exists. Most of this book is a flailing attempt to fight that uncomfortable truth. There is a complex reality to Dahmer's case that cannot be explained with a sentence or with a diagnosis. Dahmer was weird, but not even the weirdest kid at his rural Ohio high school. He witnessed some disturbing things, but not anything more disturbing than his parents' heated arguments or his mother having a seizure. The author grapples for explanations and evidence, but the uncomfortable truth is that the same piecemeal evidence could be thrown together in a book about almost any of us. The truth is complex, and the truth is uncomfortable precisely because of how ""normal"" and ""human"" Dahmer was, but Backderf desperately wants to find a simple, comfortable story that makes Dahmer appear inhuman and monstrous.* ""What it means to be friends with someone you don't really like"": The author admits that Dahmer was not a friend but a mascot. Backderf was amused by Dahmer's ""spaz freak"" performances, but had no interest in him as a human being. In fact, it would be more accurate to describe Backderf as a bully than a friend. Backderf served as president of the ""Dahmer Fan Club,"" which was less a fan club than a group of guys who exploited Dahmer's goofy qualities for their own amusement.Backderf's account suggests that Dahmer was perfectly incapable of normal human conversation, that he was clinging to a faint thread of sanity, and that his only means of engaging in social activity was to put on a spaz freak show. But if you look up any of the interviews with Dahmer, you will find that he was almost precisely the opposite of what Backderf describes. Dahmer was articulate, sensitive, and intelligent. He was, in short, a human. That seems to be a truth too uncomfortable for Backderf to acknowledge.---For something that delivers what Chuck Klosterman describes, see Into the Abyss or Standard Operating Procedure.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KV5U12CHNPJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419702173#wasThisHelpful","R1KV5U12CHNPJ9","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Millions of people adore Mumford & Sons, finding their sound to be much more than pleasant folksy tunes but rather something like a revelatory, deeply meaningful expression of passion.When I first heard M&S, I, too, found them revelatory. It was intensely refreshing to hear popular music that has soul--so much soul that they couldn't help but to project it at the tops of their lungs. It was a desperately needed reply to the current ""I don't care / we do what we want"" irreverent dance-pop glitz ethos.Many listens later, I see M&S differently. The music reliably invokes excitement but, in doing so, it finds no space for subtlety or understatement. Their roots are in Back Country bluegrass and folk -- genres that are all about stories -- but in M&S's music there are no stories. Rather, this album is a lot like U2's City of Blinding Light: Biblical imagery expressed in generic terms. A flailing attempt to capture spirituality. Or maybe just to prevent boredom. Instead of stories intended to shake and inspire, we get posturing and shouting intended to excite. After a while, all the excitement becomes exhausting and empty, not unlike the dance-pop glitz they oppose.I believe people are starved for deeper rewards than Maroon 5 and their dance-pop contemporaries offer, and I believe that's why M&S are the top-selling musicians in the country (and by a wide margin), because they give the instant impression of heartfelt folky soulfulness. But the truth, revealed after enough listens, is that they are closer to stadium rock. To find deeper rewards, you have to look to the folk / bluegrass / celtic roots that have inspired them: Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, or even more recent acts like Ray LaMontagne or Amos Lee. Their music may not be as instantly pleasurable or exciting as M&S's, but if you give it your patience and attention, you just might find rewards that are far more precious than excitement.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGI86M5MXLS4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008O037RG#wasThisHelpful","RGI86M5MXLS4Y","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I encourage you to read the review of T. Biddle, who says eloquently everything that needed to be said. He/she begins by saying, ""The criticism that this film is ""too one-sided"" or has ""an agenda"" demonstrates a lack of understanding of what a documentary is and does. Documentary filmmakers ALL have agendas; they have a point-of-view and must engage viewers emotionally or they fail in their task.""I will just add one flake of nuance: Yes, filmmakers all have their agendas, and should not be ashamed to wear it on their sleeve, but at the same time they have a responsibility to not oversimplify or mislead, and this movie sometimes veered too closely to that gray line. Nevertheless, this movie succeeds in capturing the grotesque events of the Vietnam War and people's way of rationalizing them, and it succeeds in capturing the human condition more broadly. It isn't one of the best or most expertly crafted movies, but it's one of the most powerful. Watch this movie, and then watch The Fog of War.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R127RG7JG1MNZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006673L#wasThisHelpful","R127RG7JG1MNZP","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Werner Herzog dedicated this film to the ""good soldier of cinema,"" Mr. Roger Ebert. Ebert responded by writing a letter to Herzog, which he later posted on his website, and which I have posted pieces of below. You'd be hard pressed to find a more beautiful tribute to Herzog/this movie.---Dear Werner,You have done me the astonishing honor of dedicating your new film, ""Encounters at the End of the World,"" to me. Since I have admired your work beyond measure for the almost 40 years since we first met, I do not need to explain how much this kindness means to me. When I saw the film at the Toronto Film Festival and wrote to thank you, I said I wondered if it would be a conflict of interest for me to review the film, even though of course you have made a film I could not possibly dislike. I said I thought perhaps the solution was to simply write you a letter.Without ever making a movie for solely commercial reasons, without ever having a dependable source of financing, without the attention of the studios and the oligarchies that decide what may be filmed and shown, you have directed at least 55 films or television productions, and we will not count the operas. You have worked all the time, because you have depended on your imagination instead of budgets, stars or publicity campaigns. You have had the visions and made the films and trusted people to find them, and they have. It is safe to say you are as admired and venerated as any filmmaker alive--among those who have heard of you, of course. Those who do not know your work, and the work of your comrades in the independent film world, are missing experiences that might shake and inspire them.You often say this modern world is starving for images. That the media pound the same paltry ideas into our heads time and again, and that we need to see around the edges or over the top. When you open ""Encounters at the End of the World"" by following a marine biologist under the ice floes of the South Pole, and listening to the alien sounds of the creatures who thrive there, you show me a place on my planet I did not know about, and I am richer. You are the most curious of men. You are like the storytellers of old, returning from far lands with spellbinding tales.The line between truth and fiction is a mirage in your work. I understand this. What must be true, must be true. What must not be true, can be made more true by invention. Your films, frame by frame, contain a kind of rapturous truth that transcends the factually mundane. And yet when you find something real, you show it.In ""Encounters at the End of the World,"" you talk with real people who have chosen to make their lives there in a research station. Some are ""linguists on a continent with no language,"" you note, others are ""PhDs working as cooks."" When a marine biologist cuts a hole in the ice and dives beneath it, he does not use a rope to find his way back to the small escape circle in the limitless shelf above him, because it would restrict his research. When he comes up, he simply hopes he can find the hole. This is all true, but it is also ecstatic truth.In the process of compiling your life's work, you have never lost your sense of humor. Your narrations are central to the appeal of your documentaries, and your wonder at human nature is central to your fiction. In one scene you can foresee the end of life on earth, and in another show us country musicians picking their guitars and banjos on the roof of a hut at the South Pole. You did not go to Antarctica, you assure us at the outset, to film cute penguins. But you did film one cute penguin, a penguin that was disoriented, and was steadfastly walking in precisely the wrong direction--into an ice vastness the size of Texas. ""And if you turn him around in the right direction,"" you say, ""he will turn himself around, and keep going in the wrong direction, until he starves and dies."" The sight of that penguin waddling optimistically toward his doom would be heartbreaking, except that he is so sure he is correct.I have started out to praise your work, and have ended by describing it. Maybe it is the same thing. You and your work are unique and invaluable, and you ennoble the cinema when so many debase it. You have the audacity to believe that if you make a film about anything that interests you, it will interest us as well. And you have proven it.With admiration,Roger","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FZKOBIWV8KJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DWNUD8#wasThisHelpful","R2FZKOBIWV8KJJ","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to describe why I found this book so valuable, but I read every sentence of every page as if it contained the secrets of the universe. Even the trite questions like ""where do you get your ideas?"" are answered with great thoughtfulness and profundity. Errol rarely gives a straight answer, but he always gives a provocative one.Before reading this book, I recommend that you look up a couple of his video interviews (e.g., with Charlie Rose or with Herzog) just to give you a sense of the sloth-like pace - i.e., the thoughtfulness - with which he speaks.Here are some selected quotes:I used to transcribe all of my audiotapes by myself and there were these exciting moments where you would become aware of patterns of speech, the way people talk, the way they use language, the way they express themselves, the way they don't express themselves. When you sit and transcribe interviews, you become aware of things that you would never ordinarily notice. As you actually put these words down on the page you're listening to them in a completely different way. How much can you actually learn about a person and how do they communicate just from their patterns of speech? It goes well beyond the surface content of what they're saying.---Truth is not guaranteed by style or presentation. It's not handed over on a tray like a Happy Meal. It's a quest, and often it's as interesting to chronicle people's persistent avoidance of truth as their pursuit of it. But in any event, whatever truth is, it's a linguistic and not a visual thing. I do not believe that the truth is subjective, that the truth is contextual, or that the truth is up for grabs. To me the real story behind The Thin Blue Line--and I think this is an important story to be told in general about the world--is not that the truth is unknowable but that often people are uninterested in the truth. They don't seek the truth but rather some series of answers that make them feel comfortable or answer to certain needs they might have.---The only way that people can make sense of experience, of the world, of history, is by picking and choosing from a myriad of details and facts.---Stories, by their very nature, have to be tremendously simplified versions of reality. Reality is too complex, it's too chaotic. We tell ourselves stories so we don't have to deal with reality. We create stories out of the mess of reality by eliminating material, by reinterpreting material, by rearranging material. But the investigative element is what connects the stories to the world. It's what makes stories interesting to me.---Perhaps the best thing a film can do is create something that is unusual and unique, that has emotional power, that says something unexpected. My tendency as a filmmaker is to keep going, to keep gnawing at some bone until I finally come to a conclusion that satisfies me.---I love commercials, unreservedly. The haiku of the West. And I like to think of consumerism as the most effective preventative to genocide yet devised. When someone shows up at your door and asks you to hack your neighbor to death with a machete, you're less likely to do it if you have prior plans, say, to go buy a DVD player.---Despite all of our efforts to control things, the world is much, much more powerful and deranged than we are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LW1UAM7IO2FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604733721#wasThisHelpful","R1LW1UAM7IO2FD","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book isn't really about what it's like in Jerusalem / Israel. Or if it's about that, then only at the surface. This book is a travelogue. It isn't so much about Jerusalem as it is one person's experiences there, his perceptions -- colored by his personal history and obscured by his limited sample -- of its people and places and politics. It isn't the carefully considered thoughts of a political activist or a historian delivered with dry facts; rather, it is the perceptions and experiences of an ordinary traveler delivered with striking artistry.---For a travelogue, one has to wonder why Guy didn't just show us photos with captions. It would have been much easier. But it also would have been much less effective. Drawing seems to be Guy's way of thinking, of finding people's and place's defining characteristics. The drawings slightly exaggerate certain characteristics and highlight what he sees as important, bringing his stories to life by taking us directly into his perspective.---It's no surprise, given how deeply Guy values his work, that this book is expertly and perfectionistically constructed. There is not a wasted word or a wasted line. It's remarkable given that faces are drawn with only a few simple dots and circles that he is able to so clearly convey emotion. Even more impressively, he is able to convey emotions without facial expressions but rather by subtle changes in color or perspective from frame to frame. I didn't know comics could do that.Also surprising was the diverse content of the mini-stories. There are abrupt transitions from mundane sidewalk or domestic observations - things that some might call ""trivial"" everyday stuff - to accounts of the dark and serious history-book-worthy events taking place around the city and country. The book somehow does this non-awkwardly and even smoothly. So smoothly, in fact, that it blurs the line between what's ""trivial"" everyday stuff and what isn't. For example, we see Guy in casual conversation at a cocktail party with famous diplomats and political prisoners; we see his wife casually organizing transit into an area that is currently being heavily air-bombed; we see his nanny casually grab her coat to leave for the night and then remark that her home is being demolished because it is was ""illegally"" built, and how she will have to hire a lawyer to prevent it, and how it probably won't work, and how she'll have to pay for the demolition herself.I never thought I would find myself prowling the library for graphic novels. That's the power of Guy Deslisle, I guess. But sadly I haven't found any as compelling as Guy Deslisle's.

"Reviewer ""From Hades"" spends 1,620 words supporting a thesis that can be stated in a sentence: The civilian interrogators were responsible for Abu Ghraib, and this film is flawed because it doesn't suggest that.The reviewer makes clear that he believes the film spends too much time ""humanizing"" the military personnel when instead it should have been placing blame. He wanted the film to single out the civilian interrogators as the responsible persons so that, I guess, we can wipe our hands and move on.It's distressing that his is the top-rated review because he is doing the precise thing that the film magnifies to absurdity: Telling the simple story, reaching the simple conclusion, identifying the ""bad guys,"" and being satisfied with your tidy little explanation.It's easier to theorize about human behavior than it is to look at it.It's easy to look at the photos from Abu Ghraib and construct stories. A social psychologist might say that Abu Ghraib illustrates the results of the Stanford Prison Experiment. An economist might say that ""rational"" people were responding to grim incentives. An evolutionary biologist might say that Abu Ghraib merely shows apes gone amok amid environmental pressures. A neurochemist might say that the military personnel were experiencing a severe chemical imbalance in the brain.It's hard to do what Errol Morris did, which is to examine the events that actually happened and listen to the people involved. The result -- this movie -- shows how grossly inadequate simple stories can be.Before watching Errol Morris's films, it's important to understand that he does not make traditional ""issue"" or ""historical"" documentaries like you might see on PBS. His purpose is not to document factual events, although that's part of it. Errol is after deeper truths--not just what happened, but why it happened, what it means, what it can tell us about ourselves.If Standard Operating Procedure does not make you think about anything other than what happened at Abu Ghraib and who's responsible, then I wonder whether you were really paying attention.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ1EPHAUN5IUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DPHDA6#wasThisHelpful","RQ1EPHAUN5IUZ","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is one very bad reason to read this book: You want to know why he killed himself.Here's Jonathan Franzen: ""One good, simple, modern story would go like this: 'A lovely, talented personality fell victim to a severe chemical imbalance in his brain. There was the person of Dave, and then there was the disease, and the disease killed the man as surely as cancer might have.' This story is at once sort of true and totally inadequate. If you're satisfied with this story, you don't need the stories that Dave wrote.""Too much of this book is the good, simple, modern story.---Here is a sort of good reason to read this book: You want to be helped to see the magnitude of his writing in three dimensions.It's only a sort of good reason because the book isn't terribly helpful in that regard. D.T. Max takes the classic New Yorker approach to writing--the invisible author clinically disengaged via the use of facts and other people's opinions. The result is something that reads vaguely like a dry biosketch. Most of the facts and other-people's-opinions won't help you gain a richer understanding of how he wrote and why he wrote and what his writing meant to him. They aren't that type of fact. They are more like gossipy details meant to show that Saint Dave isn't as saintly as some have imagined.David Lipsky's account is far more satisfying: it fully engages with DFW's ideas and it does not reduce his life to a series of gossipy factoids and other-people's-opinions.With all that said, if you have already read Lipsky's account, then this book provides some added context - e.g., pieces of letters to friends - that you will likely find rewarding.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I7LTDVQBDYWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025925#wasThisHelpful","R1I7LTDVQBDYWW","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Some people are so convinced that Jeffrey MacDonald is inhuman and evil that their response to this 500-page book that suggests otherwise is one not of discomfort or confusion but of physical disgust. One reviewer said, ""I hated this book. Jeffrey MacDonald deserves another lengthy sentence just for inspiring it.""Much of the criticism lacks any specific examples of how the book gets crucial facts wrong. Rather, the charges are against the author, saying that Errol Morris is ""guilty of self-deception he accuses others of"" or that he ""just wants to sell books.""These charges will hardly seem likely if you know anything about Errol Morris. He spent orders of magnitude more time researching this case than was spent by all of the attorneys combined. He spent so much time researching this case that this book probably wouldn't make a profit even if it sold millions of copies.Errol Morris has devoted his career to understanding and chronicling cases of self-deception and error: false inferences based on psychological assumptions, false inferences based on the presence or absence of materials in a photograph, false inferences based on the logical inconsistency of testimony. It's hardly likely that one of the planet's carefulest thinkers on self-deception has spent 20 years obsessively researching a case and, in the end, is merely deceiving himself.It may be many years before we see another book like this one. It is not every day, or even every decade, that we get a book that is the product of 20+ years of careful thinking about such a non-cozy truth. Nor is it every decade that we get a book with such serious implications: the potential to give a fair trial to a man who may have been wrongfully sentenced to life in prison, the potential to change the way the country thinks about its justice system, and the potential to open eyes to our own self-deception, not just in how we prosecute criminals, but in our mundane day-to-day lives.We ought to support this book, no matter how wrong you think its conclusions are, because this is precisely the type of work that we urgently need more of.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVMDA9URUA8ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594203431#wasThisHelpful","RVMDA9URUA8ED","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That ought to give you a sense of how sacred the text is to people, and how important it is to read.The negative reviewers are right that this is a near-sacred piece of text, one deserving of your carefulest attention, but for the same reason, they are exactly wrong that the book does the text a disservice. For two reasons:1. One line per page forces you to slow down, to consider the words more carefully. To pause. Think.2. The mere fact that the text is in a book changes our approach to it--gives it more weight. Here's William Deresiewicz: ""It's not that the text is any different on a screen than it is in a book.

"I always thought that if someone cares about something deeply enough (and provided they are reasonably good at articulating it), then I will want to read it, no matter the subject. This book kind of overturned that.Geoff Dyer is a special species of aesthete. Or maybe just an extreme example of an aesthete. The aesthete of all aesthetes. This is a man who cares more deeply about aesthetics and beauty than most of us care about our mother. It would be fair to use the term ""obsessive."" He speaks of jazz musician Don Cherry with a saintly if not creepy reverence. He will plead passersby to tell him where he can find a Doughnut Plant doughnut. He will organize his entire day around the right cup of cappuccino. The man can't help but to write essays examining the merits of chained-bicycle street memorials.This all makes for a fascinating read, at least for a while. Geoff Dyer is the first person I would go to for an assessment of an object's aesthetic merits, but reading 415 pages of those assessments was for me - someone who could fairly be called an aesthete himself - sort of tiresome.The troubling part is that Dyer's concern for aesthetics seems to supersede his concern for anything else, like, well, people. His concern is more for the chained-bicycle street memorials than for the people they memorialize. His concern is more for the immaculate fluffiness of hotel bathrobes than for the people who wear them. His concern is more for his mate's opinion of Burning Man than it is for the woman who will be attending Burning Man with him. He calls her ""the woman that I had recently started sleeping with."" (Notice he uses ""that"" instead of ""who."")If you don't share his deep passion for these things, the overall feeling from this book is one not of aesthetic appreciation but of profound loneliness.Regardless, I'd recommend reading at least a couple of the essays/reviews because this man has such a depth of concern for aesthetics that he penetrates them to a level that we ordinary folks cannot fathom.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLT5RT1VO1RS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555975798#wasThisHelpful","RLT5RT1VO1RS1","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewer jafrank said, ""The tone in most of these pieces is so generically, so cleanly misanthropic that it almost makes misanthropy itself boring. ... it all feels like someone checking things off of an old list of grievances."" He also used the word ""milquetoast""--I had to look it up, it means ""a timid man or boy considered childish or unassertive.""Either jafrank is making shoddy inferences or I am, because I sensed that Franzen was doing exactly the opposite: What jafrank calls a timid display of misanthropic grievances was, from my seat, a bold and compassionate criticism of ""porn-soaked modernity,"" an urgent attempt to have us acknowledge our self-stimulation, our individualism, our faulty understanding of ""love,"" our emptiness.The book is essentially the work of a social critic, and strange as it may sound to many people who tend to think of critics as being motivated by the lower emotions - envy, disdain, contempt even - critics are, above all, people who are in love with beautiful things, and who worry that those things will get broken.Let's please not dismiss this book as timid misanthropy, because we urgently need more critics. More Franzens.---If you aren't sure whether you'll want to read this book, check out first the chapters ""Pain Won't Kill You"" and ""David Foster Wallace."" Those are, I think, the most compelling chapters.---If you adored this book, then you might want to check out the works of other highly perceptive social critics: William Deresiewicz, Werner Herzog, Errol Morris, and (of course) David Foster Wallace. And please let me know if you have other recommendations. Good social criticism is hard to find.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PEE1HU20WHVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374153574#wasThisHelpful","R1PEE1HU20WHVX","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewer ""Angry Mofo"" always provides an interesting critique of Herzog's films. He calls this one ""closest to a failure"" and among his criticisms is that ""the film should have ended with the last dream sequence"" because...""It wraps up the tragic aspect of the story, and would have left Hauser's image with a lyrical cast. Unfortunately, the film drags on and closes with a hideous brain-chopping scene, not graphic, but still gruesome and repulsive. [...] It comes across as needlessly callous, robbing Hauser of his dignity and reiterating the film's broken-record message about the hypocrisy of society.""I agree that the dream sequences were the most poignant and poetic moments of the film, but I strongly disagree that the ending Herzog chose was ""callous"" or un-poetic. In fact, the ending is what I cannot stop thinking about, and it, more than any other scene, forces you to seriously consider Hauser's ideas and visions and perspective, because it so perfectly mocks and robs us of any sort of scientific or material explanation to his ""strange condition."" It is, in fact, one of the best endings I've seen to a Herzog film (others that come to mind are Gesualdo and Cave of Forgotten Dreams), which means it's one of the best endings I've seen to a film, period.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C74UJVRKR73O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005R248#wasThisHelpful","R3C74UJVRKR73O","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Buying racquetballs is confusing, even for someone like me who plays regularly and has used all of the different colors at one point or another. Someone should create an in-depth, brand-by-brand guide, but for now I offer you a brief tutorial on the different colors and their standard uses.BLUE - For amateur or recreational players - These are the cheapest and most commonly used ball and can be found in Wal-Mart or any sporting goods store. They work fine but tend to break more easily than others and tend lose their bounce faster than others.RED - The fastest option - A lot of people who I play with prefer the red ball, the fastest ball on the market, and I didn't realize until doing a little research that the red ball is actually intended as an outdoor ball since that extra liveliness is needed on an outdoor court. With a fresh red ball, it can feel like you are playing with a rubber bouncy ball, which can be both fun and frustrating. The nice thing is that even after many plays the ball still has decent bounce, so it may be the longest-lasting option. This ball favors those with a power game. This ball is not available at all sporting goods stores so you may want to buy it online.PINK - Basically the same as red, but probably easier to see - Of the serious racquetball players I know, the pink ball is probably their favorite, and not just because it appeals to their feminine side. I think the primary reason is that it is as lively as the red balls but probably a little easier to see (red can be hard to see because red, white, and brown all blur together at high speeds). I may be misjudging since I've only used it a couple of times, but the pink ball also seems slightly thicker and sturdier than the red ball.PURPLE - Another fast option; most common ball on pro tours - This is the fastest ball that is expressly designed for indoor play (unlike the red or pink balls). It's probably the most commonly used ball on pro tours as it is the official ball of the IRT. However, with this ball you should be careful that it says ""HD"" in the name because I'm pretty sure there are some balls that should be in the blue category but just happen to be colored purple.GREEN - A fast-ish, sturdy option - This might be the second-most commonly used ball behind blues and can be found at many sporting goods stores (but not at Wal-Mart, most likely). It's not as fast as the purple or red but faster than the blue, so is a nice in-between ball. I've also found that it tends to be a fairly sturdy ball, resistant to breaks. On the downside, some people seem to have trouble seeing the green ball (especially if they are colorblind).BLACK - Slowest ball, for ralliers - Technically, the black ball is designed to be the slowest to allow for the longest rallies, so it may be the ball preferred by people who can't move as swiftly or who have more of a finesse game. But it gets confusing, because I've played with two different brands of black balls, one that was the worst I have ever played with (called Slazenger Black) because it felt like I was playing squash -- the ball wasn't just slow, it didn't bounce! -- and the other brand I played with (don't know what it was; maybe Ektelon) felt near-perfect because it was slightly heavier than the typical ball but still had good bounce, so it was easy to anticipate while also bouncing at reasonable height. If I can figure out what that brand was, I will update this post.---Bottom line: I suggest the pink ball if you are looking for a lively ball and short rallies, the black ball (but not the Slazenger!) if you are looking for a slow ball and long rallies, or the green ball if you are looking for something in between. The blue ball is also fine if you're just looking for something basic and cheap.Prices will typically be cheaper (probably 15-35% cheaper) if you buy them in-store, but a lot of stores don't have a great selection or don't allow you to buy in bulk, so there are benefits to buying online, too.

"Buying racquetballs is confusing, even for someone like me who plays regularly and has used all of the different colors at one point or another. Someone should create an in-depth, brand-by-brand guide, but for now I offer you a brief tutorial on the different colors and their standard uses.BLUE - For amateur or recreational players - These are the cheapest and most commonly used ball and can be found in Wal-Mart or any sporting goods store. They work fine but tend to break more easily than others and tend lose their bounce faster than others.RED - The fastest option - A lot of people who I play with prefer the red ball, the fastest ball on the market, and I didn't realize until doing a little research that the red ball is actually intended as an outdoor ball since that extra liveliness is needed on an outdoor court. With a fresh red ball, it can feel like you are playing with a rubber bouncy ball, which can be both fun and frustrating. The nice thing is that even after many plays the ball still has decent bounce, so it may be the longest-lasting option. This ball favors those with a power game. This ball is not available at all sporting goods stores so you may want to buy it online.PINK - Basically the same as red, but probably easier to see - Of the serious racquetball players I know, the pink ball is probably their favorite, and not just because it appeals to their feminine side. I think the primary reason is that it is as lively as the red balls but probably a little easier to see (red can be hard to see because red, white, and brown all blur together at high speeds). I may be misjudging since I've only used it a couple of times, but the pink ball also seems slightly thicker and sturdier than the red ball.PURPLE - Another fast option; most common ball on pro tours - This is the fastest ball that is expressly designed for indoor play (unlike the red or pink balls). It's probably the most commonly used ball on pro tours as it is the official ball of the IRT. However, with this ball you should be careful that it says ""HD"" in the name because I'm pretty sure there are some balls that should be in the blue category but just happen to be colored purple.GREEN - A fast-ish, sturdy option - This might be the second-most commonly used ball behind blues and can be found at many sporting goods stores (but not at Wal-Mart, most likely). It's not as fast as the purple or red but faster than the blue, so is a nice in-between ball. I've also found that it tends to be a fairly sturdy ball, resistant to breaks. On the downside, some people seem to have trouble seeing the green ball (especially if they are colorblind).BLACK - Slowest ball, for ralliers - Technically, the black ball is designed to be the slowest to allow for the longest rallies, so it may be the ball preferred by people who can't move as swiftly or who have more of a finesse game. But it gets confusing, because I've played with two different brands of black balls, one that was the worst I have ever played with (called Slazenger Black) because it felt like I was playing squash -- the ball wasn't just slow, it didn't bounce! -- and the other brand I played with (don't know what it was; maybe Ektelon) felt near-perfect because it was slightly heavier than the typical ball but still had good bounce, so it was easy to anticipate while also bouncing at reasonable height. If I can figure out what that brand was, I will update this post.---Bottom line: I suggest the pink ball if you are looking for a lively ball and short rallies, the black ball (but not the Slazenger!) if you are looking for a slow ball and long rallies, or the green ball if you are looking for something in between.

"This is David Gray's least successful album. Listen to this album and I suspect you will find that shocking. The feelings of this 26-year-old were delivered with such cutting precision that it feels less like you are listening to David Gray and more like you are listening to sadness and angst and longing themselves.I can think of only two reasons why this is not one of the best-selling albums of the 90s: (1) the album cover is not exactly inviting, and (2) it was released at a time [1994] when musical nihilism was at its peak, when grunge dominated the radio and when the mood of the time was ""whatever."" This album, however, is decisively non-whatever--it delivers feeling with a stomach-sinking sincerity.It's interesting to contrast this album to his later ones. His later albums like ""Life in Slow Motion"" are musically more interesting and more mature with greater delicacy and with more violin and mellow electronica and layered instrumental complexity, but you won't find David Gray on such raw display as you do in this album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHWI1MVGDN1U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005KB4T#wasThisHelpful","R3UHWI1MVGDN1U","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you, like I did, have suspicions that anything meaningful can be said about life from an MBA perspective - i.e., that terms like ""resources,"" ""processes,"" ""priorities,"" ""metrics,"" and ""marginal upside"" just cheapen any discussion about what it means to live well - then I encourage you to flip first to the Epilogue. The Epilogue is the best and most important chapter of the book.In one part of it, Christensen describes the biggest challenge he faced. A clot lodged itself into a part of his brain where writing and speaking are formed, preventing him from being able to speak or to write beyond a few simple words. But it wasn't his biggest challenge for the clich reason that he had to ""overcome"" a burdensome physical ailment. It was his biggest challenge because he had to overcome his Self:""I became focused on myself and on my problems. It was a numbing, downward spiral--and for the first time in my life I truly felt despair. The more I focused on my problems, the less energy I had to get better. I recognized that I had come to a fork in the road. I could try to hide my problems, retreat from the world, and focus on myself. Or I could change paths. I resolved that I needed to refocus on expending as much of my cognitive and physical capacity as possible on what I knew to be my purpose. And as I did that--focusing on resolving others' challenges rather than my own--the despair fled, and I felt happy again.""This book is written by an extremely thoughtful man, one whose words deserve your carefulest attention. Without your carefulest attention, you are unlikely to get much from this book, because it isn't written in compelling prose. There are lots of business theories and abstractions and generalizations and matter-of-fact statements that are unlikely to strike your heart. At no point are you likely to reach for a tissue, for example. But there are profound insights in here, if you listen and question and think.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PKYFNDDJYNOM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062102419#wasThisHelpful","R1PKYFNDDJYNOM","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In this film, which has been named to several top-10 lists (including Ebert's) and which has been called Ozu's masterpiece, we see a contrast between modern, post-war self-involved ""busy"" people and the glowing version of Ozu's ideal woman - and person - in Noriko (Setsuko Hara), a woman who is infinitely kind and self-sacrificing. One novelist said of Hara, ""We would sigh or let out a great breath from the depths of our hearts, for what we felt was precisely this: Can it be possible that there is such a woman in this world?""Like all of Ozu's films, Tokyo Story's pacing is ""calm,"" and important events are often not shown on screen, only implied. The camera never moves so as to elevate the feeling of calmness, which is quite unlike what you might be used to seeing in your motion pictures.It's remarkable how relatable and moving this film is after 60 years, especially since it originated from a culture that couldn't have been more different than my own. But if you aren't familiar/comfortable with meditative films, I might suggest that before jumping into this film you get your feet wet with films like Gates of Heaven or The White Diamond, which are equally as meditative but have more modern pacing and camera work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GLI9D04SDNYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JLV7#wasThisHelpful","R3GLI9D04SDNYH","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine this: A 28-year-old steals a 35 mm camera from a film school, heads to the South American jungle, and, with a miniscule budget, convinces 450 actors and extras - many of whom do not speak his language - to not only endure jungle heat and insects and sleep in a communal barn but also to trek over a muddy mountain with alpacas and horses and with heavy equipment on their backs and to board small, hand-crafted rafts on a river that, if you fell in, you'd be sucked under and killed. And imagine that this 28-year-old, after making up the script as he goes along, shooting most of the scenes only once, and editing the film in only a month, ends up creating what Roger Ebert named one of the 10 best films, period.The story of the making of this film is almost as insane as the film itself. On their way to the jungle, the cast and crew were at the last minute diverted from a plane that ended up crashing, killing 90+ people. (28 years later, Werner made a documentary about the sole survivor called Wings of Hope.) Once there, resources were extremely scarce. Werner sometimes had to sell his boots or his wristwatch just to get breakfast. The total budget was $370,000 (or about $1.9 million in today's dollars) and one-third of that went to the lead actor, Klaus Kinski. Kinski, by the way, was about as mad and uncontrollable on the set as he appears in the film. One night he became so infuriated at the noise created by the partying extras that he randomly fired three shots into the barn. He was lucky he didn't kill anyone. Later he hit someone so hard in the head with his sword that had the person not been wearing an iron helmet his skull would have been split.When Werner was asked how he dealt with all this when he was only 28, he responded, ""I had a clear perspective and I was fortified with enough philosophy to get through it.""That perspective/philosophy is not only what allows Werner to complete such ambitious films, it's also what makes his films worth watching. There is a reason he went through all the jungle-imposed trouble. Said Werner, ""In this film, human beings are put to the real test. You can learn more about ourselves this way than from a film that takes place in a car, a restaurant, and on the telephone. The purpose of the jungle is to explore what is the bottom line of our existence, and how do we behave under particular strains and stresses, and then you gain much deeper insights into our very nature.""In this film (and in all of his films), the jungle is not just a scenic backdrop, it is a character itself. It causes the other characters to go insane and it, too, grows increasingly insane. But Werner doesn't consider the jungle exotic. ""It's just another forest.""What's particularly hypnotizing about the movie is the images. Images like the woman in the royal gown walking straight into the jungle, or like the 400 monkeys scurrying around a raft full of corpses, or like the unendurable silence that everyone knows means death, or like the horse being shoved off the raft and then standing on the shoreline, perfectly still but slowly disappearing. The film alternates between spontaneous documentary-like shots and highly-stylized frozen still-lifes. Instead of showing close ups of the actors' faces, it shows characters from behind so that we have to project emotions into them. It uses a choir organ that sounds vaguely but not quite like the human voice. And the bird calls are carefully timed to maximize tension.As much as I adore this movie, it doesn't sit well with me that this is Herzog's best-known film (outside of Grizzly Man). At times, it has the feel of a movie created by a 28-year-old. Especially in comparison to his later movies, there is more blood and action and dark humor and overt metaphors. Fitzcarraldo is, in plot, a very similar film, but since it was created 10 year later it is substantially more mature. Please don't let this be the only Herzog film you see. (Psst, check out The White Diamond and Encounters at the End of the World.)---Here are some other things to help you appreciate this film:* Werner kept telling Kinski to ""move like a crab."" Kinski did this to great effect--genuinely frightening most of the cast.* Since there was such a small budget, Werner did all the costume design himself, with ""help"" (quotes deserved) from Kinski.* The corpse shown in the 50th minute is a real mummy. It is extremely fragile so bringing it to the set was a real challenge. They actually purchased an extra plane ticket for the mummy and sat it next to Werner's brother on the plane.* Werner: ""I've never storyboarded anything in my life. I think it's a disease of Hollywood.""* At one point, over an artistic disagreement of how his character should behave, Kinski threatened to leave the set. Werner threatened in return that if he turned around, there would be 8 bullets in his back. He was serious. Kinski was well-behaved ""for the next 10 days.""* The same stolen camera that he used for this film he used in 8 other films. But he doesn't like to consider it ""theft."" ""It was just a necessity--I had some sort of natural right for a camera, a tool to work with.""* Much of this information comes from the commentary available on the DVD. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5KBK2EZU5QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6305972761#wasThisHelpful","R2A5KBK2EZU5QM","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These BiC's, which made their first American appearance in 1959, were designed exceptionally if not bizarrely well. And I don't mean in a quaint, historical way. These pens respect principles of space, form, structure, density, and gravity. Because of their hexagonal shape, they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength (try snapping one), and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability. A tiny hole drilled in the barrel's body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen. Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy. The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper, the ink slides out cleanly and, well,... perfectly. It's not only one of the most inexpensive pens, it's also probably the most efficient pen, with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words (or about 2 novels). A true masterpiece of design. I'm not the only one who thinks so. They have their own exhibit in the Museum of Modern Art.This particular pen is a slight variation on the original, with a slightly wider foundation and using slightly more ink (hence the ""Bold""). It's still great, you just probably wouldn't be able to write 2 novels with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10LIAT12LYM3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00347A8PS#wasThisHelpful","R10LIAT12LYM3W","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"***The point/mood of the movie***The [intensely dark] mood and point of this movie I think is best summarized in a monologue given by a priest-actor at a funeral in the 107th minute:""Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make. You can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for 20 years, and you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate---but there *is.* It's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes, or it seems to but it doesn't really. So you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along, something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is, I feel so angry. And the truth is, I feel so f'ing sad. And the truth is, I felt so f'ing hurt for so f'ing long, and for just as long I've been pretending I'm okay, just to get along. Just for---I don't know why. Maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, f everybody. Amen.""The real point of the movie, though, is what Sammy says minutes earlier: ""I've watched you forever, Caden, but you've never really looked at anyone other than yourself.""---***The point of the surrealism***This film, while ambitiously trying to capture all of reality in 120 minutes, injects a hefty dose of absurdity and surrealism. The point, I think, is actually to make it feel realer by suckerpunching you with some unconscious yet poignant images. David Foster Wallace said it best when describing David Lynch's Blue Velvet:""Blue Velvet captured something crucial about the way the U.S. present acted upon our nerve endings, something crucial that couldn't be analyzed or reduced to a system of codes or aesthetic principles or workshop techniques. The movie helped me realize that first-rate experimentalism is a way not to `transcend' or `rebel against' the truth but actually to *honor* it. It brought home that the very most important artistic communications take place at a level that not only isn't intellectual but isn't even fully conscious, that the unconscious's true medium isn't verbal but imagistic, and that whether the images are Realistic or Postmodern or Expressionistic or Surreal or what-the-hell-ever is less important than whether they feel true, whether they ring psychic cherries in the communicatee.""---***The effect of the absurdity/surrealism***There were two scenes that especially rung my psychic cherries. One was in the 39th minute when Caden explains his theatre ambitions to Hazel as if to impress her, and yet she couldn't look more bored or uninterested. It was both hilarious and distressingly sad. Here's the quote:""The idea is to do a massive theatre piece--y'know, uncompromising, uh, honest. [Hazel's cheeks deflate, her eyes sag.] Here's what I think theatre is [Hazel looks down to find her tea, sips, raises her eyebrows in faux interest]: It's, um, the beginning of thought. It's, uh, the truth not yet spoken. [She looks back to the table, purses her lips in faux respect.] It's what a man feels like after he's been clocked in the jaw. It's love, in all its messiness. [She rests her head on her chin, then looks to see the source of the faint chatter behind her.] I want all of us, players and patrons alike, to soak in the communal bath of it. The mikfah, is what Jews call it. [Looks back again.] Because we're all in the same water, after all, soaking in our, uh, very... menstrual blood. And nocturnal emissions. This is what I want to try. [She finally shows genuine excitement because her soup has arrived!]""The other cherry-ringing scene, easily the saddest of the film, was in the 101st minute when Caden goes to find his grown daughter. He watches her tattooed naked body dispassionately dance and blow bubbles behind acrylic glass. She doesn't recognize him. She doesn't even notice him. ""Olive, it's Daddy,"" he says as he knocks on the glass, growing increasingly more frustrated that she remains perfectly apathetic to his existence. He screams desperately, pounds the glass, and is escorted out. She keeps dispassionately dancing and blowing bubbles.----***In comparison to other similar-yet-not films***I've recently been on a kick of watching those films that Roger Ebert has declared the very best, the ones that seemingly try to and mostly succeed at capturing the enormity of life within their tiny bounds. It was really interesting to watch this film after watching Gates of Heaven (a documentary about a pet cemetery) and The Tree Of Life (an even more ambitious film than this one) because the message, at core, is eerily similar if not exactly the same while the approach and mood is so dramatically different. If you were only going to watch one of those three, my strongest recommendation would be Gates of Heaven.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4DX03IQUYGH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001P3SA8K#wasThisHelpful","R4DX03IQUYGH9","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you still think that John Mayer is a hokey teen-pop star who sings about puppy love amid a sea of blankets, then you urgently need to give him another listen.This album is quite good. ""Queen of California"" is probably the best track-- its final 75 seconds of complexly layered guitar will make you melt. ""If I Ever Get Around to Living"" has the rare and gratifying combination of delicacy and soulfulness. ""Walt Grace's Submarine Test"" is one of the best story songs since Bob Dylan's ""Boots of Spanish Leather.""This album has more of a folksy and country taste than his others, but it's subtle and varied. There is pedal steel on three tracks (Queen of California, Shadow Days, and Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey) and lap steel on another (Born and Raised). I don't recall if this is JM's first time using steel guitar, but he uses it well. In fact, my only complaint is that he doesn't use it often enough.Continuum is still his best album, and it isn't really close, but Born & Raised is a worthy and timely addition. Given the rapid musical desertification that is occurring at the hands of dance-pop glitz infested radio, Born & Raised comes as an intensely quenching and relieving swig of cool water. We should support this album for that reason alone-- to show that we still crave popular music that has soul.P.S. - If you adore this album, then you'd probably also adore a similarly folksy and steel-guitar-y album from Ray LaMontagne: God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29FEKW7T7R4ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007MAETA8#wasThisHelpful","R29FEKW7T7R4ND","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Except for Dog Bites Man, no TV series has induced more rib-hurting laughter in me. I adore this show.In my humble opinion, Sarah Silverman is freaking hilarious. What she says is funny, but it's *how* she says it - subtle inflections and mannerisms - that makes her extraordinarily funny.And if you think that she is spewing vulgarities and bigotry just to get a few shock-giggles, you aren't paying enough attention. She is more morally-serious than you probably realize. She does these things to magnify absurdity--to make them ironic and dumb.And Brian and Steve... oh my, what a pair.

"America's conversation about vaccines is complex, involving not only medical risks and benefits but also ideological beliefs about parental choice and the limits of government. It's also culturally interesting that the ""medical and public health establishment"" is treated with such skepticism by the broader public, and how the emotionally charged activism of non-experts (parents, celebrities, politicians) is competing with - and largely winning against - the dry and logical thinking of experts.P.S. - All Frontline programs are available for free online, including this one.

"These boys are onto something. You can tell by the crazed looks on the concert-goers' faces.You can also tell by their finances. As of June 2012, according to the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represents a $50 million business empire. Aside from their music sales, the band has already published three books and the top-selling calendar of all time. And they have commercial endorsements with Pokmon, Nokia, HarperCollins, and Hasbro.So, people - and in particular, girls - love them. And that's not necessarily bad. Certainly you'd rather have your daughter loving One Direction than, say, Pitbull. Their image is clean and wholesome. I would use the term ""puppy love"" if I could do so uncondescendingly.And the band takes steps to ensure its parent-friendly image. Certainly you wouldn't want your daughter reading the steams-of-consciousness of 18-y-o boys on Twitter, but they've got that covered: A team of social media experts tweets on their behalf.The one thing that doesn't sit well with me is how manufactured the whole thing is. They don't make their own music, they don't tweet their own tweets. They don't dance or sing or just generally behave in the way any normal self-respecting 18-y-o male would.

"You should watch this program. Why? As Jewel would say in the L'Oreal commercial, ""Because you're worth it.""Here was the synopsis that convinced me to watch it: ""Each year, legions of ad people, copywriters, market researchers, pollsters, consultants, and even linguists--most of whom work for one of six giant companies--spend billions of dollars and millions of man-hours trying to determine how to persuade consumers what to buy, whom to trust, and what to think. ... This 90-minute documentary explores how the cultures of marketing and advertising have come to influence not only what Americans buy, but also how they view themselves and the world around them.""Although I generally liked it, I was disappointed that very little attention was paid to the last part about how ""persuaders"" influence how we see ourselves. Most attention was paid to the behind-the-scenes stuff of how marketing works and some of the science/philosophy of it.I think to summarize it in one sentence, it would be exactly what the guy said at the very end of the program: ""The secret of all persuasion is to induce the person to persuade himself."" It's all about appealing to the unconscious/emotion/reptilian brain--making you feel (rather than think) that the product/idea/politician/whatever serves your own selfish primal desires.One marketing guru formed his marketing philosophy by studying why people join cults. The conclusion? People join both cults and brands for two reasons: (1) to belong, (2) to make meaning. ""We need to figure out what the world is all about, and we need the company of others. It's as simple as that.""My favorite moment, by far, is at the beginning of Chapter 4 ""Science of Selling"" when a market researcher probes a poor guy with a very awkward question: ""I've got a whole list of emotions here. I just want you to tell me yes or no as to whether you feel that emotion when you're eating white bread.""...Accepting?""The guy's eyebrows furl. He pauses. Looks to the side.""Do you feel accepting when you're eating white bread?,"" the market researcher asks again, as if the guy didn't understand the question.Another 2-second delay and then the guy finally answers, ""Yeah. I would say yes,"" in the least convincing possible way.----P.S. - All Frontline programs are available for free online.

"Trivia Q: What do the following things have in common?:* Monsterama* The Girls Next Door (and its spinoffs)* Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy* America's Book of Secrets* Bridget's Sexiest Beaches* Ancient AliensAnswer: They were all created by Kevin Burns.Kevin Burns (not to be confused with Ken Burns) is a master of the art of TV documentaries. He is one of the most successful men in Beverly Hills, having created over 100 TV documentaries in the past 17 years, and yet you probably know nothing about him.There is a line from his IMDB biography that I find mildly haunting: ""After the sudden death of his father in 1988, Burns decided the time had come to seek his fortune in Los Angeles."" I struggle to see how that logically follows. Why would the death of a father inspire Hollywood fortune-seeking?If his film credits are any indication, Burns is an unpretentious guy who loves monsters, celebrities, movies, and sex. (Who doesn't?) But what's fascinating about Burns is that he went from a fraternity president at a private boys' college in NY with a couple of highfalutin majors (English literature and history) to making TV documentaries about playgirls and aliens.""It's all about good storytelling,"" Burns says in an interview with TV Week. ""It has to be worth your time.""All of this is interesting context from which to understand Ancient Aliens.

"Because the points are so subtle and the layers are so seemingly bottomless, this is the most intellectually challenging film I've seen.Roger Ebert picked Gates of Heaven as one of the 10 greatest films because ""it is totally impenetrable. It is a mystery after 50 viewings that I have never solved. You can approach this film in a dozen different ways. It just doesn't have a bottom. And you can't decide, no matter how often you've seen it, if it's a comedy or a tragedy.""Werner Herzog, a mentor to Errol Morris, literally ate his shoe in order to see this film get made. Here's how Werner described it: ""It's not a film on pet cemeteries. It's a film on the family behind all that with all their failures and all their dreams and all their dramas. It's the only authentic film on love and emotions in Late Capitalism, and maybe it's the only authentic film on loss of emotions and distortion of feelings and degeneration of feelings. It's a very, very sad film, and very purely done. It's an extremely pure film. And a very mature film. It's Errol Morris's very first film and it's a film of a very mature filmmaker.""I'm glad this wasn't the first Errol Morris film I had seen simply because it's so immense and challenging that only through seeing his later films -- and in particular, Mr. Death and Tabloid -- could I understand, at least vaguely, what this film meant to him.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRL5NEDUSSGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DD6RWI#wasThisHelpful","RRL5NEDUSSGE","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this book fully expecting to write a mean, sarcastic review. I envisioned leading off with an Onion-like headline: ""The key to Good Living finally revealed: Secret discovered by two Los Angeles shrinks.""Subtitle: ""Secret now available on Amazon for price of a few cheeseburgers.""This book, from the outside, appears to commit the most deplorable of self-help crimes: selling clichd half-truths to existentially anxious go-getters under the empty but marketable guise of ""motivation""--telling people, for instance, that the bountiful gifts of the universe are theirs if they just use their mind as a magnet, and/or practice 4 simple exercises.This book, though, to my utter shock, not only isn't reprehensible, but also is very much worth reading.This is not to say that the book is without flaws. Even some glaring flaws. Namely, (1) syrupy and vague language, (2) sometimes relying too heavily on mystical thinking, and (3) overselling the ""tools"" as the focus of the book and the solution to all your problems. But when you dig down to the book's core message, it is non-obvious and persuasive and I'd even say _urgent_.The book ought to be re-named to something like, ""How to stop seeing yourself as the world's protagonist, and why it matters."" That's really what it's about. The authors tell you this directly, they answer all your nagging questions and concerns, and they give concrete ways to do it--namely, by giving you scripts (ones which've worked with their clients) and advising you when best to use them.The bottom line is that I strongly recommend this book unless you (like me) have trouble seeing past syrupy and vague language. In that case, check out David Foster Wallace's version: This Is Water.I put below what I thought were the most important points of the book.---Notes: (1) this does not include any of the actual ""tools,"" which I think ought to be treated more as friendly tips, and (2) I put many of these points in my own words.* Beware of goals like power or wealth or status, or even goals like a loyal spouse or healthy children, simply because they are external. With these goals, you will be endlessly unsatisfied, always craving more. The only goals that matter (and, coincidentally, the only goals we can control) are internal. (p. 52; 162)* ""Usually we think of love in a moralistic or religious context; we try to be loving because it's the ""right"" thing to do. But the abstract concept of ""doing the right thing"" isn't enough to change your behavior. ... I never tell patients to be loving because it's the right thing to do. I tell them to do it because it's in their self-interest. I remind them that they don't want to live in a state of rage--not because it's bad, but because it's painful and debilitating."" (p. 85-86)* The authors criticize our usual notion of ""love,"" which is felt only when another person is pleasing us. ""You feel it for your child when he smiles at you adoringly, or your partner when she looks particularly attractive."" Like children, we expect love to be effortless and immediate and instinctive, but the only kind of love that matters is independent of impulses. It takes work to be truly loving. (p. 78-80)* Until you can control your own mind, you will be immature. Simple as that. (p. 160)* What we call ""spirituality"" is just recognizing that there are things bigger than yourself, and the real value of it is that it's stronger than your impulses, so you are better-equipped to navigate the day-to-day tedium without getting hung up on petty desires or ways that you've been ""wronged."" (p. 90)* What we call ""evil"" is just the part of you that has an impulse to act out of pure self-interest without regard to anyone or anything that gets in the way. ""This manifests itself in selfishness, greed, or, when your aims are thwarted, hatred or destructive rage."" (p. 132)* Everyone wants to feel that as an individual we have value. But our immediate reaction is often to look outside of ourselves for evidence--for approval or validation. But when you crave the approval of others, you give them power over you. They become authority figures who define your value. (p. 108-9)* We are often uncomfortable ""speaking out"" because of what others might think of us. The danger of not speaking out, though, far beyond discomfort, is that you don't get to hear yourself. You don't get to find out who you are. (p. 123)* In our cosmology, it is either feed or be food. We see ourselves as alone against an uncaring universe. Feeling we won't be provided for, we become obsessed with controlling our future. (p. 151)* Normally we envision peace of mind as a resting state. But that isn't peace, it's passivity. Peace of mind takes work; it is an active state. (p. 162-3)* ""Success is paralyzing for a simple reason. It makes you feel as if you did it all yourself. Ironically, the moment you claim all the credit for your success, you also have to take the blame for any future failure--and that's terrifying. This makes you risk-averse, less creative, and afraid to move forward with new ideas and new projects."" (p. 165)* Everyone succumbs to worry, fearing that things are far beyond our control, and in a very primal way, we take refuge in the only activity that seems to offer a sense of power--thinking. The paradox is that that's exactly when our thoughts spiral into uncontrollable worry. (p. 171-2)* The fundamental danger of living in Late Capitalism is letting a consumer mentality seep into the depths of your psyche. If you let this happen, you will expect a reward for the slightest effort--or better, for no effort at all. And you will care only about what you get from the world, not about what you might add to it.

"The cover of this book is amazing. A hefty man with a crew cut and a sleeveless shirt kneels to put his nose to the ground. He wraps his chubby hand around a small orange flower growing out of a weed growing out of gravel. He smells it. It's probably odorless. His imposing (and pale) right arm pushes on the ground to give him balance to prevent his nose from falling into the ground, and yet the same hand appears to rest on the ground almost limply.I'm not sure what the metaphor is, but it's overwhelming.Oh, the book? I think I spent more time staring at the cover than reading the pages underneath it. I was unable to get lifted into George Saunders's world. I read the first few chapters, skimmed the middle, and then read the last. It has all the elements that I normally love in a book - absurdity, humor, cultural observations, morality, heady prose - but there was something that prevented it from being compelling to me. Maybe it's because it's sometimes almost sci-fi heady and abstract, or maybe it's because I couldn't find a clear point or theme in the chapters--they seemed instead like cultural observation after cultural observation after cultural observation, without ever hammering a single observation persistently or deeply enough to strike a vein.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20ZA2ZDR2IK8L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159448242X#wasThisHelpful","R20ZA2ZDR2IK8L","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She even suggests that we be ""ambitious"" in picking a good partner, and she advocates having classes and guidance counselors to help us pick a spouse much as we have them to pick a career.This book would have been more convincing if instead of emphasizing the importance of accruing-resources-before-it's-too-late, it emphasized that certain things are too important to be treated as ""resources.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SDTWTBXME7AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0446561762#wasThisHelpful","R1SDTWTBXME7AB","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the only Errol Morris film that I will give less than 5 stars. It's hard to believe I'm going all the way down to 1. That needs explaining.This film could have been equally as good if not better than all the rest. Morris had heard about a rural town in Florida where people had been severing their limbs in order to receive insurance benefits. Certainly there's some substance there - something interesting - not just in the brutality or absurdity but in what it says about us inhabitants of Late Capitalism.But then once he got to Vernon, FL and started filming, he found extreme resistance-- he actually received death threats warning him against including anything related to limb-severing in the film. Understandably, he abandoned the storyline. The result is a movie that is literally about nothing.What's worse is that the movie ends up having a thick whiff of elitism. That's because Morris salvaged his funds by interviewing local eccentrics and including their goofiest quotes in the final cut. Because there're no events and no storyline, we don't get to see who the people really are; we only get to laugh at their surface personas. It's as though we're people-gazing from the sidewalk.  If this movie appeals to us at all, it appeals to the worst parts of us.This was the first Errol Morris movie I had seen and I was so un-smitten that it was years before I tried any of his other films, and, for me, that's this movie's most reprehensible crime. It is seriously disturbing that Vernon, Florida is more popular and more highly-rated than Gates of Heaven, which Roger Ebert has long kept in his top-10-of-all-time list, or than Mr. Death, which might be both the most well-crafted and most meaningful movie I've seen, or than Tabloid, which is the single best ""love"" (quotes deserved) story that I've heard, and includes two of the best moments in recent film memory.If you choose to watch Vernon, Florida, please keep these things in mind.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUTJ3A1Z52CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028O9YR6#wasThisHelpful","R2GUTJ3A1Z52CV","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like Mindy, sort of in a little-sister way. She's sweet and cute and friendly and says funny things. I would use the word ""fluffy"" if I could do so un-condescendingly.At first I was frustrated by the book because of its...well...fluffiness. Have you no existential angst?, I wondered. Don't you see death and misery and loneliness? Aren't you supposed to be a comedian, and aren't all comedians ""tortured""?She has problems and insecurities like any human - she goes into them in-depth in the book - but ""tortured"" is not a word you'd use to describe her. Selfishly, I wanted a little more depth or darkness from her, but that's just not who she is. And she doesn't need to be. The book works for what it is.One reviewer nailed it: This is a great book for the treadmill. It's almost like a long magazine article. It is easy and pleasant and it even contains useful tips, including tips for guys about what women are looking for in a man (Answer: not a boy).If you're looking for something a little darker and funnier, my strongest recommendation would be Sarah Silverman's The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee. If you're looking for something so dark that it will wipe that miserable smile off your face, check out Michael Ian Black's You're Not Doing It Right: Tales of Marriage, Sex, Death, and Other Humiliations.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JMD2COJULI7S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307886263#wasThisHelpful","R1JMD2COJULI7S","A1LBIZLET9CW1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LBIZLET9CW1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed how all of the pieces of Claires story were slowly revealed and then came together. I was really rooting for Claire and Jodie through the whole book.This was a fantastic story. Filled with action, adventure, and an intense criminal/legal aspect that immediately pulls the reader in. That the main character is a lesbian is more of an adjective rather than a plot point. Which makes it so much better. The setting was brilliantly described, to the point that I could practically taste the sand in my mouth, could feel the sweat rolling down my back, and feel the sun beating down on my skin, scorching my flesh. The characters were delightfully fleshed out. Everyone I was supposed to hate, I hated with a passion, and everyone I was supposed to love I loved fiercely, and the ones I was supposed to be on the fence about, like Faye, I waffled in my feelings over until the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LE200PG3PIDG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JDSRLQG#wasThisHelpful","R2LE200PG3PIDG","A1E481YU3ZPK6S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1E481YU3ZPK6S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UPDATE: The manufacturer did send a replacement bug vacuum.  In a month, it had one brief blip where it wouldn't turn on, but in general it has worked.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This was a very nice idea with some nice features, but unfortunately it's of very poor quality.  Within 2 days, the vacuum portion no longer worked.  My husband who does repair work disassembled it and discovered the problem was that a very cheap microswitch inside of it was broken.  It would have cost only 50 cents to use a decent quality one in the first place.Also, before the microswitch broke, we had discovered that the batteries that were included had almost no charge left.  They died in less than 48 hours and had to be replaced.  Once replaced, the suction was much stronger than when it had arrived.  So it's not like my kids had used it excessively and worn it out; there wasn't much oomph left in the batteries to begin with.Quality is really lacking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ16KXHQT8QYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UJGU9GK#wasThisHelpful","RZ16KXHQT8QYT","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cover is very nice.  However, it's too thick and the holes for the rings set too far in so that the cover rarely completely closes on one try.  I usually have to go down along the edge and press it the rest of the way down the ring.  And it's only 21 sheets of paper.

"Nice idea.  Very good taste.  If you're using this at work or don't have young kids like I do, this can be especially convenient and left on the table or counter if you're a frequent coffee/tea drinker.  As is, I keep it on an upper pantry shelf.  It's nice that it doesn't need to be refrigerated, but the bottle does state that it's best used within 30 days of opening.Be aware that the nozzle opening may need scraped clear periodically.  Mine ended up with dried crusted creamer.  Until I figured it out, I could only press it down very slowly or it squirted creamer out to the side, missing my cup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R72SI3TOLGMC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U8T3SF2#wasThisHelpful","R72SI3TOLGMC8","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's a nice idea, but the discs had rough seams at spots along the edge.  So the first time I used this, it scratched up my tabletop.

"I haven't received the final product yet, but with Vine's time limit on reviews, I'm forced to write one now.This seemed like a promising idea.  It would have been nice to see a bit more variety allowed.  All pages are set up to have a picture at the top and several lines of text at the bottom.  The instructions with the kit could have been a bit clearer as they basically said use only marker, which is difficult for writing words.

"I was very disappointed in this product.  Even immediately after it dried, there was almost no bad taste with only brief contact.  I don't see how this would work to stop nail-biters.  As for thumb-sucking, you have to have it in your mouth for several seconds for the taste to kick in, and even then it's a mildly unpleasant taste that I could see many determined thumbsuckers just ignoring until it wore off.

"The book continued the author's previous pattern of lots of coincidences and soap opera elements to further the plot and cheaply create drama.  But it didn't have the pluses that were in the first two books to balance that out.  The characterization was shallow with actions that didn't naturally flow from it.  There were lots of short scenes as we jumped from one story line to one of the many others.  The main male characters just were flat and uninteresting.  There was a lot of telling the reader rather than showing.  In several areas, the dialogue or narrative felt forced.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T1X5RTOZAFWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KNI4XU#wasThisHelpful","R1T1X5RTOZAFWA","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The whole book is in poetry form.  I thought thered be some poetry included, but no its the entire thing.  But it doesnt really meet my definition of poetry.  Much of it is just really prose that has been broken up into little fragments all over the place, or sometimes its just relatively incoherent fragments, all of it at least double-spaced so every page is mostly white space.The sentences are brokenInto pieces like shardsLaying on the sand.It makes this a very annoying book to read.  My 12 yo son adores history and will read just about anything thats history-related.  He wouldnt touch this book, and I dont blame him.  Which is very unfortunate, because I think the author could have written the book more normally, and it would have been much more enjoyable.I'll end with an excerpt from the book, and yes the double-spacing is how it's presented so that it takes up 4 times as much space as it should.There are so many choicesfor ways to spend paydaythat I almost feel temptedto go off by myself and keep mystingy silver wages so that I can buypaper and pencils to sketchevery wonder that I see when I walkthrough the forest, or even right here,on this bustling Bottle Alley streetmade of mudand rum.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V88EA1GT8R5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544109414#wasThisHelpful","R1V88EA1GT8R5M","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Updated reviewMy original rating was 3 star, as I felt the binder seemed closer to flimsy than to heavy-duty, but was waiting to see what happened.  I was right.  It took less than a year for the binder to start falling apart.  It didn't even get heavy use.  Just a modest number of pages in it, not knocked around, only looked through gently.  But the cardboard front and back are tearing away from the binding.  Definitely will get a different binder this time.Original ReviewI do have to say that this binder doesn't feel especially heavy duty to me.

"We currently have this air purifier in a room that's roughly twice the size of the 100 sq ft this air filter supposed to be good for.  And it's keeping up wonderfully.  It's a room with a lot of storage that's shut up and gathers lots of dust.  Before this air filter, I'd walk in and within a few minutes be sneezing and eyes itching with dust allergy.  That's no longer a problem.The indicator light to show the quality of the air is kind of neat, though not essential.  It is a nice feature that it adjusts the fan speed depending on air quailty, speeding up if things are not in the green.If space is an issue, this fits very nicely and unobtrusively in a corner.  While I prefer Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier as our number one purifier, with one running in the open floor plan downstairs and one in our master bedroom, the The AeraMax 100 Air Purifier is nice for a single room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V0GMUNS6MFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D52E2XG#wasThisHelpful","R3V0GMUNS6MFX","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased this book because I strongly suspected one of my children had an auditory processing disorder.  He seemed to have normal hearing when we tested him by whispering, saying his name when his back was turned, etc, but he had a lot of trouble with following oral instructions, misremembering what was said to him, etc.  This book was a great resource to help me understand what my son was experiencing.  The book is very easy to read, very understandable, written in a somewhat conversational style with lots of helpful examples.I would have liked more specific information about the different types of auditory processing disorder, therapy for the various types, etc.  I wanted to go into his evaluation fully prepared and armed with all the information I could get.  However, this book is probably informative enough for the average parent.What I most appreciated about the book was that she was both optimistic and realistic.  She made it very clear that much could be done to help with the various difficulties, but also recognizing that not everyone will be able to overcome all their difficulties completely.  Realistically, that their auditory processing disorders, even after therapy, may place some limitations on career, etc.  But, none of us cannot truly be anything we want to be, as we each have our own areas of weakness and difficulty.  I appreciated the fact that she didn't allow the reader to believe that there was a magic pill that would totally fix APD for everyone.As for my son, it turned out that we were right about his hearing being normal and in thinking that he had APD.  He has significant difficulty with auditory memory and with hearing when there is background noise.  This book gave us a better understanding of what he is dealing with.  I would definitely recommend this book to parents of children with (suspected) APD.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A7OXQZS9TFXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FC0WOM#wasThisHelpful","R2A7OXQZS9TFXP","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is interesting reading.  The author does a good job explaining different conversational approaches in a wide range of areas, and she uses a lot of good examples.  I don't quite agree with her take on it that there's never a style that is inherently inferior, but she definitely helped me have a better understanding of how two people might mentally approach a conversation and the troubles that can arise if they don't understand the other's approach.  However, the book is definitely light on any sort of how-to as to what you do with what you've now learned, very little about how to different types can improve communication, etc.  Still, it's thought-provoking and enjoyable reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LVYCJJTG099X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345379721#wasThisHelpful","R2LVYCJJTG099X","AAWUXA65NDMYM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AAWUXA65NDMYM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After having only used high end laptops for the past few years, I was hesitant on this one.  Pleased that performance is very good and with an SSD upgrade, the i3 is more than tolerable.The screen is large enough to actually get some work done, but the viewing angles are terrible.  What was a nice surprise was seeing how crisp the screen was, can't really see individual pixels unless you really try and having the GUI larger due to scaling is actually a lot easier to use.Never liked 8.1, but with touch, it's not bad for some things.  While you'll rarely use this as a tablet due to it's weight, it's nice to have.For around $400 (Thank you Black Friday), I couldn't be happier considering I paid $400 for a Nexus 10 not too long ago.  My old laptop was 14lbs (desktop replacement) and a pain to travel with, this one is relatively light and much easier to deal with, even the ""brick"" is small and light.The worst problem is very low audio, luckily the media players (Media Player Classic) and VLC let you boost the audio, so everything but an occasional Youtube video is OK, but it really is just too weak.I looked at a lot of laptops/convertibles and this had the best bang for the buck, the next real step up puts you close to $1000 and unless you're a gamer with eagle eyes, you won't miss the extra HP much.UPDATE: Aug 22 2015 - Recently upgraded to a larger SSD and decided to do a fresh install of W10.  This took a bit of research to adjust bios settings to finally accept the USB thumb to boot and the W8 license did not transfer for me.  W10 is noticeably faster that 8 and is all the better without the crapware.  All hardware drivers were present except the card reader which mounting an old 8.1 Macrium reflect image and pointing w10 to that directory to search for the driver succeeded.  If you don't mind the privacy issues of w10, it's a nice upgrade for this machine","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IG1KPNXD0SG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA7A876#wasThisHelpful","R1IG1KPNXD0SG1","A10NMELR4KX0J6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10NMELR4KX0J6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book is comprised of the initial portion of a web serial that is still available for free on the web.  Of course, the price is well worth it for the convenience of reading it in book form.This chunk of the web serial is the ""young want to be heroes going through the hero training program"".  There are some detours in which we are introduced to the world and its problems, including ""Monster"" an unstoppable villain, but generally, the book sticks relatively closely to the hero training program.  It is very well done for what it is, currently the #5 ranked web serial on one of the major sites that rates web serials.  It is (very roughly) similar in quality and approach to Super Powereds, the #3 rated web serial, also found in book form.  There are differences in tone, as well as plot.  Super Powereds feels lighter, and has the young heroes involved in a 4 year certification program, whereas Citadel gives the young heroes one book's worth of training and immediately sends them out into the world.  The over-arching plot(s) in Citadel aren't fully in place yet, and its tough to know where its going.  That said, I'd say that the major difference is that there are a lot more books/pages done in the Super Powereds universe, and the author of that serial has a longer track record of delivering updates on a schedule.  Although he has sped up recently, Mr. Clevenger has been fairly uneven in the pace of updates.  Still, no reason you cant try both if the concept appeals to you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18HHPI2L6J69G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017PJOQDK#wasThisHelpful","R18HHPI2L6J69G","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Continue Online is one of the better written web serials.  Its available for free if you go look for it.  This portion that you are considering buying is deemed book one, book 2 is also done online, and book 3 is well in progress based on the online postings, with the author maintaining a good pace.  Continue Online combines a ""guy gets into a VR world run by AI that is more then it seems and has its own agenda"" scenario with some in depth character development, with both elements being well done.  The main character is initially very depressed, and the overall feel is accordingly a bit heavier then something like Sword Art Online (an anime, but the best I can do for a comparitor).  It seems that because of the heavy characterization vis-a-vis the main character, some fans of lighter fare such as Sword Art Online are not enjoying Continue Online, while others are really appreciating the in depth exploration of the main character.Although, I am enjoying Continue Online, it might work better as a web serial than a book.  While there are a variety of sub-plots, mostly related to the VR game, the overall plot development is very slow and meandering, and even by the middle of book 3, the overarching plot is thin enough that I could easily describe it in a few sentences.  Even in book 3, the various adventures in the VR world have not really been linked up to the over-plot or explained.  In this respect, Continue Online is a bit like an anime but with stronger development of the main character and his struggles.  I am enjoying this mix, but those who want their books to read like a book with a central plot, a beginning, middle and end could have a different reaction.How I ultimately feel about Continue Online might depend, to an extent, on where its going, and whether the over-plot ripens into something meaningful.  That said, I am enjoying the serial, and definitely do plan on continuing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35PLPAS508PNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016O7ZQRY#wasThisHelpful","R35PLPAS508PNX","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Villainous is a breezy fun read, but it feels like there is a lot less book here then the first go round - only 164 pages this time around vs 244 for book one.  Moreover, the POV switches to Black Valentine, and she is a pure comic book cut-out consisting only of a smarmy wise cracks about misdeeds she could commit punctuated by worry about her family.  The result isnt funny enough or likable enough.  By contrast, in book one, White Knight, battling his own body, confused by what what was going on, and struggling with the consequences of being in love with a super-villain, seemed more 3-dimensional and felt more ""real"".  The plot is also a bit thinner this time, with Black Valentine having to identify and develop evidence on a new drug's supplier to make a deal to prevent White Knight from going to jail for the events of book 1.  She achieves this in the simplest fashion, by making phone calls, asking for meetings, and reading minds when she gets there.All of that said, the book IS still breezy fun, and I got through it in a day and a half.  There are a few points where the book approaches the quality of the first book, such as the ending, which is terrific, and I'm hopeful the series can get back on track in book 3.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EELUBRR4ZWJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015XAJQXS#wasThisHelpful","R1EELUBRR4ZWJR","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. Harries is a skilled writer, infusing these stories with interesting characters struggling with interesting events of a sci-fi flavor.  The characters are three dimensional and feel real.  You should be aware, however, that most of these stories dont have a traditional ending, and in a couple of instances its frustrating.  Nor do they have a ""big idea"", with a possible exception or two.  In at least once instance, a story involving two genetically engineered boys raised together, the story teased a big surprise revelation, but ended up not going there.  Rather, these stories are mostly of the ""slice of life in odd/crisis times"" as some sci-fi event intrudes on the lives of ordinary folks.  From the blurb, that appears to be the point -- ordinary people in extraordinary situations, doing the best they can.  Personally, I prefer more of a traditional story, even in novellas, but if the concept appeals the writing is fairly good.I should note that I did not get through all of the stories.  I dont usually do a review before finishing a book, but I'm not clear I will finish all of the stories, and I got through enough that I think this review is informative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZRWMEXJXXHQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131RH128#wasThisHelpful","R1ZRWMEXJXXHQR","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pleasant and easy going book, but the writing style renders it rather slow, and there isnt enough plot here to keep things interesting.  This book is written in the first-person and feels like its 80% exposition at times, which really kills the pacing.  I feel like with a little more practice this author could write something pleasant and readable, but I had a hard time finishing this because the writing style (first person, with lots of exposition) gave it a detached airy vibe.  I dont always mind the first person perspective; for example, In Confessions of a D-List Supervillain, it kind of adds to the humor.  Here, it just didnt work.As far as a plot summary, the main character is a form/power shifter that can basically do anything.  As the world goes to pieces (nano-zombies), only he/she can so much as scratch his/her nose.  He/she builds gadgets, heals the sick, can drop armies with radiant energy and dance like there is no tomorrow.  I'd call it wish fulfillment, but the main character's internal thoughts are so boy scout vanilla that they are a bit dull, and its hard to relate.Overall, I found the book sort of pleasant and was able to finish it despite the problems noted above.  That said, I do not plan to read the sequels.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7P74Z50Y0AGP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YO494WI#wasThisHelpful","R7P74Z50Y0AGP","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the first Prospects book and gave it 5 stars.  The second Prospects book expands the cast, bringing the portion of the made-for-tv team that stepped up and acted like actual heroes into the fold.  This expansion isn't particularly beneficial, given that we didnt have all that much time with these characters in the first book (i.e. we dont really know these characters at the start of the book).  Moreover, ALL of the characters, old and new, have problems, and all get pages.  Insecurities about weight, about powers, about relationships and the like.  Not a single well adjusted character to be found given that even good ole Agent Farrel suffers from continuing marital problems.  So its a bit hard to settle into this second book and get comfortable, at least at first.  The proofreading errors were a bit of a distraction at times (this may be improved by the time you read this -- the author mentioned he would address the issue.)The ""train the misfits"" plot that worked fairly well in volume one is absent here.  Instead, the heroes get involved with a super villain through a chance discovery, and gradually learn what it going on while tangling with the villain.  While this plot is perhaps a little overly comic-bookie, the real difficulty is that without the concreteness of the training, this plot is one of the two major drivers of the story, and I'm not sure its quite up to the task.The other main driver of the book is the characters, all of whom are struggling with various personal demons and insecurities.  Unfortunately, there are now, in this second book, so many separate characters with screen time that its a little difficult to get terribly involved with any of them -- i.e., there are so many different mini-story arcs for the various characters that it distracts from the flow of the story at times.  The Prospects is not A Game of Thrones, and having so many different characters with separate stories in the context of this much shorter and simpler story, doesnt fully work.Conclusion.  The second Prospects book passed the time and was a mostly enjoyable read, but tighter editing and greater focus would have helped the book considerably.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E01G84O63HIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UISIS94#wasThisHelpful","R2E01G84O63HIO","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Grim Reapers giving people powers?  The premise conjures up several pretty bad movies from recent years and just seems . . . silly.  If you have been a reader for a while though, you understand that sometimes the one or two paragraph plot description you get before taking the plunge is hopelessly inadequate, and a dumb-sounding premise can be:  (1) so well fleshed out and/or (2) so well done that you forget you initially thought the premise was goofy.  And this is the case here (both 1 and 2).Forget the idea that this is about Grim Reapers or zombies; its not, at least not in any sense that matters.  The Zombie Knight is essentially a superhero novel or novels, featuring a strong foundation with concrete factions fighting for concrete reasons (some of which are only revealed as the story progresses).  The author has a good sense of humor, and some of the dialogue is quite funny.  The powers and action sequences are also very well done.  Perhaps most importantly, the characters and factions are sufficiently well done that the reader cares about them.  While Hector, the main character, suffers from painful shyness, and is a bit annoying initially, he grows on you given his bravery in other contexts, and as his shyness fades.  The world of the Zombie Knight is more than dark enough that one will genuinely worry about whether favorite characters will live or die.  Heroic rescues can fail, and plans can go badly wrong, with tragic consequences.I usually give a plot summary in my reviews, but here the plot is spooned out quite slowly, and sufficiently complex that its hard to summarize anyway.  Suffice it to say that shy Hector is essentially reborn, and when given the chance to actually make a difference, seizes the opportunity even though it thrusts him into constant danger.  His troubles change and morph as we learn more about the world and its factions, and he acquires a variety of companions from the heroic to the flawed.FYI, this started as a web serial, and its still available for free on the web.  Once you get caught up (the serial is just past page 1000), its hard to stay as enthusiastic because the author seems to have slowed down a lot, and the story develops slowly.  The author is apparently having some job troubles, and hopes to speed back up after changing jobs, but right now the pace of updates is quite slow.Highly recommended for fans of action packed fantasy, especially those with a fondness for superheroes and villains, with the caveat that I am started to have some concerns about the author's ability/desire to finish the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QY6KQ4BMVP6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6REYRY#wasThisHelpful","R1QY6KQ4BMVP6X","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved the first book every bit as much as any of you I'm sure.  Madcap zainy superhero & villain humor, with charm and 3 likable main characters.  A few other reviewers were troubled that the sequel takes place almost entirely in space, but I think that is only the starting point for the problems here.  The excuse to get Penny et al into space is painfully thin, and space turns out to encompass a baffling array of alien factions (four!), two new human factions & a huge number of new mad science technologies (from Penny, other mad scientists and aliens) all thrown up in whirlwind fashion, and all having nothing to do with the first book.  Its hard to figure out and remember what is going on.  Its not remotely possible to summarize the plot, as the trio go from space station to space station, from faction to faction, like ping pong balls, and more or less accidentally have some involvement in complex inter-faction events that are difficult to care about.  Very generally speaking, after floundering around a while, the trio eventually come to hope to liberate the humans from two of the non-human factions (and defeat a third that pops up near the end), even if the space humans are too dumb to realize it, but things feel more like a hot mess than a heroic adventure.Almost all of the new characters are puzzling, not fleshed out, and not particularly likable.  The title is highly misleading, as the ""Parents"" almost drop out of this volume, the keeping the secret while going to school dynamic is largely missing and ""the"" Moon is not blown up.  Although the trio still call themselves ""supervillains,"" almost no one thinks they are here -- rather, they are simply earth kids with some potentially useful abilities to be exploited by the various non-earth factions.  Other villains and heroes are almost entirely absent.  Penny's power, it turns out, works very differently then we knew.  Unlike the first book, the trio don't really display competence or cleverness here, and Penny's inventions are counter-productive more often than not.  In short, nearly everything about this book is very different.  ""Charm"" is a strange animal that can't always survive a very different kind of story and environment, and at least for me, it just didnt work, the charm was gone.I'm giving the book 3 stars out of some residual fondness for the trio.

The protagonist, a ""costumed crimefighter"" that spends a lot of time drinking and has the philosophy of avoiding any actually dangerous villains, is shocked to learn that his father, who overdosed, was also a hero, and discovers a secret room and a set of notebooks.  A simple quest to learn who his father really was rapidly becomes something else as his father's notebooks are stolen.The intent here is that in learning about his father, the main character also learns about himself, and grows as a character.  As part of his growth, he dedicates himself to bringing down a major villain while the main super-team is away.  This part of the story works to a reasonable degree, and comes close to actually being moving once you understand what brought the father down, and why father's struggles were passed on to the son.  That said, its tricky to plant a character study in a superhero novel, as nobody wants to read about a sulky superhero who would rather drink his problems away than stand up and fight.  At times, this deeper theme of the novel slowed things down and took away from the entertainment.To the extent this deeper layer of the story is not a homerun for you (and it wasn't for me) there is a more superficial layer to the story, as the main character blunders from fight to fight and interacts with interesting villains and other heroes, interspaced with flashbacks to his early days.  This part of the story is actually very well done -- the heroes and villains were quite distinctive, and there was plenty of action and humor, all delivered with style.I waffled about giving this 5 stars -- Memoirs is definitely worth your time, and I look forward to reading more from Mr. Jacob.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4ZRHNE4BON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QD3ORSY#wasThisHelpful","RJ4ZRHNE4BON","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really liked the first Union station book, but felt like the second and third lost their way to some extent, getting bogged down in uninteresting plotlines and to some degree losing touch with the humor that made the first book so successful.  They weren't bad books, but, at least for me, they just didn't work as well as the first book did.This fourth book is a return to the form of the first book, with the humor arising from the fact that all the aliens are spying on the humans leading to some really funny situations and dialogue.  Most importantly, spy-related humor is every bit as simple and universal as blind date-humor, and this volume therefore didn't require the kind of exposition that was necessary, for example, in the second book with respect to the ""raider/trader"" game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG8XEY9O6ZYGG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKZVFLY#wasThisHelpful","RG8XEY9O6ZYGG","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The masked ""Bandit Lord"" - an upcoming mob boss - gives a car rise to the #2 man in another organization and asks ""Would you be loyal to me if something happened to [rival boss] and your uncle?""  The #2 man states that he could never be part of plotting to harm his uncle - but yes, if something happened to him, he could follow the Bandit Lord (a concession given out of fear to the Bandit Lord's rapid rise and brutal consolidation of power).  The Bandit Lord turns a corner, and suddenly idles the engine, with the car overlooking a burning nightclub the uncle and rival boss frequent.  ""The time is now.""As the above excerpt hopefully indicates, the world of Devil's Cape is violent and gritty, stylized but also with a very real feel.  Another example, in the world of Devil's Cape, if the mob boss wants a hero with physical resistance dead, he has a sniper shoot him with an extremely high caliber bullet -- and a dozen guys with sledge hammers move in to finish the job.  (These little bits are not spoilers, don't worry.)The history of the mob conflict is interwoven with origin stories for three new heroes as well as a troop of villains.  Its all very, very well done.The difficulty, if there is one, is that the book starts 22 years in the past, and takes a long time to work up to the present and introduce the new villains and heroes.  The pay-off - the three heroes coming together - comes very deep in the book, around 90% of the way.  While its totally worth the well written journey, all the set-up time combined with the ending of the book, which cries out for a sequel that doesn't exist, may leave some a little frustrated.  The author does have a blog and is apparently still an active writer, so one assumes there is hope, but Devil's Cape was released in 2010.  I'll say a little more about the ending in a comment to avoid spoilers.Bottom Line:  This is a five star superhero fantasy, marred only by the combination of a lot of set-up time and an ending that cries out for a sequel that may or may not ever come.  Expect it to be one of your favorite superhero novels -- and to be at least mildly annoyed that there isn't a sequel.P.S.  There are a few Devil's Cape short stories the author has written.  I'll check these out, but unfortunately, they don't look like sequels.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V4Z03STN2945/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H1U3G4#wasThisHelpful","R1V4Z03STN2945","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prequels are often underwhelming, and reading about the early struggles of Cal didn't sound sufficiently interesting before I got started on Origins.  I was wrong.  The book manages to be just as funny as the original, and there is lots of action, adventure and interesting things going on.  Bernheimer even manages to get an impressive amount of amusement riffing off of the unlikelihood of future events through Cal's random pre-Confessions thoughts about Aphrodite, saving the world, and a host of other subjects - all without ever feeling strained.Bottom line, people that liked Confessions should like Origins.  In fact, in some ways Origins is a better book -- Confessions was very short and built from separate episodes, and to a modest degree felt like two separate stories.  Origins is longer, and more like a single story (even though some of the events in Cal's life are discrete).Pull the trigger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9EK5H11KJDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KSV42RI#wasThisHelpful","R2I9EK5H11KJDR","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although technically a sequel to Nobody Gets the Girl, the two books are as a practical matter so independent that reading Nobody Gets the Girl is unnecessary.  Both books are likable and engaging, but Burn Baby Burn is more original, higher on the wackiness quotient, has more action, and more interesting characters.  Although perhaps slightly further from a ""serious"" super-hero novel, its a better book.Although these books don't take themselves overly seriously like some super-hero series (such as the Wild Cards books), nor do they sacrifice a legitimate story.  Thus, you have the legitimate origin story of a young villainess, and her adventures after the death of her villain mentor.  While her story arc includes many of the elements you might expect, including romance and a change of heart, you also have sentient chimpanzees and other wackiness.There are funnier and/or wackier super-hero books, and there are more ""serious"" / ""realistic"" super-hero books with more action, books with more finely drawn characters or realistic character development, but in terms of sheer likability, I found this one right up there.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILO5AR2HKCBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0061SN2CS#wasThisHelpful","R2ILO5AR2HKCBL","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review contains very minor spoilers.  It should be safe to read, and I feel the minor spoilers will help you make your decision.This book starts pretty strongly, with wit and style, as we learn how Dale, aka Blackjack, a minor super-villain, gets caught up in the schemes of the most prominent villain.  The book feels gritty, and (in terms of this type of book) ""realistic"", at first.  However, eventually, things just started to feel slightly, but consistently, off for me.  First, there is the plot, which we eventually learn involves some bad aliens that want to carve off a piece of the earth and keep a subset of humans for, apparently, zoological purposes.  For me, this was a somewhat jarring shift given the realistic feel of the beginning of the book.  Second, even leaving aside the plot, the book got a little surreal for me in other ways, including a lengthy dream sequence that didn't seem to have anything to do with anything.  Third, the characters and their motivations seemed off at times, including the true hidden villain who seemed to alternate motivations between ecological motives, hating Dale, and just generally being an evil nut job.  Similarly, the primary romantic interest seemed to alternate between falling for Dale and just merely wanting to set him on the right path, in odd fashion (she was mind controlled at times, but the point stands).I did like this book.  It just didn't fully gel for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R397JAA8GTEUBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PV3QW6#wasThisHelpful","R397JAA8GTEUBH","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 140 page novella manages the neat trick of putting traditional bad blind date humor in the context of space stations, friendly AIs and aliens.  It is laugh out loud funny in a few spots, and just generally an easy, gently amusing and pleasant read.The humor is not over the top silly (not like The Hitchhiker's Guide).  Rather, the humor feels natural, even though some of the blind dates and other situations are definitely ridiculous.  Nor do you need to like science fiction -- pretty much anyone that can appreciate well done bad date humor can appreciate this.Bottom line:  I really liked this book, and think most people would.  It is maybe a tad too short (and perhaps even too silly) for a 5-star rating, but I definitely recommend picking it up.P.S.  The gentle well done humor in a science fiction setting reminded me of Agent to the Stars, another book I highly recommend even to people that do not normally enjoy science fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34MJ8OG1LHI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4I391A#wasThisHelpful","R34MJ8OG1LHI2","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like the original, the sequel again manages to be very funny without feeling like it is trying too hard.  Sure, the Hank books are crazy madcap whirlwinds as Hank is tossed around by fate, but they mostly (with an exception or two in this book) stay within at least spitting distance of legitimate science fiction (unlike, for example, The Hitchhiker's Guide books).Hank's world has changed quite a bit as a result of the events of the first book -- corporations have taken over his space station -- but Hank, the overall feel of the book, and the plot structure are not much different.  Book 2 has the same kind of humor throughout the book as book 1, and I laughed out loud quite a bit.  Thus, people that liked book 1 should like book 2.A few caveats.  First, while generally very similar in feel, this second book is definitely darker in tone than the first.  In the first book, Hank seemed more competent and heroic than he gave himself credit for, was highly likable and things turned out very well in the end.  In the second book, Hank seems much less competent, and his mistakes get a considerable number of people killed, something he doesn't generally get too upset about.  While there is nothing wrong with a second book putting the hero through a bit of a tough time that doesn't fully resolve in the second book, here Hank feels more like a punching bag than a hero at times.  The more upbeat feel of the first book felt like a better match with the humor for me.  Second, the villain turns out to be something that would fit better into the Hitchhiker's Guide than legitimate science fiction.  Third, at least one plot point seems to have been dropped.  While these are not entirely trivial points, the overall package is still very likable, entertaining and funny.P.S.  Since the humorous science fiction/fantasy genre is so rare (if we are limiting it to books with a real story) here are some recommendations for others that you might like if you enjoyed the Hank books:  (1) John Scalzi's ""Agent to the Stars"" (alien encounter sci-fi); (2) Jim Bernheimer's ""Confessions of a D-List Supervillain"" (super-hero fantasy) (3) Lee Doty's ""Out of the Black"" (urban fantasy set a bit in the future) & (4) Connie Wills' ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" (time travel sci-fi, amusing, but not lol funny).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ER4XNYAE7YHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JU9JRUQ#wasThisHelpful","R3ER4XNYAE7YHO","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kay is much loved for his writing skill.  Fans know and enjoy Kay's tendency to wax poetic on matters such as fate, turning points, love, destiny, history and other matters.  In this book, however, it felt like these passages were lengthier and more frequent.  For example, when, early in the book a previously unmentioned young guard is cut down, Kay waxes on for a bit about a life cut down too short, and what might have been.  Then, later in the book, when the son of an influential character is killed -- a son who did little other than follow his father around -- Kay again waxes on about what could have been, at some real length.  Kay does this deliberately, and even alludes to the first death when discussing the second.  While some might find this a clever literary device, I found the length and frequency of these detours to be indulgent.  While I normally either enjoy or don't mind Kay's literary asides, here I found it too much in just the same manner that too much candy can make one sick.Bottom Line:  Kay has a distinctive style and pattern of writing, and that is present here.  Many fans will enjoy this book greatly, just as they have Kay's other books -- there is no great deviation from how Kay has written in the past.  However, some might find that something is subtly off, as I did, and leave a little disappointed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HG1XT61GZZDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWLA0U2#wasThisHelpful","R3HG1XT61GZZDS","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cover and blurb make this seem like a detective & magic book, and its very much not.  Rather, the setting is an alternative universe where folks with super-hero like powers started appearing in the 1800s.  The powers fit into the super-hero/villain mold, although, known to some, there is true magic via creation of items and runes.  By the 1930s imperial Japan, backed by the magic of the mighty ""Chairman"" and his magically-enhanced elite troops, threaten the world,  In the US, those with powers are distrusted and persecuted, and only a secret society dedicated to preventing the abuse of magic stands between freedom and imperial rule.The plot is fairly strong, particularly when compared to the somewhat campier Monster Hunters series by the same author.  Monster Hunters was tremendous fun and action packed, loved it, but a little campy / comic-book like (for example, like the Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe).  Here, we have the same level of action, and the same amount of fun, but better plotting that doesnt feel nearly as campy.  Given that Correia knows how to write convincing action and make it cool and fun, the addition of a real plot is enough to make Hard Magic a tremendous success.Conclusion:  Correia will probably never craft something as tight or complex as the best selling epic fantasies, but many will find his books substantially more fun, and fans of well-written pulse pounding action and epic clashes between good and evil will find much to love here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31YKQHOCCG8R4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APAHLMA#wasThisHelpful","R31YKQHOCCG8R4","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is about the events of a single day. Although, as usual for this series, the chapters are written by different authors, this volume has a unified plot running thoughout the entire book -- actually one main plot, and two subplots. The main plot is that the Astromer is out to kill the Aces that beat him in book 2. Secondary plots include Wraith's (formerly known as Ghost Girl in Book 1) misadventures when she accidentally steals the wrong thing from a mob boss, and Alligator Jack looking for his niece Cordelia who suddenly left home in Louisianna for New York City. The subplots twist and turn and coincidentally overlap with each other, and to a lesser extent, the main plot. Thus, this feels like a single book written by a single author, even though, as usual, chapters are written by various authors. The writing is pretty engaging and well done, and carries you along nicely.Although it is nice in some ways to have a cover-to-cover plot (as opposed to multiple discrete stories as found in many of the wild card books), there are a lot of negatives as well. First, the subplots, while well written and somewhat engaging, are perhaps a little trite or pointless, and get a lot of pages. For example, Ghost Girl (n/k/a Wraith), who had a one night misadventure in book 1, is the focus of one of the subplots in book 3 -- and has another one night misadventure. The only real difference is that she gets more pages here. Second, almost no new hero aces are introduced, and there are no new origin stories. Third, the only two villains we spend any time with (besides the Astronomer) both channel the bad experiences in their lives in the course of their kills -- Demise, a villain from book 2, channels his death experience using projective telepathy, and Roulette, a new villain, channels the birth of her baby with the Black Queen (a fatal Joker) to summon poison during sex. The similarity between these two villains is mirrored by the similarity between the Astronomer and Fortunato -- one draws power from sex, murder and torture, why the other draws power from sex.  So, at least compared with other books in the series, there is somewhat of a lack of diversity and originality.  Fourth, while Hiram has some time and Tachyon is involved, the most interesting characters from the prior books have at most cameos -- the main characters here are the Astronomer, the two villains that kill by channeling their bad experiences, Alligator Jack, Bagabond, Ghost Girl/Wraith, Hiram, Tachyon, Fortunato and Brennan (the Green Arrow type).I read many of the Wild Cards books 20 years ago. I still remember favorite characters, heros and villains and events, from books 1 and 2, and some that I havent encountered yet in the first 3 books -- i.e., I remembered nothing about book 3. What is missing is the ""Geez thats cool"" factor found so often in books 1 and 2 -- there is nothing as inventive or original as, for example, Croyd or Modular Man's origin stories here. Nothing to remember.Basically, you have to judge this book like a conventional book, on the strength of its plot, as there is not enough of the inventive, original, cool Aces and Jokers stuff from prior books. Although the writing is good, and the book is entertaining, the plot cant really compare to the plot of top fantasy books, and as a result, this book just didnt feel like anything special the way books 1 and 2 did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WA24F703SOSE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEC9IUM#wasThisHelpful","R1WA24F703SOSE","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The review rated most helpful describes the plot in great detail, so I'll skip that and simply say that this is the rare sci-fi book that manages to combine innovative ""big ideas"" with lots of action, AND with meaty moral dilemas about the future of our species.  I normally hate that sort of thing -- it usually feels like the author is preaching at you, pushing their version of how the future should be.  Here, however, both society and the main characters really struggle with these issues, in believable fashion, and it definitely added depth to the characters and the story.For those that dont like to start unfinished series, this looks like at least a 3 book series, but only two books are currently out.  I did see a reference to book 3 in an interview, but I dont know anything about release dates.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VNW1R2GCASHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0857662937#wasThisHelpful","R1VNW1R2GCASHE","A1CR5F9SON7A15","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CR5F9SON7A15?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Compulsion"" a chillingly exciting novel by Martina Boone filled with mystery, secrets, murder and ghosts mixed with a splash of romance begins at Watson's Landing where seventeen year old Barrie has been sent to live with her Aunt Pru after the death of her mother. With no knowledge of her family's history, Barrie is suddenly swept up in an ancient feud, a curse and magical gifts that have haunted the Watsons and two other founding families for generations.Set in the rustic setting of the Watson's plantation where the yunwi (water spirits) roam their land and at midnight an ancient ghost sends a sphere of fire across the water dividing their home from those of the Beauforts and Colesworths, the story revolves around an ancient curse, dark family secrets and magical gifts. With Barrie's arrival at the plantation the plot heats up when she decides not only to make friends with her Colesworth cousins, but to help Cassie find her family's lost treasure. Tension and suspense builds as secrets are revealed and letters are found that expose clues to the mystery of Barrie's mother's exile, her father's death and the disappearance of her grandfather's brother.Having lost her mother and the protection of her guardian Mark, Barrie at first is reticent about any emotional entanglements especially with ""hottie"" Eight Beaufort who can read her mind and is determined to leave Watson's Landing. As Eight helps her integrate into the community and uncover her family's secrets love blossoms. Yet as Barrie connects to her new home and looks to her future, she realizes that she must give Eight enough space so he can make his own decisions but she wonders if they'll include her.Martina Boone has created characters that bring the story to life with their complexity, flaws and faults. Barrie Watson (nicknamed Bear) is stubborn, feisty, impulsive and awkward even in her trendy clothes and stiletto heels. Yearning for the intimacy of a family relationship beyond the love and support of her kind and astute Aunt Pru, she ignores what her heart and commonsense tell her about Cassie and the Colesworth family. In contrast Cassie Colesworth is a self-absorbed, selfish and jealous beauty who masks her worst traits behind friendliness and warmth towards her cousin. Her father Wyatt Colesworth is sinister, ruthless and abusive, scorning the prosperity of the Watsons and Beauforts. Eight Beaufort seems steady, self-confident and often overbearing, hiding his insecurity about his future. All these characters and others add to the power, realism and drama of this fascinating and imaginative story.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Compulsion"" with its intriguing plot and well-developed passionate characters. I rate it highly and look forward to reading ""Persuasion"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MY8B756JI922/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481411233#wasThisHelpful","R3MY8B756JI922","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Golden Age""  is a fascinating story about the Langdon family that begins in 1987 and ends in 2019.  Spread across the country family members have branched out from their farming roots, an industry affected by climate change and economic decline not only into the political arena and wall street trading but into a passion for conservation, literature, and horses.Set against an historical background of events that rocked America including political upheavals and scandal, 9/11 and the Iraq war and in an atmosphere of uncertainty and change, family members struggle to make their mark and with internal rivalries created by differing views, beliefs and personal values.In this emotionally infused novel, the chapters are divided by years, each highlighting significant events affecting the Langdon households including Richie's election to Congress and his twin brother Michael's financial dealings and infidelity. With a family tree at the front of the novel, I was able to keep track of the various relationships although Jane Smiley doesn't deal with every Langdon descendant.In the finale Jane Smiley creates unique, complex and unforgettable characters facing diverse challenges in their lives; like Michael a smart financial guru who's a difficult, inconsiderate and aggressive risk-taker and Frank the acerbic WWII hero and self-made defence industry innovator who in his seventies discovers love with his wife. Like all the generations of Langdons the characters in ""Golden Age"" breathe life and drama into this mesmerizing family saga.I enjoyed this innovative novel that's not strictly plot- oriented but deals with the momentous and emotional events in the lives of members of a family dynasty. It is well-worth reading and I plan to backtrack and start at the beginning with ""Some Luck.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P5JWC6KC721V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700348#wasThisHelpful","R1P5JWC6KC721V","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Born to Endless Night"" the ninth novella in the ""Tales of the Shadowhunter Academy"" series begins with Simon and his friends finding a warlock baby on the steps of the Academy with a note attached to its blanket that reads "" who could ever love it."" Handing over the dark blue-skinned child to guest lecturer Magnus Bane and his lover Alec, Simon never expects that it will transform lives even in the Lightfoot family.In the next segment of this fascinating series not only Magnus Bane but Alec and his family learn that life holds beautiful surprises, ones you least expect that make life worth living. With the discovery of the baby comes revelation as Magnus after much thought finds he not only loves Alec deeply but is committed to him for life and wants to have a family with him. In the Lightfoot family the baby brings warmth, love and acceptance as each overwhelm what was once unwanted with affectionThe plot is filled with insights into the prejudice and shifting attitudes of the Clave, Simon's role as a change catalyst in the Shadowhunter Academy and about a storm that's brewing with the Otherworlders. All these developments make this novella not only entertaining but gripping.Magnus Bane the visiting lecturer seems more human and approachable as he grapples with adopting an unwanted baby with Alec, adding another dimension to their relationship. The arrogant High Warlock of Brooklyn who's usually calm and composed is suddenly emotionally ruffled dealing with a child and the Lightfoot family. In contrast Alec who's more confident and relaxed in his work with vampires and werewolves in New York because of his bond with Magnus begins to show his feelings not only in his attachment to the baby but in his discussions with Simon. As with all these short stories Simon continues to grow as an individual not only becoming more positive about his relationship with Isabelle, but by changing the beliefs of Shadowhunters and mundanes in the school.For me ""Born to Endless Night"" is the best the Shadowhunter Academy series so far not only in plot but in the development of personalities we've come to know and like. Yet Cassandra Clare still keeps Simon in the forefront of this series showcasing his fears and aspirations as he draws closer to Ascension, to awakening his memories and adopting a new name as a Shadowhunter while still working hard to keep his individuality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BGYL59UEC71F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TBKUWKS#wasThisHelpful","R2BGYL59UEC71F","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Archipelago (The Man Who Loved Too Much#1)"" is a parody of the life, love and pursuit of happiness of Billy Green a young boy with an adoring mother and a dysfunctional father who struggles with bullies at school, rebels against the stern discipline of nuns at his Catholic School, and is almost molested by the neighbourhood puppeteer.With a sharp mind, and love of learning Billy survives the rigours of high school with the goal of attending a good college far from the neglected industrial pit of Detroit and his abusive father. At Cornell University he vibrates with new life subsidizing his finances with part-time jobs, losing his virginity on his birthday, and falling in love with the girl of his dreams. Yet for all his intelligence, Billy is very naive and trusting and soon learns that everything isn't what it seems.With each short chapter spanning the important events in his life from childhood to college the reader gets to know the idiomatic, amusing, strong-willed and goal-oriented Billy Green. You laugh at his pranks as he rebels against the nuns who try to control his behavior, are sensitive to his friendship with Sister Mary Felicia an atheist haunted by her own abusive background, and bristle with indignation at the cruelty of the high school gym jocks. Tension builds as Billy faces victory or defeat until the story climaxes with a cliff-hanger that begs for a sequel.Intriguing with every twist and turn in Billy's life, the plot captures the reader's interest from the first page to the last as John Rachel in a unique way comments on the depravity of the human spirit with Billy's drunken, foul-mouthed father's mistreatment of his family, the sexual perversion of a neighbour, the government's fear strategy in the 9/11 terrorist attack and the deceitful manipulation of someone he loves. Yet for all the secrets, lies and misdirection that Billy has to deal with there is hope and promise which is typified in the love, support and encouragement of his mother.John Rachel creates strong, complex characters like Billy Green who has a smart, inquisitive, and combative mind as a child. A loner even in college, people gravitate to him because of his approachability, mystery and sense of humor. But Billy is very innocent and accepting which allows him to be the butt of five coeds' joke, to be seduced and manipulated. Irene Green is Billy's devoted mother who has a deep inner strength as she deals with the ignorance, indifference and cruelty of her obnoxious husband Harold. Natalie haunted by tragedy and dishonesty in her past is smug, provocative and arrogant, manipulating Billy's feelings for her. Her friend Pam masks her calculating and dishonest nature behind a sharp wit, assertiveness and pride. All these characters and more add energy, passion and intensity to an engaging story.""Archipelago (The Man Who Loved Too Much#1) is innovative and entertaining and I can't wait to see what Billy faces next in his search for happiness and true love.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XHQ9DFGHVTET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692310053#wasThisHelpful","R2XHQ9DFGHVTET","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Creeping"" is an eerie, dark tale that begins eleven years after Stella Cambren and Jeanie Talcott disappear in the woods around Savage. Troubled about the day she returned and Jeanie didn't, Stella's relies on her friends for support and encouragement especially Zoey who protects her from gossip and speculation. Popular with friends and pursued by the good-looking lacrosse captain Stella seems to have no worries as the summer winds down and she looks forward to her senior year at Wildwood High.But all her expectations are shattered at a party at Old Savage Cemetery when the corpse of another young girl is discovered after a downpour that sends teens running for their cars. Disturbed by the decomposing body holding a bone and a possible connection to her missing friend, Stella begins a journey that not only triggers her lost memories but leads to uncovering a murderer, a legendary evil and secrets long hidden.An horrific murder, superstitions about an ancient evil, and six year old Stella's cryptic words about ""hunting for monsters"" in the woods blends fear, mystery and bone-chilling suspense into a plot that twists and turns as the answer to the puzzle of Jeanie's death slowly unravels. Well-written and exciting as events unfold that have Stella, Sam and Zoey digging up graves, dodging shotgun bullets and struggling to escape the clutches of a murderer, the action never stops. I even liked the ending which provided a rational explanation for the killings but left food for your imagination.The plot's atmosphere vibrates with dark, shadowy foreboding and spine-tingling chills that's tempered by the romance between Stella and Sam, and Zoey's uninhibited banter. Forced by Zoey at age twelve Stella had to choose between friendship with her or Sam. Over the years as her popularity grew she scorned any of Sam's kind overtures,fighting their attraction. Turning to Sam for help in her search for the truth about Jeanie's disappearance Stella ignores Zoey's opinion of him, and their love blossoms again.Alexandra Sirowy in this novel has crafted characters that are complex and unforgettable, although sometimes unreal. Stella Cambren the seventeen year old who has never recovered any memory of the disappearance has become popular and mean-spirited, walking in Zoey's shadow. She only indulges in flirtations, shunning a boyfriend, afraid of being abandoned again. She can be fearless, stubborn, impulsive and brave, although she's afraid of standing up to her best friend. Zoey rules Stella's social life even after she and Sam hook up. Unnaturally wild, cocky, mouthy and an acknowledged rule breaker, Zoey's one saving grace is that she's very protective of Stella. In contrast Sam Worth is smart, hardworking, dependable, kind and patient. Although I doubt he would have endured Stella's condescension or waited for her to care for him for five years, in this story Sam is devoted and forgiving, waiting for her to love him back. Yet these characters and many more bring passion, energy and drama to this absorbing story.Although some of the characterizations seemed unrealistic, I enjoyed ""The Creeping"" and kept wondering what was hiding in the shadows of the woods. I couldn't put this tale of darkness, mystery and romance down until the end and highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGVFZAHVDFYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481418866#wasThisHelpful","R1YGVFZAHVDFYO","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With clues including a mysterious map, missing blood and suspicious footprints Abigail and Jackaby search for a killer they know is inhuman much to Chief Constable Marlowe's chagrin and disbelief.Told in a first person narrative from the notes that Abigail's compiling for Jackaby's case file, the story heats up when the two are arrested for the murder of a neighbour of Arthur Bragg the dead journalist who was researching bizarre murders in nearby towns . With Jackaby's bloodied tuning fork in the victim's hand and wanting them out of the way Chief Constable Marlowe detains them hoping to appease reporters with an arrest, and Commissioner Swift who's haunting his every move in the case. With skillful dexterity William Ritter builds intensity and suspense with vivid imagery of a violent storm juxtaposed against the pain and fear of the keening as danger draws close to the jail where Abigail and Jackaby are being held. Even the action is unrelenting and fast-paced with Junior Constable Charlie Cane's sudden shape-shifting and a chase through the nearby woods. With witty banter, a blossoming romance and a chilling mystery the story flows towards an explosive ending and a cliff-hanger than begs for another book.Enriching the drama with their energy, passion and complexity are characters like thin, angular Jackaby with his long thick brown coat that hides multiple pockets and an abominable knitted cap. A detective who claims to use science and reason to solve crimes he's unconventional and enigmatic, a confident, arrogant seer who sees details beyond the norm. His assistant the energetic, headstrong and bold Abigail Rook is a perfect partner for the audacious Jackaby, yet with one glimpse of the reliable, loyal and dedicated police officer Charlie Cane, she's smitten.""Jackaby"" is a delightfully entertaining young adult paranormal adventure that you can't put down until the end.

Driven to succeed Aubrey's adverse to dating until she meets Zion, one of the black leather bikers who shows up to investigate the crimes. When he also saves her from making a bad decision worse at the local fair, Aubrey discovers her heart being swept away by the kind and protective man who's begun to invade her every thought. What she doesn't realize is that Zion an enforcer for the president of the Wolves motorcycle club is enthralled by her, wanting more than friendship. But both will have to make sacrifices if their love is to endure.Ronnie Douglas meshes romance with a crime spree that endangers Aubrey and her Grandma Maureen. The underlying premise is that the police force is inept while the motorcycle club who's involved in covert criminal activities of its own wants to find the culprits and protect members of their family. Although unrealistic it's the basis of two fundamental arguments in the story; Aubrey's to stay away from Zion who could end up dead or in prison because of his work, and his decision to leave the club so he can be with her. The plot is emotionally intense as Aubrey continually fights her attraction to Zion while he struggles to weaken her resolve.

Aubrey Evans is driven to succeed and shaken up not only by her parents troubles but also because she's forced to leave her upscale college for life in a small town. Aubrey is overly determined with a ""Plan"" that has to be continually altered, as well as feisty and bold which seems strange for a young woman who's supposedly socially awkward. In contrast handsome, bad boy Zion is intense and intimidating as the club enforcer, but kind, smart and funny with Aubrey. Raised by the club members he works hard to be accepted by Eddie Echo and is unshakeable in his loyalty. What Ronnie Douglas does well is to slowly build the chemistry between Aubrey and Zion, two strong-willed people from different backgrounds and with diverse goals; throwing roadblocks in the way of their infatuation with each other.Of the other characters Noah Dash is amiable and charming; Ellen assertive and spirited; Grandma Maureen tough and resolute; and Eddie Echo intimidating as President of the club but fair-minded and devoted to Zion and Maureen.

"""Reckless"" a gripping and terrifyingly realistic thriller begins when Ruth Carver wakes up injured in the back of a beat up truck. The seventeen year old, abducted by a deranged, psychopath who hates redheads has no idea where she is but keeps remembering her grandparents advice to fight for her life if this ever happened.Taken to a remote rundown cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the bearded ruffian she calls ""the Wolfman"" has only one purpose- to reform his seventh victim for her bad ways. But what he doesn't expect is that she's not only determined to avoid rape and to escape, but to bring him to justice.In a game of cat and mouse where Ruth uses all her strength and wits to evade a sexual predator, Carolyn Lee Adams quickly builds tension and high-intensity as the plot heats up. The action is fast-paced and exciting, a definite page-turner from the opening chapter to its shocking conclusion.Through flashbacks the reader goes back in time to understand not only what motivates Ruth's drive to succeed, a compulsion that marks her as mean and callous, but the catalysts in the Wolfman's past that drive him to kill. With each tantalizing clue to the psyche of the hunter and hunted the reader is drawn further into this intoxicating fight for survival. With its vivid, descriptive detail that's all too real, the reader senses the hunter's slow decline into hatred and madness, and his victim's struggle to hold on to her sanity. Yet amid the violence, rage, hatred, pain, and sorrow that propel this story, there are rewarding glimpses of victory, self-discovery and faith that make it unforgettable.Ruth Carver a prize-winning horsewoman at age twelve has always been ambitious, fearless and determined, a risk-taker who feels that her efforts are the foundation for her family's success.

Her kidnapper, Jerry T. Balls (Wolfman) haunted by abuse and bullying in his past is frightening with his merciless and brutal nature. A killer and rapist he believes it's his duty to punish ""bad girls"" especially redheads, and has used his power and control to demoralize then murder six already. It is these two main characters that fuel this story with passion, drama and power.""Reckless"" is a powerhouse of emotion as Ruth confronts her flaws and faults in a fight to survive, finding not only redemption but a renewed awareness of love for her family and Caleb when she's broken and damaged.

"In ""Of Dreams and Rust"" the gripping and intoxicating sequel to ""Of Metal and Wishes"" war has broken out in Itanya as the Noor and poor Itanyai in Western Yilat join forces to win their freedom. In Gochan Two where war machines are built, Wen assists her father healing the sick and nursing Bo (the Ghost) who's taken up residence in the bowels of the factory. As Wen dreams about Melik the red-headed Noor who disappeared with his people after the collapse of the slaughterhouse Bo has begun forging wires and steel into a body armour that makes him seem more inhuman and robotic. Over the months Wen and Bo have built a fragile bond of friendship, but he can't wipe away her yearning for the brave, strong-willed Noor who stole her heart.When news that Gochan Two is about to construct war machines that will squash the rebellion Wen makes a momentous decision that will not only make her a traitor to her people but take her into the heart of the fighting. What she doesn't expect is that the brutality of war has changed Melik and that her sacrifice might come at a price she's unwilling to pay.The plot is fast-paced and action-packed as Wen faces one challenge after another in her struggle to bring news of the war effort in Gochan Two to Melik. In a finely crafted story that's very visual Sarah Fine builds intensity and suspense especially when Melik surprises Wren with marriage to protect her from the wrath of his people just as they face a horde of mechanized spiders that threaten to destroy his home in Dagchocuk.Although the atmosphere is dark, bleak and hopeless for much of the plot there are moments that are poignant and even triumphant as the battle heats up. The bond between Bo and Wen continues to grow even as he girds his body in steel. There are touching instances when you sense the depth of his love for Wen and his tragic fixation with protecting himself that are often overshadowed by his immaturity and the soul-wrenching darkness that threatens to consume him. Wen is realistic about Bo's strengths and faults, loving him more as a sister/friend, yet sadly realizing he wants more from her.In ""Of Dreams and Rust"" the depth and complexity of personalities driven by their flaws and faults as the world explodes around them, are unforgettable. Fourteen year old Sinan like Bo is highly intelligent and thirsty for knowledge. He's capable, confident and boldly unafraid. Melik in this story seems cold and heartless at times hiding any compassion or mercy for the enemy. It's his unforgiving and hard traits in the midst of war that erodes his relationship with Wen. From two very different societies they often have trouble relating, but with time and patience (as well as a little push from Sinan, Bo and Anni) confront the hurtles that plague their love.I thoroughly enjoyed Sarah Fine's ""Of Dreams and Rust"" a page-turner from beginning to end with its imaginative plot and well-developed characters. As a fan I look forward to reading more of her novels in future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UEED97P7XLGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144248361X#wasThisHelpful","R3UEED97P7XLGC","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""The Rule of Three Fight For Power"" continues Eric Walters' exciting survival adventure ten weeks after a global blackout. The military force that threatened the neighborhood has been destroyed and lies in the valley below the bridge. Even their base of operations has been deserted. Afraid that the danger has not been eradicated, Herb, the ex- CIA agent has stepped up Adam's flights in his ultralight and has Brett's team exploring and scavenging at night.But as the neighborhood continues to maintain tight security and to refuse refugees admittance to their haven, trouble is brewing outside the gates with a new tent town. When an enemy storms the tents killing the innocent while they sleep, Adam and Herb begin to suspect that danger lurks in an unexpected direction; a menace that could disrupt the harmony in the community.The plot begins ten weeks after a global blackout left humanity without power, scrambling for food and water and gangs of armed people attacking small communities to survive. In a fast paced, mesmerizing sequel to ""The Rule of Three"" threads of this story follow not only a surprise raid on the military base; a mysterious fire in a nearby condo; but an attack on the tent town that's sprung up near the wall. In the turmoil, tragedy and death that stalks the neighborhood, the inhabitants try to hold tight to their principals of decency, justice and fairplay, but with the rationing of food and fear of another attack, cracks in the neighbourhood's solidarity begin to show. As the hopelessness and anxiety mounts, doubts and uncertainty leave the community unsettled and the atmosphere tense.Eric Walters in this absorbing struggle for survival slowly builds tension and suspense as loyalties are tested and a psychopath starts making plans to kill the community's leadership and take over the reins of authority. The intensity of the plot is often broken by Todd's wit and humor as well as the ongoing romance between Adam and Lori.In this story the well-developed and realistic personalities of some very unforgettable characters continue to grow in complexity. Sixteen year old Adam Daley who believes in doing what's right and continues to voice his opinions still trusts explicitly in Herb and his mother's judgement. He often distances himself from the problems on the ground, taking to the air whenever he can. Upright and conscientious Adam will have to confront his worst nightmare when he has to kill or be killed. His highly independent girlfriend Lori grounds Adam with her compassion and empathy for the tenters. She's smart, level-headed, strong and suspicious of Brett's erratic behaviour. Herb the tough, skilled former agent is the key organizer and planner, who will finally make a mistake in judgement that could cost lives. As Brett becomes more and more of an adrenaline junkie his personality takes on sinister and reckless undertones. Smug, cocky and over-confident he changes, becoming more of a ""plastic action hero"" rather than someone Herb and the Committee can depend on.What I like about ""The Rule of Three "" trilogy is its believability as the story grows and takes on momentum especially after a betrayal rocks the community bringing death and destruction. The story is intoxicating and the action gripping as the neighborhood struggles to survive in a chaotic tempest, hoping that their troubles will soon end. It will be interesting to see what Adam and his family face in the next adventure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6ZM551YKT9LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374301794#wasThisHelpful","R6ZM551YKT9LR","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

But the danger is more insidious than they ever could have imagined when they discover another nemesis - a covert government organization- is also determined to capture them. In this story not only are the pack's powers tested, but their loyalty and friendship especially when a decision has to be made that could change the Virals future.In a spell-binding, fast-paced story the Virals face one challenge after another as they not only tackle the lethal actions of a rogue pack, but are stalked by a government organization who are determined to harness their abilities and use them as a secret weapon. Whether the Pack is zip-lining from the top deck of an old naval destroyer or jumping from the third floor of a house into a pond, the danger, and suspense continually escalates; the tension broken only by Hi's cutting wit and humor. Kathy and Brendan Reichs not only create an electrifying thriller in ""Terminal"", but weave historical landmarks into a descriptive background setting that brings Charleston and the surrounding area to life.In this plot Tory's life becomes even more emotionally complicated as she deals with her attraction to Ben and her crush on Chance. After both boys declare their love, she continually has to contend with Ben's jealousy and their confrontational outbursts as tempers flare and fists fly. Like her father's engagement to his girlfriend which could jeopardize her life on the island, and the risk to her friendship with Ella, Tory begins to deal with the roller-coaster of emotions she'd like to ignore and that threaten to swamp her, even making a choice between Ben and Chance.As in all the Virals novels the characters are realistic, well-developed and complex like Ben Blue whose temperamental mood swings are exacerbated by his jealousy. Yet when he has to make any decision that could affect Tory, he's selfless and loyal; following his heart. Chance Claybourne can be secretive, arrogant and irritating, but is unshakeable in his determination to protect Tory and the pack. Although all the characters are unforgettable, in this thrill-ride it's the cold ruthlessness of the Trinity and the deadly menace of the sinister undercover organization that incites chilling excitement and high-energy as events unfold.""Terminal"" a thriller with a heavy dose of science fiction is a page turner from beginning to end although the epilogue left the reader with a lot of unanswered questions. I hope this is not the end of the Virals saga and that we'll read more about Tory Brennan and the Pack in future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JTM3ZO3QV1LD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595145281#wasThisHelpful","R1JTM3ZO3QV1LD","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Eighteen year old Chance Claybourne after spending time in a mental hospital has lost his playful side and is tenacious in his determination to uncover the secret that Tory keeps hidden.Like all of the Virals novels to date I enjoyed Tory and her pack's criminal investigation in ""Exposure"" and look forward to reading the next book in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27GS3N96AO1Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0147514371#wasThisHelpful","R27GS3N96AO1Y1","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Enthralled by tales of the Ghost, Wen begins to investigate the mystery behind a superstition that has bred kind and cruel acts throughout the factory.Feeling guilty and looking for forgiveness for her disastrous wish, Wen befriends Melik the outspoken leader of the Noor , giving medical aid to his stricken people.

As tempers rise and conditions in the factory worsen not only does an explosive confrontation between the Ghost and factory bosses send the Noor into hiding but it tests Wen and Melik's love and loyalty.Sarah Fine sets the stage for this emotionally-intense plot in a slaughterhouse where a company boss swindles the Noor the cheap labour force who work for a pittance, only to have excessive charges whittle it away. In the hopelessness of the factory the Noor contend with the ridicule, prejudice and hatred of the Itanyai defying the evil that threatens them by holding on to their pride and clinging to their close-knit relationship.In an atmosphere of cruelty and strife, threads of the plot follow Wen's struggle to appease a Ghost who's determined to protect her against any threat, her fight to control her fate even when bullied by an ""Underboss"" who preys on the virtue of young girls, and her forbidden love for the radical leader of the Noor.

In contrast the Ghost, a broken and lonely man fights from the shadows building an army of mechanized spiders and waiting to unleash their power and horror. Prone to cruelty and childlike in many ways he like Melik loves Wen but only one rules her heart.

In the ensuing chaos that leaves one of the radical animal-rights activists of ""Storm"" seriously injured, Odin Remby their brilliant hacker escapes with a set of highly encrypted files and a post-surgical dog.After sensational headlines hit the air waves about the disastrous raid, sixteen year old Shay Remby finally receives a desperate phone call from her brother, filling her in on Singular's nefarious and inhumane research programs. With little money and a knife for protection she heads to Hollywood to look for Odin fearing the lethal consequences if the company's security team finds him first. What she doesn't expect is to garner the help of Twist a wealthy artist who she calls ""Cat in the Hat"" and the homeless kids he harbours in a seedy hotel.In a well-developed plot that keeps the reader mesmerized from the opening prologue to the explosive ending with a cliff-hanger that begs for a sequel, the thrills never stop especially after Shay joins forces with Twist, Cruz, and Cade. Within the threads of the plot Shay not only climbs her way to notoriety in Twist's pro-immigration action and a sign raising excursion to the Hollywood Hills, but draws attention to the ecological difficulties of keeping beached sperm whales alive until high tide. But what fuels the high-intensity and suspense of the plot stems from the ethical issues around animal and human experimentation and testing by a multi-million dollar corporation.The characters are realistic and unique the complexity of their personalities adding excitement and high-energy to the drama as events unfold. Odin Remby is the brilliant computer hacker who's autistic so socially awkward and sensitive around people, but cognizant and perceptive to the pain and suffering of animals. His sister Shay in contrast is a math whiz and a tough, shrewd and aggressive teen who flees the nightmare of foster care to find her brother. Wilful, defiant and brave she quickly wins the admiration and respect of the resourceful, artistic Twist; the suspicious and daring Latino, Cruz; and mouthy, cocky but clever Cade. Yet it's the cold-hearted, ruthlessness of antagonists like Stephen Creighton (Sync) the head of Singular's security and Harmon, the intelligence chief that add a frightening chill to this intoxicating tale.I thoroughly enjoyed the finely- crafted intrigue and suspense of John Sandford, Michele Cook's novel ""UNCAGED"" and look forward to reading the next book in the Singular Menace series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DJLNVDTPXIJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385753055#wasThisHelpful","R2DJLNVDTPXIJQ","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Rule of Three"" is a dystopian vision of a new world that begins when the lights, computers and iphones go out in sixteen year old Adam Daley's school in Milton. Amid the fear and chaos that follows, Adam's neighbours guided by the sound advice of Herb Campbell a retired enigmatic government spy and his mother the Captain of a local precinct, band together pooling their talents and resources as government and security break down.With his father away and the electrical outage global, Adam quickly matures taking on responsibilities that have him facing death, ducking bullets and voicing humane ideas for survival to the community's leadership. But even as guards patrol the protective walls circling the neighborhood, a sports field and lawns are dug up for planting, and patrols are sent out to scout and rummage for supplies, a danger lurks only miles away that could destroy all that's being built.The plot is well-developed, imaginative and very realistic; the main theme dealing with Adam's neighbourhood surviving challenges like transportation, security, food and water consumption. It's fast-paced and action-packed especially when events unfold that have Adam and Herb dodging bullets , escaping a Cessna in the ultra-light and even a surprise raid against a merciless and ruthless encampment of mercenary soldiers. The novel is a page turner from beginning to end, climaxing with a violent explosion that begs for another novel.In a story filled with violent clashes, the seriousness of the theme is often broken by humour and romance. Adam is continually teased by his friend Todd about his blossoming romance with Lori Petersen, although I did wonder (like several other details that weren't apparent) why her rich, possessive boyfriend didn't find a way to get in touch with her. Amid the turmoil issues are often raised that have ethical implications like restricting families seeking a safe haven to only professional or skilled individuals, and the morality of killing when innocent by-passers are accidently murdered.Adam Daley is a likeable sixteen year old who's resourceful, reliable and hard-working; completing the ultra-light he and his father had begun building. In contrast to Herb Campbell Adam is optimistic and proactive, looking for the best in humanity. Herb a former spy is a wealth of information, having served abroad in operations that required organization, soldierly skills and cunning. He's tough, sharp-edged and clever as mysterious as he is cynical. These two main characters and others add passion, energy and tension to this exciting and highly entertaining tale.I enjoyed ""The Rule of Three"" a great story without the graphic language prevalent in many other teen novels.

"""The Summer I Turned Pretty"" is a teen romance that begins in Cousins Beach where Isabel (Belly) Conklin and her family vacation in the summer with Susannah (Beck) Fisher and her two boys, Conrad and Jeremiah. Since childhood Belly has felt left out when the boys get together but the summer of her sixteenth birthday things start to change.For years Belly has had a crush on Conrad yearning for the day he will begin thinking of her more than just a tag-along kid. This summer she's blossomed into a pretty young woman which hasn't gone unnoticed either by the Beck boys or newcomer Cam. But her emotions are topsy-turvy because Conrad the boy who stole her heart as a child has changed in disposition, and her mother's best friend Susannah who's been like a second mother is facing a health crisis.Narrated by Belly with flashbacks of childhood memories the reader is swept into the close relationship between two lifelong friends and their families - the Fishers and the Conklins - as they deal with life's capriciousness. Belly has always yearned to be part of the boys circle and this summer they have not only begun to notice her, but Conrad who she's loved for years has changed; his mood sour and remote. Frustrated by their heated chemistry and his mixed signals, Belly is distracted by Cam a smart, straight-edged guy who likes her for her brains as well as her beauty, and the romantic overtures of her friend Jeremiah.Well-written with realistic dialogue and emotional intensity the plot not only follows the romantic ups and downs during Belly's summer vacation but also both family's struggle to deal with the pain of Susannah's progressing illness. The story's electrically-charged and intense, although often broken by laughter and humorous situations.For Belly Conklin the summer is a journey of self-discovery as this intelligent, naive and feisty teen not only chases love but faces the pain of loss. A spoiled, tattle-tale as a child, Belly can still be shallow and inconsiderate especially when she's influenced by her friend Taylor Jewel who's a self-absorbed, flighty tease. Yet as the story progresses her kindness and deep love for her extended family shines through in her words and actions. Conrad the eldest and most sensitive of the Fisher brothers is aloof, quiet and moody, caught up in the agony of his own pain. Although it's apparent he cares deeply for Belly, he remains unattainable and unavailable, toying with the affections of other girls and snubbing her. In contrast Belly's brother Steven can be an obnoxious and insufferable tease, but also very protective; the very popular Jeremiah funny and likeable; and the new boy Cam thoughtful and caring.Of the other protagonists who add passion and power to the drama, Susannah Fisher is a kind woman with a heart of gold who can be resolute and stubborn especially when dealing with her husband's infidelity and her illness. In contrast Laurel, Belly's highly independent mother is confident, reasonable but very secretive. Jenny Han has a flare for creating characters that are unforgettable even with all their flaws and faults.I enjoyed reading ""The Summer I Turned Pretty"" and can't wait to read the next book in this absorbing trilogy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMO580EOCGXF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1416968296#wasThisHelpful","R2DMO580EOCGXF","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Between Us And The Moon"" is a young adult contemporary romance set in Cape Cod where Sarah Levin and her family vacation each year at her wealthy aunt's house. Unlike her eighteen year old sister Scarlett who's preparing to study at the Julliard School in New York Sarah eagerly plans to track a comet, watch the stars and apply for a scholarship until her boyfriend Tucker Jackson who she's loved since kindergarten shatters her dreams in his desire ""to experiment"" with his social life and arguing that she only watches the world but doesn't live in it.Shattered Sarah rebels and initiates ""the Scarlett Experiment"" determined to be more like her beautiful and popular sister. Adopting Scarlett's clothes and rhetoric she catches the eye of nineteen year old Andrew Davis who not only makes her feel special but loves the geeky quirks that make her different from any other girl he's known. But as their romance quickens her lies threaten to destroy their love, bringing them both a lot of pain.In a flowing writing style Rebecca Maizel weaves a well-developed plot that revolves around two troubled teens; one who hates living in the shadow of her older sister, and the other who lost a friend in a tragic accident and can't move on. Although the main plot deals with the romance between a sixteen year old girl and a nineteen year old boy the forbidden aspect of their love seems to arise from a stigma related to the difference in their ages when in reality any issues would result from her drinking illegally and from his obvious maturity having been out of school for two years and living on his own. Yet there are underlying themes that are very real in this story like sibling rivalry, family relationships and the crushing impact of grief.With an emotional-intensity often broken by snatches of humor Sarah nicknamed ""Bean"" goes on a journey of self-discovery learning lessons about herself and her family as she realizes that life and love can be fickle. The tension heats up in this mesmerizing tale with a hurricane that not only ruins her sister's going- away party but flings her into a steamy situation that brings heartache after Sarah's lies are revealed. Quickly progressing to an intense ending, the climax seems to be somewhat anti-climatic with more questions than answers.Sarah Levin is a highly intelligent teen with a logical, hyper-detailed mind who loves math and astronomy. She's not very social, fearing rejection but in loving Andrew changes becoming more confident and outspoken, realizing that there is more to life than science. In contrast Scarlett Levin is a graceful beauty who's overconfident, popular and funny, but very phony. Tucker Jackson Sarah's best friend for nine years is a geek who's insecure and wants to be well-liked, choosing to dump Sarah to make his dream a reality. Sensitive, good-natured and loving Andrew Davis is haunted by the death of a friend but finds solace and an anchor in Sarah. When he discovers she's been lying about her age and going to MIT, his pain turns his love to disgust. All these characters and many more add passion, depth and power to the captivating dramatic events that end with a secret, small smile.Reminiscent of Jenny Han's young adult romances, ""Between Us And The Moon"" is an engaging story from beginning to end and has to be read to be enjoyed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU7JA96NWSS07/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062327615#wasThisHelpful","RU7JA96NWSS07","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Spirit of Redd Mountain""  is an enthralling mystery thriller with a haunting atmosphere that begins in 1963 on the dangerous wintery slopes of a mountain after tragedy strikes when the careless bullets of a hunter causes an avalanche that sweeps six novice skiers and a rescue ranger to their deaths; their bodies never found. That day a legend was born. Over the years multiple reports have surfaced about a skier in a red parka who diverts accidents on the slopes, and of an invincible Red Elk that acts as a decoy to save wildlife in the forest.Thirty years later when Gerry Bruce (Jr.) advertises a hunt for the Red Elk, renowned hunter Warner Barney ,the man who triggered the snowslide returns determined to kill and mount the head of the elusive quarry in his den. But Gerry's father a former guide and Oliver Barry, the park ranger have other ideas. With their party of conservationists, a veterinarian, an animal rights activist, a journalist and photographer they chase the hunter and his prey over the mountain little realizing as events unfold that fate is leading them towards a final showdown.Larry Auerbach sets the stage for this exciting page-turner on Redd Mountain, a group of peaks clustered together and separated by ridges. Here ski runs are separated from hunters by a non-hunting zone that an arrogant and careless hunter crossed in the 60's stalking a prey that will come back to haunt him years later. This well-written, fast-paced plot not only follows Warner Barney the obsessed hunter who's chasing the Red Elk , the ranger and guide who are planning to thwart him, but also the egotistical reporter who will do anything to write a sensationalistic story on the weird happenings on the mountain.In an riveting and gripping tale where the people in the hunting party chase the Red Elk for different reasons, some will come away from the adventure with a sense of self-discovery while others will face their self-recriminations, and guilt from the past. In a plot where the author builds tension and high intensity with continual appearances of the spectres and premonitions that raise cautious fear, the action never stops as the party faces one challenge after another in their chase across the mountain. Amid the mystery and uncertainty as curious, paranormal events develop ideas about careful and selective hunting versus unlimited killing are voiced. Yet the seriousness of the party's undertaking is often broken with the odd dash of humor and the stirring of romance between an influential and knowledgeable old rancher and a reserved and lonely veterinarian.The characters are engaging and unforgettable as they deal with skepticism , guilt from the past and their individual flaws; like Warner Barney the trigger happy fanatic who ran from the consequences of his deadly action years before. He's a self-absorbed, arrogant, abrasive bully who thinks money can buy anyone or anything. In contrast Gerry Bruce (Sr.) a rancher and former guide haunted by guilt is a man of integrity who wants to see justice prevail just as Parker Woodson the sensible and determined ex- ranger and Oliver Barry impulsive and perceptive head of park and skier safety do. All these personalities and many more including an overly ambitious, controlling reporter and her conscientious, amiable cameraman add to the energy, passion and drama of this absorbing tale.I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Spirit of Redd Mountain"" and recommend it as a must- read for all those that like a haunting story you can't put down until the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6ZS6NCS9TUC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1462033369#wasThisHelpful","R1W6ZS6NCS9TUC","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unable to move the man she cleans his wound, makes him comfortable and goes to her friend Lady Tamara for help, never realizing that the encounter is about to change her life forever.Leslie Hachtel sets the plot in England in 1508 in a time when women have no rights and are owned and bartered like property. In this period Lady Dariana raised by an indulgent father after the death of her mother is unusual, refusing to have her life bargained away so the King can cement his alliance with Spain. Yet when she meets Lord William, the Earl of Darnsworth her defiance is challenged when she's impelled to marry him, but her anger at his high-handedness soon turns to a love that defies any force that threatens it.For a short story, ""The Defiant Bride"" is well-written and evocative of the period, the pace flowing smoothly to a satisfying ending. The romance quickly heats up when the besotted William awakening from his injury is determined to find the ""angel"" who nursed him and make her his own. As Dariana and William's chemistry ignites there is a clash of wills not only before they wed but afterwards as they challenge anyone who would keep them apart. The novel is a page turner from beginning to end as the author mixes romance with the deadly intrigue of enemies that want vengeance not only against William but Dariana who dared to thwart her marriage to a wealthy Spaniard.The characters are fascinating and engaging, their love affair quickly heating up the pages of this absorbing story. Eighteen year old Lady Dariana is headstrong and independent in her desire to choose her own husband.

Lord William is the arrogant, confident noble who's enthralled not only with Dariana's beauty but her cleverness and kindness. An honourable man well-liked by the King and a strong, powerful warrior he will defy anyone who tries to take Dariana from him.Yet like all good stories it's the villains that add chilling excitement to the tale. Cedric of Beckford is William's half-brother, a troublemaker who feels he's been wronged. Masking his cold-heartedness, envy and intimidation behind false charm, he's intent on gaining what he wants even if the cost is murder. Melissa, William's former betrothed and Cedric's ally is a mean, vindictive woman with a hot temper who will do anything for money and position. All these characters add passion and high energy to the drama as it unfolds.I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Defiant Bride"", rate it a solid 4.0 and look forward to reading more by Leslie Hachtel in future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D6UME6KZB543/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1511886285#wasThisHelpful","R1D6UME6KZB543","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Awakening"" the first book in the ""Shadow Realm Saga""  is a captivating fantasy that begins in Noren City when Lilly Lowreth is frightened by a stranger in a long coat wielding a sword. Terrified he's trying to kill her she flees into the heart of a temple where a dramatic twist of fate will sweep her into a world of light and shadows, and into a war between the luriel and daemons.Lilly quickly learns that deep within her burns the light and power of a luriel and that the man she thought was an assassin is her mentor and protector, a daemon slayer- Mychel Viltis. Even after discovering that she's a celemae, a fledgling luriel stalked by daemons from the Shadow Realm who want to kill her, Lilly clings to a life of normalcy in her world, resisting the truth of old myths that suddenly seem very real. With her emotions already topsy-turvy from a recent breakup, Lilly flees her unexpected discovery by spending a night out with her friends and rebounding into the arms of good-looking and magnetic Darrac, a daemon in human form who is determined to win the favour of his leader by killing her. What neither expect is to face changes that will have Lilly's powers maturing and Darrac changing as their bond grows stronger.Melanie Nilles sets the backdrop for this intoxicating tale between the Gray Realm where humans cling to a firm belief in science and technology, and the Shadow Realm where luriel and daemons fight an ongoing war. After the Sundering when an ancient race split into daemons and luriel, the latter broke off pieces of themselves and attached them to human souls so they could multiply. These celemae, fledgling luriels must find Enlightenment if they are to survive the threat of daemons who want to kill them. As a celemae Lilly must embrace her power if she is to live and help in the fight against the daemons, but she may be different, her power the healing force that could end the war.Although slow at first as Melanie Nilles introduces the reader to the shadows of a hidden world that suddenly collides with mankind, the pace quickly picks up as events unfold that have death not only stalking Lilly but monstrous creatures plaguing humanity. The mood is sombre and dark as Lilly confronts her fear and insecurity struggling to grasp her newfound power, Mychel fights to protect her and Darrac, the daemon sent to destroy her begins to evolve, his allegiance changing. In a fluid writing style (except for the unusual brackets around some of the dialogue) Melanie Nilles sweeps the reader into an imaginative and innovative world where everything is not what it seems, and the battle between good and evil may not be that clear-cut. Even the climax which ends in an explosive confrontation leaves more questions to be answered.Although the characters add power and excitement to the plot-line with their complex personalities, I felt little rapport or sympathy for Lilly and wasn't caught up in her romance with Darrac. Perhaps with more details to her breakup with Rian, it would have created some sympathy and given more substance to Lilly's feelings and actions. In the story she's lonely and naive, rebounding from a broken heart when she meets Darrac. Fearful of losing his interest she clings to him, craving his acceptance and yearning for love. Even as her power as a luriel builds and she senses the presence of a daemon, she never questions Darrac's sudden presence in her life and relegates Mychel who encourages, protects and anchors her, to only a friend. Lilly is overly skeptical, naive and unpredictable until near the end when she begins to show courage and spirit. Darrac is a hard-nosed, calculating and confident daemon. As a roguishly handsome, dark-haired human he easily sweeps Lilly off her feet, ensuring his angry, heartless leader, Torek that he will kill her at the first opportunity. Yet as he spends more time with her, slyly drinking-in her energy at night, his loyalty and ideals begin to change.Even with my criticism of ""Awakening"" I was thoroughly mesmerized by this unique fantasy from the first page to the last. I look forward to reading the next chapter in this saga.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE6W9U7CB9KIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH5STE6#wasThisHelpful","RE6W9U7CB9KIF","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A genius haunted by abuse and tragic loss, Adam's stubborn, manipulative and feels helpless, struggling with severe migraine headaches as he deals with a relationship spiraling downwards, out of his control. In comparison Emilia (Mia) Strong with her feminist ideals is highly independent, strong-willed and refuses any outside interference in making decisions, even from someone she loves. Rather than being honest and asking for help when sick or even giving Adam a chance to explain his actions she avoids any unpleasantness, shielding herself by running from a problem or putting up a defensive wall around her heart. In this story neither Adam nor Mia has had any experience in the relationship department, both have serious trust issues and are unable to communicate honestly with each other.""At Any Turn"" is an emotional roller coaster that paves the way for the final book in a rocky romance that you hope will end in Adam and Mia finding happiness,","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36PDB57QGDRBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940951046#wasThisHelpful","R36PDB57QGDRBY","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""At Any Price"" a titillating stormy contemporary romance begins with Mia Strong's ""Virgin Manifesto"" as she offers her virginity for auction online. Her rules are clear; the highest bidder must be unmarried; have a lab workup to ensure no STD's; no criminal history; proof of payment in an offshore holding account and a contractual agreement that there will be no contact after the contract's completed.But the auction goes awry when the winner, Adam Drake the CEO of Drake Multimedia Entertainment snidely voices his own conditions and Mia begins having second thoughts. Only with charm and playing on their steamy chemistry is he able to take control of the situation so the game can begin. What neither expect as the romance heats up and they reveal past pain and suffering is that love can heal even their worst demons if they 're strong and brave enough to accept and trust each other.The story comes alive in the world of gaming where geeks like Mia Strong set aside their troubles playing Dragon Epoch, the latest innovative game from Draco. But Mia's no stranger to problems; struggling to pay her bills, studying for her MCAT, and trying to help a mother recuperating from cancer whose teetering on the verge of losing her ranch. Motivated by money and a sense of security, a feminist who's determined to control her destiny, Mia puts her only asset of value up for auction even though she's continually warned that nothing good can come of prostituting herself for money.This well-written plot vibrates with emotion and sexual tension as events unfold that have two people troubled by the past and adhering to a ""no dating"" policy to pursue their dreams,  find love in a wacky contest of wills. With wit, humor and steamy sexual foreplay Brenna Aubrey builds a story filled with tension and passion where trust and love can be irreparably destroyed by secrets and lies.Mia Strong haunted by a brutal assault and the rejection of her ""biological sperm donor"" is overly practical, insecure, afraid of failure and avoids relationships preferring the safety and control of the imaginative world of Dragon Epoch. As her sexual barometer heats up, craving more stolen hours with Adam, she changes into a virginal wanton becoming daring, bold and empowered but reeling from the truth of secrets that could undermine her growing attachment. Adam Drake the brilliant child prodigy who's the founder and CEO of a rising company and plagued by family tragedy isolates himself from love hiding his emptiness behind an excessive work ethic. Only with Mia does he come alive and awaken to the possibilities of love. Both characters are engaging with complexity in their personalities that fuels the drama with energy and passion.Although at times I found Mia a bit too high-strung and over-dramatic , the story is riveting, a page turner from beginning to end. I look forward to reading the next chapter in Mia and Adam's steamy romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAO79T9O6F99/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=194095102X#wasThisHelpful","R3UAO79T9O6F99","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Both characters are engaging and complex, igniting their burgeoning romance with electricity and passion.Although not a fan of novels with a high- level of graphic language, I found ""For the Win,"" to be a well- written, sexually-charged contemporary romance with a cast of memorable characters. It keeps you captivated from the first page to the last and I intend to read more stories by Brenna Aubrey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YBTHBELFQ2N0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940951097#wasThisHelpful","R2YBTHBELFQ2N0","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Alien Me"", a blend of science fiction and urban fantasy intertwined with romance begins at Duncan High School in Likely Minnesota after Darcy Hinson is cyber bullied into publically apologizing to her date after being accused of poisoning him when he passes out at a movie. Angry and frustrated she's further humiliated at school when the stones in her jewellery burn her skin after new student Sean Banks enters her class. Forced to flee Duncan High after being attacked by assassins in the principal's office, Darcy quickly learns that she's far from normal and has been endowed with some strange and unexpected abilities.Swept deep underground to Geminay the home of the Original People, a technologically superior alien race Darcy's life becomes further complicated when she learns about her creation as a human-hybrid and that she's duty-bound to obeying the commands of her high-born creators. But in this heartless, unemotional and logical world of lies and deceit nothing is what it seems. As Darcy begins to fall for Sean, a love that's forbidden and slowly rebels against the constraints of her creators she uncovers a plot to destroy humanity, a plan she will do anything to stop.Emma Accola sets the stage for this captivating tale in Geminay where the Original People settled after being hunted by the Tarkwin, a callous warrior race. In this rigidly structured society ,high-born houses rule under the direction of two royals, and do little work leaving that to the low-borns and discarded classes. In a social order where Mechanics created human-alien hybrids called Sworn Assets, Darcy quickly learns that her role is not only to be a conduit for the yellow sun above but an energy source to help the people return to their homeland. But although she's richly provided for in a beautiful setting, the mood is dark and sinister and death the cost of free will.Fast-paced and filled with suspense the intensity of the plot heats up when Darcy begins to learn the extent of her power as a ""missusan"", someone who can kill with a touch. As events unfold and the danger that threatens their lives escalates Darcy and Sean not only draw closer, romance blossoming, but they unravel clues to an evil plot that means freedom for the Original People and death for humanity. The story is fascinating from beginning to end especially with a cliff-hanger after an explosive confrontation that begs for a sequel.The characters are engaging and complex, adding energy and passion to the emerging drama; especially sixteen year old Darcy Hinson who's insecure, easy-going and highly submissive to adult authority. As the plot progresses she begins to change becoming more altruistic, resourceful, confident and brave. Sean Banks who was strong and self-assured on the surface quickly becomes compliant and passive, fearing the high-borns control. Forbidden to fall in love, Darcy and Sean's friendship and trust quickly grows deeper underground as their attachment grows stronger.Yet it's the antagonists that add chilling excitement to this tale especially Lady Naomi who's ruthless, cold-hearted, merciless and will do anything to ensure that that her relationship with Lord Sylvan continues and that they can return home.At first I thought events progressed too quickly with little build-up to the momentous actions that have Darcy and Sean fleeing assassins. At times the dialogue was stiff, and unrealistic for a sixteen year old facing such an unexpected and significant change in her life. But as events progressed the story flowed more smoothly, becoming enjoyable and entertaining. I look forward to reading the sequel as Darcy and Sean struggle to keep their love alive as they fight to save mankind from extinction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131NM5C2QE4BT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XRWWF92#wasThisHelpful","R131NM5C2QE4BT","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Amanda Lester and the Pink Sugar Conspiracy""  is a tween adventure filled with mystery and intrigue that begins when twelve year old Amanda Lester a descendant of Scotland Yard Inspector G. Lestrade is reluctantly enrolled at "" Legatum Continuatum: the Enduring School for Detectives"" at Lake Windemere in England. A filmmaker at heart Amanda not only deplores any connection to her bumbling ancestor who worked with master sleuth Sherlock Holmes, a detective she considers egotistical and overrated but being forced to study at the secret detective school.But as Amanda makes new friends especially the good-looking, magnetic Nicholas (Nick) Muffet and strange events begin to unfold that rouse her curiosity she slowly becomes embroiled in a mystery and a conspiracy that goes far beyond an assigned school project.Paula Berinstein sets the stage for this captivating tale of secrets, lies, murder and deceit at the Legatum Continuatum a covert school that teaches the young descendants of famous detectives the ""tools and tricks of the trade"". Divided into five houses with fifty students each the plot heats up when Gaston Thornkill the headmaster advises the students that they must solve a crime before the end of the term and that the winning house will receive future privileges. But to Amanda and her friends who have found blood spatters and heard noises in the walls the mystery has already begun.With an explosion on school grounds, a pink powder found in odd places and suspects murdered not only does the author build tension and suspense but the intensity and pace of the plot escalate. And if that's not enough to start Amanda's investigative skills boiling, her father disappears and she begins receiving threatening emails. With natural dialogue and humor Paula Berinstein cleverly captures not only the emotional upheavals of being a tween but in the case of Amanda her angst and her family's interaction when she's forced to move away from all she knows and loves, as well as the flattery and confusion of a first attraction.Like the plot the characters are realistic and engaging especially Amanda Lester who was told she's close-minded, dictatorial and a micromanager by her girlfriends in the Stick Dog Filmmakers Club. Yet in the detective school her flaws are minimized as she becomes more of a team player, showing a resourceful, clever and impulsive nature. Smitten by the dashing and creative Nick Muffet who has a similar interest in film, she's quickly enchanted by his niceness and easy smiles that mask secrets and a connection to an infamous villain.Of the other characters who add their intelligence and expertise to the investigation are blind but perceptive and cheerful Ivy Halpin; her loyal, curious and likeable dog Nigel; the strong-willed and moody Amphora Kapoor; and the brilliant, dependable, but awkward and sometimes annoying Simon Binkle.I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Amanda Lester and the Pink Sugar Conspiracy"" and highly recommend it to tweens and teens alike. I look forward to seeing what's in-store next for Amanda and her friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8K9XSVOBB0JC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0986030481#wasThisHelpful","R8K9XSVOBB0JC","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Fashion Academy"" centers around Mackenzie Williams a sixth grader who has been addicted to fashion since she was old enough to style her dolls hair and dress them with her unusual flair. Wanting to be a designer ""who colours outside the lines and thinks outside the box,"" Mickey is excited when she receives a full scholarship to the Fashion Academy of Brooklyn (FAB). But when she arrives with her avant- garde style, she's ostracized by smug Jade Lee and her friends. Wanting to pursue her dream and socially fit in to the academy, Mickey makes friends with Javen Cumberland a ""doggy design genius"" who reinvents her image. Becoming the chic fashionista Kenzie Willis, supposedly the daughter of Finnish designer royalty, she quickly makes friends, but the lie could cost her the individuality that makes her unique.The story is innovative and inspiring for young girls who dare to dream. It's filled with humour and amusing incidents like the stink of decay from the red cabbage and berry juice on the t-shirt she designs. In a plot that progresses quickly as Mickey takes a journey of self-discovery there are heartwarming moments as her crusty and dreary Aunt Olive warms to her clever and affectionate niece.Mackenzie (Mickey) Williams is an ambitious, driven young girl whose life becomes an exciting adventure as she explores her dream of becoming a designer at the Academy. Javen Cumberland (JC) who ""believes less is more"" in fashion is the smart and talented friend who helps Mickey change her image so she'll fit in, while stodgy Aunt Olive is the ""germophobic bird-watcher"" who transforms under her niece's love and guidance. The personalities of all these characters and many more breathe life into a charming tale.I enjoyed ""Fashion Academy"" and intend to have other middle schoolers who dream about their future read it. I'd rate it 4.5 if the scale allowed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z3Q9V05WWXH8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492601624#wasThisHelpful","R2Z3Q9V05WWXH8","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Storm Fall"" the fast-paced sequel to ""Rebel Wing"" heats up as Aris Haan overcomes the demons haunting her after her last dangerous mission as Aristos and she rejoins her search and rescue unit. With new purpose in being the public face of enlisted women in the military and as a Lieutenant training new flyers at the Spiro stationpoint, Aris's work has grown harder especially with the men in her unit undermining her authority with taunts and snide comments. Encouraged and supported by her best friend Dysis, her sectormate Pallas and her commanding officer Major Milek Vadim who she's fallen in love with, Aris is determined to overcome the men's hostility, and to help find the Safaran torturer who scarred her and burned Ward Galena Vadim's face.Tracy Banghart sets the stage for her second mesmerizing novel in Atalanta where war with the Dominion of Safara continues to rage not only with the deaths of soldiers but innocent villagers. Plagued by the cruel and brutal leadership of Ward Belias who's determined to gain the rich resources of Atalanta the Safarans suffer from starvation and illness, their children stolen to serve in his army. In a fluid writing style she breathes realism into a plot where the war seems endless and the Atalantan military are killing a faceless enemy only to discover a hidden truth; they're no more than children. As in every war story it's filled with tragedy, brutality and violence but often diluted by love, courage and mercy.The plot is action-packed and mesmerizing with every dip and turn of the wingjets, every explosive encounter with the enemy, and all the political intrigue. Threads of the story not only follow Aris's foray into the battle zone to discover the whereabouts of the Safaran torturer; her blossoming romance with Milek; but also the problems and strategies of Ward Nekos and Ward Vadim as they try to end the war while the love they thought lost rekindles. The plot's innovative with its futuristic look at the power-hunger and greed that undermines a senseless war as well as imaginative with science fiction devices like the diatous veil, solargun and sythin. The pace never stops, holding the reader captive until the startling cliff-hanger at the end which begs for another book.The personalities of the characters continue to be realistic and strong adding fervour and high-energy as they're challenged by one crisis after another. In this story Major Milek Vadim the authoritative, stern-faced officer who's cool and in control under pressure begins to show a softer side as he falls hopelessly in love with a strong-willed, independent and tougher Aris. Although their love's forbidden in the heat of war, they steal moments alone, their feelings growing in intensity. When Aris is thought to be dead uptight and principled Calix Pavlos breaks the rules, deserting his post to search for his former girlfriend with the rescue team. Regretting words that not only hurt but severed his bond to Aris, Calix shows resourcefulness, kindness and bravery.In the violence of war for every heart shattered and friend lost, new romances are born or rekindled like the attraction between Dysis and Calix, two opposites in personality drawn together in a secret mission to save Aris. And there's the volatile chemistry between Ward Nekos and Ward Vadim who can't forget the past, their love rekindled as they strategize to find the spies within their Dominions and to end the danger and brutality of the war. Yet in every crisis it's the antagonists that add chilling tension and heighten the suspense; like Elom, Galena Vadim's cruel and brutal torturer and Ward Belias the dangerous, heartless and deceptive Safaran leader.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Storm Fall"" and highly recommend it. As a new fan of Tracy Banghart's series I look forward to reading about Aris's next exploits in the war against Safara.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LGUFY3M8OM4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBGZZA8#wasThisHelpful","R2LGUFY3M8OM4T","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the future in the Dominion of Atalanta ""Rebel Wing"" is a mesmerizing, fast-paced blend of military action, romance and intrigue that begins when eighteen year old Aris Haan's boyfriend is drafted as a field mender in the military and leaves for war.Desperately in love and feeling adrift without him, Aris makes an impulsive decision to use her love of flying and join Calix on the battlefront but there's a problem- the military's prohibition of women. Undeterred Aris discovers a way to become a soldier but it means giving up her life in Lux, her family and friends, and changing her identity.In a novel that's a page turner from beginning to end Aris makes a transition in her life that transforms her from a weak, helpless, protected young woman into a brave and skilled flyer who overcomes trials and survives the violence of battle to find her calling in saving lives as part of the search and rescue unit.Tracy Banghart sets the stage for this innovative plot in Atalanta one of Five Dominions, a country rich in resources at war with Safara. As the story opens Aris and Calix are planning their life together and about to join one of five services - Health, Commerce, Technical, Environment or Military. But fate has other plans for the young lovers when Calix is conscripted into the army and Aris decides to follow him into a war that Atalanta appears to be losing.Threads of the story follow not only Aris's self-discovery and bravery under fire, but the kidnapping of the Ward of Ruslana by the Safarans who are determined to isolate Atalanta from any help from her allies. With multiple twists and turns Tracy Banghart slowly builds tension and suspense in an unique plot filled with exciting exploits and imaginative technology that can change a person's appearance. Even the intensity of Aris's romance with Calix who refuses to bind her love to him with a ""Promise"" until after the war, begins to change as she transforms into a strong, determined soldier with a new purpose in her life.The characters are unforgettable, adding power and passion with the complexity of their personalities. Aris Haan (aka Aristo) a sheltered young woman after illness left her with a limp is a romantic in love with her boyfriend Calix, but even more with flying her wingjet. Floundering after he leaves for war, Aris makes an impulsive decision that will eventually change her into a tough, courageous and determined flyer in the military. Practical and overprotective Calix Pavlos is not a rule breaker. When he discovers Aris's ruse he becomes judgemental and distant; his love conditional. In contrast Major Vidar Aris's tall scarred commanding officer is a stern, hardened soldier but calm and level-headed under duress. What begins as admiration for Aristo's flying skills slowly grows deeper when he discovers he's really a woman.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rebel Wing, a thrilling blend of romance,intrigue and the imagination of science fiction. I rate it highly and look forward to reading the next book in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HJHYD46G53Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939106427#wasThisHelpful","R38HJHYD46G53Z","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In ""A Book of Spirits And Thieves"" the spin-off series from ""Falling Kingdoms"" Morgan Rhodes weaves an urban fantasy filled with dark magic and mystery that begins in the Speckled Muse Bookshop in Toronto where Crystal and Becca Hatcher open a parcel with a strange book written in an unknown language. When the light of magic flares within its pages and Becca falls into a coma a dangerous adventure begins where worlds collide.Swept away to Mytica Becca Hatcher's spirit meets Maddox Corso a struggling necromancer who's beginning to discover the depth of his power. Believing only Maddox can help her find a way back to her world, the pair begin a journey that will have them confronting the power of Valoria a dark, power-hungry goddess who's bent on not only ruling her realm but all the unseen worlds beyond it.While Becca and Maddox search for a way to thwart Valoria's schemes, Crys Hatcher explores the mystery of the ancient book that left her sister comatose in the hospital. What she will uncover is not only a secret society that threatens her family but a dangerous attraction to a rich bad- boy Farrell Grayson, a member of the organization's inner circle.Morgan Rhodes sets the stage for this captivating tale between Mytica where an evil immortal sits on the throne slowly stealing the people's liberty and enforcing their total obedience , and Toronto where a mysterious leader of a secret society kills in the name of truth and justice. In a plot that brews slowly as it twists and turns, the action soon heats up when Becca and Maddox challenge Valoria's evil plot and Crys has to make a decision whether or not to hand over the powerful ancient book to the leader of the Hawkspear Society. As the intensity and suspense of the plot escalates lies and secrets are revealed that not only shock Crys, but have Becca facing an unsavory truth. In a natural flowing writing style that brings realism to this fantasy and with witty banter that breaks the growing tension the author builds a story that keeps the reader guessing even with a cliff-hanger at the end that begs for a sequel.The characters are unforgettable and complex as they struggle to overcome one challenge after another. Crystal (Crys) Hatcher is a nearsighted teen insecure about her looks who hides behind black glasses and an argumentative, defiant personality. Truant at school and troublesome at home Crys takes refuge in her love of photography. Yet for all her flaws she's relentless, a pit bull in discovering the mystery of her family's past and the book that holds the sister she loves hostage. In contrast Becca is pretty, responsible and self-confident. In ancient Mytica her spirit is drawn to the young necromancer Maddox Corso who's the only one who can see her. Plagued by his guardian's abuse, insecure and suspicious of a power he's only begun to tap into,Maddox's strength-of- character and determination shines through with each new challenge, even when he loses the girl who encouraged and supported him. In contrast charming but aimless Farrell Grayson the irresponsible and reckless son of a prominent Toronto family who's haunted by the loss of his brother and yearns for the respect of his parents seeks solace in the dark intrigues of the Hawkespear Society. A nineteen year old who relishes control over others and thinks money can buy him anything has a weakness for his brother and a young woman who smells like strawberries.Yet like all stories it's the antagonists that add a chilling excitement to the drama; in Mytica the merciless and heartless Valoria and in Toronto the controlling deceit and manipulation of Markus King.Like all of Morgan Rhodes novels, I thoroughly enjoyed ""A Book of Spirits And Thieves"" as dark magic flares, and an ancient and modern world collide.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TTLXLX4D0WT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595147594#wasThisHelpful","R23TTLXLX4D0WT","A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUL8ZT5YPEV7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This may not be the brightest UV light on the market, but it gets the job done, just turn the lights off.Having dogs, my wife and I have seen them have ""accidents"" (sometimes ""intentionals"" if they're in a mood) on the carpet and would clean them up.

"I've been wanting to delve into a Windows tablet of my own since a few Surface Pro 3's came in for some of the sales force at work.  Alas, I don't have $1,000+ laying around for such things, so when I saw this little gem advertised on sale, I had to get one.  As many others here have done, I got mine at Microcenter for a whole, whopping $59.I work in IT, so instinctively, the first thing I did out-of-the-box was start loading Windows Updates.  It didn't take long before reality came along and smacked me upside the head (in other words, C: ran completely out of space and Windows became very unhappy in a hurry).  A ""Reset to Factory Fresh"" later, and I was ready to try again.  You see, this tablet has only 16GB of ""hard drive"" space and half of that is tied up in the Recovery Partition (which, I've learned, is where *most* of Windows actually runs from on this tablet).  Of the ""available to the user"" space on C: drive, just over 2GB is tied up in various necessary directories, so right off the bat, C: is down to just 4GB free space.  A visit to www.microcentertech.com for a quick download gets you a utility that will free up 2 GB of C:, bringing it up to 6GB out-of-the-box.  6GB still isn't ""spacious"" by any stretch, but when you're talking drives this small, every little bit counts.  Mercifully, there is no ""bloatware"" pre-installed on this tablet like you find on most desktops and laptops.Lessons learned, I immediately turned OFF Windows Update so as not to run into those particular space problems again.  I also used every tip and trick I could find - and made up a few of my own - for making the most of my tiny C: drive.After getting past the C: space issues, I'm finding this little tablet to be surprisingly able and functional.  Since it's running ""full blown"" Windows 8.1, and it has a real USB port (a powered ""host"" port), installing anything you like is easy as can be.  The USB port even powered a (mechanical) USB hard drive.  Of course, as soon as you start installing stuff, you're back to the C: drive space problems.  I strongly recommend buying a 64GB MicroSD card and using it as a ""permanent"" install location for any and all programs that give you a choice of where to install them.The tablet comes with a one-year license for Office 365 Personal (licenses to install 2 devices, plus 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage) for free.  That, by itself, is $65 so buying this tablet is sort of like buying Office 365 and they give you a tablet to run it on.  Sweet deal.I've tried to see how far I can push this little guy.  It runs most programs fairly well, but CPU-intensive apps (like video encoding) run slowly and produce ""low memory"" errors.  All things considered, though, it's a remarkable device that is well worth its price.

"Everyone who has a DLP television will, sooner or later, hear the inevitable ""pop"" that signals it's time for a new bulb.  In my case, that sad sound came about a week after my 4-year extended (including bulbs) warranty on the TV ran out.  I figured I was ""in for it"", looking at a $200, $300, or even $400 repair.  Ugh.But, Amazon to the rescue!  Several 1 and 2 star reviews note ""infant mortality"" of these bulbs - they pop or burn out within the first month.  But, hey, for less than $30, I was willing to chance it.  So far, the gamble has paid off - it has been installed in my TV for a little over a month with no sign of trouble.This bulb comes in a complete cartridge, making it as easy to replace as it is to swap out ink cartridges in a printer.  Actual replacement time was about 5 minutes - including pulling the TV away from the wall so I could access the lamp compartment.  In short, I don't think it could be much easier to do.That was it.  Turned the TV on and presto! there's the picture!  Sweet.  My wife and I noticed that the picture is significantly brighter than it was with the old bulb.  We're not sure if it's because the replacement is meant to be that way or because the old bulb was ""on its way out"" long before the pop.  Whatever the reason, this bulb is fantastic.If you have a compatible DLP TV and need a replacement lamp, look no further.  You can't go wrong with this sub-$30 replacement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U8N1NDNZJ7LN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005F6O10Y#wasThisHelpful","R3U8N1NDNZJ7LN","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of those things that I just had to try out.  I was a little apprehensive because the stated requirement of ""iOS 6 or newer"" (for Apple devices) is a little old and I have the latest and greatest iPhone, but it was inexpensive enough to be in the ""low risk"" category (little $ to lose).  It works great with my iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.0.2, so I'm very happy I took a chance on it!This remote shutter release is remarkably easy to set up and use.  First, turn this little remote ""on"" and then go into the normal pairing process on your smartphone.  ""Keyboard"" may appear momentarily but is quickly replaced by ""AB Shutter 3"".  Tap on it and it's paired.  I had it ready to go in just a few seconds.  Using the remote is also simplicity at its best - open the camera app on your smartphone and press the corresponding button (iOS or Android) on the remote to take a picture.  There are no ""hidden"" settings to find or anything else to do.  Truly, it could not be any easier.  Pressing the ""Android"" button while paired with an Apple device has no effect.Some other reviewers reported that this remote ""lost"" its pairing every time it was turned off and back on.  I have purposely tested that because it would be pretty annoying, but I am not able to replicate that problem.It's not documented in the instructions that come with this remote, but if you want to reset the pairing and use the remote with a different smartphone, just turn it on and then press and hold both buttons (iOS + Android) for about 2 seconds.  The LED on the remote will flash rapidly to indicate it is in pairing mode.  If you do this and then wish to go back to using it with the first smartphone, you need to tell that smartphone to ""forget"" this remote.  Then you can proceed with the normal pairing process.It's pretty easy to open the battery compartment to replace the CR2032 button cell.  Unlike some electronics, there are no screws to remove or twisting motions.  The cover just slides up after a little initial resistance and then lifts off.  Knowing that I tend to fidget with stuff in my pockets and toss my keys onto my desk carelessly, I added a small piece of tape to help keep the battery cover on.  I did not deduct a star for this because it would not be fair to ""dock points"" for my bad habits - besides, needing to keep ""eyeglass"" screwdrivers on hand just to replace batteries is a pet peeve of mine.Included in the package is a drawstring pouch and a wrist lanyard.  Additionally, the key-loop on the remote is large enough to accommodate most key rings, so they've really covered all the bases for carrying, using, and transporting this little device.In summary, this is a remarkably simple and easy to use device at a very inexpensive price.  I would not hesitate recommending it to anyone who wants to do any kind of photography with their smartphone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381V28IFQDA59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J2QK6O8#wasThisHelpful","R381V28IFQDA59","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a plastic phone mount that came with my Joby Gorillapod, but my new iPhone 6 Plus doesn't fit, so I needed something different.  When I stumbled upon this metal one, I was very excited to try it out.One of my fears with the plastic mount was that it felt delicate - like it wanted to break at the most inopportune time.  That fear is no more with this beautifully machined aluminum mount.  Sure, it's bigger and heavier than the plastic one (which even folded flat), but this metal one is tough to beat.  In today's world where cheap plastic is abundant, it's nice to see a product with good, solid, quality, metal construction.I also like that rather than having a spring, which can wear out, this mount employs a simple thumb-screw to adjust the size and lock the mount onto the phone.  There's virtually nothing to wear out with this and I have no doubt that it will provide years of reliable service.This ""XL"" version fits my iPhone 6 Plus with room to spare.  The ""jaws"" open extra wide to accommodate almost any behemoth phone you might have - up to 3.6 inches.  For smaller phones, like the iPhone 4 or 5, there's a ""regular"" version..  The rubber pads protect your phone from damage while in this mount (just don't go nuts torquing the thumbscrew too much - it's not necessary for a secure hold).  Best of all, the standard tripod thread means you can put your phone on top of virtually any tripod of your choosing.There is really nothing not to like.

"These screen protectors may be inexpensive, but they're not cheap!I ordered two of these screen protectors - one for my mom and the other for a friend.  My mom used to have a film screen protector on her iPad but, the iPad case caused it to peel up and it started being a general pain - to the point that she cut it so at least part of the screen was protected, but the nuisance part was gone.Having had good success with real glass screen protectors, I bought this as a replacement for the film and have no regrets.  Mom agrees there is nothing like the look and feel of real, honest-to-goodness glass instead of plastic.  Installation was relatively easy, but you only get one shot to get it right when using glass protectors, so you need to take care and take your time.  Also, from experience, I learned to ditch the instructions that come with the protector and use the ""hinge method"" to install it.  Search on Google or YouTube for the ""hinge method"" of installing a glass screen protector.  It's almost fool proof and yields PERFECT results when done carefully.The protector, itself, seems to be of top-shelf quality and is everything you'd want it to be - clear, responsive, etc.  It's hard to go wrong with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KJCVHVMWZR2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4JZNC8#wasThisHelpful","R3KJCVHVMWZR2K","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like this little drive. Don't let its diminutive size fool you - this thing packs a punch!Right off the bat, we're talking 64GB of flash storage for under $30, so there's a lot to like before you even open the packaging.

The first time I transferred a 20MB file to it, I thought something was wrong because the progress bar popped on the screen for a fraction of a second and then was gone.  I have other flash drives that I used before this one that would take about 30-40 seconds to do the same file copy from the same USB port.  I even went back and tested exactly that with the other drives - this one is pretty quick and leaves my others in the dust.  I guess I had just gotten used to slow speeds.Besides the subjective ""feel"" of the flash drive, I ran the Black Magic disk speed test (Mac, Mac app store) on it and got results consistent with other reviewers - about 15MB/s write and about 21MB/s read.  I know that's not much compared to some others, and certainly close to nothing compared to USB 3.0, but it's more than quick enough for my needs.I'd feel comfortable recommending this flash drive to anyone who's looking for a ""big"" flash drive with a small price tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GF44582QP9WK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009OU5O0S#wasThisHelpful","R2GF44582QP9WK","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought an SSD along with this enclosure so that I could upgrade my 2009 MacBook Pro.  It facilitated my using Apple's Migration Assistant to move from the mechanical drive to the SSD.  Transfer speed with FW800 (my '09 MBP does not have USB 3.0 ports) was reasonably fast, considering it's housing a 5400 RPM mechanical drive running at SATA 1 speed.But, along the way, I wanted to boot off the now-external drive in this enclosure using FireWire.  It worked fine - one time.  Now, if this enclosure is connected and I try to boot from it, the activity light blinks a little intermittently, but the drive doesn't spin up and it doesn't show up as a boot device.  Strange that it worked once, but not after that.  I reset the PRAM and such, but the drive still won't spin up to boot if it's connected with FireWire.  If I connect via USB, the drive does spin up and I can boot from it, but USB 2.0 feels like slow death - not the fault of the enclosure, just throwing it out there.  I tried FW by itself as well as with a dedicated power cable (from another drive) plugged into a 2-amp iPad power supply, so it's not a matter of not having enough ""juice"" to power the drive and enclosure.Oddly enough, if the operating system is up and running and I plug this drive in , it works like a champ - regardless of whether I'm connecting with FireWire or USB (no need for that extra power cable either).  I make my living in I.T. and I've been running on Mac for at least 7 years.  Maybe someday if I have nothing better to do, I'll bring it in to the local Apple store and see if the Genius Bar has ever seen anything like it.Until then, I'll just give this a middle-of-the-road 3-stars.

"I'm liking this bracelet for several reasons:  1) price - I've seen comparable ones for almost 5 times the price of this one. 2) Feels strong and durable; not flimsy at all. 3) virtually care/maintenance-free stainless steel construction.  4) two-tone (brushed/polished) finish.As another reviewer noted, this bracelet is sized for a gorilla - well, at least a larger man.  Fortunately for me, I have big hands and large wrists, so this fits me fine.  I feel like it's just a tiny bit too long - not much, just a hair.  Some quick measurements tell me that removing one link would make it too small for my wrist, so I won't be doing that.  As it is, there's no possibility of it slipping over my hand while it's clasped (without serious damage to the bracelet or - more likely - my hand), so it's fine.  Besides, I see no way to resize it.  Other reviewers say it can be done by a skilled jewler or a clever MacGuyver type, but I don't purport to be either and I won't be pursuing it anyway.The bracelet arrived in a small box.  Inside the box, was a pouch.  Inside the pouch, a plastic bag.  Inside the plastic bag, the bracelet was wrapped in a heavy-duty vinyl material to prevent it from scratching and marring itself during transit.  Of course, all that is inside an Amazon-branded shipping box.  In short, considering that the bracelet is solid stainless steel, the packaging bordered on overkill, but if you're giving it as a gift, it may or may not be ""nice enough"" depending on your personal taste.As stated earlier, the entire bracelet is constructed of two tone (brushed/matte with highly polished accents) stainless steel.  It is substantial and heavy and feels very well made.  It measures 8.85 (roughly 8 7/8) inches in length when fastened, .5 inches wide, and roughly .19 (3/16) inch high.  My postage scale weighs it at 82.1 grams / 2.9 ounces.  If ""understated"" and ""lightweight"" are attributes you seek in a bracelet, this one probably won't excite you.The clasp is a fold-over design and snaps (with an audible click) closed.  It took a little getting used to - had to work on that ""manual dexterity"" a little bit, but in almost a week of wearing it, there's been no sign or indication whatsoever that the thing wants to come undone by itself or that the bracelet is weak and might fall apart.  Exactly the opposite.  I'll say it again - it feels solid and well-made.I would have no qualms about recommending this bracelet to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCG6NAXHXA7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DH7V19M#wasThisHelpful","RLCG6NAXHXA7T","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Prior to buying this SSD, I had been mulling over getting one for my early-2009 17"" MacBook Pro for more than a year.  High costs and relatively small sizes of SSDs kept me away - until this little terabyte-class gem came along.  My only regret now is that I didn't do it sooner!  Had I known how much the SSD would help, I would have spent the money to do it sooner.As other reviewers said it would, this SSD breathed new life into my aging MBP.  Boot up from the apple logo to a responsive desktop dropped from almost 4 minutes all the way down to 24 seconds!  Actually, a freshly-installed Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9) booted in just 15 seconds, but that doesn't really count because it had no programs, user data or settings, or anything else installed.In the interest of full disclosure, it wasn't all peaches and sunshine from the start.  I had intended to install Mavericks fresh and clean on this SSD and then use Apple's built-in Migration Assistant to pull in my programs, settings, etc. from the mechanical drive (that is now in a firewire enclosure) as I had done many times with hard drive upgrades in the past.  For whatever reason, this SSD didn't like Migration Assistant.  Sure, it ran and completed, but then booting the computer exceeded 8 full minutes and ran at a snail's pace afterwards.  Clearly something was wrong, but I don't know what it was and I wasn't completely opposed to rebuilding the computer fresh-and-clean all the way.After this less-than-stellar result, for Plan-B, I reformatted the SSD and reinstalled Mavericks and then re-installed all my programs, re-created my preferences settings, and easily copied my home directory from the external drive to this SSD.  Everything installed fresh-and-clean from the ground, up.  The results were nothing short of astounding.  Fully loaded with antivirus and firewall software, full suites of productivity apps, and a few extras, the system boots in less than half a minute.My Windows 7 Bootcamp partition made the trip to the new SSD unscathed thanks to Winclone and now also boots in less than 30 seconds.  I thought about leaving it behind, but while my personal computing is 100% Mac, my professional life is 100% Windows.  Incidentally, Winclone is more than worth its purchase price if you're using Bootcamp on a Mac and want to move your Windows partition to a new drive.The SSD, itself, is tiny at only 7mm thick as compared to the standard 9mm size, but fits comfortably without a spacer in the MacBook Pro thanks to Apple's design.  A 2mm self-adhesive spacer is included for other mounting configurations.The only other thing worth talking about is the limited write-life inherent in ALL SSDs.  There are two types of SSDs - SLD and MLC - and the entire Crucial M500 line uses MLC, which is regarded as the lower-end, slower, consumer-grade type.  This worried me a little, so I did some homework.  This M500 starts with a full terabyte under the hood, but Crucial employs some unique data verification and integrity techniques that cost 40GB right off the top, hence the 960GB label.  Along with wear-leveling and other life-increasing measures, Crucial calculates that one would need to write 40GB to the SSD every day for 5 years to wear it out.  An independent review I read said they went about torture-testing some SSDs of various brands - an M500 included - and concluded that Crucial's estimate is conservatively low - the drive is capable of much more.  As for being slower - it's all relative.  The drives rated throughput far exceed the capabilities of the SATA controller in my early 2009 MacBook Pro.  So, while there are ""faster"" drives out there, my on-board SATA controller can only do what it can do and I won't benefit from a ""faster"" drive than this M500.  All these factors eased my fears and I went with it.  Besides, when was the last time I wrote 40GB to any disk any day (except for rare occasions)?In short, it's a great drive at a value-price that I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.  Sometimes, after spending ""big-bucks"" ($450 is big-bucks on my budget these days), I'll come down with a case of buyer's remorse.  But not this time!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8N3CA1Q9865V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ8RGL6#wasThisHelpful","R8N3CA1Q9865V","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I have three printers scattered around the house that all take these ink cartridges.  Somehow, it seems, they always run out of ink at the same time and we just hated spending $40 per printer to replenish the ink.  We spotting this ink here on Amazon and we were a little skeptical - after all, it's well known that you generally get what you pay for - so we ""gambled"" a few bucks and ordered one set.These cartridges turned out to be a great deal and we just ordered three more sets!Be sure to do yourself a favor by reading and following the included instructions before using these cartridges.  As other reviewers have noted, you'll need to dismiss a message on the printer stating that these are not genuine cartridges and the ink levels are essentially ""unknown"", but for the price, you can't go wrong with this ink!  Besides, the cartridges are somewhat translucent, so you can open the cover of the printer and see how much ink is in them.Aside from the error message and no electronic indication of ink level, these are great cartridges well-worth the price if you're willing to live with those shortcomings.  They print quite nicely and the colors are rich and vibrant.

"First, read past the poorly translated description that reads as though it went through a word blender.  The highlights are that this tempered glass screen protector is 0.4mm thick, has an oleophobic coating to resist oily fingerprints, is chemically hardened to 8-9H, and is sized for the iPad Mini.  The edges of the protector are chamfered (rounded) to help prevent chipping.This, like any other glass screen protector, is a one-shot deal when it comes to installing it.  You'll want to take your time because once it's on your iPad Mini, you will have spent your one-and-only chance at getting it aligned just right.  Taking it off ""may"" (read as ""will"") degrade the adhesive and it won't stick properly, so take your time.Getting a perfect alignment while following the included instructions, I respectfully submit to you, would be virtually impossible.  The instructions show a ""free-hand"" approach to lining it up and getting it installed, but I don't think anyone is capable of getting it perfect on the first-and-only chance with that approach.  For this reason, I strongly recommend the ""hinge method"" - Search Google and YouTube for it.  Using the hinge method (and a small suction-cup for a little more control), I achieved a PERFECT installation - at a casual glance, it is very nearly indistinguishable from the iPad Mini screen, itself.  This hinge method works for smaller iPhone screens as well.  Of course, you'll also want to THOROUGHLY clean the iPad Mini screen and make sure it is free of dust and smudges before you stick the protector on it.The screen protector is actually just a tiny little bit smaller than iPad Mini screen.  With a perfect alignment, there is an approximately 1mm margin all the way around the edges of the protector to the edge of the actual screen.  Again, use the hinge method (and a small suction cup, if you have one) to install this protector and take all the time you need to get it lined up perfectly.There is nothing like the look and feel of real glass on your device - just the way it was designed in the first place.  Of course, this protector doesn't do anything to help alleviate glare, so if that's something you want in a screen protector, this one is not for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B7Y52SRVSLCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4JZLNE#wasThisHelpful","R1B7Y52SRVSLCX","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes, it seems that certain authors try to impress you with complicated vocabulary and ""lofty"" writing that ought to come with some sort of decoder kit.A.W. Tozer is NOT one of them! There's nothing complicated here and this book is a surprisingly easy read.Tozer's writing is crisp, clean, and directly to the point. He doesn't mince words or pull punches; virtually nothing is left to interpretation - he pretty much spells it out for you in straight-forward English.What impresses me most is that this book was essentially written 50 years ago, but very well could have been written yesterday.  The references to things like ""people these days"" or ""our times"" still ring true and are completely accurate today - possibly more so now than when he first penned them.

"Pros: heavy duty protection; very clear; barely noticeable; compatible with iPhone 5S TouchID; does not impair any features/functions at all.Cons: no installation instructions in the package; as with all glass protectors, you only get one shot at installing it correctly - the adhesive is not reuseable (but read on to learn how to get it right the first time).Be warned: this protector does NOT include any application instructions, but here's what to do:Not wanting the crooked installation I had with a previous glass protector, I Googled for advice and found the ""hinge"" method on YouTube.  Basically, before peeling the backing off the adhesive, get the protector lined up perfectly and put some scotch tape (painter's tape, masking tape, or similar non-marring, non-residue tape) along one edge so that the screen protector now swings like a door on hinges on the phone.  When you're satisfied that the alignment is perfect, ""open"" the door, clean the phone's screen THOROUGHLY, make sure there is NO dust on the screen, peel the backing off the adhesive, and ""close"" the door.  Perfect installation that anyone can do.  As mentioned, YouTube has some videos showing this excellent method of installing glass screen protectors.With the protector perfectly aligned, it is barely perceptible.  You might be the only one who realizes that there's a screen protector installed on your phone.  It is very nearly invisible and, as noted earlier, does not impair any features or functions of the phone.  TouchID, proximity sensor, and the front-facing FaceTime camera all work perfectly woth this protector installed.The fit and finish of this particular protector is comparable to the expensive name brands, but is delivered to your door at bargain-basement prices.  In fact, you can buy two of these for the price of one of the least-expensive name-brand.  The quality of this protector is excellent!Once you go with a real glass screen protector, you'll never want to go back to the ""traditional"" vinyl or plastic ones ever again.  Not even the highest quality film protector has the look or feel of real glass on your phone.All told, I could not be any happier with this purchase and would happily to buy it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70JFUDQFZH68/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CZE3HY0#wasThisHelpful","R70JFUDQFZH68","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It used to be that if you had a string of Christmas lights, either they all lit up or none lit.  Then a few gyrations later, there are sets that, at most, every other bulb would go out.  Then we made the move to LED Christmas lights.  Not even half way through the first season, small sections of the string - about 10 bulbs or so - would go out, but the rest of the string was fine.  By the end of the season, all the LED sets had these ""burnt-out"" sections, some sets had more than one section out.  Second season of LEDs, we bought all new light sets and, within a week of being on the house, those sets have the same ""small section"" problem.  Needless to say, these LEDs are getting expensive fast and making me wonder if going back to the tried-and-true incandescent lights wouldn't be better.Fortunately, a friend mentioned this little light-fixing gadget to us, but the one he had was only for incandescent lights, not LEDs.  My wife and I searched all the local stores and couldn't find it the LED one, but Amazon came to the rescue.I'm not sure why we kept last year's ""bad"" LED light sets, but we did and I'm glad we did.  Less than 10 minutes after opening this gizmo, all of last year's ""bad"" sets are good as new!  The directions for this LED Keeper are easy to follow and the device is simple to use - and a real money-saver.The way it works is you plug the light set into this battery-powered tool and then follow the directions to figure out which bulb (or bulbs) is (are) at fault.  The problem is the cord isn't all that long, so you need an extension to test light sets that are already ""in place"" on the house.Nonetheless, it's a great tool!

"I was looking for a tripod mount to use with my phone when I stumbled across this gem.  In a word, ""awesome"".The ""tripod"" part has fully-articulated legs.  Each segment is attached with a ball-joint to the next segment, giving the legs quite a lot flexibility.  They can be wrapped around stuff, or just re-shaped to suit the surface on which you place it.At the top of the legs, there's a lockable quick-release mechanism for the ""head"" to rapidly be detached or re-attached.  This head has a typical tripod screw mount.The bracket that holds the phone has spring-loaded arms that hold the phone securely and can be folded down for easy transport - even on a keyring, if so desired.While the highly-articulated legs are great and give you possibilities limited only by your imagination, possibly the best feature is that the mounting screw is the standard size found on all tripods, meaning that you can take just the phone-holding bracket and attach it to any standard tripod, not just the gorillapod.  The only down-side is that my wife, the shutter-bug, is eying up stealing it to use with her phone so she doesn't have to haul the DSLR around!

"As far as I'm concerned, the Otterbox Defender, Griffin Survivor, and Lunatik Taktik are the best, ultra-protective cases on the market.  That being said, I ordered this particular case by accident.

The Tech21 Impact provides very nearly the same level of protection from bumps and drops as the Otterbox, but at a fraction of the size and less cost.  But, there is no integrated screen protector with the Tech21, so if that's important to you, stick with the Otterbox.

"This charger has so much ""juice"" that it's almost scary.I've been in the market for an external ""battery pack"" for those times a wall-charger is impractical or just not possible.  In my search, I found this beast and could not be happier.  It's now possible to recharge my iPad and my iPhone multiple times without needing an AC electrical outlet.  The freedom and possibilities are endless.As some other reviewers point out, yes, this unit does have some design oversights.  The power button is really way too easy to press, or get pressed in your bag, thereby wasting some of its power.  It is a little counter-intuitive to need to turn the unit on to charge it.  And I don't really have a need for a flashlight built into the unit, but I guess it's not so bad to have a backup light-source, just in case.Also, as some other reviewers note, you don't get to use the full ""claimed"" capacity.  This charger is rated as having 15,000mAh capacity, but you only get roughly 10,000mAh, or so, of use.  The included manual clearly states that about 30% of the stated capacity is lost to the voltage/current conversion and regulation that powers the USB ports.Recharge time from ""dead"" is definitely steep, but can be mitigated with a more powerful wall-charger.  Unfortunately, it does not come with a wall-charger.  Although you can use any USB port to recharge, if you're thinking about using the USB port on your computer, be prepared to spend a LONG TIME.  Most computer USB ports only supply 500mA, one third the minimum recommended by the manual - so that would take quite some time!  The best bet is probably an ""iPad"" type charger, if you've got one handy.Nonetheless, even with all these potential short-comings, this is still a stellar product and has a ""crazy"" amount of power packed into a relatively small package.  I'm only docking one star for all the negatives.Seriously, all the negatives aside, this thing is amazing!  It puts all others to shame and I have no reservation strongly recommending it to anyone.Also, if you're in the market for a VERY powerful wall-charger - which, by the way, will do an excellent job giving this unit a full charge - Anker provides a discount on some of their other products when you buy this one.  I took advantage of the offer and picked up their 36W/7.2A quad-port wall-charger (2 x 2.1A and 2 x 1.5A ports).  Any of the ports on that other ""monster"" will give this portable charger all the juice it needs for a ""speedy"" charge (albeit, ""speedy"" is relative - it's still at least ""overnight"" or more).The discount offer details are in the product description.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MALVHW1ETJSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5T3QK4#wasThisHelpful","R2MALVHW1ETJSY","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This LED color-changing strip is very bright; it can easily light a whole room, but it is dimmable with the remote control.With some basic soldering skills, cutting the strip (after every third LED) and inserting wires into the strip to allow bends or areas without light is a snap.  I'm lighting some small shelves with 3 LEDs at a time and while prepping and placing the 4-conductor wire extensions is somewhat slow and tedious, soldering them directly to the strip is a breeze.  If you don't feel comfortable soldering directly on the strip, various snap-on connectors and wiring kits are available.The rather minimal instruction sheet that was included leaves something to be desired, but it's not difficult at all to get the hang of setting colors, intensity, and do-it-yourself (DIY) shortcut buttons.Unlike some other reviewers, the unit I received did not have any ""mixed up"" colors on the remote (i.e. press green, but get red).  Mine worked perfectly right out of the package.I haven't used the adhesive backing on the strip yet, but have a hot-melt glue gun on standby in case the adhesive does not work out, as other reviewers have had mixed results with it.Overall, I'm very pleased with this light strip.

"I saw this sort of EL wire at RadioShack, but couldn't bring myself to spend $30+ (wire + battery box) on a ""novelty"" for which I have no specific purpose.  Buying on Amazon, though, I got more stuff for less than half the RadioShack price.The wire lights up brightly enough for dim/darker environments.  The light is not plainly visible in bright environments and is virtually invisible in sunlight.The wires have ""quick"" connectors, so it's easy to use one strand or the other or both as you see fit.  If only a single wire is connected, it does light up brighter than having both wires connected.The only down-side is that, as other reviewers noted, the battery pack emits a buzz/hum noise when it is turned on.  It's not very loud, and is easily masked by almost any other ambient sound or conversation.  But, it is noticeable in quieter settings.  If you intend to use it in a quiet environment, it's something to keep in mind.Since this battery box is boosting 3VDC to over 100VAC, so I suspected that you'd be hard-pressed to find one like this that doesn't make some sort of sound in the process.Overall, it's a good value for the money.For the really curious:  Being the techie that I am, I analyzed the hum quickly and found it's composed of several frequencies at around 2kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 9kHz, and 13kHz.  The predominant noise, by a wide margin, is the one around 4kHz.

The video shows two protective layers - one on the top side of the glass, one on the adhesive side.  My unit had only one protective layer - on the adhesive.This protector is awesome!  There is no discernable difference in screen clarity with it on and I see no evidence of it interfering with the front-facing camera.  It feels just like the actual screen, but can easily be replaced if it is ever damaged.  It's the perfect addition to the phone!The real disadvantage - and the only reason I subtracted a star - is that you only get one shot at installing it correctly.  If you've ever applied any screen protector to your iPhone, you know how tricky it can be to get the protector aligned perfectly.  Unlike plastic and vinyl films that can be taken off, reapplied, and otherwise adjusted to perfection, this protector allows only one chance at getting it right.  Once the adhesive side of the glass touches the screen, you're stuck with it for better or for worse.  Removing the protector can be done, but the perfectly transparent adhesive will be damaged in the process.For this reason, I went through several ""dry runs"" of installing this protector by leaving the protective backing on the adhesive while I went through the motions and practiced handling it with the included suction cup.  Once I was satisfied that I had a decent technique and a reasonable chance of getting it right, I did it for real.My efforts mostly paid off.  It's about 2mm away from perfect, but there's no way to adjust it without damaging the adhesive.  The perfectionist in me will learn to live with it.  The tiny misalignment is enough for my case to squeeze the corners, causing SLIGHT bubbles in the very corners, close to the edge.  There are no bubbles in the viewing area of the screen.The slightly imperfect application is a price I'm willing to pay for the touch and feel of real glass.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWNNFZG52MPRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BT8L2MW#wasThisHelpful","RWNNFZG52MPRU","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many others, I was wanting a way to use my iPhone-compatible earbuds with mic that have a 4 position (a.k.a. ""TRRS"") plug with my computer for Lync calls.  The issue being that the computer has two separate jacks for headphones and mic and can't use the TRRS plug on the earbuds.  For under $8 and free (Prime) shipping, this adapter was worth the gamble.As soon as the package arrived, I eagerly got to testing the adapter with my earbuds and made a Lync test call.

"I use this mic with my iPhone primarily for recording and it is surprisingly sensitive.  With the right recording app (the free Tascam PCM Recorder app works well) and the mic gain turned up, it can pick up a whisper so quiet that you couldn't even hear it without this.  It's also capable of recording loud sounds that would be well into the pain/hearing-damage threshold without distortion.Perhaps the best feature is the headphone adapter that's built-in, allowing real-time monitoring of what's being recorded.  Combining this feature with good noise-cancelling headphones allows you to hear ONLY what's being recorded. It's almost like having a recording studio with you.Since you can download a calibration profile specific to the mic's serial number, it's also a great mic for audio analysis and measurements.  It really comes in handy for some of the audio engineering in which I moonlight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCKLZWHJC6Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ADR2B84#wasThisHelpful","R2HCKLZWHJC6Y6","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pros:  Thick and substantial, hard to tell it's even there, great scratch protection, mild impact protection, tear off handles make it easy to apply without fingerprints.Cons:  seems to attract dust and fuzz like a magnet while you're trying to apply itI've used many different screen protectors over the years, but this is the best I've found.  The Wrapsol is thick and substantial but, unlike the Invisible Shield, it doesn't dramatically change the feel of the screen.When you first apply the protector, it will be virtually impossible to remove all of the air bubbles with the squeegy (included in the box).  Don't sweat it and be patient.  All but huge bubbles will work themselves out over a day or two.  I find that they work themselves out a little quicker if you keep the phone in your pants pocket with the protector pushed against your body-heat.  Still, though, it takes time.I'm not sure how I discovered this, but I figured out that if the protector is pretty close to the placement you wanted, but it could be a little more precise, it's possible to apply firm finger-tip pressure onto the surface of the protector and scoot it slightly it into place.  If the placement is off by quite a bit, you'd be better off peeling it back up and re-applying before tearing off the handles.  This sort of fine-tuning is very much like what you would do with a wet-application protector, but without the risks of intentionally spraying water on your device.The biggest drawback is that like most dry-application protectors, this one seems to attract dust, fuzz, hair, etc. like a magnet while you're trying to apply it.  It can be extraordinarily difficult to apply it and not find some dust or something trapped under the protector afterwords.  Depending on the size of the debris, you might just want to live with it.  Eventually, over time, the protector will form-fit itself to whatever is stuck underneath and it will be hardly noticeable.If you find a particularly large piece of debris or fuzz trapped under the protector, you may need to peel it back off.  If you've already removed the handles, scotch tape or similar helps and prevents damage to the protector.  Trying to ""pick"" the debris off with tweezers or fingernails will be virtually impossible.  At this point, you're best off washing the protector under running water with soap or dishwashing liquid.  Yes, I know, you're thinking that would wash the adhesive off it, but it doesn't - it works.  Just shake it thoroughly to dry.  Don't try to use a cloth or towel or you'll be worse off than you were before.  There will probably be a few tiny water droplets still on the adhesive side when you reapply it to your device, but you should be able to squeegy them out.  When using the squeegy, be sure that you have some sort of protective layer between the squeegy and the screen protector or else the protector can be scratched by the squeegy.Wrapsol proudly proclaims this screen protector to provide some impact protection.  Conceptually, I can understand that, but I wouldn't go tossing your device around willy nilly - even with the protector, the screen is not indestructible.All in all, Wrapsol makes a great product and I would strongly recommend this screen protector for your iPhone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GY449X4RT75X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MBOZRW#wasThisHelpful","R2GY449X4RT75X","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:  Extreme protection, innovative mute/silence switch mechanism, feels good in the hands, access to all ports and functionsCons:  Adds some bulk, no screen protector, and 6 screws deter quick-and-easy case changes, headphone opening is a bit smallI picked up this case for my new iPhone 5S and it is awesome.  I previously used a Taktik Extreme on my iPhone 4S and although Lunatik is coming out with an Extreme for the 5S, it will cover the TouchID sensor, rendering the sensor useless - a compromise between protection and functionality I'm not willing to make.  This case has no integrated screen protector, so none of the phones's functions are hindered in any way - including the TouchID - but, the screen could be vulnerable to being scratched.  Mitigating this potential risk is the fact that the screen is ""recessed"" by about 4mm by the bezels.  Nonetheless, I also added a Wrapsol Ultra Xtreme screen protector to the phone.The case has 3 main parts: the front bezel, back bezel, and silicone impact truss.  The phone sits in the impact truss, which is then sandwiched between the bezels, providing impact and drop protection far above and beyond that of most other cases I've found.  The bezels are held together by 6 small hex-head screws.  The case comes with a tool to fasten the screws.  The included tool is adequate, but is pretty small for my large hands.  A precision screw driver set with a larger handle is my preferred tool.  If you lose a screw, the case comes with one spare.  If you need more than one spare, Lunatik may provide replacements.  Otherwise, the information about the screw specifications can be a little hard to come by, so I'll tell you here:  Metric 1.5mm socket head, M2 thread, 8mm length, 0.4mm pitch (black from heat-treating).  A box of 100 screws (plenty to share with friends and family) will cost you about $12 from McMaster-Carr (part # 91290A015) and are indistinguishable from the original screws.Since the case is screwed together, getting the phone in and out of it takes some work - it's not the sort of thing you'll do on a whim.  On the other hand, I don't want to take the phone in and out of the case often, so it's not a problem for me.Unlike the Griffin Survivor, this case slips easily in and out of my pockets without turning the pockets inside out.  Also unlike most other cases, rather than cut-outs for the volume and mute switches, there are form-fitting buttons molded into the impact truss and the mute control slides up or down to actuate the switch.  In the Taktik Extreme for 4S, the mute control ""lever"" (for lack of better word) was quite a bit longer, making it easy to actuate accidentally while in your pocket.  In this Taktik Strike, the control is *just* long enough to provide its function and accidental movement is virtually eliminated.Many people complain about the narrow headphone and sync/charge port openings, so if you're thinking about this case, be warned that - like all the Lunatik cases - the openings are pretty slim.  It fits the standard Apple headphone and lightning cables, but after-market headphones (and to a lesser extent, lightning cables) are a hit-or-miss proposition.Despite any potential shortcoming of this case, the level of protection is second to none.  If anything, it might be a little overkill, but if you're worried about dropping your phone, this case will let you rest easy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2Q8SY0AGEL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9AS82C#wasThisHelpful","R3I2Q8SY0AGEL8","A2ZR86VINKXV7J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZR86VINKXV7J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My dog walks well on her leash 99% of the time (loose leash, right beside me)... the other 1% she totally flips out. This of course seems to happen when I'm walking her and pushing a stroller and we're crossing a busy intersection. I have almost lost her and she has knocked me down a few times. With the head collar on I can shorten her leash and when the going gets ""ruff"" she is forced to walk right by me looking almost straight ahead. We can walk past herds of corgis, dozens of squirrels, gigantic dogs that could leap their fence if they really wanted, etc.The best things:She will suddenly back up to get out of normal collars and harnesses, the buckle on this collar means if she does get it off (she did the first time we tried it out) she is still stuck with me on the end of a leash.She's learning she doesn't get to host a super awesome surprise party every time she sees another dog. Instead all she gets to do is huff a little while looking at them through the corner of her eye. This is awesome for me. At first she would try as hard as she could to get out of the head collar so she could really start up the act but now it's not such a big deal because there is no exciting reward for acting like an idiot.People mistake her head collar for a muzzle.

Anime, video games, quite a few halloween stickers that were OK. There were some stickers that weren't duplicates but they were of the same thing. Like two different stickers of the superhero guy or two pictures of different lips. Some seemed like they were designed for a discount child's product or show that fell through. About 15 of them were just painfully dull, like a red t-shirt or a stock photo of a film reel - three different line drawings on a beige background.

"I have this at the top of the stairs with a banister on the right and a wall on the left.  I had a pressure gate (with caps screwed into the walls) at our old house but didn't want to use it at the new house.Our banister is slightly wobbly and sits ever so slightly back from the top step, so we couldn't put pressure on the banister and we couldn't use a gate that had to go straight from the banister to the wall because there would be a gap between the step and gate. I also did not want a gate with a bar across the bottom because I don't want a tripling hazard at the top of the stairs.This gate doesn't have the bar on the bottom, it can be installed at an angle, and it doesn't use pressure to stay put. I also did not have to drill into the wood post. It is also taller than our old pressure gate and does not provide any footholds for climbing.It was a little tricky to install (the pictures were not helpful at all because the grays blended together) and I could not get the bubbles level without putting the gate at a bizarre tilt (could be my house). The plastic pins probably won't last forever and the handle you squeeze to release the main pin is probably going to be the first thing to break. The banister padding is held on with cheap velcro and these thin clips that keep coming unclipped (and the kids love trying to undo the clips and velcro which does not help). It is also quite an eyesore with the velcro sticking off the chunks of padding, the hunks of plastic screwed into the wall, and the skinny wobbly looking white bars. But it keeps my kids upstairs where most other gates would fail so I would buy the same gate again if I needed to replace it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUPOP6O625TFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNKLI4#wasThisHelpful","RUPOP6O625TFL","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I tried looking online for suggestions or refills and it seems the company is very aware of the refill issue and has no intention of selling dye packets. I wasn't able to find anyone who came up with a replacement - you just have to use regular food coloring which doesn't produce the same results.It was easy for the older kids (5 and up) to use but a little too difficult for a three year old - the first push is the hardest and it works best if you are able to get a little momentum going.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KFODO6R1CFIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOEOMS2#wasThisHelpful","R1KFODO6R1CFIX","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cards are good quality, artwork is charming and thoughtfully executed. Kind of whimsical. Every card has a TIDY hand-drawn look to it and the face cards all have wild animals on them (each suit is a different area: jungle, arctic, grasslands, swamp).The box is pretty fancy, too. Soft matte paper, embossed. Like a nice wedding invitation.I casually collect cards (over 40 decks) and this is my favorite deck overall. I like the look, love the fact that the face AND number cards are ""special"" without adding distractions.An explanation: Some decks only change the backs and jokers, some change the face cards but don't try anything with the rest of them.

"When I took it off of the box I have to say I was surprised! I am aware of how much I paid for this hat and was still surprised. Maybe you've bought a hat from a dollar store and you think you're prepared for this hat. No.If one person were responsible for assembling and shipping this hat I would have to assume that person doesn't like hats or children and seriously did not care about what happened after the hat went in the box. (Note: I do feel sorry for whoever made this hat and I'm sure they aren't child-haters.)The hat arrived in a perfect looking box, so this isn't about shipping. Some of the straw was damaged (wrinkled looking and flaking) but I was expecting a little of that.So, here's my beef with the hat:The star on the front was glued on crooked and off-center by about an inch. The strings were put in crooked. The narrow strip of ""fabric"" around the inside of the is hat is wrinkled and crushed - and I'm not even sure why it's there. It's paper thin and doesn't appear absorbent. (I took pictures of this since it's difficult to describe.) Since that band inside the hat is crushed it makes the hat more uncomfortable than it would be without it, so it isn't there to protect the head from the hat. It doesn't appear to be adding any stability to the hat.The brim is curved all the way around instead of dipping in the front so it looks goofy on anyone wearing it (even babies!), it's also crooked and I can't fix it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YTJGHM3J9827/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZL9AE0#wasThisHelpful","R1YTJGHM3J9827","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not officially used these yet, but decided to do a review to share additional information about the product.Color: I'm getting them for a children's birthday party and I was hoping they would be the color shown in the picture (bright blue and yellow). Not a big deal, just would have been better colors. The picture on the box was of red and blue horse shoes, inside the box were red and black horseshoes (two red, two black). Twist ties were difficult to undo - have wire cutters ready if you don't like dealing with difficult ties.Material: hard glossy plastic, I assumed they would be thinner and more flexible but they probably work better this way.Injury potential: I wouldn't want to get nailed in the face with one but I think kids could throw them at each other (we all have the uncle who starts it) and not do any serious damage. Like frizbees.Stakes - Two pieces that connect together: red stake and white pole. Hollow plastic. Stake end is cut at an angle to create a tapered point. The tip of the point has been cut off so they aren't sharp. Might want to use something else if you have hard dirt, I may as well try putting them through concrete.I wasn't sure what I was going to get, but after examining them I think they're going to be pretty fun.

"Bought this a couple years ago for a hallway. It has to be adjusted ""just so"" in order to remain both upright and operable. I was readjusting it every few days to keep it in that range. Too tight and the door wouldn't open, too loose and it would get knocked out of place or just completely fall over with a little pressure. I had a bench against it for awhile so it wouldn't fall over if it was leaned on by my toddler. After a few months I decided to just keep it adjusted too tight and stepped over it instead of bothering with the door.Generally rattly, wobbly, unstable. Definitely more of a deterrent than anything else (can't trust the thing, definitely wouldn't use it above stairs).Guests had no problem with our other gates but this one was confusing people and getting knocked out of place.

"I don't think the reflection is all that distorted - it's good enough to use to apply eyeliner (if you're planning on doing that with it...). Since it's a ""soft"" mirror I could see where some would be worse than others though, and if it's squished a little it's going to get distorted.It is easily scratched - when I tried to wipe it with a piece of soft flannel it covered the mirror in scratches. Akin to dragging scrunched up aluminum foil across a CD. That happened maybe three hours after we got it so that was pretty disappointing. The scratches aren't very deep but the mirror obviously isn't going to take a lot of abuse, I don't see it faring very well against a baby old enough to grab it or bang toys on it.Otherwise, it's cute enough and babies do like mirrors. I don't have a problem with it falling over on the floor because the velcro sticks to the carpet we have. Cheaper than other mirrors, safer than a glass one.

"I like to use screen protectors, this is the fifth or sixth one I've used. I am not happy with it.For some reason this particular one seems to hold more oil than any of the others.  I have pretty clean, dry hands and I don't eat while I'm using my Nexus. It still quickly became a situation where I was pushing grease around on the screen. I even double checked the screen protector on my phone to make sure I wasn't imagining things. The one of my phone feels more slick and snappy while this one is a little more ""gummy"" or rubbery. Less like glass, more like a glossy photograph.It isn't the exact right size for the screen. I know they aren't going to fit perfectly but this one is too far off for how much it cost combined with the fact that it claims to be specifically for the 7"" Nexus Tablet.I did have to use the second screen protector because I (like other reviewers) picked at the corners trying to peel off the third layer. The film seems thick enough to have another layer involved.I'll give it two stars because it's not bad enough to give up and throw it away. It will do what it's supposed to do and protect the screen.

"I previously owned a baby gym with a single bar that was attached to the mat with velcro. The bar and mat were pretty floppy (and cheaply padded) and my baby was able to take the bar down with a firm grab/kick. When I washed it, it got lumpy and curled up along the edges. Awful thing.This one, however, is very sturdy. The bars aren't going to fall over or collapse, they are able to hold up quite a few toys and get jostled around. It's regularly abused by an older child (over 40lbs) and bounces right back. I've already washed it (the mat, not the bars) once and it still looks like new. The toys are all cute and provide a wide variety of play methods. My son (that it's meant for) is only a month old and likes to lay on the mat and look around. I'm confident he'll like it even more as he learns new skills.Also, I bought this back in February on sale and didn't open it until July.

"I had purchased one of those cushioned removable potty-training seats but it meant for a round seat and would shift back and forth when my son sat on it, resulting in his refusal to use it. Not good. I have a built-in seat on the basement toilet (spent less than ten bucks for it at a hardware store, on sale) and I thought it was great, but I couldn't find anything similar for the elongated toilet.This one cost a lot more than the other, and it is better in some ways and worse in some ways.PROS:- The cheaper seat is thin plastic, this one is more solid and doesn't seem like it will bend or crack if it's ever put to the test.- The potty seat on the cheap seat is held onto the lid with clips, so it's a little harder to put the seat down or clip it back on. This one is held to the lid with a magnet - it stays up when you want it to, and it is really easy for a little kid to put it down.CONS:- At least on our toilet, if you have the lid and the seats up, the adult seat will suddenly fall down with a BANG. I don't mind the seat being down, but I'm sure it wouldn't be a pleasant surprise for it to fall down while someone was using it.- The adult seat isn't plastic. It's a nice, solid seat - but the ""high gloss finish"" is cracking/wrinkling up (so far it is just underneath the seat). It isn't enough to see any wood, but it isn't pleasant and I am looking forward to replacing the seat when we no longer need it for potty training. I've had it about six months.- The ""easy clean and change"" hinges... WHY?!? In order to lift up the child seat I have to put the lid down, let the magnets connect, and then lift the lid up again. If I try to put the child seat up by lifting it up the way you would normally lift a toilet seat, it pops right off (it's easy for kids to pop off, too). I don't see how removing the seat makes it easier to clean, I don't normally take off adult-sized seats to clean them. Am I supposed to be putting the child seat in the dishwasher or something?Overall: Three stars. It has some things about it I don't like but it is functional.Almost a year later: My son spilled punch on the seat and it stained a ring around one side of the adult seat. I have tried a few things and it's here to stay. If I scrubbed it with anything abrasive it would damage the paint (paint on the bottom of the seat is a testament to this). The magnet in the child seat fell off, never to be seen again. Screws on the right side fell out leaving behind stripped holes. Seat has become an unsanitary eyesore and I am on here looking for a different one.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EY4296S38VDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00596IFY8#wasThisHelpful","R3EY4296S38VDW","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son had thwarted every other ""child safety lock"" I tried. He either figures it out or destroys it with his Hulk strength. Even the pricey magnetic ones that are a pain to install. So the only place I can store things in his room is in his closet, which has sliding doors.I know some children have broken this lock, but it's been up for a few months and I think he's given up on it (he did break the actual door by laying on the floor and kicking it in, I fixed/reinforced the door and he *still* has not gotten past the kidco lock).Some tips:- He can tear off anything mounted on foam tape in a matter of seconds, and if I screwed it down he would figure out how to push down the tabs (or he'd just break them off). So I put it well out of his reach. That's kind of a given.- The other thing I did was to take the knobs off and make sure the closet door was flush against the door frame when locked. If he was able to pull a handle or wedge his fingers between the frame and the door he'd just pull with all of his weight and break the lock off that way. With it flush against the wall he doesn't have any leverage.- I don't open the closet door with him watching. I don't know if he's really ever noticed the lock, but he hasn't tried pushing a chair/stool over to the door to reach it so I'm not going to point it out. If we're both in his room and he wants something out of there I just tell him ""it's locked"" and I open it when he isn't paying attention. If your child is really insistent on getting into the closet, pretend your child is a detective and the closet is full of evidence that will put you away for a long time. ""It's locked, maybe if you turn around for a second or leave the room it will mysteriously open.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM6SMTC7BHPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004B1N6ZU#wasThisHelpful","R2BM6SMTC7BHPR","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not careful with my phone (keep it loose in my purse with keys and things, throw it on the counter, drop it on the floor, I have a toddler who runs off with it sometimes, etc.) and the cover still looks about the same as it did when I got it. Stands up well to abuse. The quality of the illustration is nice - it's sharp looking.I'm not crazy about the overall quality of the cover in other ways... the bare gray plastic edges are pretty noticeable up close. Not so cool. It is also bulky, and part of it will occasionally pop off - although not very often. If you made a habit of taking the cover off/catching the edges of the cover on things you would surely break the delicate tabs.UPDATE: I tried to throw onto a counter from a hospital bed and managed to hit the counter and then the tile floor with the phone. It put a 1/2"" crack in the corner of the back cover and the front cover popped off, but I clipped the front cover back on and didn't notice the damage to the back cover until the other day. I might end up supergluing it so the crack doesn't grow any larger. Phone is fine!Add. UPDATE: Broke after dropping it again.

"I used to own a Canon A95 and a Fujifilm J10. I replaced the A95 with a Powershot SX20IS. After I dropped the Fujifilm and broke the lens (whoops), I replaced it with this Canon A2200. I bought it on sale, and with an employee discount and I am still dissapointed with it. It isn't bad because it's an inexpensive camera, it's just bad. I don't trust the Canon name anymore.Even in ideal lighting conditions most pictures turn out awful. The other day I took my son out to the zoo. It was really nice out - sunny, but not too bright. I thought I could trust the A2200.First picture (auto mode): the lighter colors are washed out (with white patches, even), the rest of the colors are muddled. Fuss with the settings a bit - my son's pink cheeks are blotchy red, his jeans are neon blue. Fuss with them a little more - his face is either bright white or bright pink, his hair is either gray or dark brown with a funny looking ""crown"" of reflected light. He is either frozen by an overly-aggressive flash, or he looks like a grainy blur. I finally fuss with it enough to get a really fantastic looking picture (as good as I would NORMALLY get with any of my other/previous cameras) and the next ten pictures I take look overexposed.

"The quality is good for the price. I was not fond of the menu, but the pictures turned out pretty well most of the time.I had mine for a couple years. I got it while my regular camera - a Canon A95 - was getting repaired (can't miss a month of baby pictures).I liked the small size - similar to a deck of cards. I ended up dropping it on my porch while the lens was out, and that's what killed it. My fault. It took pretty good pictures. I always had to use the flash (unless it was outdoors on a very bright day). I was happy with most of the pictures it took - the colors were not entirely accurate, all of them were ""warm"" but they weren't washed out and they weren't blurry (so long as I used the flash). I have a Canon PowerShot SX20IS and a Canon PowerShot A2200 - and, on the fly, this camera takes much better pictures than either of them. (With a lot of set up, the SX20IS takes much better pictures, but the auto mode is junky - it cost 3x the J10).The similarly priced A2200 takes abysmal pictures.

It was ~2010 at this point, and I went out and bought a ""better"" camera (Canon Powershot SX20IS) and although the camera had better features - I got better pictures out of the Canon A95.

"Both of my grandparents had campers, and after I put these up I was struck with a pang of familiarity... these are totally camper curtains. Stiff, woven polyester with a white liner on the back.

"I've had this for a couple years now. My son likes it a lot. I'm not crazy about it.- There is no way to keep the sand and water separate - I realize that's a ""no duh"" thing but there really is no point to having a divided table. The whole table will be soupy wet sand in no time. Even if you have a very careful child the sand and water will get mixed up when they pour sand/water through the funnels. The wet sand is a mess and it takes awhile to dry out. I just put sand in both sides and I don't intentionally add water.- The cover is not waterproof. When it rains, the table gets an inch or so of water in it and the cover protects the rainwater from sun... so the water just sits in there. Heating up. In the dark. With dead bugs in it. There are drain plugs on the bottom of the table, but they are under the sand. If there is a lot of standing water I tip the table over to dump out the water (and a bunch of sand). Word of warning: I sewed a layer of vinyl underneath it. Don't do that, the moisture trapped between the two layers isn't a good thing. Eventually the cover blew away (I'd put it under one of the legs while the sand was drying out). Now I just keep the table in a sunny spot on the porch and it is usually dry (has some debris mixed in, but it's dry).- The cover does not protect the table from insects. They can get in from the sides, and there is also a big hole in the center of the table (like for an umbrella).- Don't put gravel in the table. I bought a bag of sandbox sand thinking ""sand is sand"". The chunks were too big to go through the funnels and the trays were a muddy mess.- Sand in the table isn't great either. I cleaned out the gravel and bought a bag of play sand (very fine, neon colored) that works with the funnels, but it also clogs up the moving parts. The wheels on the cars don't turn, the spinners don't spin, the tippy thing is jammed.- Rice works okay (had the table indoors for awhile), but then you can't use water.- Water-only provides optimal performance, but then you don't have a sandbox. If you don't have a bathtub or room for a kiddy pool this table would be great for playing in the water.My son still likes the table a lot. Compared to a regular sandbox it's smaller, and it's raised. So it can sit in the corner of a small porch, it's pretty easy to move around, you don't have to buy as much sand (I bought a couple bags, used half a bag to fill the table and so I have plenty of extra sand to replace/restore), and your kid(s) won't be sitting in a pile of sand (although they can still dump it on themselves). My son likes the funnels and cars, and moving sand from one side to the other.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R8NANH957WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00439HF2A#wasThisHelpful","R23R8NANH957WR","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was worried when I picked up the box because it was so light, but I was pleasantly surprised. This mattress is firm. And when I say firm, I don't mean to say that it is hard... it is more like the foam is very dense.

"I'm a cashier, I've seen a lot of bags. If you want your bags filled fast and well - these are much better than the flimsy windbreaker-fabric bags. Whenever someone has those bags, they fumble around trying to unfold them (a lot of times they are folded/wadded up into pouches), and then they are difficult to fill because they don't stand up on their own. It takes longer, it's sloppier, and since the bags don't have a square bottom everything gets crushed together when the bag is picked up.Compared to the reusable bags sold by Walmart/Target/etc. these are bigger - they are also tall and narrow. If you are going to get a lot of large boxy things (toys, cereal, paper towels, kleenex boxes) these bags would be a great size. They would be too big for a lot of yogurt/baby food/makeup sized items.These bags are well made (they are not too stiff, not too soft - sewn well - reinforced seams), the reason I'm not giving them five stars is because they don't have the little loop (so the bagging person can hang them on the plastic bag holder to keep the bag up and open so they can fill it up better/faster) and they don't have an insert in the bottom. Most reusable bags like this have a rectangle of plastic that fits in the bottom - which I think is pretty important. Let's say you put a bunch of cans in the bag... if the bottom of the bag is just fabric, everything is going to move and squish together when the bag is picked up. I'm going to put some plastic canvas in the bottom of mine. Another option would be wrapping cardboard up in duck tape (so it doesn't get wet).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KD0PWPPG7PB3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004MNHZE0#wasThisHelpful","R1KD0PWPPG7PB3","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The book read like a magazine article for ""finding the perfect swimsuit for your body type"" - I wasn't surprised to read that the author has a background in fashion magazines.While reading the first few chapters, I determined that this is typical fashion B.S. To say that there are three ""types"", and plus size versions of those three types - is idealized (to put it lightly). I didn't fit neatly into one of the three categories - a lot of women probably don't. I could see where someone up in the clouds of the industry would believe that. About half of the clothes for my ""type"" (or at least the one I thought I was closest to) are things I would NOT look good in - e.g. short shorts, pencil skirts, and halter tops. After taking out the things recommended for taller women, I was left with some no-duh things that anyone could wear. Things that I already wear.Some advice was solid, but I found myself scoffing more than nodding. The absolute worst part was the bra section. I know a thing or two about bra fitting - and this section was totally off.After disregarding the $$$ stores, body shaping undergarments, and tailoring (because: no.)... I wasn't left with much. I wanted to look a little more put-together, and this book was incredibly unhelpful in that regard.And I agree with others who have rated before me, this book would have been much more helpful with some pictures, preferably of real people with the body types wearing the clothes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KSLRIDVPAZTK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592400418#wasThisHelpful","R1KSLRIDVPAZTK","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have a basketball, a small soccer ball, a bouncy red ball, a big yoga ball, smaller plastic balls with bells and rattles in them, a ball with liquid and glitter in it, and I think there is a tennis ball around here somewhere. This ball is by far the favorite ball.Out of all of the toys we have, this is easily one of the top five. And it is sure to remain a favorite, as it isn't necessarily a ""baby"" toy. His uncles were over and they were downstairs throwing it at each other for a long time, and they are all over 20. People are kind of drawn to it, I've noticed. They want to toss it around. It's weird looking. I'm sure if I left it in the yard someone would take it.As for toddlers: The ball is easy to hold on to, it is light, brightly colored (ours is orange) and translucent, it is the perfect size, and due to the bumps it can suddenly change direction while rolling (which makes it a little more exciting than other balls).

"My son is a little over a year old, and can get on and off the toy but hasn't figured out how to move on it yet. I can sort of push him while he is on it, although I have to be really careful about holding up his feet. There isn't a lot of room between the wheels for dangling feet or for big steps.The vroom-vroom noise is fun, and so is the honking. I could do without the super-cheery singing voice button and I'd pry it off with a screwdriver if my son didn't like it so much. He likes to sit on the four wheeler and push the buttons with a big grin on his face.It doesn't ""do"" tight corners, although it can make wide turns just fine.

"I'm not certain that this chair is the exact same one I have. Mine doesn't have the basket/net thing in the back, but it is Winnie the Pooh and has the same fabric, shape, and honey pot.I've had this highchair for about five months or more, and it has been working out pretty well. It is roomy and comfortable, and the coloring is attractive. I don't like character-themed baby gear, but the Pooh bear stitched into the seat is actually kind of pleasant looking. The honey pot attaches underneath the tray and is easily removed. It was a bit of a distraction.I like that you can (easily) tilt the back of the seat, and move the seat up higher or lower on the legs, although the lowest setting on ours isn't usable (it doesn't connect correctly). It was that way out of the box, and I probably should have just returned it, but didn't want to bother since I bought it on clearance and it was pretty difficult to put together.As for the buckles, my son really hates being strapped in once he realizes he can't stand up in the chair, and so the buckles have been put through quite a bit of stress. The buckles are fine. They're set up similar to seat belt buckles. I removed the straps that went over the shoulders (that is an option). I haven't had any issues with the lap belt, and I'd say the belt was just fine.I can take the tray off with one hand, rinse it off, and snap it back on - that has saved me a lot of trouble.The fabric on the seat isn't waterproof, so it starts looking dirty when baby food soaks into it. It is a little difficult to take the cover off, and the straps are also difficult to remove and replace. I have never been able to completely clean the fabric by wiping it down, but it comes out of the washer spot free. Most of the chairs I looked at had this same fabric.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BE3LQIOBZNNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00153ZBO6#wasThisHelpful","R2BE3LQIOBZNNX","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS: When I tried to switch my son to bottles, it took a few months of frustration before I found these. He was having a hard time tipping the bottle back to drink out of it, and it was just horrible. Months of this went by, making zero progress, and then I bought him a cup with a straw to try out. He loved it. That was the last day of nursing, ever. So, 10 stars out of 5 for this cup so far.CONS:  We've had this cup for awhile now, I've gotten picky about it, so we're down to 3 out of 5 stars. It is still a good cup, I still use our cups all the time and would buy another one. BUT...I've always had issues with cleaning it. I use a bottle brush for the bottom part and lid. The bottle brush cleans out the bottle just fine, but the lid is full of nooks and crannies. I think I'm cleaning it out really well (scrubbing, hot water, soap) and then I notice some accumulated grime in part of the lid - the horror! The straw is another frustrating cleaning issue. I bought pipe cleaners to clean out the straw portion, which is a little gross to me, but there isn't a better way to do it. Milk will sometimes collect and dry along the edges of the outside of the lid, and that takes a second to blast clean with the dish sprayer. The straw will discolor when dark juice is used (even though I water it down a great deal) and so the straw is stained. We have two of these cups, and every night after my son goes to bed I have to take some time to thoroughly clean both of them out. The straw is difficult to thread back through the lid, but since I've been doing it awhile it barely takes a second to get it through - you get the hang of it. You just have to twist it through, and give it a little tug. I forget about it being an issue, but I remember the first time I couldn't get it back in I thought for sure I ruined the cup.It leaks a little bit. When it was new it didn't, but the valve inside the straw cracks a little right away, and so it leaks if the cup is left on its side (or upside down in the diaper bag). There is a little piece of plastic on the inside that goes over a little vent, and it helps if you have the plastic firmly over the vent like it is supposed to be. And, it does leak while upright. If I have a lot of milk in the bottle (formula and whole milk both did this) it will somehow manage to ""leak"" while the bottle is upright. I've watched it happen. If you have the lid closed the leaking isn't really an issue.I wasn't aware that it was any kind of choking hazard (like it says on the page). My son is pretty destructive and has had it since he was about 9 months old (he is over a year old now), and it hasn't ever been an issue.The cups have been dropped many (many, many) times and one of them did break when it hit the floor, and the cup had only been used a few times. It cracked on the bottom, and had to be thrown away. It only happened once, and it was in the kitchen. I would have been pretty upset if it happened in a store or elsewhere - then we would have a big mess and no bottle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H8SOK40M121S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LK6KOO#wasThisHelpful","R1H8SOK40M121S","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son is a little over a year old, and has had it for maybe four months or so. He doesn't get bonkers about it, but he does like the music and he likes to have it in his crib and in the car. He sleeps with it and when he wakes up in the middle of the night he turns on the ""bedtime music"" by himself and falls back asleep. I think it is really great for that reason alone - especially when we're away from home. I think it is a toy that he will have and enjoy for a long time.I like that you can pick music out on the website, and change what the dog says.Cons...It has gotten a little grungy looking despite my attempts to keep it clean, but it isn't that big of a deal. It looks well-loved.It isn't annoying (we had another, similar puppy that was pretty obnoxious and not nearly as lovable), but it is cheerful to the point where it is a little unnerving - like the little girls in The Shining. It would be nice if it had even more music to chose from, and if the ADD-INS weren't so STAGED sounding (My favorite color is... RED, is that you're favorite, too?).

"When I think of toys with bright, primary colors and music - it brings to mind words/phrases like ""annoying"", ""obnoxious"", ""overly pleasant"", or perhaps ""dorky looking"". This guitar is not any of those things. It makes other toys seem *condescending*.My son got this for his first birthday, and it was a big hit. He likes his grandpa's guitars, so it was important that a toy guitar for him had strings on it. He likes to pluck the strings, and hit the buttons - and he didn't even notice any of the other toys after we opened this one. It has been a couple months, and he still plays with it all the time - he dances and rocks back and forth like he his having the best time of his life. He hugs it. We haven't had to change the batteries yet.The songs aren't irritating (no peppy voices), it has two volume levels, and it lights up in an attractive/cool manner.I let him play around with the keyboard version in the store, and I think it would be as good as the guitar.The only negative thing I can think of, is that the sticker is getting grungy looking. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the toy, so it really isn't a big deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TU5LUT81IAM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E6UJLY#wasThisHelpful","R2TU5LUT81IAM8","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is really easy to install rear-facing, and a little trickier to install forward-facing. I wouldn't recommend trying to install it the first time in a hurry, or while sleep-deprived, but once you figure it out it is easy-peasy to do again. The seat is sturdy and seems to be very safe and well-made. I think it was well worth the price, and as a concerned new parent it was very comforting to get this seat in the mail, after considering seats in the store that weren't as nice. I remember going back in my son's room quite a bit before he was born, and every time I went in there I would look over this seat with a feeling of accomplishment. Yeah, that is pretty goofy, but aside from his crib it was the nicest/most expensive thing we bought when getting everything ready for the baby. It, unlike a bunch of other baby products we bought, was not something I regret buying.I've had to fuss around with the buckles and other parts as my son has grown out of one setting or another, and I've had to take it apart to clean it out a couple times. Nothing was difficult to do. It all comes apart and goes back together without a lot of trouble, and nothing comes apart when it isn't supposed to. I've been using it for about a year now.I started off with a (hand-me-down) infant-style seat when my son was first born, and definitely prefer this seat. I think it is a lot more comfortable than the infant seat we had, and I think my son felt the same way (he wasn't as fussy about being put in it). For the same amount of money you could get two cheap seats - one for an infant, and one for a toddler, or you could get one seat that does both jobs, is easy to use, and that is worthy of admiration.For an infant, you might want to get one of those c-shaped pads for supporting the head while the baby sleeps. Some seats come with it, this one doesn't, but they sell them just about everywhere and they aren't expensive.I did have to cut the instruction book out (it is attached inside the seat with a short cord) so I could read it and install the seat at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LM341WGTGX95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000PGB0MQ#wasThisHelpful","R2LM341WGTGX95","AE3FV83ZN6IH0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE3FV83ZN6IH0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Aside from the Tokidoki signature heart and crossbones and the black branding tag on the side, the graphic is Hello Kitty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y8KNVOUC2DYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6T9LI4#wasThisHelpful","R2Y8KNVOUC2DYU","AWNQ2PULUBHDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNQ2PULUBHDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was able to order this gift with purchase from Sanrio (which has been offered twice in the last few weeks, so keep an eye out!) and I have to say that I am in LOVE with this set! There is also a similar My Melody set of pastel chopsticks offered on the site, and both designs retail for eighteen dollars.

"This luggage tag was available as a free gift with purchase from Sanrio online.  The retail on these Tokidoki tags is thirteen dollars on the price tag, and I have to say given the size (about 5.75"" from the top of the ears to the feet), weight, and detail make the tag worth it!  While I wouldn't trust the tag to survive TSA and the rough handling of checked airline bags, this definitely works great for a carry-on, backpack, golf or gym bag, etc. The name and address portion is VERY small, so you might want to consider printing any info on a label and then sticking that onto the back of the tag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3PDIP4UXCQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3Y0ZU4#wasThisHelpful","R3F3PDIP4UXCQ3","AWNQ2PULUBHDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNQ2PULUBHDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son had been eyeing this Hot Wheels set for months and finally received it for his birthday. He still loves this and uses all of his cars, not just the color shifters. The set itself is a decent size and breaks down into separate components for storage. The ""elevator"" and dunk tank are fairly easy to maneuver. No the (expensive) color shifter cars aren't the best at changing, but it's a neat detail. Other big box stores offer this set with up to five extra cars, but we were able to stock up during a buy two get one sale at our local supermarket.

"This Gearonic flip case (""wallet"") is very basic and honestly at this low price, that's all I'm really asking for. I need something to protect my entire iPhone 6, and I don't want to shell out a fortune for it since I tend to swap out my cases alot. This has a white shell for the back which holds the phone securely in place (so secure that it's a bit difficult getting the phone back out), and a magnetic tab closure for the 'cover.' Except for the volume buttons and those on the front screen, all other ports and buttons are unobstructed when this cover is closed. The stand feature (really just breaking the inner cardboard) messes the clean lines of the case, BUT again as this so low cost it isn't a big deal for me. Good extra coverage for those times when I carry my phone in my back pocket, GREAT for added insulation when it's cold out, the stand makes this perfect when traveling, and the best thing is that Amazon fulfilled this directly. Yay.EDIT: Why didn't I realize that the magnet could be a problem?!?! While leaving my phone in this case, there have been a few times when the battery was drained overnight (phone was left on at almost a full charge, then was completely dead upon waking up with NO apps, wifi, or 4G running in the background). I've taken it out of the case, and the battery percentage has remained steady. My diy fix was putting stickers where the magnet pieces meet.

"This MyBat case is pretty, visually very cool. Super slim design and all the buttons and ports are unobstructed. And while I don't think this case provides anything more than a back cover, it's definitely eye catching (especially against the gold) and better than nothing. The plastic itself is actually slick - super stiff and very unforgiving. If you pull it off too quickly, it will likely crack. The curves at the top and bottom are just a tad bit sharp so you should definitely be careful when changing this cover.

"Love this wallet! The white and yellow is a super bright, very cheery color combo. The overall size is more compact than other wallets, but still holds cards, your cash, and even your iPhone 6 (a bit snug tho)!! I've used this for the last few months and that new leather scent is still there. Because I fold the wristlet and Coach hangtag inward, the yellow is becoming discolored right at that edge. And although the card slots are also a bit snug, in general this is still a great everyday piece!EDIT: I still love this wallet, but it still has yet to soften after months of use.

"I purchased this purple set from Sam's about six months ago and used them for grilling, when pulling a pizza out of the oven, etc. I used only these last month for Thanksgiving food prep and they definitely saved my skin from a few painful burns when roasting the turkey. I'm a decent cook, and I mostly use cast iron in my oven... so inevitably accidents will happen on occasion. These mitts don't ""fit like a glove,"" and they're not supposed to anyway.

"Compared to the previous two albums, the 2.0 editions are definitely enhanced - bigger (twice the space, because there are now more discs being released), much sturdier (this feels like a REAL album, and not the Disney Parks type of books), and with the 5 power discs included (the featured two Lion King, Aladdin, King Louie, and Calhoun are exactly what you get) this means that the retail is bumped up to over twice what the older albums originally cost.This is a bull's eye exclusive (at least that's what the T website claims {the Marvel Superheroes album is a TRU exclusive}), and it retails for twenty-four ninety-nine. According to the find in store feature, this album is widely available in stores.  However, I ordered it right before Thnxgvng and it was delivered less than a week later.

"I ordered a dozen of these Disney Fairies Pez candies, based on the unbeatable subscribe & save deal and the helpful advice of the other reviewer on here.  The 'assortment' included four each of Tinkerbell, Rosetta, and Silver Mist.  These were intended as party favors for a girl's bday party, so we weren't exactly picky based on both the price and our experience.The first Pez shipment we received was of Marvel Pez - a huge hit with the boys in our family, BUT not with the bday girl!  Her reaction was pretty hilarious, and Amazon made it right and expedited the correct item at no additional charge. The Fairies carton was pretty beat up and the packages themselves were dented a bit (all were still sealed, so no issues there). Word of wisdom: definitely make sure that the Pez item number on the box matches with the Amazon barcode.

The long brush and connector work well, with lots of other helpful uses besides car washing (like cleaning house windows)... However, the brush bristles leave white lint on the car (I've only used a few times so far). The squeegee and microfiber are decent and work ok, BUT feel too flimsy because of the plastic (compared to a metal framed sponge).

"Hubby ordered a pair of these chino shorts for the summer, and he looks great in them.  Seriously, not that I'm being a super nice wife, the fit looks like it would look good on just about any male body type - pockets are well placed and the seams are well proportioned and not darted. Inseam is the right length, fits perfectly at the knee so no comfort issues when sitting, driving, walking, etc.  The only complaint is the back pockets - if you're the type to store your wallet in your pocket, definitely use the button to close otherwise the wallet doesn't stay in place.  Also, one of the pockets is double lined for storing a card or a money clip.My husband ordered a pair of these chino shorts directly from the Levi's website (full price, % off, free shipping), and frankly he should have just bought here on Amazon as they are almost half the retail price.

Clothes do seem brighter, however I tend to overload the drum so that may be my problem right there.

If it wasn't for the sale and the fact that I needed KFR codes, I probably would have passed on these. My kids didn't seem to like these, and they are big eaters of various granola and trail mixes. Personally, I think the bars taste pretty good - just enough crunch, not too sweet with just 7 grams of sugar. Great for a quick mini breakfast, throwing in the purse when on the go, running errands, or for those long trips.Not the best option for those with pickier tastes, and definitely NOT worth paying top dollar.

My hair looks great after my usual two washes per shower - super strong, super shiny, and very much under control (see ya, frizzies!).  However, the scent can be a little overwhelming especially when combined with the conditioner.  And even though these minerals are ideal for dry scalp, I unfortunately still have build up after a few days of use (have to use a different product for a day or two, then return to using Mineral Moisture).For those who are new to Organix/OGX, the hair products are SLS free but are NOT 100% organic or all natural.

"I ordered these to replace my girl's water sandals that she has since grown out of. Love the fun, bright colors. However, I ordered a size 3 and they fit like a normal size 2 so these are definitely snug. If your child is a half size, do not hesitate in ordering up! Also, there is no strap or buckle or velcro or nuthin' on these - one end simply lifts up so your kid's foot can slide in.  Not the most ingenious method and certainly not the most long-lasting (I can easily see this part ripping in the future), however it will definitely save time when we're in a rush.An absolute steal at the current price for brand name water sandals.

"3.5 starsLast year Gillette Venus marketed a purple lower priced ""starter""/basic Venus razor towards the teen/college set, and now offers this cute and compact Venus Snap.  The Snap *looks* like a fun, travel friendly, convenient product. But is it worth it...?No, not really. At big box stores, the retail is nine ninety-nine (slightly less at about nine-fifty at my local Walmart). I combined a manufacturer coupon plus a rewards card e-coupon at my local Kroger to get this down to just a few dollars - definitely worth the price for just the blade alone. The chunky handle is somewhat difficult to control - I kept holding on to the razor release and was afraid it would pop out! After a week I ended up switching to the normal Venus handle, and I felt the longer handle was easier to maneuver.  I also realized that the Venus handles have a notch about 1/3 of the way down from the razor, where I usually grip on to.  So after years and years of using my razor this way, no wonder the Snap felt strange! The shave itself was alright, but for some reason didn't seem as close as when using the normal sized handle (even with the exact same blade). Anyhow, the blue compact is a nice touch especially since the vents allow the razor to air out.Overall this is a tremendously marked-up price for a ""cute"" product. Definitely worth purchasing if on sale, or you have a coupon (be on the look out for  Gillette promos here on Amazon) or perhaps in a gift set. But otherwise, meh... You would be better off getting a full sized Venus razor for less.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NECNFJB08DG7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5H5Z1O#wasThisHelpful","R2NECNFJB08DG7","AWNQ2PULUBHDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNQ2PULUBHDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 30-something year old skin has developed serious dryness issues, especially during the winter months. The low price of this wash was a great incentive, but ultimately the mid-range rating on Good Guide (dot com) of 5.8 made me want to try this product. These days I'm big on what goes in and ON my body, so the fact that the ingredients in this creamy soap are for the most part safe is extremely important. Also important is the fact that it delivers on its moisturizing promises!My skin is now more supple and needs much less lotion during the course of the day, and my back (you know the spot I'm talking about) is much less dry and itchy. This also works great as a shaving cream. Yes, as the body wash formula includes Olay facial moisturizer, this smells like goopy ""old lady soap.""  Meaning it smells formulaic, but not necessarily perfume-y like most heavily scented body washes on the market. The lather is so-so: use a few drops on a loofa, then repeat if necessary for more bubbles.With stacking a coupon + subscribe and save, I was able to try Olay Age Defying body wash for just under two bucks. Definitely worth that cost, as this is a small bottle (in fact, the smaller 13.5 oz size is a good thing as no wash goes to waste AND the bottle easily fits in the shower). Not exactly ""age defying,"" but it cleans and moisturizes wonderfully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URBNPIM4MIL0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B22BCK2#wasThisHelpful","R1URBNPIM4MIL0","AWNQ2PULUBHDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AWNQ2PULUBHDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Firstly, the packaging is high quality and it included everything necessary to successfully install and re-install this protector if needed. You get a sheet of stickers (Two for dust removal and two more for screen protector removal if you need to re-position), a micro-fiber cloth, an alcohol wipe, and instructions for installation.There will be an area all around the side of this protector where your iPhone bezel will be unprotected. This is due to Apple's decision to make the screen curved as opposed to flat like in generations past. I personally do not like this choice, but hey it's not my choice to make, lol!As a positive side effect, since the protector does not go all the way to the edge, you should be good to use just about any case for the new iPhone with worry of the glass protector getting in the way.Overall, I highly recommend this protector for the price and say to those who believe the protector doesn't fit....wake up, realize that glass isn't flexible and go get your orange peeling plastic protectors if you want something to fully cover the top of the phone! :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TTIBLV4WLOFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NU96VTM#wasThisHelpful","R3TTIBLV4WLOFZ","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're wondering, yes the product works with both iPod 5g and iPhone 5 (and most likely 5s)and from what it seems it will fit previous generations but it wont be as snug a fit as the 5th gen models. Now on to the product, I'm a Weight lifter and i occasionally run (2-3 days a week) for prolonged periods of time (2-3 miles) and i can say from using this for a week and a half this is the best arm band I've ever used. Its so durable, it fits my arm and then some, and on top of that it has a key holder, which i use to keep a few dollars to buy water if i need it, very handy. The Velcro is tough and dose not get loose, there were times where i purposely tried to see how much force it took for it to come off my arm, and the only way to get it off was by removing it myself, so its very tough. The Item Arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered. I'm planning on finally getting an iPhone 5 next month and all I have now is an iPod 5g and it fits like a glove, and when I get my iPhone 5 I can just swap out my iPod for my iPhone 5. For the price this is a no brainer, one the most highest quality iPod/iPhone arm band I've ever used, I wouldn't be surprised if the price went up, the quality is top-tier and rivals the other(more expensive) products on amazon.IF YOU LIKE MUSIC WHEN YOU'RE WORKING OUT, IF YOU LIKE TO CARY YOUR IPHONE WHILE YOU RUN BUT HATE HOW IT JERKS AROUND IN YOUR POCKETS DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS YOU WONT REGRET IT!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58P6IX1TV0ZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M13NO3Y#wasThisHelpful","R58P6IX1TV0ZD","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We'd previously been using some of the old-style roller shades that attach with suction cups. These do work... for a while, until the glass gets dusty or oily, or something (i.e. a power window being lowered) bumps them loose. Then more often than not, they never work again.I also found that these simply refused to stick to the sharply inclined rear windshield. They're also a pain to remove when you want to, and don't cover very much area. Half the time we tried to retract them, the cups would come loose and fall off altogether.These use the same material as screen protectors, and that makes way too much sense. They don't have adhesive, but it almost seems that way when you stick them on a window. They're light and don't fall off even sharply inclined glass (you could even put it on a moonroof if you wanted) and they're easy to remove. .On a safety side, they're also light enough that they won't kill anyone if turned into projectiles. Overall, it's a major improvement and they're cheap to boot.

What a nice invention ..usually I am not a sucker for all these things but this one is so worth it ...A+++++++","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OIRSOJNUZ4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPZ36LM#wasThisHelpful","R25OIRSOJNUZ4Q","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just love this belt.  I have always used a waist trimmer belt for exercising but have struggled with fit and a lot of the belts roll down when you are in the middle of a workout and have to keep spending time adjusting .. quite frustrating.  I liked this one because it was wider and very adjustable .. I can use it and so can my husband.  I liked that it was comfortable against my skin and was not itchy .. and most important of all, it did not roll down even through high impact workouts.  I love how you start sweating in that area as soon as you start warming up.  I recently had hernia surgery and I have even enjoyed wearing it during the day under my clothes for extra support (and I hope to make that area look a little less deformed).  I love it and I give it a high recommendation.  My husband is buying another one for himself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AAMIMSXREBMW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NX9CMZ6#wasThisHelpful","R1AAMIMSXREBMW","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love LIGER products ... I stumbled into them by accident and now I am obsessed in seeing what they have to offer.  Browsing through their products I saw this outlet and I had always wanted to have an electrical outlet that had USB ports.  I got this and was soooo happy at first sight.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  I love the heavy material and sleek design.  What I liked even more was that when I placed it in my outlet not only did it look nice (I am biased to the black) but it covered the whole outlet and not only did it have two USB ports it still have an three prong AC outlet.  I am getting four more for my whole living room.  Ohh and when I plugged my phone it charged it right away...wonder if it was because it was in a direct electrical source.  This has a super high recommendation.  Now I am going to browse to see what else they have.  LOVE IT!!

"I am so used to the navigation program in my car that when I bought another car without one I felt lost.  I started using my phone and it was hard to drive and navigate (talk about hazard), it was suggested by a friend that I get a car holder, to be better able to use the features of my phone. On that advice I looked for a car mount for a while and I'm really happy I purchased this one! I've only had it for a couple weeks, but it has made a lasting first impression. I originally wanted to stick the mount on my dash, but with my phone in it my vision was blocked. I put it on my windshield, and it worked GREAT! It really does stick to the windshield.It is so easy to put my Samsung Galaxy 3 with its case in it, something that apparently a lot of others do not do. It does this with no problem. It's easy to adjust and locks firmly in place. Make sure the part that holds your phone is locked into place with the mount. You'll have to tighten the ball. I put my phone in and remove it easily with one hand, an action that has become as second nature as inserting the key. I am also able to charge my phone as the holder does not get in the way and all the other controls on the side are easily accessible.My nephew drove with me this weekend and as teenagers do, he put his IPhone 5s in and did a video while driving. I thought that this was a pretty ""neat"" feature, if that term is still used. Of course it is probably going to cost me another as he mentioned that his mom's got in the way of his camera and it shook a lot making his video bad.Overall, I love it! It will be a practical and SAFE way to use the GPS on my phone. I have also noticed that the speaker for calls and music is a lot clearer. I will and am buying another.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZG1ZWDDTCR2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NAHI2OG#wasThisHelpful","R2ZG1ZWDDTCR2D","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've played with a lot of other golf gloves, this isn't one of my favorite looking gloves but it definitely is one of the most comfortable and breathable gloves I've used. Some classic golf gloves are very thick and some newer gloves are very thin, I would say this glove is in the medium range for material thickness. The blend of a breathable mesh materials on the back of the hand and fingers is what makes this glove very breathable without compromising the strength of the glove. I hit about 1000 balls a week at the driving range and this glove has held up for almost 3 months of the range + 3 18 hole games.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33TNXKOPQKGQX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H5AWXD0#wasThisHelpful","R33TNXKOPQKGQX","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the label and was amazed at all of it's uses so I separated it into smaller bottles for different uses.  I've been using this for a while now as an all around body moisturizer- it is my go to oil after showering and it absorbs so quickly I can get dressed right after application. There is no fragrance to this oil so don't be disappointed there - you can always add fragrance essential oil to it if you like. It's light and quick to use- not like a baby oil which I find heavier. My skin is normal to dry (very dry on my legs)You can use it to remove your make up, even the waterproof and you are nourishing your lashes and your skin. I will keep buying it. Also helps you lashes to grow.I did use it to make a stir fry and the taste was not overwhelming ..hardly noticable....I love to use all different types of oil .. can't wait to try it on salads.Soooo I am super happy ..a must for all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DIUYNP3VTMOL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LESLEXE#wasThisHelpful","R3DIUYNP3VTMOL","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From the first day I took Probiotic by Nutracraft, I have been virtually totally free of all discomfort in that respect. I don't know if everyone would have the same dramatic turn around, but this has been my experience. I have been taking them for a week now and I feel completely straightened out and so normal.

"These grilling mats are awesome. We used one tonight on our charcoal grill to cook swordfish and veggies.

My husband really loved how it kept the heat more controlled, no flame outbursts because no drops. Extremely easy cleanup, I just put it on top rack of dishwasher. The pack is really a nice value as I see one lasting a really really long time, I might just give the other one away as a gift and spread the joy of my new grilling mat.

"This isn't my first brand of phytoceramides. I've used a couple of different ones and have been exceedingly pleased with the results. This isn't a magic pill that you take once and watch as youth ripples up your face and body. It takes time. It was at least a couple of months that I was just popping the pill along with my 25 (exaggeration but not much) other supplements. Then one day I thought -- damn, I look pretty good for 38. Not long after my step daughter literally asked what was up with my face -- she said my skin looked amazing. Saw an ex boyfriend for lunch a few days ago and he said ""you look exactly the same as when I met you"" which was almost ten years ago. So do they work? Yeah. He** yeah.This specific brand I've been using for only a few days. I haven't had any adverse reactions and the more youthful appearance I have regained over several months of using ceramides hasn't dripped off like candle wax, so I believe they're still working. I like that this contains 350 mg of phytoceramides. I am also pleased that the ingredient list is as simple as ""phytoceramides, vitamin a, c, d, e"". No fillers or crap listed.This product does have gluten in it, so if that's an issue for you, check out the potato or rice derived products. However, for me, the gluten isn't a huge deal. We do avoid a lot of it, but in this small quantity it isn't the end of the world. I've used wheat, rice and potato and honestly, I can't tell you that I prefer one over the other. From what I understand, Dr. oz recommended this dosage and type while other types contend that a lower amount of their product is as or more effective. To me, it is still just one pill. If it works, then I'm down with it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUVXGG6XL12G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJCC9BA#wasThisHelpful","RVUVXGG6XL12G","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Then a few days later we went fishing and it helped us with unhooking our fish.  My husband used the saw to trim some sticks for my son.

This brand has given me back what I thought I'd never have again, self esteem. I continue to lose inches, slow sure but I don't want it too fast either or it will come right back. I not only lost a pant size but it's from all over, little by little. It took a long time for my body to get to where it is and it's not going to disappear overnight, and I don't expect miracles. With this product however, I don't even have to TRY to lose weight, it just comes off. My sugar craving's have decreased dramatically, and so has my appetite. I'm very pleased that I did the research before I purchased another bottle of junk that didn't work. I'm glad I found this product. You can look this up if you want to be sure like me, I work hard for my money and I'm tired of wasting it on products that either don't work or work for a little while and stop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N7W7W1FA43ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHVRLU8#wasThisHelpful","R1N7W7W1FA43ND","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been doing several painting in different medium since I was a child. I now have an eight year old that has the same love and I was telling her how important it is to have a great quality brush. I had given her some of my older brushes but she wanted some new ones so I went on shopping. I didn't want to spend much so these seemed perfect. My biggest concern was that the quality was going to be very poor so I was a bit hesitant. I had her open them but together we did a watercolor project. She loved them and so did I. Loved all the variety and the quality was exceptional for each one.  The bristles are soft and maintain their shape. The paints are easily transferable to the canvas and paper. I also loved that they come in a perfect carrying case.  I now have to buy myself a set. .

"These are a great idea... for the right person. They are cutely packaged in a book style set with a bag for containing them. Great as a stocking stuffer or small gift idea for someone who prefers their spirits straight. Also a unique conversation starter.What they will do:- Drop the temp of your drink by a few degrees- Keep the drink from being diluted for slow sippers who don't want their drink watered down- Allow for a reusable set of chilling stones that provide many reuses- Keep an already chilled drink cool longerWhat they won't do:- Cool a drink to refrigerator temperatures (they just can't, it's a matter of physics)- Keep a drink ice cold for long periods of time (meant to chill, not super-cool drinks)- Scrape high quality glasses (soft stone, rounded corners mean little to no scuffing)... no promises on low grade glassThese will work for the intended purpose, which is to keep a chilled drink cool longer, or to add a slight chill to a drink. They can't possibly make a room temperature drink ice cold, because they just don't have the thermal mass to do so. But if kept in the freezer (in a cold spot, not on the door), they will work nicely for someone that absolutely must have their spirits straight. Many people are used to ice diluted drinks, and no, these cannot compete with the thermal mass of frozen water, but the trade off is, they won't dilute the drink either.As long as you know what you're getting when you buy them, these are great. Just don't expect them to be something they're not.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8NE6KOQDLUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8HA5L8#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8NE6KOQDLUB","A32F1YXKEJNMMU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32F1YXKEJNMMU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my daughter who has very long thick hair. It was not problem to put on. What I loved was that it was snug without being too snug and it kept her hair dry and ears as well. I read that other's have problems with size, but I have long hair and, what I consider, big head and I did not have problems. I love that she can switch it from black and blue (which is her favorite color).  I give it a high recomendation. Great quality.

"I began jumping rope several months back as my primary cardio routine. I started with a basic everlast 'speed' rope and developed decent technique. I decided to look for a 'faster' rope after awhile and thankfully I found this one. It is cheap to buy but offers the ability to skip rope at dizzying speeds. I love this thing and I use it at least 2-3 times a week.

"Once Upon a Power Play is a great addition to Jennifer Bonds Risky Businessseries. Character-driven, the story very much focusses on Chloe and Ryan and considering I havent been overly impressed with many of the Brazen titles of late, this was a welcome discovery. And whilst the storyline was fairly predictable, this couple had an amazing chemistry, didnt bring a huge amount of drama and created some very sexy heated moments. I couldnt have asked for much more.""Happily ever after is a fairy tale that's not meant for me.""The authors writing style works perfect for me. She pulls her reader in from the start and has brought characters with superb personalities. There was nothing I didnt love about Chloe and Ryan, individually or together, and whilst both have their vulnerabilities and insecurities its perfectly balanced with verbal sparring, fun and dirty-talk that actually doesnt leave you cringing.""Everywhere this ice cube goes, my mouth follows.""All in all this was a thoroughly enjoyable read that I wouldnt hesitate to recommend if youre looking for a feel-good sexy sports-romance which is low on angst. Heres hoping that Jennifer Bonds has a story in the making for Ryans teammate, Bash as he was a wonderful secondary character who definitely has mileage in him.Copy received courtesy of Entangled Publishing for an honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UI1ENO9JED3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLZ5RE#wasThisHelpful","R2UI1ENO9JED3N","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm always happy to pick up a book by Marissa Clarke and her Anderson Brothers series has so far has brought me pretty much all I could ask to find in a lighter contemporary romance. Chance of a Lifetime was no exception; romantic, fun and sexy, heart warming and at times quite emotional, Chance and Gen brought a refreshing perspective to one of my favourite tropes; second chance love.""...he could show her the adventure and freedom she craved so badly and still keep her safe.""Simply put, I adored them together. Strong and feisty, Gen is absolutely determined that her disability won't prevent her from living her life how she wants to, which is easier said than done with a family who think being blind means being helpless. Chance has been a little of a mystery in the previous books, but now is his time to shine and believe me, he does. His humour, patience, devotion and regrets over the mistakes he has made in life made him a man to fall in love with, and following a chance encounter in a bar with his childhood best friend, he finds himself offering to help her complete her bucket list.""What do you see?""""Nothing but you.""This couple's journey was my definition of rom-com and Marissa Clarke has injected the same emotions you experience when watching a film on a screen. I howled with laughter at the verbal sparring between the Anderson men, and I must admit there were a couple of moments between Gen and Chance when I thought my eyes may leak. Add in Will and Claire and Michael and Mia's evolving lives and Gen's irritating big brother and you have the icing on the cake. And, whilst I'm a little sad that the series is complete, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that it's one I'll be re-reading.Copy received courtesy of Entangled Publishing via NetGalley for an honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BBMFPQUVOBNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016VIVL7A#wasThisHelpful","R3BBMFPQUVOBNY","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For those of you who follow my reviews, you'll know by now that Victoria James is one of my favourite authors. She crafts beautiful love stories with characters who steal your heart and journeys that enchant from the opening page.""...what happened here last night? A Christmas Miracle?""The Billionaire's Christmas Proposal is a book I've been eager to get my hands on as its predecessor, The Billionaire's Christmas Baby is a festive read I could read over and over again. And whilst it does bring all I expect to find in a book from Victoria, and I did fall in love with Ethan and Allie and their story, I have to be honest and say it's not my favourite from her. There were parts to the story that I don't feel were necessarily needed; in comparison to her previous books it was heavier on tropes and there were elements that wouldn't have have been missed if you'd taken them away, giving an opportunity to give the reader a little more on those that mattered. And if this had been the case, you would still be presented with a lovely romance with an equally lovely couple who have secrets and uneasy pasts.""The way he spoke; the warmth in his gaze and in his deep voice was enough to make her forget all the reasons she'd made up about why she couldn't be with Ethan.""Ethan and Allie's journey is romantic, festive, heartwarming and bittersweet, bringing a family feel and highlighting aspects many of us take for granted. And, whilst it was fairly predictable in comparison to Victoria's usual MO and it may not have pulled the level of emotion from me that so many of her books have done in the past, it was an enjoyable read.""I'm showing you what it's like to forget where you are, who you are, and everything except wanting more.""Copy received courtesy of Entangled Publishing for an honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXH357H5H35O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166PXFFO#wasThisHelpful","R1IXH357H5H35O","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second book in the Sin City SEALS series picks up more or less where To Tempt a SEAL left off. I loved the first, we were given a glimpse of the characters featuring here and Sara Jane Stone's writing voice worked well for me, giving me huge hope for the series.""I always play to win.""""I dare you to try.""For me, Natalie and Jack didn't light the pages up in the way Cade and Lucia did. Their story had already laid the groundwork giving us an insight into Natalie's upbringing and Jack came across as fun and appealing, so I was semi-expecting a hero who would break through his lady's barrier in an equally fun and sexy way. And so it begins when he makes a bet with his idiotic older brother that he can bed her, which she knows about.""I dont understand how all those women who fall for your pick-up lines walk away afterward.""I started out liking both Jack and Natalie but, if I'm honest, it was too long a read, padded out with too many games of cat and mouse. Many of the enjoyable moments involved Lucia and Cade, but I generally found Natalie frustrating with her running and this pretty much lasted until 80%. However, I will say that heading towards the finish this couple did endear themselves and they brought what I'd been hoping for earlier it; was just that bit too late to rate this higher.Will I read more in the series? Absolutely. If Sara Jane Stone can recreate the spark she brought to the first book then I will be a satisfied reader.

"I've always been a fan of Samanthe Beck's work. Her writing style has grabbed and she's consistently brought her readers engaging, entertaining, sexy romances with great couples. So it's fair to say I had high expectations for Compromising Her Position.I intended to stop you, butI can't really put it any other way; I had issues with how this book was opened and the mistaken identity sex aspect of this storyline. Mistaken identity sex becomes a grey area when you know the girl you're having sex with doesn't know who you are, yet you say nothing. If she knew who was actually underneath the Santa-suit, what would she do? She might say carry on, good for her, but she also may say no and that choice was never given. And this immediately became a pretty big sticking point for me.""...once shed pressed her soft, eager mouth to his, he couldnt for the life of him bring things to a halt.""Had this been an author I wasn't familiar with, I'm pretty certain I would have parted ways at this point, but despite this whole aspect bothering me I continued, and unfortunately I have to say I found the story generally lacking. Samanthe has always brought her readers that bit more; she's written books with stories that are more than sex, with couples who are relatable and quickly endear, and whilst the consensual passion between Rafe and Chelsea was well-written, outside of the bedroom they didn't have that spark that she has so often created and I simply couldn't become invested into a couple who started out the way they did.This doesn't mean I won't read future books from Samanthe Beck. I will, I have always rated her writing, and her previous books have all been four and five-star reads for me, but in comparison, Compromising Her Position just didn't hit the right notes.Copy received courtesy of Entangled Publishing for an honest and unbiased opinion.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14CK7XFQVHXS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151U7X3U#wasThisHelpful","R14CK7XFQVHXS1","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've adored Elizabeth Otto's Paint River Ranch series and Can't Resist a Cowboy is a good finale. Granted, for me, it didn't hold quite the emotion pull as its predecessors, but Levi and Carrie were another endearing couple who haven't had an easy-time of things.""You're staring, Sunshine.""""If you saw yourself from a female perspective, you'd be staring too.""Second chance love, an injured ex-marine/cowboy and a heroine with a life-long illness that could change her life. Combined, this held huge promise, and whilst Levi and Carrie's circumstances did pull on the heartstrings, I was expecting more considering Levi's history. Unlike Cole and Tucker's stories, there were no tears, but he is a sweetheart and he does have the Haywood charm; I just didn't fall in love with him in the same way I did his brothers.""I never stopped caring about you, Sunshine. I learned to push it away, but it was always there, with each breath.""That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, I did; Elizabeth Otto has a gift of creating likeable characters who absorb you into their lives and have personal issues that are often shied away from in romance. Levi and Carrie have a past and with that comes a natural chemistry and intimacy, but I found the passion quite slow burn. In some respects it was fitting, but it did add a steady feel when reading.""You never have to apologise for touching me, Carrie.""The banter and sparring between the brothers brought humour, Birdie brought the cute and that honesty only little-ones can get away with, and it was lovely to see Cole and Rylan, and Tucker and Sophie's lives evolving. It may not have been quite the journey than I was hoping for, but you can't not want Levi and Carrie to find their HEA and it is a good addition to a series I highly recommend.Copy received courtesy of Entangled Publishing for an honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O7EWQO70ZWPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W19B64M#wasThisHelpful","R1O7EWQO70ZWPI","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the London Legends series. No point pulling any punches, I do; I've pretty much read them back-to-back and I can quite comfortably say, Kat Latham can do no wrong. She has a talent of creating endearing characters with wonderful personalities, strengths and weaknesses. Ash Trenton and Camila Morales are no different and were as unique as each of the previous couples from the series.""If you want easy, you came to the wrong man. I don't do easy. I do worth-it.""Newly retired from the Legends, Ash has been a bit of an enigma throughout the series. But when he bumps into his first love at his leaving-do, old feelings are re-ignited and Camila has a proposition for him. One that requires him hopping a plane and helping out at the camp she runs for troubled teens.Their journey was so different, for a start it doesn't take place in the UK, and whilst we know these men fall and fall hard, Ash was in a league of his own. I had an inkling I knew where the story was heading, and I was proved right, but it didn't detract from a strong, emotional read with humour, heartache and strong determined lady and a strapping man to fall head-over-heels for. He's a softie, but he's also a talker.""I don't want lovey-dovey words. I want dirty talk. I want your mouth to get so filthy you feel like you need mouthwash.""With a natural chemistry that comes with familiarity, Ash and Camila's re-ignited passion brings revelations, vulnerabilities and maturity, and together they were perfect. If, like me, you love this series, Taming the Legend won't disappoint. (And it also has a hidden treat of being loosely connected to One Night with her Bachelor, although it's not necessary to read it to follow).4.5 stars.This review will feature on Read Your Writes Book Reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D76DV4JHLN3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3LQJWU#wasThisHelpful","R1D76DV4JHLN3F","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The second book in Jessica Scott's Homefront series, After the War is an engaging read with a storyline that goes beyond romance. Life in the army is often glamourised and to be presented with serving officers and the situations they have encountered and continue to face, was quite humbling; running parallel to this second-chance love-story is one that makes you realise just what these men and women sacrifice.""Sean Nichols was nothing more than a bad memory. One she was determined to leave exactly where he belonged. In the past.""Sarah and Sean have a history, Rewind several years and we have a young man who didn't want the woman he intended to marry to become a soldier, and a woman who didn't see her role in life as that of an army-wife and mum. Ending their relationship, Sarah pursued her dreams, married, had a daughter and faced her own tragic loss. But when circumstance places them in the same place eight-years later, they discover war may have changed them, but their feelings for one another remain.""This doesn't feel wrong to me.""Whilst at times it felt a little steady, it was an enjoyable read. Sean and Sarah were likeable and their reconnection was touching, emotional and at times a little heart-wrenching. I have no idea what army-life is like, but with a gritty accompanying storyline it's given me what I can only perceive as a reality to the struggles officers face. Jessica Scott is an author that I will certainly read again and I look forward to the next book in this series.Copy received courtesy of Rock Star Lit PR via NetGalley for an honest and unbiased opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZEBH6WDYHIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V8A5RB8#wasThisHelpful","R35ZEBH6WDYHIS","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me begin by saying J.D. Hawkins has talent. To cram that much awful into an opening chapter? Oh, that takes a level of skill that goes beyond mastery.""Let me tell you something. I can tell how a woman f***s by the way she moves; you can tell how a man handles business between the sheets by the way he walks.""and I can tell when my early warning detection system is doing its job perfectly when sentences like that appear a couple of lines in.Unfortunately I threw the towel in at 20% and for several reasons. Aside of my feelings towards the characters (which I'll return to), Insatiable was in desperate need of an editor - the grammar and punctuation errors, the telling without showing and the POV slips made it a frustrating read, but grammar wasn't the only problem. It was the choice of words.""I pull back, her clit following me like a lost dog.""""I roll my knuckles in and around her holes with the expertise of a piano player.""""she rolls it (his juices btw) around her mouth before swallowing it like its a vintage wine getting her drunk.""This isnt erotic. Far from it. What I read was clichd, crass and left someone with a fairly strong constitution feeling queasy. Yet it was strangely clinical. All the action happened just like that. The licking lips, the awful chat-up lines and a girl dragging him into a corner in a nightclub; what I managed to read had no sense of pacing and everything just happened so abruptly and dispassionately that there was no emotional investment to be had. It centres wholly around who Jax does or doesn't want to bang and whether or not he succeeds.""I can sense the dozens of women deciding at first glance that Im the one they want to f*** tonight.""He had no redeeming qualities. Insecure and manipulative, cocky and chauvinistic, I couldn't abide him and felt like I was reading and being expected to enjoy the thoughts of, quite bluntly, a misogynistic narcissist. As for the heroine, Lizzie, she really was nothing more than an object. There for his benefit. As were all the women, including the one redeeming character, Luce who had the potential to be a likeable character as she was the one person to pull him up on his incessant bitching. But the author ruined that by pulling out the old pathetic misconception that man cannot simply be just friends with woman.On the positive side, the reader does get sex in the opening chapter (clunkily and unsexily, but it's there) and the book is fairly short, which is a definite plus, if you can make it to the end.Will I be reading the subsequent books in this series? I think my answer may be a little obvious, but no I won't. And, as always these are simply my own personal and honest thoughts.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37J7XM9119OT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X2J688Y#wasThisHelpful","R37J7XM9119OT4","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Changing His Game is a steamy addition to the Brazen line, with a refreshing storyline. Combine Tumblr, a dirty talker and a lady who knows what she wants, and you get a romance with plenty heat and some humour.""Is that a river in your panties or are you just happy to see me?""When Marley Lake has a computer problem at work, her knight-in-shining-techy-armour comes in the form of Austin Rivers, silent partner in Gaming magazine. The same magazine Marley is copy-editor for. And when he spies the dirty gif she's watching, it's not long before she sees his hard-ware.""I didn't realise you were left-handed.""""I'm not.""""But you're eating with your left hand.""""That's because my right hand is busy with something a lot more important.""Megan Erickson is a new author to me and whilst it was fairly predictable, she's brought her readers likeable characters, chemistry and sexy shenanigans.

"Jen McLaughlin/Diane Alberts is just one of those authors you can rely on to bring you a hot sexy read. Taking What's His is another great addition to her Shillings Agency series, and brings us Holt Cunningham; a dirty-talking, bespectacled, dominant man with a vulnerable side.""One wild, crazy night, and then we both move on. No broken hearts. No painful goodbyes.""When Holt meets Lydia Thomas in a bar, their chemistry sizzles and it burns bright throughout. I loved how prepared Lydia was to go toe-to-toe with him, but it was how hard Holt fell that made me adore him the way I did. He has vulnerabilities, he's stubborn and dominant but he's also a complete sweetheart.""I'm not going to call you sir.""""Yeah. You will.""If you're a Doctor Who fan, there are little moments in this book that will make perfect sense and bring the feels, and if you're not, well they'll still do that, just perhaps not on the same level. Jen certainly doesn't let her reader down and with Lydia's newly-single brother Steven featuring throughout, here's hoping we're given the opportunity to discover which lady will bring him to his knees.4.5 stars.Copy received courtesy of Entangled Publishing for an honest and unbiased opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NM9PKIZKXT9K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQ1HICA#wasThisHelpful","R3NM9PKIZKXT9K","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...and Richard Larsen and Hanna Vincent's spans over twenty years, beginning on the eve of the millennium. Told from both perspectives no emotion is left untouched and I loved them together....they say you hurt the ones who love you most...Fix You is about normal people. Normal everyday relatable people who have the same ups and downs in life that any of us could have. Hanna and Richard's journey puts you through the ringer; you feel their joy and their pain and live their highs and lows, they frustrate, they make foolish decisions but they're soul mates, they're just meant to be and you can't not want them to find their HEA.Ive always loved you, even when youve been far away and I havent been able to see you.Withh a plethora of secondary characters to love and hate, all adding valuable content, Carrie Elks has brought her reader a contemporary romance that draws you in from the opening chapter.

"The third in the Blackcreek series, Pretend didn't grab me in the same way as Collide and Stay. The storyline had potential, both characters have family issues, but they seemed to play second fiddle to the fact that Mason and Gavin couldn't keep their hands off one another.What kind of life is it if youre not living your own?Together they were lovely, Mason has a dirty mouth and Gavin doesn't fair so bad, but the emotional angle could've been much more.

"The first book in this series has always been one of my favourites from the Bliss imprint. And having waited quite a while for this, I was very much looking forward to returning to Lake Bliss. Second-chance love is a trope I'm fond of, and with a romance between the town's once golden-boy and the town's sweetheart on the cards, it enticed.""I've never forgotten you...Can you say the same""Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this as much as Just for the Summer which was a real shame. I had such high hopes; Rachel and John have that chemistry that comes with having a past, and there were some lovely moments between them, but on the whole I struggled to connect with them until pretty much near the end. The introduction of Rachel's ex-husband and her decisions frustrated and if I'm honest, I was hoping that the kids would have had more time in the spotlight.On this occasion, Just for Appearances just wasn't for me.

"When Victoria James releases a book the clouds part, the heavens sing and rainbows fill the sky. Well, perhaps that's an exaggeration, but it makes me happy as I know I'm going to find a man to love. This time it's Gage Mackenzie; Cowboy, gent, user of the word Darlin' and yes, I'd happily ride off into the sunset with him...""Sweet baby Jesus, this man was a work of art.""The second book in the Tall Pines series,  Rescued by the Rancher is a lovely romantic journey with endearing characters, a captivating storyline and set in a beautiful location. When Meredith Simms arrived at Tall Pines a year previously, she was at a low point in life but with the support of her sister, brother-in-law and Gage, she's become a strong, independent lady, but with a vulnerable side. Gage is a protector; strong, sexy and gentle, he's a complete sweetheart, but he has his own secrets. I expected emotion, I've read enough of Victoria's books to know I'll get it, but I didn't expect it to be as deep-rooted as it was. I hurt for them, but this was balanced by so many uplifting and romantic moments.""You walk into the room and you turn me on. You look at me, you smile at me, you laugh, and you turn me on.""Whilst the intimacy is closed door, the emotional elements surrounding Gage and Meredith bring a sexy and passionate feel keeping the romance alive throughout. Victoria James has a gift of creating a couple to fall in love with with a strong, emotive writing style containing humour and with secondary characters who bring a real family feel and valuable content to the story. I loved seeing how Cole and Mel were getting on, well if I'm truthful I loved getting another little fix of Cole, but I also did a happy dance that's there's the possibility of more visits to Tall Pines. I have to be honest and say it's not my favourite of Victoria's books, but she can still do no wrong; it's a fine addition and one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.(The second in the Tall Pines series, Rescued by the Rancher could be read as a standalone. That said you don't want to miss out on The Rancher's Second Chance and the brooding delight that is Cole Forrester.)Part of this review can be seen on Read Your Writes Book Reviews as a joint review feature.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZPPH2LCMH4RT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URVJHG0#wasThisHelpful","RZPPH2LCMH4RT","A1AH7FPROGNXH8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AH7FPROGNXH8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I admit that I have the ebook version of this book through B&N for my Nook Tablet (the ebook comes as a trilogy called Time In Death along with 2 other novellas, Haunted & Eternity)I love the In Death Novels, but the novellas can make your head ache. I realize she only has 80 to 100 pages to build up murder, back story, solving the crime and arrestBut it is due to the limited space that many of the dramatis personae do not get developed. In this book you have the 2 main characters of Eve & Roarke, 5 secondary characters of Mavis, Ian, Mira, Peabody, Summerset; three recurring characters in Leonardo, Morris and Isis. Now add to those 10 characters another 24 minor and periphery characters that we have never heard of. That is a LOT of people to develop a story for in 100 pages.As I said, I have the single ebook from the Suite 606 anthology because I have read the other authors work before and do not care for them. I own all of JD Robb's books from Naked In Death to Festive In Death and have Obsession In Death on Pre-order.I love the stories in the novels, but the novellas? Not so much.In my opinion, the most confusing and unsatisfying novella to date was Missing in Death.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CK94UGJ3CY04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KJ6Y14#wasThisHelpful","R2CK94UGJ3CY04","AQ06TB7GQ5AQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ06TB7GQ5AQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Look at that wing, extend it with another wing die cut and I definitely see a dragon!!Die cut the whole bird and several cuts of the tail, color them with alcohol ink from shrink plastic and then shrink them. Adhere the tails pieces with either hot glue or glossy accents at an agle to each other and you would have a cute little embellishment for your card. You could do the same thing in cardstock to make a larger embellishment for a gift.

The brown was for the vines, white for the fence, green for the stems and leaves and purple for the flowers. You can use a Xyron sticker machine to adhere the layers down but I used Scotch Fast Dry glue in a 20mm needle applicator (my favorite applicator - bought here on Amazon) to glue down the little bits.When all the layers were done, the die cut was 1/8"" thick and when centered on a light blue layer it was quite pretty. I suggest trying that technique should you buy this die.

"I should have known Jonathan Tropper was involved with this movie.  I'm a huge fan of this talented and gifted writer who specializes in bittersweet comedies.  THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU is based on Tropper's novel of the same name, and the author also wrote the screenplay.  When a family patriarch suddenly dies, and four scattered siblings with hectic, dysfunctional lives are put together under one roof for a week, there is everything from chaos to heart ache to warm fellowship.  THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU tells the story of the Altman siblings, who must first get to know one another all over again before there's any chance of a connection, plus get to know their surrounding community again.  It's a solid comedy with plenty of poignant moments--which is vintage Tropper.All four siblings have plenty of baggage.  Paul, the oldest (Corey Stoll), has been stuck in his hometown running the family business; his life is fairly predictable and mundane--except he has a wife (Kathryn Hahn) obsessed with becoming pregnant.  Second oldest Wendy (Tina Fey) has a marriage in freefall due to her workaholic husband, but has a special connection to her two younger brothers, who she helped raise.  Judd (Jason Bateman) is going through a divorce--and has also lost his job.  And Phillip (Adam Driver), the baby, has been so indulged his entire life he's totally dysfunctional--but he brings his much older girlfriend (Connie Briton) along to show her off.  All the siblings are brought together by their caring mother (the ageless Jane Fonda), who has a bombshell of her own to share with her children.  The story is told primarily from the point of view of Judd, who's feeling his life is spinning out of control--but there are plenty of other snippets revealed about all the family members.  Plus Judd and Wendy get to rub elbows with childhood sweethearts (Rose Byrne and Timothy Olyphant, respectively).  The film meanders a bit too long, and Connie Britton is so under-utilized, yet THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU will still have you both chuckling--and leave a lump in your throat.--D.

"When I became a huge fan of the movie, I did not realize CLOUD ATLAS was based on a novel.  I thought such a complex plot of six interweaving story threads to be the product of a group of screenwriters, so I was delighted to learn the movie stems from David Mitchell's extraordinary and brilliant novel.  Having just finished the book, I cannot wait to see the movie again!  Mitchell is an extremely gifted writer, as he tells each separate story in a totally different genre.  What the movie portrays is aptly conveyed in the pages of Mitchell's book:  That our lives are ripples in time that affect other lives in other times, and vice versa.  It's a haunting theme, masterfully told by a terrific writer.Again, the novel is comprised of six separate story threads; with the exception of the sixth story, each other thread is interrupted in half, then resolved in the second half of the book.  'The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing' is told in the first person and relates a 19th Century south seas ocean voyage with very racial overtones.  'Letters from Zedelghem' is in the form of letters from one man to his lover conveying the story of a dysfunctional music collaboration in 1930s Europe.  'Half Lives:  The First Luisa Rey Mystery' is told in the present tense and is about a young reporter in the Seventies suddenly finding herself in the deadly corruption of big oil.  'The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish' is relayed in first person and is the hilarious story of an aging book publisher trapped in a nursing home, and how he conspires to escape.  (Like the movie, this by far is my favorite story--and it is incredibly funny.)  'An Orison of ~Somni 451' is a futuristic interview between an Archivist and a ""fabricant"" (clone) regarding a bold uprising that rattles the establishment (the ""corpocracy"").  Finally, 'Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After' is told in broken English first person about a brutal post-Apocalyptic world far, far into the future.  Again, each thread is vastly different, but the theme--our lives are a mosaic that transcends time--is constant.  Mitchell's CLOUD ATLAS is not for everyone, but it is definitely a novel like you've never seen before--and one I'm most appreciative to have read.--D.

"Let's keep things in perspective.  J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' is a lighthearted, whimsical, 275-page fantasy novel for children, ages 9 to 12.  It is anything but a dark, brooding, sinister epic requiring mining plot lines (and characters) from the appendices of Tolkien's sequel 'The Lord of the Rings'. . .or pulling new characters directly out of writer/director/producer Peter Jackson's creative posterior.  Yet with the third--and, we hope, final--installment of THE HOBBIT:  THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES, Jackson has created a whopping 9 hours of cinema.  All of it is a stunning visual feast, full of heart-pounding action, haunting music, and amazing visuals--but most of it is forced and contrived.  It's akin to ordering a hamburger and receiving an entire cow; to fans of the novel, these three films are the culmination of over-the-top.But again, Jackson knows how to make a movie, and FIVE ARMIES is quite a movie.  Here we find the original 13 dwarfs, and Bilbo (Martin Freeman), entrenched in Erebor, where Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) has succumbed to the same destructive greed that affected his grandfather.  Meanwhile, the nearby humans of Laketown claim they're entitled to a portion of Erebor's treasure, as do the elves of Mirkwood, led by the mysterious Thranduil (Lee Pace).  And of course, Sauron has dispatched an army of evil orcs to invade the region, and, not to be outdone, an army of dwarves, led by Thorin's cousin Dain (Billy Connolly is terrific), sweeps in to defend the fortress.  And through it all, there persists the non-believable romance between an elf and a dwarf (Evangeline Lilly and Aidan Turner); plus no Hobbit movie is complete without the fantastic Gandalf (Ian McKellen).  Throw all of these elements together, and the viewer is overwhelmed by a non-stop battle, but to his credit, Jackson pulls no punches; several characters, as in the book, are ultimately killed.  It's all masterfully crafted, with incredible special effects and furious action, yet THE HOBBIT:  THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES proves to be too filling.  This quarter pounder has too many toppings.--D.

So as my existing towels were showing signs of wear and too many machine washings, I decided to roll the dice and come on this website to purchase a new set of bath towels.  I picked the UTOPIA towels, but with some trepidation; it's been my experience with cheaper towels that the quality is inferior, causing the towels to shed fibers on your person during drying.  But my fears were unjustified; the UTOPIA 8-PIECE VALUE 100% COTTON BATH TOWEL SET is worth every penny and more!As the product page advises, these towels are feather soft and mega-absorbent.  The edges are tightly woven and show no signs of unraveling.  Plus they are extremely durable; I've had the bath towels and hand towels through the washer several times, and they've yet to show any signs of wear.  And best of all:  No towel fibers left behind on my carcass!  As advertised, the UTOPIA set includes 2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 4 washcloths; in my small household that's more than sufficient.

"I could not wait to read TEAM OF RIVALS  after becoming a huge fan of Stephen Spielberg's film Lincoln, which is based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's comprehensive presentation of the political genius of Abraham Lincoln.  (The film is focused on the passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolishes slavery, so I was so disappointed that in Goodwin's biography this event is glossed over in roughly four pages, and fails to go into the minute detail and machinations Lincoln had to exercise to leverage the necessary votes in Congress, but this disappointment did not take away from my enjoyment of this book.)  In TEAM OF RIVALS, Goodwin suggests that Lincoln demonstrated his political prowess by appointing his three 1860 Republican presidential rivals (William Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates) to serve in his cabinet.  All three looked upon Lincoln with contempt as a backwoods Illinois lawyer, and all three sought to dominate and manipulate him as their services in the cabinet began--yet all three grew to admire Lincoln's political skill and savvy to hold warring factions of the Republican party together as the country endured the relentless bloodshed and heartache of the raging Civil War.  Meanwhile, Goodwin tells us about Abraham Lincoln the man, about his volatile wife, Mary, and the anguish they endured together when their beloved son Willie died in the White House in 1862.  Not only was Lincoln faced with the titanic responsibilities of wartime, he was also in personal agony and grief, yet he possessed the talents to put his personal tribulations aside to govern with acute wisdom.  And Ms. Goodwin tells the story of Lincoln in a written manner that is as beautiful as it is riveting.Don't be fooled into thinking this is merely the story of Lincoln and his cabinet during the Civil War--TEAM OF RIVALS tells us the stories of the lives of not only Lincoln, but of his three rivals, as of all them, in their own unique way, gain national influence and prominence.  We also learn a great deal about other colorful characters of the period, including Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's feisty Secretary of War; the Blair family, leaders of the powerful conservative faction of the Republican party; Gideon Welles, Lincoln's loyal Secretary of the Navy; and Kate Chase, Salmon Chase's beloved daughter, who becomes the three-time widower's hostess and social darling of Washington.  And everything presented in this sweeping historical account is meticulously documented, based on letters, diaries, newspaper articles, and countless other historical studies; that it took Ms. Goodwin ten years to research and write TEAM OF RIVALS comes as no surprise.  At more than 750 pages this biography is not a short read--but all history buffs can surely agree that TEAM OF RIVALS is one excellent read.--D.

"HORRIBLE BOSSES 2 aptly follows the sequel rule:  It sucks.  This monolithic yawn fest dares to follow in the footsteps of its clever original--and muddies the waters accordingly.  It's contrived, unimaginable, boring, and predictable. . .and those are its good points.  Only the re-appearances of Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and Kevin Spacey--especially Kevin Spacey--save this one-dimensional improve rant from beer coaster status.Once again we're subjected to the trials and tribulations of Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), and Dale (this time, an alarmingly annoying Charlie Day), as they haphazardly attempt to get back at a tycoon who has backstabbed them (Christopher Waltz) by ""kidnapping"" his over-willing son (good grief, is Chris Pine more unlikable?).

Thomas asks Harry to protect the cast and crew of an indie porno production from a deadly entropy curse--a curse exposing the wizard to various members of Thomas's White Court family.  And finally, Harry learns some eye-opening secrets from his past--secrets that will change forever his relationship with Thomas.  Weave all these components together, and you get BLOOD RITES, the sixth installment in Jim Butcher's fun-filled, fast-moving Dresden Files series.Like all the previous volumes, BLOOD RITES is action-packed and entertaining--with Harry always ready to furnish an off-the-cuff quip.  Harry may be battling a pack of Black Court vamps and their ghouls, but he's never going to take matters seriously.  The ultimate showdown with the curse-summoning Lord of the White Court is fast, violent, and furious, and as BLOOD RITES concludes the stage is set for future plots involving Harry and Thomas.  With one star off due to some uneven inconsistencies and outright sloppiness, BLOOD RITES is a fun read daring the reader not to reach for the next installment.--D.

"Historical accuracy be darned, 300:  RISE OF AN EMPIRE is a graphic novel brought to heart-pounding life much like its stimulating predecessor.  The story is told via gorgeous vistas, slow motion photography, driving music, chiseled bodies, gratuitous violence, and spewing gore.  In this version, Athenian muscle man Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) leads the tiny Greek Navy against the mighty Persian fleet, led by the stunning, but deadly Artemisia (a gorgeous and sensuous Eva Green).  The action sequences are frantic, to say the least, and in this version the filmmakers have ratcheted up the gore.  But like its predecessor, it realizes its purpose is to entertain, so it never takes itself seriously.And is it fun to watch.Lena Headey (wolf howl), David Wenham, Rodrigo Santoro, Andrew Tiernan, and Peter Mensah all appear to reprise their roles from the action-packed original.  Yet this version of 300 is aptly carried by Stapleton and Green, who have terrific chemistry on screen.  300:  RISE OF AN EMPIRE looks and feels like a cartoon, only with live actors.  Here's hoping the talented filmmakers are able to launch a 300 franchise; that's a sequence of films this reviewer would appreciate, plus think of all the Hollywood trainers who would find fulltime work.  Chisel away.--D.

"IMAGINE ME & YOU is a tedious rom-com that's been recycled and rehashed countless times--only this time, it's a she and a she instead of a him and a her. Comfortable couple Rachel and Heck (Piper Perabo and a bored Matthew Goode) finally tie the knot; but Rachel, while actually walking down the aisle, falls instantly in zany love with Luce (Lena Heady), the florist for the wedding.  And suddenly, a slam-dunk, sure-thing marriage is thrown into perpetual chaos, as Rachel wrestles with her guilt and orientation, with Luce somehow hoping Rachel will see the light and come play on her team.  The stage is set for bland predictability, as there is tension and tenderness and heartbreak (Goode's scene where he attempts to cry had me donkey braying)--then the inevitable, over-the-top, butterflies and kittens ending.Advertised as a romantic comedy, there is very little actually funny in IMAGINE ME & YOU.  Rachel pouts and Heck worries and Luce happens to know the perfect plant for any occasion.  Of the supporting cast, Darren Boyd is overwhelmingly unlikable as Heck's best friend Cooper, and I'm still trying to decipher a single word uttered by Rachel's soft-spoken Papa (Anthony Head).  Yes, IMAGINE ME & YOU travels down the road of Been There, Done That, but salvages three instead of two stars because Piper and Lena are so wonderfully stunning.  Eye candy is always good.--D.

"Yes, there have been a plethora of Dracula films populating the history of cinema, featuring different plots, characters, settings, and times.  But it wasn't until I became a huge fan of Francis Ford Coppola's terrific film Bram Stoker's Dracula, that I learned his version was actually based on the Bram Stoker horror novel, first published in 1897--a novel that terrified the literary world.  During Coppola's riveting commentary of his film, I learned he is a huge fan of the novel, and that he lifted, word for word, many of the lines of dialogue and narration directly from the book.  Accordingly I became intrigued to read Bram Stoker's classic; having finished it, this is one sensational and satisfying horror yarn.  Yet the reader must keep in mind the times in which it was written, when emotional melodrama and hand wringing were common in literature.  Yes, I was rolling my eyes during some of the ""We're doomed, doomed!"" and ""Oh my dear sweet love!"" goofiness, yet I was amply rewarded staying with the story about an ancient vampire looking to leave his native Transylvania and feast on the streets of London--and the hearty group of souls bent on destroying him.The novel is comprised of three distinct plots.  The first finds Jonathan Harker, a young real estate solicitor, traveling to Dracula's castle to complete numerous transactions involving the Count's purchasing of several English estates; very quickly Jonathan discovers something is awry and inhuman about the old Count, and he also discovers he's a literal prisoner in Castle Dracula, where his plight becomes more desperate as he realizes he's going to be left behind as food for Dracula's blood-sucking harem. Only by attempting a daring and dangerous escape--once Dracula has embarked on his journey--does Jonathan not join the ranks of the Undead; he lives to see another day, and marry Mina, his fianc.The second plot relays the Count's bloody entrance into England, and the courtship of Lucy, a dear friend of Mina's, by three love-sick suitors, and Lucy's mysterious illness.  Lucy continues to suffer from lack of blood, and Dr. John Seward, one of the suitors, sends for his mentor, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, who specializes in strange and rare ailments.  Despite John and Van Helsing's best efforts, Lucy continues to grow weaker; Van Helsing begins suspecting something supernatural is victimizing her.  Ultimately Lucy dies, yet Van Helsing suspects it is a false death, and that Lucy is transitioning into the unholy Undead.  Despite the vigorous protestations of her betrothed, Lord Godalming, and his friend Quincy Morris, the group opens Lucy's tomb to discover the professor is right--and that Lucy must be destroyed in order for her soul to be released.Finally, the third plot involves the Harkers, the professor, and the other three men entering a pact to find and destroy Dracula--no matter the cost.  As they seek out and desecrate the Count's many hiding places, Mina herself begins suffering the same as Lucy.  Running out of time, the men finally confront the vampire as he enters one of his abandoned properties; Dracula escapes, but realizes he's met his match, and flees England to return to his castle.  The group pursues, aided by Mina's connection to the vampire's mind, as he has forced her to taste his blood.  Splitting into three groups, the pursuers ultimately confront Dracula as he has a group of gypsies take his coffin back to his castle.  There is a violent struggle--and at last, peace.Told in the form of letters, diary entries, journals, and clippings by several of the characters, Bram Stoker's DRACULA is a page-turning masterpiece.  Again, contemporary horror buffs might find the writing style somewhat tedious, but for those who want to enjoy a suspenseful, frightening, and above all, wonderfully written tale of terror, this classic deliciously satisfies.--D.

"So I ventured into the world of lesbian erotica hoping to be captivated by a point of view unknown to me, along with a compelling story.  Marina Rice Bader's ANATOMY OF A LOVE SEEN misses the compelling mark by a girl power mile; this is a  2-hour snore fest that never finds a rhythm or pace, populated by petulant prima donnas.  The actual premise shows promise:  Two now-estranged lover/actresses (Sharon Hinendael and Jill Evyn) are called back by their director (Bader herself) to shoot a pick-up scene from the movie where they originally fell in love.  The scene is an intimate bedroom scene, making it a difficult proposition for the actresses and the film crew.  Yet this premise quickly erodes as the film meanders into countless temper tantrums and pouting sessions, all augmented by dialogue that's just plain goofy.  Halfway into this mess I was tempted to go buy some wine and ice cream and have a good cry.  After the movie was over I wanted to graduate to whisky shots.To be sure, both Hinendael and Evyn have some talent (and Hinendael is stunningly gorgeous), but not talented enough to overcome a tired, sophomoric yawner.  And the secondary story featuring Bader and her assistant (Constance Brenneman) trying to figure out the boundaries of their relationship was bizarre as it was unnecessary.  We're ultimately left with a sort-of butterflies and kittens ending, followed by the initial love scene that sparked the romance.  No doubt this was Bader's payoff to her audience for sticking it out over two hours of contrived banality; unfortunately it's not enough of a reward to overcome all the relentless boredom.  I'm not ready to give up on lesbian erotica, but ANATOMY OF A LOVE SEEN guarantees I'm staying away from the genre for a long, long time.--D.

"Critically panned and basically shunned when it made its theatrical run, I caught WINTER'S TALE on cable with exactly zero anticipation.  Knock me over with a feather!  This whimsical, magical, haunting tale of transcendent love is a definite keeper.  WINTER'S TALE is the story of thief Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), a 1916 New York troublemaker who's made a mortal enemy of the demon Pearly (Russell Crowe is terrific).  By chance, Peter breaks into the wealthy Penn household to rob it, and meets the beautiful--yet consumptive--Beverly Penn (the stunning Jessica Brown Findlay).  Beverly's days are numbered, yet the two instantly fall in deep love, and Peter decides if there's one more thing for him to steal, it is Beverly's death.  This yearning for a ""miracle"" makes Beverly the target for Pearly, who sends a goon to the Penn country estate to poison Beverly.  Peter is crushed, and his confrontation with Pearly and his men should have been his demise, yet Peter finds himself crawling out of the East River in the year 2014; it turns out he cannot die, for he is Beverly's miracle.  Destiny puts him in the path of terminally ill little Abby (Ripley Sobo), and her mother Virginia (Jennifer Connelly).  Peter discovers that saving Abby is his miracle, and after one more confrontation with Pearly (who is incensed Peter is still alive), a miracle does indeed take place.  The viewer then learns there is a close correlation between miracles. . .and the stars of the sky.Again, this is a beautiful, haunting film showing love is timeless and transcends lifetimes.  Other noteworthy acting performances include William Hurt as the Penn patriarch, Graham Greene as Peter's mentor and friend, and a cameo by Will Smith as the Judge (i.e., Satan).  Screenplay writer and director Akiva Goldsman bases WINTER'S TALE on the Mark Helprin novel of the same name; it's a novel I will definitely be picking up.  If one can get past the bad press and approach this film with an open mind, WINTER'S TALE will prove to be a most rewarding experience.--D.

"It was high school since I last read James Thurber's THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY, so it was fun to revisit literature's best daydreamer via Ben Stiller's offering.  My expectations pulling up a chair to watch this film were nada, so I came away most pleasantly surprised.  Stiller hasn't been in anything memorable recently, but here he's captivating and charming as Walter Mitty, a soft-spoken darkroom developer for the soon-to-be-defunct 'Life' magazine.  Walter goes about his tedious job quietly, harboring a considerable crush for a co-worker (Kristen Wiig) whom he is too shy to approach. . .but does he ever daydream about her.  (By far my favorite fantasy involved a spoof on Benjamin Button.)  Vagabond global journalist/photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) has sent Walter some negatives to develop; in particular, Sean instructs Life management to be sure to use Negative 25 for the cover of the magazine's final issue.  Trouble is, Walter can't find it anywhere, and as he knows his days of employment are numbered, he embarks on a spontaneous trip looking for the elusive reporter that takes him on adventures beyond his wildest fantasies--from Greenland, to Iceland, to the snowcapped Himalayas.  The story then neatly ties up a handful of subplots, with the finding of Negative 25 the ultimate payoff.  Again, this is one charming film.Stiller is stellar here (sorry, couldn't resist); he plays the introverted Walter with ""Aw, shucks"" aplomb.  The years of chain smoking and living on the edge have taken their toll on Penn, yet Shirley MacLaine seems ageless as Walter's somewhat overbearing mother.  Walter's nemesis is new boss Ted, played by Adam Scott.  Scott's performance?  He should stick to making vodka commercials.  Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed an actor by the name of Olafur Darri Olafsson, playing a drunken Greenlander helicopter pilot, a pilot who sends Walter directly into the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  Yet Stiller is the ultimate prize with this film, as both actor and director, and many of the vistas as Walter goes on his journey are literally stunning and breathtaking.  THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY is a definite feel good movie, a film daring you not to be charmed.  When's the next Air Greenland flight?--D.

"Based on a true story, a story about four Navy SEALS on a counter insurgent mission in the remote Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan that goes tragically awry, LONE SURVIVOR is a gripping, intense, and overwhelming story depicting a fierce determination to survive, no matter the costs.  The four SEALS, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster), are discovered by three goat herders wandering in the upper elevations of the mountains; thus the team has a dilemma:  kill the civilians, which violates the Rules of Engagement; tie them up and leave them to be found in the coming days; or let them go and abort their mission.  Unfortunately, the team chooses the third option, only to discover their location is too remote to communicate for a rescue chopper.  They encounter a huge force of fierce Taliban fighters, and an intense firefight ensues.  This violence is graphic and definitely not for the faint of heart.  All four of the men sustain severe injuries, and true to the film's title, only Luttrell survives the battle.  A local village comes to his aid, with one of the villagers hiding him in his house, and LONE SURVIVOR becomes a race against time to alert the military of Luttrell's location before the Taliban wipes out the entire village.All four of the actors are superb and incredibly believable, particularly as they sustain ever more severe injuries and realize the hopelessness of their plight.  Writer and director Peter Berg deserves similar platitudes for presenting such a riveting and intense story.  One star off due to the film's slow motion start, taking much too long to set up the main story; however, once the mission goes awry, LONE SURVIVOR moves at a breathtaking pace.  This is a true tale of courage and the indomitable will of the human spirit,  a tale enthusiastically recommended.--D.

"I have been an unabashed fan of SUGAR DADDY suckers since I was a rug rat.  The rich caramel taste, along with the long lasting endurance of these pops, have always been a hit.

Ah, pure bliss!As the years went by, Sugar Daddy and I drifted apart.  I never saw the candy on display at any grocery or convenience stores, so I just assumed the candy was no longer made.

"The Oklahoma Panhandle.  Many who live in the main body of Oklahoma--or travelers from north Texas or Arkansas--know it as a necessity to drive through while on their way to the Rockies in New Mexico or Colorado.  The fact is, it's not usually a destination.  So what is the history of this narrow, long strip of semi-arid land whose sparse inhabitants once contemplated forming their own state?  How is the terrain, as one travels from east to west in this rugged land?  And what kind of hearty souls not only live in the Panhandle, but WANT to live there?  The answers are provided in Sara Jane Richter's travelogue THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE (IMAGES OF AMERICA).Richter, an instructor at Oklahoma Panhandle State University, provides a plethora of information and photographs about this isolated land.  Most who have driven through this region know that a great deal of it is as flat as your coffee table, but Richter points out there are some contrasting geographical regions, including Black Mesa--Oklahoma's highest point--located in the far northwestern corner of the Panhandle (and the only part of the state on Mountain Time instead of Central Time).  We also learn about the hearty people who settled the area, from outlaws hiding from the law, to cattle barons, to ranchers and farmers and merchants and schoolteachers.  Page after page is archived by photographs depicting the land, or the people, or special events; by far the most interesting pictures (to this reviewer) show the devastation of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression.  The author has a determined affection for No Man's Land, and it shows in the pages of this book.  From Beaver to Texas to Cimarron Counties, the population is sparse--yet the vistas are endless.  THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE (IMAGES OF AMERICA) is an interesting introduction for those wishing to learn more about this rugged and isolated land.--D.

"Is LINCOLN Steven Spielberg's finest achievement?  Let's just say there's a lot of competition.  Yet the awards, the acclaim, the accolades, the audience reception of this remarkable film speak for themselves.  Telling the story of the last four months of our 16th President's life, LINCOLN focuses on the passage of the 13th Amendment--the abolishment of slavery.  The Civil War is winding down; Lincoln, fearful that his Emancipation Proclamation which declared the slaves war contraband would be struck down by the courts, takes on a sense of urgency to pass the amendment in the month of January, during a lame duck Congress.  With a slim Republican majority, the president is going to need some Democrats to join the Republicans; fortunately, there are 64 lame duck Democrats--who just might be looking for patronage jobs come March.  Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), the president's right hand man, recruits three self-proclaimed ""scoundrels"" (James Spader, John Hawkes, Tim Blake Nelson) to approach these Democrats in an effort to ""buy"" them off.  The machinations of this sausage making is fascinating, and as a Confederate delegation reaches General Grant (Jared Harris) to discuss a cessation of hostilities, the story becomes more layered and compelling.  We all know from history the amendment passes--narrowly--and LINCOLN then focuses on the ending of the brutal war--and the tragic ending of the president's life.Daniel Day-Lewis is an extraordinary actor, and here he gives a spellbinding performance as the tall, slender, introverted, brooding, careworn Commander-in-Chief.  Yet the actor conveys another layer to this complex man; Lincoln might have the weight of the world on his shoulders, but his wit was always razor sharp, and he could relate a plethora of stories at the drop of a hat.  Day-Lewis makes this film work, and work exceedingly well.  The entire cast is stellar, but in particular I was most impressed by Tommy Lee Jones (fierce abolitionist Congressman Thaddeus Stevens), Sally Field (a shrill, feisty Mary Todd Lincoln), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (eldest child Robert Lincoln, who desperately wants to get in the fight), James Spader as referenced above, Bruce McGill (fiery Secretary of War Edwin Stanton), and Jared Harris as General Grant in what was comparably a very small role.  Numerous actors have relatively brief roles as Congressmen or telegraph operators or staffers, yet everyone meshes in elegant believability.This Blu-Ray edition offers several bonus features; all of them are very good.  From interviews with Spielberg, the cast, and the production crew, to showing us how the film was shot in Richmond, Virginia, to behind-the-scenes looks at sets, costumes, props, and musical scoring, it's all material that enhances the viewing experience.  Spielberg has made several remarkable films.  There would be no objection from this reviewer to make the argument that LINCOLN is this filmmaker's very best.--D.

"Jim Butcher can flat out spin a yarn. . .and wizard Harry Dresden can darn sure narrate it.  GRAVE PERIL, the third installment of the highly popular Dresden Files series, has but one major theme:  Something, or Someone, has been stirring up the spirit world; in essence, ghosts are going postal, causing mayhem and carnage throughout ChicagoLand.  And one particular demon--so powerful it can attack its victims in their dreams--seems to be obsessed with wreaking havoc on Harry, Karrin Murphy of Chicago's Special Investigations Unit, and a handful of other officers involved in the arrest of one very destructive sorcerer.  Harry suspects the source of this demon's power has something to do with powerful vampire Bianca, and those of her ilk in the Red Court.  And what better way to have all the suspects in one spot than to attend a Vampire Ball?  Accompanied by Michael, a Knight of the Cross who is Harry's sidekick in this installment, Harry sets Bianca's ball on its fang-infested ear.And makes for one grand fun read.Red Court.  Black Court.  White Court.  White Council.  The Nevernever.  Faeries.  As this series moves along, Butcher establishes more and more the machinations of Harry's supernatural world.  And in GRAVE PERIL we're introduced to a plethora of new characters, including Michael; the sensuous faerie Lea (Harry's ""godmother"", a most dysfunctional relationship); Thomas, an irresistible hunk to the ladies (probably because he's a ""sex"" vampire); and the deadly Mavra, a translucent vampire of the Black Court.  And in this installment we learn that Harry has more than just a physical interest in Susan; and Susan, as the novel concludes, has one whale of a dilemma herself to work through.With a constant quip at the ready, Harry's tongue-in-cheek style is always funny and vibrant.  Even when Harry is surrounded by what appears to be insurmountable danger, he never takes himself, or his situation, too seriously.  Action-packed from beginning to end, GRAVE PERIL is a page-turner that will have the reader asking just one question:  When can I get my hands on the next volume?--D.

"A film about a brooding, depressed, self-esteem-challenged 14-year-old does not, on its face, sound appealing or entertaining.  Add to the mix an overbearing new boyfriend for the teen's divorced mom, a mom seemingly content to look the other way in her desperation not to be alone, and even more angst and misery seems eminent.  But director/writer/actors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash have waved a magic wand over their delightful film THE WAY, WAY BACK, as this charmer is a keeper.  It's tender, poignant, funny, and uplifting--with a twist of defiance in the end that can't help but make a viewer smile.  When said teen is dragged against his will to accompany his mom and boyfriend to a summer resort--a resort with a very special water park--the magic of THE WAY, WAY BACK begins weaving.The cast is exceptional.  Steve Carell plays boyfriend Trent, a less than savory, pretentious, transparently fake rogue, with the wonderful Toni Collette as teen Duncan's mother, who finally realizes the proverbial line has been crossed.  Kudos to young Liam James as downtrodden Duncan; over the course of this film, Duncan takes an amazing, life-changing journey.  Yet the true scene stealer is brilliant Sam Rockwell as Owen, the ""developmentally challenged"" manager of Water Wizz, the local water park.  I'm used to seeing Rockwell in dark, often sinister roles, so here the actor throws a sensational change of pace; as Duncan's mentor and ardent supporter, Rockwell is funny, yet compelling and very strong.  Other cast members include Maya Rudolph as Owen's often-frustrated girlfriend, and Allison Janney as next-door neighbor Betty, who can't live life to its fullest enough.  Even Faxon and Rash have small, yet satisfying, roles playing employees of Water Wizz.

"On its face, HITMAN is preposterous.  A suit-wearing, cue-ball assassin being pursued by legions of suit-wearing cue-ball assassins. . .all with bar codes on the back of their heads, as Agent 47 overcomes overwhelming odds to take down a diabolical Russian mobster and foil Interpol all at once.  Yeah, pass me the vodka.  Yet with a grimacing, unemotional Timothy Olyphant blasting his way through this ridiculous caper, the viewer never, not once, thinks this actor is taking himself seriously; Olyphant is having loads of fun, and he's inviting us to come along for the ride.Accordingly Agent 47 fights:  at the train station, all over a church, even in a five-star restaurant bathroom.  He never sleeps, he rarely smiles, he's always two steps ahead of Interpol and his pursuers, and he's determined to protect a vagabond hooker targeted by the mob (the incredibly scrumptious Olga Kurylenko).  He even relies on the CIA itself to pull his chestnuts out of the fire.  The way Olyphant plays this cat, Agent 47 could read the phone book and be cool.  The action is fast-paced and furious, the violence gratuitous yet oh so awesome, and the plot predictable yet supremely delightful.  If you want to watch a nonsensical movie (based, of course, on a video game) that will have you do nothing more than giggle with prurient glee, pull up a chair and take in HITMAN.  Now I'm wondering what Olyphant's bar code would register at Wal-Mart.--D.

"I pulled up a chair to watch THE HANGOVER PART III with much trepidation and scant anticipation.  I dreaded another more ratcheted up version of the classic original, which was basically the case for Part II.  Instead, THE HANGOVER PART III has a delightfully original plot, pays subtle homage to both of its predecessors, and even brings back a couple of characters from the original that are fun to say hello to again.  And even though there is an ominous undertone to this version (in the form of a threatening mobster, played by the always superb John Goodman), the Wolf Pack members demonstrate their ineptness over and over again, from getting trapped in the basement of a bad guy's mansion, to scooting down tied-together bedsheets from atop Caesar's Palace.  And is it ever fun to watch.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha all return as Wolf Pack members Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug. . .and no HANGOVER version would be complete without the outrageous antics of Lesley Chow (Ken Jeong).  Look for brief appearances from the original by Heather Graham (the now-reformed Jade) and Mike Epps (""Black"" Doug); and Melissa McCarthy joins the cast as Cassie, a dysfunctional romantic interest for Alan.  THE HANGOVER PART III gleefully blazes its own plot trail, refusing to be a copycat of its two predecessors--although the closing credits bring a brief blackout scene that promises to be--in two respects--rather jarring.  And based on the demise of a giraffe, some fighting roosters, and a couple of guard dogs, this is not a movie that PETA is going to endorse.  If this is indeed the end of the HANGOVER franchise, THE HANGOVER PART III is a more than worthy finale.  Nice to see that Wolf Pack ride off into the sunset.--D.

"I've never tried absinthe, never been privy to this opiate's ability to bring to its user vivid and fantastic images, sights, and sounds.  Yet something tells me watching a Baz Luhrmann film is akin to drinking absinthe; I became a fan of this creative director ever since I was floored by his amazingly bizarre Moulin Rouge.  And his latest offering, a provocative version of Fitzgerald's classic THE GREAT GATSBY, evokes the same sensations:  vivid, brightly colored images; anachronistic music; wild party shots almost to excess; haunting sights transposing to another scene; eerie animation; and acute attention to detail.  Luhrmann weaves all of these mind-altering components like an enchanted sorcerer, making his THE GREAT GATSBY one entertaining experience.We're all familiar with the fatalistic, tragic story.  And the cast does an admirable job bringing Fitzgerald's characters to life; Tobey Maguire lends credibility to Nick Carraway's initial naivete, giving way to anguish and despair; Leonardo DiCaprio keeps getting better and better, and here he doesn't disappoint as the ever-optimistic Gatsby, forever pursing that green orgiastic light; and Carey Mulligan is a pseudo weak link as pampered, indecisive Daisy Buchanan.  Of the remaining cast, I especially enjoyed Joel Edgerton as the philandering jock Tom Buchanan, and the scrumptious Isla Fisher as Tom's mistreated mistress Myrtle Wilson.  But again, the real star of this ensemble is Luhrmann; he brings his version of THE GREAT GATSBY to pyrotechnic life like a master craftsman.  So as far as the absinthe, I'll pass.  I've seen heady images, compliments of Luhrmann.  That's psychedelic enough for me.--D.

"I had no idea A WINTER HAUNTING is a quasi-sequel to the novel Summer of Night.  I purchased A WINTER HAUNTING because the novel's plot looked interesting--and because Dan Simmons is one gifted writer and storyteller.  English Professor Dale Stewart is, to say the least, having one whale of a midlife crisis.  He's left his wife and daughters for a dalliance with one of his grad students. . .who in turn dumps him.  Sleepless and in the throes of massive depression, he botches a suicide attempt.  Desperately wanting to get his life back together, he takes a one year sabbatical from the University of Montana to go, against his psychiatrist's pleading wishes, to his boyhood town of Elm Haven, Illinois, to write a break-out novel.  Dale hasn't been to Elm Haven in over 40 years, following that horrid summer of 1960, when his boyhood chum, Duane McBride, was killed in an unspeakable ""accident"".  And Dale has chosen to rent the abandoned McBride farmhouse to write his novel.  There's no cell phone signal, no land line, and the entire second floor has been sealed off with layers of plastic.With a setup like that, count me in.Here Simmons patiently sets up a story about Dale's journey into further darkness.  And the author is talented enough to show us the musings between Dale's ears--a cross between fear of going insane, to self-deprecating dark humor.  A laptop that turns itself on, showing cryptic messages; an old radio in the basement that's constantly playing; the county sheriff, the bully of Dale's childhood; some sneering skinheads; a pack of barrel-chested dogs surrounding the house; and a light that comes on in the sealed-off second floor--these are the ingredients that threaten to push Dale over the edge. . .if he's not there already.  The ending is predictably bloody and brutal, with just one development that threatens to have the reader eye-rolling with annoyance, followed by one majestic and utterly surprising plot twist.  Wonderfully written and marvelously paced, A WINTER HAUNTING is an edge-of-your seat mesmerizer.--D.

"Nothing like a little slight of hand to stir the excitement juices.  But when four magicians--aided by a mysterious and anonymous third party--come together to rob a French bank, the FBI comes calling, and the charms and outright fun of NOW YOU SEE ME come to the forefront.  Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher (wolf howl), and Dave Franco play the magicians; naming themselves the Four Horsemen, they rob the French bank doing a show in Las Vegas, steal all the money in their greedy benefactor's (Michael Caine) bank account in New Orleans (distributing over $140 million to the audience), and pull off the climatic show in New York by stealing a safe from a corrupt manufacturer containing half a billion dollars.  All the while a debunker of magic shows (Morgan Freeman) continues to warn the FBI Agent in charge of the investigation (Mark Ruffalo) and his Interpol counterpart (Melanie Laurent) that law enforcement is being set up for the ultimate comeuppance.  Yet there is a surprising (and very satisfying) plot twist showing ultimately who gets played the fool.  Accordingly the four magicians join the Eye, the metaphysical level for elite practitioners where magic really is magic.This is one fun romp.  The pacing and plot and acting are all fast and furious, as the Four Horsemen are always one step ahead of their pursuers.  And it's a good thing NOW YOU SEE ME gets out of the gate and moves; if it slowed down where the viewer can actually think about the plot and how the ""magic"" is performed, the movie would unravel in a heartbeat.  Thankfully such is not the case here, making NOW YOU SEE ME a thrilling, entertaining, and very fun ride.  Highly recommended.--D.

"Gable and Laughton.  Brando and Howard.  Hopkins and Gibson.  We all have our favorite pairing of Christian and Bligh.  I have few problems with any of the three--although Brando's version is the most foppish Fletcher Christian of all.  (And his English accent is atrocious.)  In any event, the 1962 remake of the classic tale MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY has become a classic itself--even though it was not well received back when it was released.  Marlon Brando brings his own brand of roguish charm as second officer Christian; Trevor Howard portrays Captain Bligh as a sadistic, almost evil, tyrant.  (His version of Bligh is easily the least likable.)  We're all familiar with the tale of HMS Bounty, commissioned in 1789 to sail to Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants to feed to slaves in the British Empire.  In order to reach their destination before the plant's dormant season, Bligh is ruthless with his crew, pushing them ever harder to save time and sail faster.  Officers and sailors alike become disgruntled and demoralized, and Bligh's behavior draws the ire of Lt. Christian, who although he follows captain's orders is developing a disrespectful attitude (and from Bligh's perspective the disrespect is mutual).  Yet the Bounty reaches Tahiti, and here the crew receives a long overdue respite, and enjoys spending time on the island--and in the arms of the gorgeous native women.  Several members of the crew are sorely tempted to desert, yet none do as the Bounty, now loaded down with breadfruit plants, sets sail for Jamaica.It is on this leg of the journey the men revolt.  Because the plants need plenty of fresh water, Bligh cruelly rations it for the men, hanging the water ladle from the top mast.  This is the tipping point; once a crewman weak with thirst falls to his death, Christian seizes the Bounty, placing Bligh and those still loyal to him in a schooner to be cast adrift.  Christian is of course tormented by his actions, realizing the Bounty will be on the run for the rest of its days.  The ship returns to Tahiti to collect natives who wish to accompany the sailors no matter where they go.  An island that is coincidentally misplaced on all shipping charts by hundreds of miles is selected, and even though Christian is convinced the Bounty should return to England to plead the crew's case, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY ends quite tragically.I enjoyed watching a very young Richard Harris play disgruntled Seaman Mills; other solid supporting roles include Hugh Griffith and Gordon Jackson.  Again, Brando is charming and Howard quite evil, the cinematography often majestic, and the story timeless.  If you haven't seen this 1962 version of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, you're not doing yourself any favors.--D.

"We're all familiar with Jackie Robinson's story, how he was the first African-American to break the ""color barrier"" of major league baseball, making history in 1947 as first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Yet the highly inspiring film 42 takes away the nuance of such a statement and gives the viewer the stark, brutal, ugly racism that Robinson endured--not only from a skeptical public, but from his very own teammates.  There are several scenes that are downright jarring, and through all the hostility it was Robinson himself who had to exercise herculean self-control.  (Easily the most jarring scene takes place while Robinson is at bat and simultaneously being viciously taunted by Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, played by Alan Tudyk.)  Yet it's Robinson's playmaking abilities on the field that begin to win hearts and minds, as the Dodgers come together as a team and make their historic pennant run in the summer of 1947.  So in addition to the historical ramifications 42 is also a compelling, highly entertaining sports movie.Chadwick Boseman gives a commanding performance in the lead role, depicting Jackie Robinson as a determined, gritty professional focused on not only making the team, but succeeding at the highest level of baseball.  Nicole Beharie is solid as Rachel, Jackie's always-supportive, constantly-worrying wife.  Yet the cast excels by veteran actor Harrison Ford's portrayal of Dodgers GM Branch Rickey, a compassionate, yet tough-as-nails pioneer determined to bring the first black ballplayer to major league baseball.  Sporting shaggy eyebrows and constantly holding a half-smoked cigar, Ford's Rickey sets the National League on its proverbial ear, and is it fun to watch.  Finally, I also enjoyed Christopher Meloni as my-way-or-the-highway Dodgers manager Leo Durocher.  Meloni gives his white players a spring training dress-down that had me grinning ear to ear.  42 has everything, from compelling drama to outstanding baseball action to absolute inspiration.  This is a film that will have you cheering from your chair.--D.

"With it rapidly approaching 4,000 reviews, I'm not going to rehash the plot of AVATAR, which has literally been seen by billions.  This is (was?) a groundbreaking film when released in 2009; and although the plot is unoriginal and predictable, the process and technology creating another world, Pandora, populated by the Na'Vi, 10-foot tall, blue-skinned natives--all the product of motion capture technology by the various actors portraying the humanoids--are stunning.  I've seen AVATAR on cable several times, and while I'm not enough of a fan of the film to purchase this 3-disc extended collector's edition, I do give kudos to James Cameron and his very talented team of filmmakers; these pros have successfully created a very believable world inhabited by very believable natives and wildlife.  This film is a stunning visual feast.And this doesn't even consider the minutiae--like creating a whole new language, for goodness' sake.  Again, I am in total awe of the process involved bringing AVATAR to life; no telling how many countless hours were involved, on the part of thousands of people, during production and post-production, to make this film a reality.  Finally, although leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana give solid performances, I really enjoyed the second tier of the cast, including the sizzling Michelle Rodriguez (Trudy), the menacing Stephen Lang (Colonel Miles Quaritch), Joel David Moore (Norm), Dileep Rao (Max), Giovanni Ribisi (Parker, in charge of running the mining operation laying waste to Pandora; he's a scoundrel, but you can't help but like him), the incredible Wes Studi (Eytukan), and Laz Alonso (Tsu'tey).  These actors fill in the various gaps quite nicely.  No, I'm not endorsing buying this collector's edition--but I highly recommend, if you're one of the ten people who haven't seen AVATAR, to watch this incredible film.  And if you become a huge admirer and fan, then this 3-disc spectacular is going to be right down your alley.--D.

"SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD is a definite genre bender.  It's a comedy with a definite dark edge (the end of the world, anyone?).  It's also a tender, poignant love story portrayed in a heartfelt manner, a love story centering around impish free spirit Penny (Kiera Knightley), and moody, despondent, down-to-earth Dodge (Steve Carell).  Talk about bad hair days.  On the day Dodge and his wife learn that super asteroid 'Matilda' is going to strike the earth in three weeks, ending human life, his wife literally bails.  Facing Armageddon alone, Dodge is depressed and in despair; the only sympathy he collects is from a stray Heinz 57 mutt.  Meanwhile, humanity has transitioned into a handful of layers:  the hedonists, who are going to party until the party's over; the deniers, who continue to live their lives like they always have; and those who cannot handle what's taking place, and select suicide.  Into this mix comes Penny, a neighbor of Dodge whom he barely knows, who has some of Dodge's mail going back three years. . .including a letter from Dodge's high school sweetheart, where she proclaims Dodge is ""the love of my life.""  And Penny, whose family is across the pond, wishes to get back to them to spend the last remaining days with her loved ones; thus a road trip is in order, a journey to find Dodge's old flame, and a journey to seek a way to get Penny aboard a plane (the airlines have shut down).  And the road trip depicts the overall charm of SEEKIING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD.There are some true comedic moments in this film, yet the underlying love story, an evolving affection between Penny and Dodge as they embark on their trip, trumps the comedy.  The emotional climax begins when Dodge and his father (Martin Sheen at his best) reconcile, having been estranged for years, and ends with Penny and Dodge holding one another as Matilda literally can be heard entering the earth's atmosphere.  It's a dark, bittersweet ending; kudos to director Lorene Scafaria for not coming up with some lame ""solution"" (e.g., Matilda miraculously misses the earth).  A tad uneven with a tendency to meander, SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD will still put a smile on your face--and a lump in your throat.  Yes, opposites do attract; and I'll never listen to The Hollies' ""All I Need is the Air That I Breathe"" ambivalently again.--D.

"I do understand why CLOUD ATLAS was not a blockbuster.  At over 170 minutes, it's a long movie to sit through.  And the movie is a tapestry of six story threads, all taking place in different locales, and in different historical eras.  The thread ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"", taking place in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2321, is particularly difficult to follow, as the story suggests English as we know it has been altered to an almost unrecognizable dialect.  Next in difficulty is the story ""An Orison of Somni~451"", taking place in a futuristic Seoul where a food-serving clone becomes the focal point of a revolution.  Based on the above, I understand why CLOUD ATLAS never found a huge audience.  I had to view this film three times to get an adequate feel for it, and now I am a total fan; once the extended DVD with its special features is released (and I'm hoping this will be the case), I will be adding CLOUD ATLAS to my DVD collection.Extolling the theme that over time our lives are a mosaic that intertwine and affect other lives, CLOUD ATLAS is a moving, haunting film focused on the obscure musical composition 'Cloud Atlas Sextet'.  Including the two stories referenced above, other threads include a shipping voyage in the South Pacific in 1849; a dysfunctional musical collaboration in 1936; exposing corrupt big oil in 1973; and a delightful romp in (and from) a senior center in the UK in 2012.  Most of the cast appear in all, or some, of the separate threads, as different characters (obviously).  And what a cast:  Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent (the lead in ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"", by far my favorite story), Hugo Weaving, Doona Bae, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant, to name but a few.  You're guaranteed to get a kick out of Tom Hanks playing thuggish indie author Dermot Hoggins in the ""Cavendish"" thread, where he gets the ultimate revenge over a most disagreeable literary critic.  And throughout the six threads, the haunting musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and Tom Tyker only enhances the surreal film-viewing experience.  All six stories overlap to some extent--share a metaphysical commonality--making CLOUD ATLAS come together full circle.  No, this film is not for everyone; I'm just delighted it so appeals to me.--D.

"For the sake of getting it ""out there,"" I thought the original was corn pone supreme.  (Who can forget, even though I know I've tried, the image of James Brolin sitting in that chair, pulling at his hair, and screaming, ""Mother of God!  I'm falling apart!""  Blech.)  So this 2005 remake of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR at least gets some kudos for some disturbing images and goose-bump-inducing special effects.  We should all be familiar with the ""true"" story of a family of 6 getting brutally murdered in November of 1974 in an old, gothic, colonial house in Amityville, Long Island.  And a year later, a young family moves in. . .and proceeds to cross into the major dysfunction dimension, with George, the patriarch (Ryan Reynolds), losing the most marbles.  It's all predictable, and often silly, but if you just go with the flow it's more or less a palatable supernatural adventure.Ryan Reynolds has at least ten (count 'em) layers of annoyance; in THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, to my delight, his annoyance layer is at but two or three.  I think he's a better fit for a genre like this than all those nutball comedies he did a decade ago, but I digress.  He's paired with a very stunning Melissa George playing George's wife, Kathy Lutz.  The Lutz children are played by Jesse James, Jimmy Bennett, and Chloe Grace Moretz.  There's a wrinkle here in that the children's actual biological father has died, so George is getting to know his stepchildren--in a haunted house, which is a recipe for malfunction and mayhem.  George begins to feel the ill effects of the house almost immediately, while the children are all affected differently, from seeing and hearing disturbing spooks in the bathroom, to making invisible friends.  But again, we all know where this is headed, with the house ultimately winning, taking George to the brink of killing his family, and an over-the-top ending with a shotgun and an axe that's fitting for this genre.  It's uneven, with its share of good and lame, but at least this version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR does not lend itself to the outright comedy of its predecessor.--D.

"Helen Hunt, have you come a long way since 'Highway to Heaven'.  In the terrific independent film THE SESSIONS, this versatile actress boldly plays a sex surrogate introducing fragile Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), a man in his thirties who has lived the bulk of his life in an iron lung, to erotica and human intimacy.  And bold may not be a strong enough word; as a surrogate Hunt's Cheryl character leaves nothing to the imagination as she helps Mark lose his virginity within the six ""sessions"" she has allotted him.  Yet I'm getting way ahead of myself.Hawkes, a remarkable character actor, completely carries this film--and never gets off his back.  Based on a true story, Mark O'Brien is a talented poet with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor regarding his polio; he's also a hopeless romantic yearning to discover the joys of sex, augmented by a fierce Catholic upbringing, so the conflict he's feeling is dynamic, to say the least.  He befriends an open-minded priest (William H. Macy is fantastic), and, although the padre is less than comfortable with the subject matter, he nonetheless helps Mark take his journey of self-discovery.  As does Mark's helper and caretaker, Vera (a stunning Moon Bloodgood).  Mark calls upon Cheryl to help him lose his virginity, and over the course of their sessions, both persons are moved and emotionally changed.  Cheryl, especially, is touched, as she finds herself falling in love with her soft-spoken, yet eager, disabled client.  Ultimately, this puts some strain on her own marriage, as her husband (Adam Arkin) is not happy with how the sessions are progressing.  The conflicting emotions cause the sessions to end prematurely, yet Mark has been changed enough by his experiences with Cheryl to move on and actually enjoy the few remaining years of his life, culminating in a loving, long-term relationship with a warm caretaker, Susan (Robin Weigert).  *Spoiler alert!*  The film ends with Mark's funeral, where as he mentions, in narration, he's fortunate enough to have three women he's loved in attendance.THE SESSIONS is of course an adult film, yet it is also a tender, compelling, very believable story about the never-ending will of the human spirit.  Often witty and clever, always engaging and poignant, this is a film not to be missed.--D.

"Look, I get it.  THE HOBBIT is a whimsical children's tale, about a hobbit and 13 dwarves and a wizard attempting to recapture Erebor from Smaug, the fire-breathing, greedy (original 1 per center) dragon.  Dwarf names like Ori, Nori, Dori, Kili, Fili, only lend themselves to the light-hearted nature of this tale, originally written and published for children around 9 to 12 years of age.  It was a far cry from Tolkien's much more ominous, dark, brooding 'The Lord of the Rings'. . .which is why I'll never understand why terrific director/producer/writer Peter Jackson would even try to make such a silly story into a massive, three-part epic.  In order to do this, Jackson had to go back and mine the Appendices, and backstory, of 'Lord of the Rings'; the villain of this first installment of THE HOBBIT, Azog, is a product of the Appendices.  So what we have here, although it's a beautifully crafted, well-made, visually impressive film, is a 3-hour cartoon, sans the utter darkness of Jackson's previous presentation of The Lord of the Rings.  It is a wonderful film to watch, augmented by Howard Shore's haunting musical score, but it's an uneven, often thinly-veiled depiction of what should be a two-hour light snack.I've got no problems with the cast, either; Ian McKellen returns as the wizard Gandalf, and Martin Freeman turns in an outstanding performance as Bilbo Baggins, 60 years previous than the Ian Holm depiction in 'Lord of the Rings'.  Other solid performances include a stern-looking Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, and I especially liked the performances of Graham McTavish (Dwalin), James Nesbitt (Bofur), and Aidan Turner (Kili).  From the original 'Lord of the Rings' production, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis, all return for brief appearances.  Yet the whimsical, child-like nature of this film springs forth in spades, from the gaudy haircuts/outfits of the dwarves, to the animated hordes of Orcs; again, all of this lends itself to the notion that THE HOBBIT in its entirety should have been a lighthearted, two-hour film.  It was grand to revisit gorgeous New Zealand, a character in itself as Middle Earth, and was grand to meet once again all the characters we have come to love from 'Lord of the Rings'.  But Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT:  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, the first installment of a massive three-part epic, is a mile wide, an inch deep, and a visual cartoon that meanders a tad too long.--D.

"In THIS IS 40, writer/producer/director Judd Apatow revives the family of Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (real life wife Leslie Mann), the dysfunctional couple that played second banana in his previous hit Knocked Up.  And in this repeat, real life daughters Maude and Iris once again play the brooding offspring.  With Pete and Debbie both reaching their 40th birthdays simultaneously, THIS IS 40 depicts the couple's reaction to this milestone--coupled with outside factors, from Pete trying to keep his troubled record label afloat, to Debbie discovering she's pregnant.  And the results are:  total ambivalence.  They're up, they're down; they're going to split, they've reconciled.  They lay an egg for a 40th birthday party, they share a good laugh in the ER.  He's worried about hemorrhoids, she's concerned she no longer looks sexy.  And so on, culminating in an overall feeling of. . .nada.The supporting cast is a mile wide and an inch deep, beginning with Albert Brooks as Pete's freeloading father, the total opposite of John Lithgow, playing Debbie's very distant dad.  Jason Segel is Debbie's trainer, Chris O'Dowd is one of Pete's obnoxious employees, and Megan Fox supplies eye candy in spades.  Even the voice of Tatum O'Neal is furnished as a realtor helping the couple decide whether or not they should downgrade.  There are humorous moments, there are boring moments, but overall there are non-moments; THIS IS 40 tries to depict a couple having a midlife crisis, but with a story so ambivalent not even Pete and Debbie bother to care.--D.

"Now that baseball's postseason is upon us, there's not a better time to take in a baseball movie.  I missed MONEYBALL when it made its theatrical run, even though I wanted to go see it, but I digress.  Thanks to the wonders of cable TV, I've seen it several times; this account of the 2002 Oakland A's is a keeper.  In particular, it's the story of Oakland's GM, Billy Beane, re-inventing the wheel.  Being the smallest market in all of baseball, Oakland constantly has its most talented players getting snatched up by franchises that can afford to pay them tens of millions.  While most GMs would take the leftovers and try to remain competitive, Beane wants to win.  He wants to win with second and third-tier players.  How?  Statistics.  Winning in baseball is all about getting on base, whether it be hitting or walking.  And winning is about chasing starting pitchers off the mound by the 5th inning, which entails every batter going deep into the pitch count with every at-bat.  So. . .which players on Beane's roster have the best on-base percentage--and the discipline to go deep into the pitch count at the plate?  It's all in the statistics.  And those that boast the numbers get to play, to the consternation of everyone else in the Oakland organization, from the manager to the scouts to the front office. . .to the players themselves.Brad Pitt is solid as Billy Beane.  He's not pretentious or petulant or angry or bitter; he's just a soft-spoken former player with a passion for winning--and a no-nonsense approach to running an organization.  And Jonah Hill is superb as nerdy Peter Brand, a Harvard economist Beane hires to help him crunch the numbers; Hill plays off Pitt's quiet demeanor with ""aw, shucks"" gushiness.  Of the supporting cast, I especially liked Philip Seymour Hoffman as Oakland manager Art Howe; Hoffman depicts Howe as the overwhelmed skipper he must have been.  Naturally the team stinks as the season begins, yet Beane perseveres, and over the course of the summer the team comes together and goes on a remarkable run, culminating in winning the American League West.  (Which I readily remember.)  Although it meanders from time to time, MONEYBALL is a feel-good story that, yes, wins.  It's a solid triple, right in the gap.--D.

"Alrighty, then:  I'll show just how old I am.  My parents took myself and my siblings to see THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX at a drive-in theater when it made its theatrical run.  And even back then, all those years ago, I was immersed in the film's story about a cargo plane wrecked in the Sahara, its passengers exposed to the brutal elements, and the unrelenting will to adapt, overcome, survive.Since that night, I've seen this film numerous times; it's one of Hollywood's true classics.  When a ragtag group of soldiers and roustabouts become stranded in the middle of nowhere, every element of the human condition presents itself:  blaming the crafty veteran pilot (James Stewart's finest role, in my humble opine); the pilot's booze-soaked co-pilot, who always seeks compromise (Richard Attenborough); a doomed march for rescue conducted by a by-the-book British officer (Peter Finch); a lowlife pretender who feigns injury to avoid said march (Ronald Fraser); a nutcase who was already bats even before the crash (Ernest Borgnine); and a megalomaniac airplane designer who dares to suggest the passengers can build another airplane from the wreckage and fly to rescue (Hardy Kruger).  It's a dysfunctional ensemble for the ages, yet the group comes together to defy the impossible and build The Phoenix, then pull the aircraft to the nearest ridge for take-off.  Battling thirst, hunger, incredible heat, dust storms, and some hostile locals, THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX depicts the passengers' grit and determination; this is yet another fitting tribute to the unwavering, indomitable human spirit.--D.

"I had no idea Billy Joel came out with this single in the late Eighties.  I came across THE DOWNEASTER 'ALEXA' while watching The Hangover Part II.  I grew very intrigued by the haunting music I heard on the soundtrack as the guys flew to Thailand for Stu's wedding.  So I Googled it, and found the single, and knew this Billy Joel solid track about a fishing boat facing rough times had to go on my Zune.No dispute that Joel is a terrific vocalist, and this single demonstrates his remarkable range.  Yet the beauty of THE DOWNEASTER 'ALEXA' is its haunting melody; it's melancholy and uplifting, simultaneously.  And the song is equally haunting, as a fisherman takes his boat on another excursion--even though he knows his career farming the high seas is long over, due to economic hard times.  It's a tribute to the human spirit, which strikes a chord in a listener like me.  As to the other three tracks on this CD. . .forgettable.

Nobody grabs my bag by mistake.Materials and construction have proven top notch. If I could add one feature it would be a flat fabric loop on the face between the shoulder straps for sliding the backpack onto the extended handle of wheeled luggage.The water bottle pocket works well for 20 ounce bottles or less. There is an elastic loop that you can cinch down on your bottle to hold it in place.I shopped every brand of laptop backpack before settling on this model.

"If you look through my reviews you will find a headphone junkie. I have many. My favorite lightweight is the Sony XBA single driver with iPhone controls. Cheap, tiny, sounds great. Weaker bass though.I have many that match or exceed the price of this RHA headset. I listen to them all the time. But when I'm out, I usually have this RHA headset putting the tunes into my skull.Why? Because it is tough, it works well, it sounds great and it's comfortable for hours. A great combination. Do I have better sounding headphones? Yes. But they are expensive and not as obviously tough as these. They are indoor phones. These are go-anywhere phones.Most of my headsets didn't need burn in. These can benefit from some time playing. They sound a lot more precise after a couple months' use.

"Like many out there, I have the Tascam 30 pin stereo mic. It was about 20 bucks, and is a huge bargain at that price. But landscape video is out of the question.This mic, an improvement on Zoom's IQ5, allows proper l-r stereo when recording video in proper landscape mode. It will cost you more than the old Tascam, but it actually does a job the Tascam will not do.The mics are decent quality, nothing special. A decent hand rig with a shock mount is highly recommended if you want to get the most out of your iPhone's video capability and the IQ7's sound abilities.

"I have IEM dementia. Spent hundreds if not thousands looking for iphone headsets that work for me. I've had Monsters, Shures, Etymtics, Audio-Technicas, Sonys, JVCs, multiples of some of these brands and many others.For exercise you need something that is cheap, lays down a good beat, has low cord noise and stays put in your ears. Because you are going to beat on them. I like Nixon Micro Blaster phones. I can find them on eBay for around $16 shipped. Their over-ear cords keep the noise down and stay put. Sound is great for something so cheap.For airline travel, train commuting, or lawn mowing/snow blowing, you need seriously damped sound isolation. I like Etymtic's HF3 for these times. They feature a truly fine sounding single balanced armature design and hands down the best microphone in the Apple headphone industry. And their true deep insertion design allows real near total physical sound isolation. Not for use when you need awareness of stuff going on around you.For compromise use in just about any situation, I have preferred Sony's XBA1i single balanced Armature model, which is now discontinued but can still be found NOS for under $30. A very fine inexpensive headset with refined sound and light compact design. Lacking in deep bass like the Etymtic but sounds just beautiful anyway.I have left the Sonys home for these new Senns. The Momentum in-ears have surprisingly balanced frequency response for a dynamic design. Fast and engaging midrange and acceptable highs. Best sounding dynamic IEM I have, better than my much-loved metal bodied JVC Micro HD Carbon Nanotube Japan imports.And very solid bass without overplaying it like those ridiculously tuned Beats. I have some very expensive 4-driver Sony balanced armature phones and these sound as good in most aspects for a third of the price. Sony's hybrid BA/dynamic designs deliver more engaging sound but boy do you pay for it and they're HUGE. Ditto JVC's multi-driver dynamics.What Sennheiser has done in this $100 package is deliver a headset that sounds wonderful and is an acceptable compromise of the virtues discussed above such that if you only want to own one pair of headphones this Momentum IEM is a strong contender. Excellent small size, comfortable shape,decent shallow-insertion isolation, beautiful sound with great bass, good cable, mic and remote, durable construction.All for the market sweet spot price of a hundred bucks and worth every penny.Some aftermarket Comply-type foam tips can improve isolation still further if you wish, and there are triple flange insertion tips out there that will turn these guys into true isolation stars. I don't like either of those options and find the included silicone tips to work great.In short, these are great, bone stock right out of the box. If you are so interested that you are reading customer reviews, consider this a full-throated endorsement from a true IEM junkie.My new all-around favorite. The Sony single BA is relegated to listening in bed. I still recommend it, but these have real bass, stay put better, are far better built and more comfortable.Total win. Best IEM I've ever tried from Sennheiser.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21W282226GJVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3RFFZ2#wasThisHelpful","R21W282226GJVN","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""salad spinner"" mop is not a gimmick. It really does help you get your floors cleaner and is usable on all types of hard floors including expensive hardwood you want to clean without water seeping into joints.This one is a minor step up in construction and durability over the one you see on tv with the plastic foot pedal that looks like it will be the first thing to break. I've used this mop for two months now on every square inch of hard flooring in my house and it has performed better than any other mop or wet jet thing I've tried. If you mop everything weekly, you will only need cleaners in the water occasionally.When mopping up spills, this thing shines. It can soak up a huge amount of crud, release it in the bucket, come back to the spill damp and clean up the rest. By far the most time consuming step in spill cleanup is filling your bucket.Most of the time I only use white vinegar in my mop water but there's nothing wrong with a little pine sol with this mop. You can spin as little or as much mop water out as you want before hitting the floor.I also have a large bay window behind a sectional sofa with big horizontal blinds that need to be dusted occasionally. The second microfiber head is what I use on that handle to get to those blinds without having to move the couch. Hallelujah, it works. Overhead dusting can be done with this mop. Just understand the shape limits the spaces it will fit. It still works for me. I put it in a bucket of clean water after initial dusting, spin the heck out of it so it's almost dry, then go over the dusty trouble spots again.Heads are machine washable and reasonably inexpensive.There are more expensive spin mops out there for commercial duty, and cheaper ones too. This one seems to hit the sweet spot: a mop and bucket that doesn't cost much more than a standard mop and bucket but outperforms the heck out of them.I'm sold on spinner mops. This one has been good so far.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBU2OTJMEYDQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9G4V7W#wasThisHelpful","RBU2OTJMEYDQA","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upfront: I have some expensive multi-balanced armature phones from the likes of Shure, Sony, and Etymtic. Some fairly pricey dynamic cans from Audio Technica, JVC (a favorite), Monster, Klipsch, Sennheiser and a bunch of others.I have cheap ones, expensive ones, open fit, canal fit, on-ear, you name it. Quite a few that fit a little better, sound nicer, have a better mic, or are better built.But for sixteen bucks shipped, this is the most extreme value I have found in iPhone compatible IEMs. They sound the best of all sub-$20 earphones I've ever listened to. They could use a chin slider and that's the only knock I'll give them at this price. For another dollar or two I'll take a bit of memory wire over the ears please.They sound smooth and huge, if a bit veiled at the top end. Very neutral and pleasant, non-fatiguing sound, and physical comfort for my ears is top notch.I could have gone out with my super duper Sonys or Shures, but I'm out and about, listening to these Nixons, happy as can be.

"Wow, such nitpicking.First of all, this type of shelving has ALWAYS used wood composite for the shelves. Rapid Rack, Gorilla Rack, Edsal, whoever. You can't buy these without particle shelves. I have had my Gorilla racks in my basement for 16 years, moved multiple times. Some corners have been knocked off in all that repeated disassembly and reassembly but I've never had to replace a shelf. They were the strongest racks I owned before this one.My newer Gorilla racks have thinner steel and thinner laminated particle board. They are rated for less weight but more moisture resistant so they're in the garage. They survive moving much better than the originals do.Now, this Edsal rack. Its frame is far heavier duty than anything else I have. It is a hero of a shelf. You can get these $30 cheaper from the Sam's Club website.The thin, light shelves are similar to the ones in my newer Gorilla racks. They are all most will ever need. I needed a little more strength so I grabbed some construction adhesive and some Hardibacker board, cut to fit and glued to the underside of the stock shelves. You can do the same with light gauge OSB and skip the glue. Just put the stock shelves right on top of your OSB for any shelf that needs reinforcing. I just used what I had and it added enough strength. Adding an OSB shelf under the stock unit will be stronger. Gluing them together will be stronger still, if you won't need to move in the future. I'd just throw the nice one over top of the strong one. Any home improvement store will cut to fit for you.The fit and finish of these shelves is outstanding, though much heavier than the old Gorilla designs (which Edsal also makes for less money).I would not worry about the thinness of the included shelves. These are so customizable that if you need to hold an anvil on one of your shelves, a $10 board from Home Depot will make that a cinch. The rest can stay stock for easy moving.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3B4X2A4MZ7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD5O11A#wasThisHelpful","R3E3B4X2A4MZ7K","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"lucky me, these fit my outer ear as if they were custom fit. I've been a big fan of Sony's hybrid ear tips since they were introduced but never heard a pair of Sonys I wanted to own until now.I own phones from Etymtic (a favorite), JVC, Ultimate Ears, AKG, Audio Technica, Hifiman, Monster, Sennheiser, Incase and others. Since my phone has become my go-to music player, I've gravitated to high efficiency IEMs with iOS inline remote.Of that group, these Sonys are clearly the best for music. For calls, Etymtic has that superior mic.I have Sony's XBA-2ip and several of their 1ip buds, which are the best balanced armature deal on the market now and the best sound per dollar you can probably buy right now. They're discontinued so buy 'em up while you can.Back to the 4 driver Sonys. Quick rundown: fine isolation with hybrid ear tips. You can get better noise isolation with a pair of Etymtics but you have to jam them halfway into your head. Comfort on these, even with their bulky housing, is great. Sony should not have discontinued these but made them available with a custom ear mold.Sound is as clear as the single driver XBA-1ip but with more sparkling highs and much deeper, more solid bass. You can listen to these at quite moderate levels to great enjoyment. They can go very loud if you wish to deafen yourself but there is no need. They just sound beautiful.For calls, the mic is above average and the controls all work right.Which brings me to my main concern here: durability. Any pair of headphones with a retail price of over $200 should come with a detachable, user replaceable cable. These do not, so when the cable fails you're hosed.I guarantee when that happens, I will be pulling out the EarPods from an old iPhone box, some heat shrink tube and solder, snipping the pods off the ends and DIY'ing some Frankenbuds.These are way too good to toss when the cable goes bad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ARLWJ79LU1GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006K55716#wasThisHelpful","R1ARLWJ79LU1GR","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a point of reference, my home cans are Sennheiser HD650s driven by a very nice sounding Creek amplifier.I buy a lot of portable headphones for the iPhone. I have a few pricey ones like a pair of Etymtic ER4s with custom ear molds and a very fine sounding pair of Ultimate Ears Triple.Fi multi-driver balanced armature IEMs that have a ton of bass.I have had dozens of inexpensive IEMs from just about every manufacturer in the sub-$100 market. Dollar for dollar, JVC's carbon nanotube Micro HD buds are outstanding like most of their Micro HD line. I've had Monster Turbines, Beats (too tipped up in the bass department), AKGs, Denons, Klipsch Image phones (pretty good value there), and an endless parade of small manufacturers' buds.These are not tipped-up bass monsters. If they were, I'd have no use for them. If you like accuracy with a dash of smoothness at an amazingly low price, the Sony single driver BA buds are your friend.The tiny size of this model makes them ultra comfortable for hours of fatigue free listening. Listen to your classical or jazz favorites on these and you'll understand why I like them so much. They make a very good seal with Sony's hybrid tips and that seal really helps the bass. I can listen for a long time at low volume with these and their non-fatiguing sound and shape is a joy.Sony has discontinued their BA only line so you have to get their hybrids if you want these nice BA drivers.

"I use and recommend Oregon blades for lawn equipment. I go through about three edger blades per season, or at least I did. The steel in these Oregon blades looks and feels the same as the stuff I've been putting on my Power Trim edger for years.But now, it is October and I've only changed edger blades once this year. Oh, it needs changed now, but I think I'll make do with the nub of the first Oregon blade for the final mowings of the season, then put a new blade on to be ready for spring.So I now have these three replacement blades for the single Oregon blade I bought last May.

"We recently sold our home and went back to being renters.

"I am the proud owner of 4 different sizes of flat, black-seasoned, smooth-as-a-baby's-butt Griswold skillets. 2 of these were rusty when I found them and required full cleaning and seasoning to get up to snuff. But my favorite one has been done right and has been smooth ever since my grandmother got it in the 1920s.She told me, ""never use soap on these. It'll take off that nice smooth black seasoning."" And she was right--80 years ago. Soaps back then had caustic agents such as lye or borax that would strip a cast iron skillet so fast it would make your head spin. If you look hard enough today you can still find some cleaners that contain these caustic elements. But all liquid dish detergent is perfectly safe to use with your cast iron and will not harm your beautiful seasoning in any way. I've been cleaning my Griz with a splash of hot water, a drop of Dawn and a nylon beaker brush for decades. Cleans swiftly and completely while leaving seasoned finish intact.So when somebody tells you not to use soap on your cast iron, tell them, ""Eww. Remind me not to eat at YOUR house!"" Just clean it while it's nice and warm, rinse well, paper towel dry, put it back on the burner for that last bit of heat dry, then paper towel it with a little bit of peanut oil or lard. Lard gives you the nicest black seasoning because of the unique way it interacts with cast iron. When I restore a pan I coat it sparingly in lard, leave it in a medium oven for a while, then give it another very thin rubdown of lard and repeat. Pans turn blacker and smoother with lard than any other fat known to man, including bacon fat. And it doesn't take much.I have quit using my stone for pizza now that I have this. It is really good. Somebody said to preheat the Lodge pan before putting your pizza on it, and that works if you aren't using the press-to-pan method of stretching your dough. If you do press dough into this pan, no sweat--just put your crust in to bake 5 minutes before adding sauce and toppings and you'll be fine.I use cast iron for corn bread, brownies, frittatas, pies, cobbler, bread pudding...anything you want to put a tender crispy crust on. Pizza is a natural candidate. You will enjoy the results. My old pizza stone now lives in my kamado as a heat diffuser--and still gets pizzas thrown on it in the grill, and they are very nice. But the quality of my crusts is better using the Lodge pan, even though the smoky char flavor of a grilled pizza is appealing. Lodge wins for me.Now wash your cast iron with a drop of modern detergent and hot water with a stiff nylon brush. The gunk will come right out, and the pan will come out beautiful, clean and as perfectly seasoned as before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMHLBWFSVFXM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000E2V3X#wasThisHelpful","R3KMHLBWFSVFXM","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stowaway Products sells this same exact set on their website for the same sales price...but they have a flat U.S. shipping fee of 5 bucks, compared to $12.50 through Amazon.So I got mine direct from the manufacturer and saved a little money.This is a fine product; the plastics do not melt when you put hot curling or flatirons in them. And the shape is perfect for 99% of the blow dryers out there. This is ""found space"" in your bath. The price, 45 bucks with shipping, for a couple pieces of injection-molded plastic and a couple hinges, seems steep, and you could indeed fabricate a shelf on either side and attach it. But the design here works quite well given the attachment points available in your average vanity. It needs to be lighter weight than the plywood you'd probably use, because there isn't enough supporting structure for a heavier shelf. I thought of cutting a bookmatched pair of 1/4"" plywood shelves to brace under there. but the attachment points are a bit flimsy for such a flat item. This design is lighter weight, allowing you to use the strength of the available fasteners to hold your blow dryer and irons.So yes, with ten bucks for a small piece of plywood, some hinges, some backing brads and a band saw, you could make a shelf around your sink that would do this job. but this kit is ready to go now, and does the job better.

"I have had a large procession of battery cases for iphones 3g-4s. Some were good, some were cheap, and the last three for the 4s were under 20 bucks and excellent.The problem for the iPhone 5 is Apple's bonehead move of putting the headphone jack down where all battery cases, docks, etc. are going to be. So if you are used to listening to your headphones while your iPhone is docked at your desk, kiss that goodbye unless somebody comes up with a dock with its own auxiliary headphone jack--a possibility.For now you are forced to use Apple's own execrable phones, which are pretty much the only phones that will fit through any kind of hole a company can leave in their battery case, or constantly switch cases.And the iPhone 5 needs a case--I found that out the hard way already with a drop that deformed the aluminum unibody shell to the point that it was unrepairable but that a simple case would have prevented. The only reason the phone wasn't in a case was because the case was charging and I was intending to use headphones. I have a slim case but hadn't snapped it on because frankly, switching cases back and forth to accomodate the twin needs of headphone use and battery charging is a pain in the butt.This case addresses that problem neatly. The permanent slim case affords protection when you want to use your headphones, and you don't have to take it off when you want extra battery life. Yes, it is thicker than a standard Ringke Slim case (my favorite iPhone 5 case) to accomodate the keyhole fit design. Yes, it is thicker than other battery cases because you get to keep your slim case on your phone.But if your problem with the iPhone 5 is the same as mine, where you need extra battery and use headphones a lot, this case is state of the art right now--the ONLY battery case out there that addresses this need.I have an idea that will work, it just depends whether Mophie or someone else will implement it. Mophie addressed this problem with the iPod Touch by integrating a 3.5"" plug in the case next to the dock connector, then wiring in a separate 3.5"" jack on the case. Yes, that takes up space and adds a little bulk. But for so many of us who have a nice pair of headphones, the status quo is just not acceptable yet.I do like this case. With improvements in battery life to the iPhone 5 (much better than the 4 and 4s), the battery in a case doesn't need to be as large to accomodate travelers and power users. 2k mah is plenty now. I do prefer to carry my phone without the battery case, except on days when I know I'll be traveling or working late.I also did a funny thing--I took a pair of Etymotic HF3 earbuds whose cable had failed, and frankensteined them onto the cable/inline remote of the EarPods that came with the phone. The remote and mic work great, and the phones are COMFORTABLE and great sounding as is the case with all Etymotic products. All I'm missing is Etymotic's high quality mic, which blows the Earpods' junk mic into the weeds. Can't have everything, I guess. The upside is that this pair of Frankenstein buds works with all the battery cases out there now and unlike the Earpods, it sounds good and the buds don't fall out of your ears. I did this because I had the buds to work with and I was so frustrated with not being able to use good headphones with any battery case, including Mophie and other expensive ones out there.This 2-piece solution from Maxboost allows me to use any cans I want, and I have a lot of them, and still retain the option of battery life extension without having to constantly switch cases. It's an intelligent solution for a problem that didn't need to happen. Apple, put the headphone jack on top where it belongs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BTW69ZJF3GGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B2CFCR6#wasThisHelpful","R1BTW69ZJF3GGA","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are lots and lots of better blow dryers out there for over $100. There are some that may be slightly better in the $80 range. And there is a teeming universe of crap in the $20-$30 range that we've all owned examples of.I wanted better than box-store quality and will not pay the price for the stuff the pros use. This blow dryer is one of the only ones in that in-between ""no man's land"" that is too expensive for the average consumer and not quite durable enough for constant professional use.It is a GREAT step up product, with better power and lower noise than the best $30 blow dryers. Especially if you have lots of thick hair, the BaByliss will significantly cut your mirror time and will give most a better feel to their hair.What a difference ten bucks makes.

"Arcoa's E-Z Reachers are the class of a crowded field. They produce a wide variety of lengths, with some more delicate than others to suit for the intended task.I use this one down in the laundry area in the basement--the basement stairs are our ""laundry chute,"" so we always have a pile of clothes on the floor there. I can pick up anything and everything with this guy, from little nylon stockings and footie socks to jeans--though my preferred method with jeans is to grab the end of a leg and bring it to my open hand, then toss them into the rolling laundry cart. It's capable of lifting jeans, but it's easier to do them this way.I live on a main thoroughfare and have neighbors with big old oaks, so before mowing I always have to pick up branches and sometimes a piece of litter thrown from a car. I use the E-Z Reacher Outdoor Pro with rubber cups instead of silicone for the yard. The stainless ""fingers"" are a bit sturdier so it can lift more weight, and the rubber tips are better suited to heavier items, not so much little delicate things.I started my Pikstik journey with one of those folding things from TV, bought at Wal-Mart. It was fantastic for about a week and then it broke. So I bought a Pikstik and though it is more durable it has some design flaws that make it less useful for me. I keep it in the kitchen now--still very useful for my high shelves.After the Pikstik showed me what was possible I started doing some real research. There's a trash picker called the Grappler that is really good for outdoor work; almost got one of those. But since this E-Z Reacher worked so well helping me with the constant chore of laundry, I decided to go with the heavy duty version for outside. I can see where if I had bigger stuff to move the Grappler-style hawk beak picker would be better. But for what I do this is ideal--though with some heavier garments I sometimes wish I'd opted for the shorter 24-inch model of this same tool for increased leverage and less fatigue to my forearms.Realize when you use one of these things, they can't do everything. Heavy items are beyond the scope of this type of tool, as are large or awkwardly-shaped items. You can pick up a tennis ball with this, not a football. If you misuse it, it is possible to break it, though staying within its parameters, I don't see it happening.Arcoa's stuff is lightweight, but much heavier duty than most of their competition. They also sell replacement silicone or rubber tips that screw right on, so your main wear item is fully replaceable. If you need something heavier-duty than this, they have a ""pro"" model like the one I use outdoors. Anything sturdier than that, those products are out there, but most of them are not listed in the ""home health aid"" category but in professional sanitation-worker equipment catalogs. If you are looking for a reach aid in your home, you have found the best all-around tool.Be sure to look at their entire range of products, choose one with the replaceable rubber or silicone suction cup tips, and choose the one that looks best for your needs. I went for the heavier 'Pro' model for outside, and sometimes I use it inside as well. But it uses a little more hand strength and is slightly heavier. This lighter model puts less strain on the forearm and hand muscles, and has more than enough strength to do the job I bought it for.Five stars for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LCK9S8W41UWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001FA69L8#wasThisHelpful","R3LCK9S8W41UWL","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everybody with a riding mower has something like this--the lightweight mower for getting under trees and around fenceposts, tight bed edges, mailboxes, creek slopes and edges with dropoffs your rider doesn't like. The lighter the better, because if you're using it to mow the grass around your creek you don't need any extra weight. I can get the whole job done--riding my 3/4 acre, trimming the weird spots, weed whacking and blade edging, sweeping up and blowing the excess back into the lawn, in about an hour. A lightweight trim mower really adds to the speed and ease of the job. This one has been reliable and as simple as I want it to be.It can be your main mower if you have less than a quarter acre of mowable grass. Good power, good looking cut. I personally prefer a mulching deck to side discharge for that though. Doesn't matter for small trim jobs, but if I were looking for a main mower I'd be looking for a mulcher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZYM1GMKTIUJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002PD3MFA#wasThisHelpful","R1ZYM1GMKTIUJE","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I use these in my Oldsmobile along with their sister hi-beam bulbs. Their color temperature is several degrees cooler than the stock halogens, which means you don't get as good performance in foggy conditions as with halogens. But for 99 percent of the time they're much better, and their fog performance is fine. I installed the hi/lo version of these in my wife's older Infiniti, and replaced the stock fog lamps with PIAA yellows, which really cut through the fog.I like them because not only do I get added visibility but they also aren't blue like so many of the lights you see on cars that get the ""brother package.""

"When I mow the lawn, I have an iPod Shuffle that requires inline controls to work. The HF3's Apple control works perfectly. The isolation provided by the triple flange tips means I can put the volume at a very moderate level, and the drone of the mower is nearly inaudible. So they actually protect my hearing.Sound quality is great--a lot of bassheads hate these, but then the stuff they like sounds like muddy boom-boom to me, so I guess there's no accounting for taste. If your taste in sound runs more to Musical Fidelity and Mark Levinson than to Sony or Skullcandy, you might like these quite a bit more than the phones the bassheads prefer. They are not the last word in resolution or bass response, but they are mobile phone IEMs that have an inbuilt mic of exceptional quality (Ety is, after all, a hearing-aid manufacturer), good noise isolation, and a very good price/performance ratio.You can buy other headphones with slightly better sound for the $125 you're likely to spend on these, but not with an inline Apple remote. Hell, I own a few buds that cost significantly less but are just as enjoyable to listen to as these, without inline controls and mic. At this price point, these are pretty much the best you can get in Apple buds and they are very good indeed.I took the EarPods that came with my iPhone and snipped off the drivers--they sound fine but are excruciating in my ears and fall right out as well. But the cord was what I was after. Took the cord from the complimentary Apple buds, and soldered the drivers from my JVC HA-FXC80 to it right below the earhooks. The JVCs cost me $33 and after some EQ they sound very, very fine--maybe as good as these Ety IEMs at a quarter of the price. I use them a lot because they are way more comfortable than these Etys with rubber sleeves. They can't compete in isolation, though. When I'm using a mower or traveling by plane, I take the Etys and enjoy the silence. And if comfort is an issue, Shure Olives fit just fine on these so for the price of some isolation (but still way better than my JVC/Apple Frankenbuds) you can have a very comfortable fit and great, great sound.So if great sound and isolation without EQ or the work of modification are worth the extra hundred bucks to you, this Ety is worth your consideration. For comfort, the Shure sleeves are fantastic. Worth the price for me, and they are the most expensive buds I own. I've listened to some really expensive Shure IEMs, and they sound better. But do they sound $300 better? For you they might, but not for me--and their inline mic/remote setup is only a one-button affair that you have to buy separately.There are a lot of big phones with inline mics you can try for this price. I stay away from them because when I'm home I just listen to my vinyl on my big KEFs, and when I'm out I wouldn't know where to put a big clunky pair of over-the-ear phones. So I'm an IEM guy. If your preferences are like mine, you should give these an audition.UPDATE: I accidentally ran these through the wash yesterday. I went through my pants pockets and forgot the velcro cargo pocket on the thigh. The small filters kept the water from reaching the balanced armature drivers, but I had my doubts about the survival of the mic and inline controls--and wouldn't have been at all surprised if there'd been no sound coming through the right side where the remote is.Put them in and...sound from the right but not the left! A quick filter change and I got great sound--indistinguishable from new. The play/pause button worked, but the volume controls were dead and the mic was non-functional. Decided to let them sit overnight and dry out. This morning the volume controls work normally and so does the mic! So lucky me--except for an early death for a pair of filters and a pair of Shure Olive eartips, these things came through with flying colors.I do not recommend doing anything as stupid as running a $150 set of IEMs through the wash. But I'm happy to report a near miss with these--everything still works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MGKPV4YSOGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007NTFTLG#wasThisHelpful","R33MGKPV4YSOGK","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, there are NO cheap earbuds that sound right without EQ, and many whose sound will not really be improved even when you EQ the hell out of them. The JVC Micro HD driver, fortunately for headphone abusers everywhere, is EQable to a very fine degree. The C80 is even more EQable than the workhorse Micro-HD C51, itself a really great budget earbud.Out of the box, the midbass on all Micro HD phones is overboosted. The low bass below about 35 Hz is a bit lacking because of the design of the tiny in-ear driver. Both of these situations can be fixed with a parametric EQ such as Accudio Pro for iOS. The guys at Accudio, with their calibrated mics in a B&K head dummy, have even provided a custom ""flat"" EQ curve just for this model. I found it a bit sterile by itself so I boosted the low bass band just half a notch.Any electronic EQ is going to introduce artifacts into the sound and Accudio Pro, while designed and maintained by music lovers, still adds a tiny bit of hiss to the mix. Inaudible except in the very softest passages, the real improvement you can get out of a cheap pair of C80s on an iPhone or iPod Touch with this EQ outweighs that for me.So let the review state that if you enjoy overboosted bass, especially midbass, you might love these right out of the box. I love them because their sound isn't so far from flat that a good EQ can't render their sound very, very fine.I love the earhooks that come in the package. Although they make insertion more difficult, the over-the-ear position kills almost all cord microphonics endemic to in-ear designs. Meaning you won't hear every movement of the cord thumping through your skull. Also, the driver design means that for some people these will try to work their way gradually out of the ear canal, and the earhooks are effective at preventing that.What these lack is an option to buy with an inline 3-button remote and mic. Lucky me, Apple included a pair of their new Earpods with the iPhone 5, and while those sound fine they don't fit my ears at all. But the cord and mic are great. So I got out my trusty soldering iron, some shrink tubing and a heat gun, and made my dream cheap iphone buds by frankensteining the JVC drivers onto the Apple cord. It works magnificently. And my kid has a pair of Earpods with a black cord!Once again--out of the box, these are fine, sound great for a pair of $35 buds. Hard to find anything better at this price point. But after searching for quality EQable inexpensive IEMs for years, and owning a rather large collection of them, I can tell you that this is the best sub-$100 IEM after EQ that I have ever tried, and in this configuration it sounds comfortably better than a lot of IEMs that cost $150 or more, even if you EQ them too. So if you are willing to do the work to get these to sound good, they can sound very, very good. Earhooks make them fit securely and comfortably, without annoying cord noise. And if you have a cheapo pair of Apple buds that suck but include an inline mic and remote, these cheap buds are not above a head-swapping mod, which is very straightforward. Just leave enough pigtail to get the earhooks on, if you want them, and measure the Apple cord so the mic hangs where it can pick up your voice right, and there you go--for a little work, a free ""donor pair"" of Apple buds, and some EQ, your $35 bought you a pair of IEMs that can compete in the $200 price range.So I think these are a steal. If you love your music but are as unwilling as I am to spend hundreds of dollars on earphones, these can be a great solution for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UBD46G6L08SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AIL2HY#wasThisHelpful","R3UBD46G6L08SC","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"...about 1.5 cheers for Carson's version of science. It is demonstrably true that ""Silent Spring"" lent the popular political voice that led to the worldwide ban of DDT and the subsequent deaths of millions upon millions of primarily black children in Sub-Saharan Africa.It is also apparent from her own words that Carson understood the tremendous humanitarian catastrophe that would result from a ban of DDT and it was devastating to her. So to those who call her ""the Hitler to the black race"" I say walk a mile in her shoes before you pass judgment.However, to those still living who also understand the untold human suffering and death brought about by the unthinking environmental stampede to ban DDT because of Silent Spring, and who consider those millions of dead black children an acceptable price for Eco-purity, I don't know what to say.I do note that, though she wished it were not so, the most enduring impact and legacy of the whole body of Carson's work remains the Sub-Saharan Negro Holocaust of malaria victims, and any book on her legacy that omits this elephant in the room fails somewhat in its mission--unless the mission is hagiographic in nature, intended to whitewash the worst of this most influential environmentalist's effect on our world.

"If you have some shrimp in the freezer, then with a few crushed peanuts and some pea pods and a zucchini you can stir-fry up a super-fast lunch or dinner with this sauce.Is it the same as those great street wok carts in Bangkok? Umm, no.  But real fish sauce and decent tamarind paste are a little hard to come by in central PA, and this is a very good commercial alternative. Plus every street vendor makes their sauce a little different anyway. No two are the same yet it's all pad Thai. Taste of Thai also makes good stir fry rice noodles for pad Thai. Vary your veggies for what's fresh, pad Thai is more about the noodles and sauce anyway. Some of the best pad Thai I've ever had didn't have any veg in it. Hell, I like this stuff just with noodles and shrimp. Squeeze a little lime juice on it at the table and it's great, or crush a few peanuts and chop some cilantro to go with it. Love the pea pods though, and thin slicing or julienning a carrot in there is not a bad idea.Just make sure you only stir fry ONE SERVING AT A TIME. Trying to stir fry more than that releases so much liquid from your meat and veg that you wind up stir poaching them instead.

"I'm a dedicated iPad retina owner, and I love it for its window on the web. Its Kindle app is quite usable and the extra size can be nice. But what it isn't is portable in a lot of cases. Sure you can lug an iPad around, but in certain circumstances it is cumbersome, or you just don't want an $800 device on you, like at the park or the beach. Reading on the iPad is nice in a recliner where you can rest the beast on your torso, or at your desk where you can lay it down on the angled smart cover. In bed it sucks. The Paperwhite is the best thing to happen to in-bed readers since The Clapper.This is a great device. I personally love the implementation of the LED lights with the high tech light diffusion screen material. I don't require a perfectly even white page; I require sufficient reading light. If you want a Kindle with perfectly even color, turn on the light in your room or go outside in the sunshine. If you need a light up Kindle with perfectly even color, the Kindle Fire HD will do that for you, plus a lot more besides. Battery life is not so great, but you do get other benefits with it being an Android based tablet. You can use the Kindle app on the tablet you already have. But if you read good old-fashioned paper books, you'll notice there is a play of light and shadow that causes uneven color on the page in almost every possible reading situation. The perfection some seek has only become possible because of computer screens. If you find variations in color ""distracting,"" it's a wonder you ever read anything at all before books became available on backlit displays.This is my third Kindle e-ink reader, and my umpteenth Kindle when you count daughter's Kindle Fire and the multiple Kindle apps on phones, computers, PDAs and tablets over the years. We own a Kindle 2 which is still going strong, as well as a latest-gen Kindle Touch. We are a Kindle family. I bought the Paperwhite because there are multiple comfy chairs in my house that do not have sufficient reading light, and the Kindle Fire is ""not mine."" Very happy with the lighting on the display. The fact that there are multiple lights shining on it is not the least bit distracting for me as it seems to be with some nit pickers. But I do have my own nit to pick, having spent twenty bucks to opt out of Kindle's ad-supported discount program.I got my paperwhite, got it all updated with the Kindle library locally on the device, went to the home screen to choose a book, and there was an ad for ""Fifty Shades of Sex Perversion"" right there where I would never dream of placing the actual e-book. Annoyed, I chose my book and got to reading, thoroughly enjoying the reading experience.But next time I went to choose a book, there was Fifty Shades of Crap again. Now I was getting mad. I did some research and found that for a while after the Paperwhite's introduction, owners were unable to turn these ads (""recommendations"") off. But by the time I got the gadget, it had a software revision that allowed me to go into settings and disable the ads.So interesting that you can pay for an 'ad free' product and they put ads in your face. Then when users complain about the deception, they say ""Oh, we've updated the software so you can turn those ads off now. We made you pay twenty bucks so you can have the option of going into settings and clicking the opt-out button."" Now, there are people for whom ads make no difference at all. Just tune 'em out. They can easily deal with the page space being crowded by advertising. Others flat out will not deal with it because it wrecks their Kindle experience. Not that Amazon is so stupid they need this advice, but here goes:Dear Amazon,The extra 20 bucks I sent you is your clue that I'm opting out of ads on my Kindle. For 20 bucks a pop you can write the software so that ads are an opt-in instead of an opt-out--or just pay some min-wage monkey to go into the Kindle's settings and opt out before you ship the device to me. I don't care what you do. But don't do this again. Don't send me a Kindle with ads on it when I'm paying for a Kindle with no ads on it. I already opted out. Don't make me do it over again. Makes your company look stupid and greedy rather than brilliant, which is what the Paperwhite is.Bottom line...happy customers, happy company. Especially when it costs you nothing to do it right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZXLK8BRWM586/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OZNZG0#wasThisHelpful","R1ZXLK8BRWM586","A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am TERRIBLE about facial care. Cleansers, creams, collagen and a thousand other non- C-words are just the type of the iceberg of things I am clueless about. Some of it (like makeup) are because I'm that balance between ""Not Giving a Darn"" and ""I Prefer Sleep Thankyouverymuch""; others (such as facial cleansers), it's because I'm good old fashioned lazy.So while I'm probably not the best person to judge this, based on a counter full of similar competing cleansers, I can at least give a beginner's opinion of the product. And that one is: it seems to do the job nicely, cleaning my skin, clearing up blemishes, yet having a clean, pleasant smell and washing out nicely.The smell is particularly pleasant - light ""ocean"" or ""fresh air"" scented. I love that it's a scent without being too ""in your face"". Application was easy; the bottle delivers a small dime-sized amount which is more than enough to properly wash your face. The texture is smooth and dense, so it's probably better to lather in your hands before applying to the face. Regardless, it goes on smooth and clean. Rinsing is likewise easy; it doesn't slide off with one splash of water, but neither does it stay on like a mask.I definitely enjoyed this product for the time I've used it. The only ""problem"" is that, given my history with washing my face, I don't know that the price (now unavailable, but I swore I saw $17) would be worth it. I tend to be that person who buys beauty products, uses them a couple of times, realizes what a pain in the rear they are and forget about them for 6 months before the cycle returns.

"Spending time in England this past summer gave me a deeper appreciation for tea - I mean, growing up, drinking it properly also helped, but England has some AMAZING teas that really make me love drinking tea nearly as much as drinking coffee.This tea was pretty good. It was flavorful and tasty - even if it came across as a bit bitter (my steeping method, perhaps, which involves me leaving the tea bag in the cup until I remember to remove it?). The weirdest part, though, was that a lot of tea seemed to leak from the bags and pile up at the bottom - like a fine sandy type ""film"". I've never seen tea bags do this - tea leaves, duh, it's somewhat inevitable. But I thought the point of bags was to keep the tea out of your cup?I wouldn't mind drinking this brand again, but this will not be my go-to brand like Twinings or Steven Smith Lord Bergamot or Ahmad tea.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"About the most jewelry I wear is earrings. I love earrings - particularly dangly ones. But being a somewhat / part-time girly-girl, I also have expanded my jewelry collection to necklaces and earrings. Being a nerdy girl means that things like the Pi symbol and the Infinity symbol also make me squeal.Pros:+ I love the rose gold color of the necklace! Gold itself is so harsh; my favorite is copper, but rose gold is a close second.+ The pendant is fun and cute! I love that it's just a plain Infinity symbol and not with a bunch of words like ""Forever Love"" or something else that means you can only wear this is your are in some committed relationship.Cons:+ The chain is flimsy as heck. It's so delicate and thin that I thought I would break it just by holding it.+ Similarly, the clasp is tiny and hard to put on. I had to ask my sister to put it on the first time. The second, I had to bring it to the front so I could see what my hands were doing.+ It hangs oddly. Due to how the chain is connected to the Infinity Symbol, there is the potential for the symbol to be lopsided and look rather strange.Honestly, while I like the concept and the rose gold, I don't really like the necklace itself. As I said above, the chain is so delicate and tiny, I feel like if I sneeze, it'll break. The chain is also very short, so it's nearly a choker (well, not really, but it's a lot higher than most necklaces I wear).

"I run, and after a run, I'll occasionally partake in a smoothie or protein shake.This shake is MESSY. The bad is impossible to seal, even with the ""Ziplock"" at the top, so look forward to a film of white powder over everything. Especially after digging inside this bag for the spoon.The back says to use 8 - 12 ounces of water per cup of powder. My running partner and I used 10 oz at first, and I gagged several times. Admittedly, his snarky warning, ""This doesn't taste like soy AT ALL"" didn't help, I'm sure, but the taste is pretty - THERE. And it wasn't one of the flavors and textures I find appealing. I did drink all 10 oz, but man, that was a chore!The second time I partook (once again with running partner), I tried to do only 8oz. This time it had the texture of pudding - but nowhere near that lovely taste. I had to add water, it was just too hard to pour and swallow. I managed to only gag once, early on in the endeavor. My running partner, however, powered through and chugged the whole thing.I suppose if you are vegan, well, this might be it or nearly it for you if you want a protein drink. In that case - I'd probably recommend just making a kale smoothie. I mean, this stuff did blend well (with those blender cups), but the taste and texture combination was awful. When the best thing you can say about it was, ""At least I gagged only once"" - maybe it's just not for you.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I'm not like super experienced with earbuds, but I've owned more than a few brands in my day. The critical components of a good set of earbuds is pretty obvious: sound quality and sturdiness followed by price. (For me, it's also the color, as I love pink, but beggars can't be choosers.) And if you are judging Lenovo earbuds by those qualities, well, they end up firmly in the middle.They are about $20, so that puts them in the ""modest priced"" category - above the ""I just need a pair to ignore that kid on the plane and I left mine at home"" set. And for a $20, they are decent. Quality is OK - not sure what they mean by ""extra bass"" because I don't hear it. (Am I already deaf or do I not have the EAR for that? Get it?! ""EAR for it""?!!) I have zero use for the microphone, but the play/pause button works for the iPod classic from 3000 years BC (aka, the one I bought in the late 2000's), so there's that. It's weird to have the cord be long and thin, but I haven't found too many awful tangles. Maybe also it will stand up better to use and not crack near the plug?! We can dream, right?This set comes with a weird flexible plastic thingie that I guess you use to wrap them up when not in use? I don't know, I've never used it for anything but a fidgeting tool. Also, this has three different size ear inserts, though I always use medium. The fit of the earbud in my ears is weird, and even though I do nothing but sit with them in, they are constantly falling out. I shudder to think what would happen should I use them on a treadmill!If you want a set for listening to an audiobook, this isn't a bad one to go with. It's also decent with music, though I wouldn't brag about ""extra bass"". Also, if you have a use for the microphone feature, it's probably gonna work for you too. And I'll keep an eye on the cord, see how that long, lean feature works.

"This is a review in two parts: a review on Poo-Pourri the product in general and Poo-Pourri the Rose Geranium scented product specifically.When I first saw that infamous commercial, I was really intrigued! Not only was the commercial HILARIOUS (saw it again recently and near about died with laughter), but it also brought to light a concern we all have: post-pooing bathroom smells. My household always used the Fresh Scent Lysol, which didn't do much to mask the putrescence, but did make me violently hate Fresh Scent (leading me to call it the ""Who took a s@#$"" scent).Could Poo-Pourri work?Well, people, I've used it and it DOES work! Spritz 3-5 sprays (I use 5) and no more poo smell! It's amazing!What about the Rose Geranium scent, though? How does that turn out? Is that a better scent than, say, Fresh Scent?Well, yes and no. The Rose Geranium scent ought to be called ""Citrus"" - I couldn't smell a whiff of Roses or Geraniums AT ALL in the bottle. It smelled overwhelmingly like an orange or lemon grove. Not bad - unless you forget how to open the bottle and spill a ton on the floor (Not saying *I* did that!). Then it's somewhat nauseating.Poo-Pourri is definitely a product I'll be carrying around and keeping in the bathroom. The Rose Geranium scent, though, I can't really recommend for people who are looking for Roses or Geraniums - unless my olfactory senses are perhaps broken. For that reason, I've removed a star from what otherwise would have been a 5 star product.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I'm sometimes terrible about taking multi-vitamins but I really do try. I know that I need the extra calcium and Iron (my doctor has told me so), so I though I'd check this out as it had bonus points of those.The first thing I find a little odd is that this product boasts about helping ""hair, skin, and nails"". This is great - who doesn't want healthy shimmery hair? - but it also seems just a little superficial. I don't need model lustrous hair, thank you, and neither do I need obscenely long nails. And while the skin is important, if it's going to start bragging about smoothing those lines and all, well, whatever. I should THINK the most important part of a vitamin is providing nutrients to run your heart, lungs, brain, and digestive system, but what do I know. Maybe it IS all about the hair.Anyway, so the direction said to take 2, so initially I took 2 at a time. That was probably my first big mistake - I noticed almost immediately that my, erm, urine was a fluorescent yellow. That made me alert that I was probably getting more vitamins than I needed. (As to taking 2 at once, in my defense, all the package says is to take 2 a day and with meals. I probably should have known better, but I am a dense one.)From that point, I cut down to 1 a day. I STILL noticed a yellowing in my urine, though nowhere near as pronounced.Perhaps it's just me, that my body is already getting all the nutrients or enough that most of this just comes right back out; I'm a little sad because this product has a lot of iron, and us ladies need that iron. I'll keep trying to stick to 1/day and see what happens; however, unless things change greatly in the future, I doubt I would buy this product again.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Brookside Dark Chocolate Blueberry with Acai were a tasty treat that made a good satiating snack. All too often these types of bars are either more laden with sugars and fats than a Snickers bar or they taste something like corrugated cardboard. But these Brookside bars tread that line between tasty and healthy pretty well.I like to have some sweet and salty in my bars, and this is exactly what I got. I enjoyed the blueberry flavor (that seemed more pronounced than Acai) as it was definitely unique; most bars seem to be either strawberry or raspberry. The chocolate resonates well with the berry, and there is just enough salt to balance the sweet.Nutrition facts-wise, I was pleased. It was about 180 calories with 9g of total fat and 22g of carbs with 13g of sugar. I prefer bars with a little less than 20g of carbs at that calorie range, but it is a hard combination to find them and to find ones that taste GOOD. This product does have nuts in it but it is gluten-free for those with Celiac's or a gluten intolerance. (I am not gluten intolerant; finding healthy bars sometimes means eating gluten free.) And it's really nice to see a product with ALMONDS and DARK CHOCOLATE as the first two ingredients, instead of sugar and hydrogenated corn syrup.I would not be opposed to buying these in the future.

I have bought so many of these cute containers, but do my two cats ever use them? HAH! They'd rather just play in the box they came in.This short cat post is like a lot of the posts and toys I buy for my cats - attractive to me, undesirable to them. The assembly was easy enough, even though I don't find the top platform to be sturdy enough at all for either of my cats (the clumsy one or the skittish one).As for using this, neither cat really touches it. Occasionally one or the other sits on the bottom platform, but other than that, they have zero interest in it - sitting, scratching or climbing. I've placed them near the post, tried to play around it - nothing.The next step I could take is to coat in catnip and to move it around. That could help.

"I've owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time. I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.Overall, I'm impressed and pleased.

"I fell in love with all things space at the ripe old age of 11. I found a science textbook talking about space and started planning out my future like teenaged girls stereotypically plan out weddings. I would go to college and get my master's in aerospace engineering (learning Russian alongside it) then work at NASA where they would assign me as a mission specialist on a mission to Mars. I even had my little script of what I would say on Mars planned out. (In addition, I would fall in love with this equally smart guy who supported me and went along with me on the mission to keep me company.) I predicted all this would happen - well, now.Obviously, life does NOT go like you plan at 11. I'm not stepping on Mars reciting my fabulously eloquent lines about how awesome it is to step on Mars, I don't work for NASA, and I didn't learn Russian (I know, I'm sad about that one too).But I still have a soft spot for Mars. I still desperately want humans to reach out and go to Mars - even if it makes more economic and scientific sense to send robots. There is just something awesome about a group of people banding together for a peaceful goal that I love. It's what I pretend was going on during the American Lunar missions; I like to think something like this could still happen today, amidst the stupid Real Housewives reality shows and Adam Sandler's latest insult to humanity.Mary Roach's ""Packing for Mars"" hinted that it might look at all the details needed to go to Mars. Well, the title anyway - the cover blurb makes it a bit more clear it's just about all the weird things in space that we take for granted on Earth.And that's primarily what ""Packing for Mars"" is - a book about the strange way we work in space. Psychologically, biologically, and...biologically. Don't get me wrong, there was some fascinating stuff in here, about how people react in closed quarters to another person for extended time, about not bathing, about sexual relations in space, about eating squares of condensed food and what that does to your bowels, about urinating, about pooing...Okay, okay, there is a LOT about body functions here. A LOT. Did you wonder how astronauts poo? It's here. Did you want to see the evolution of the space toilet? It's here. Did you want to get into the analysis of a stream of urine? Yup, here also. How about dead skin and the stench after not bathing for 2 weeks and wearing a suit? Yuppers.And yet, I'm surprised we didn't discuss more about the massive engineering feat it would be to store enough food and water and oxygen for a THREE YEAR voyage to Mars.I feel that Mary Roach spent SO MUCH time on all the ""gross parts"" of space flight, she really didn't touch enough on the parts I wanted - what is growing food in space like? Is it viable? How about storing food? Storing ""souvenirs"" from Mars? What does radiation do? I don't even know, it's just I felt the overwhelming take-away, at the end of the book is just going to the bathroom is gross and dehumanizing and I want to take a 4 hour shower.Roach has a humorous, yet educated tone, which I appreciated. It also was a breeze to read this. But I am knocking down from my initial 4 stars rating because I realized that I have been thinking of this book as ""It's okay"" not ""really liked it"".It's a decent book with some interesting information, don't get me wrong. It's just not really what I expected/wanted to read about - a disappointment, because I've been pretty much ecstatic about reading this from the moment I saw it debut in hard cover. To wait so long until I am on vacation reading only books I WANT to read just to find it was ""Okay""? Disappointing just doesn't cut it.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I've tried many a protein bar or a health bar in my day, all in the pursuit of staving off hungry while trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Some bars have been good, while compromising on nutrition (way too much sugar, calories, salt, fat, etc.); some bars have been okay while having suspicious ingredients; some bars have been interesting while being OK.The pure protein line has been great about maintaining a healthy amount of protein, ensuring that you stay satiated. I've also been pleased with their combination of Nutrition Facts, keeping a relatively low carb/calorie count while also not compromising on taste.The Pure Protein Fruit and Nut Bar will be another go-to bar in the Pure Protein family. Once again, it keeps the protein and taste up while keeping the sugars and carbs manageable. It is a sweet bar, and it can be a little gooey if you eat it when it's warm outside, but it's also delightfully salty and a fun departure from yet another chocolate bar.

"For the last, oh, five or so years, I've owned a Samsung Blu-Ray player. It has worked pretty good throughout the years - it talks well with the Samsung TV and the Samsung Sound Bar and has had good picture quality. But it's also been rather a pain in the butt - some movies took extreme measures to play (such as ""Avatar"", which required going to disc menu to circumvent the crazy graphics that were in it or something), connecting to the internet could be hit or miss (even when my crappy internet is working perfectly fine), and the Netflix app is glitchy beyond belief and can't/won't update.So I was excited for an upgrade, even if it weren't a Samsung. And now that I've used it quite extensively over this roasting hot holiday weekend, I don't think I miss the Samsung Blu-Ray Player at all.The LG Player is much smaller than the Samsung - the difference between a trade paperback and a coffee table book. There is a weight difference as well too. Setup is ridiculously easy; connecting to the Internet even easier. The unit was so responsive - none of the muddy, slow moving graphics I was used to from the Samsung. I was able to quickly connect to the Internet and pop into Netflix. The Netflix app was one of the newer ones, like I've seen on my sister's PS4 system. It's so much better than the old one! Pandora works great, YouTube is awesome.But what about actually DVDs/Blu-Rays? No problems there - it ran both easily, no problems.One thing that was a bit irksome was that I tried to download a software update through the Settings, but it said there were none. As soon as I got back to the main menu - it wanted to download an update. Frustrating.I really love this little LG and am immensely pleased with its performance.

While they are there, numerous adventures and escapades occur - the discovery of Jeffrey, bunnies, a raging bull, a Garden competition, a birthday party, a secret crush, etc. But the threat above all is this: will Mrs. Tifton send her son to Military School to be like his grandfather?Eons ago (at least, it feels that way now), I wanted a fun summery read and was recommended this (thanks, THT!). Unfortunately, as these go, by the time I bought it, I wasn't itching for a summer read - and it went unread for 3 years. Now, I was traveling and I just HIT that vein where I wanted to read short, fun books and weed through my collection of books such as this.I found this book a fun read, though at times, it sent my eyes a'twitchin'. Don't get me wrong; this was a fun, light-hearted read, and it felt like those books I would read as a child - a classic ""any time period"" feel where kids acted goofy and silly and sometimes dumb, where summer was full of adventure and possibility.That said, I'm an adult now, not 12, so there were things that I just couldn't blow past. For instance, many of the kids felt oddly aged. Rosalind felt much older than 12, especially crushing on the much older Cagney. Now yes, when I was 12, I was more than capable of crushes, but coupled with the way she acted like the Mom (even more than the Dad acted like a dad), it just felt weird. Speaking of Dad, he was barely present in the book, unless to give encouragement or to be called upon when the girls acted like, well, brats. (Because, yes, some of what they did was truly bratty and wouldn't have happened if there was even a modicum of parental attention.) He was in this so little, I almost wondered why bother writing his character at all (which was, of course, goofy, eccentric dad - yawn!).I didn't care for how Mrs. Tifton and Dexter were treated. I got the impression Mrs. Tifton would be in her 50's and 60's, so I was shocked when she was described as being near Mr. Penderwick's age (roughly 30's). Also, I felt that she was very justified in being irritated by how often the girls would run into her gardens and, well, wreck things. Honestly, when she said the girls were brats and unruly and unsupervised - she was right. The dad rented the cottage, not the entire mansion. And while Dexter's reaction to Jane's book may seem rude, the fact is, it's probably more realistic than we'd like to admit.In general, good people are good to the Penderwicks, bad people are bad, in that childish black/white characterization. It's passable for a child, but irritating for adults.But I feel I need to stop myself now. Because I'm making this book sound horrible - and it's not. It's fun. It's timeless (minus mentioning a laptop, which was quite weird to be honest, since the book felt as if it could have been written in the 1950's!). It's just a bunch of kids having quirky adventures over a summer time. You can't really bring too much thought and inspection into something like this - you ruin the beauty of a story like this.And so I rate this 3 stars; it was ""good"". I enjoyed myself, but still had qualms. Would I recommend this and/or buy this for a child of the appropriate age? You betcha! Would I read/buy another book of this series for myself? Probably not. That ship has sailed - but at least, I can recommend this to the child and the childlike at heart.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"With Father's Day approaching, I thought my dad, being one of those types of dads, might enjoy some throwing hawks. I wasn't quite sure what a person DID with throwing hawks, other than throwing them at incoming zombies, but if there was someone who would know, it was Dad.I gave this to my dad about a week before Father's Day, and he proceeded to practice with these nearly every night. Both he and Mom enjoyed practicing throwing these at a target - and Mom is not typically that 'type of mom'.When my sister and I came over on Father's Day, the game of the day was Throwing Hawks. My sister enjoyed these and found it a delightful challenge to throw left-handed. Dad had fun alternating between drilling them so far in the wood, it took some effort to extract them and sending them nearly into the neighbor's yard.But if you get these and want to practice, I highly encourage you to remove all bricks and concrete from the possible war path. In the week that these have been used, two have already been chipped due to an accidental brush with the brickwork at my parent's home - one on Father's Day itself. I felt disappointed, though I know physics and metallurgy being what it is, you can't expect a hawk thrown at top speed towards a brick to come out unscathed.One thing my dad noted was that while the paracord provided a nice grip, it also had a tendency to slip over time, causing the user to have to adjust. Otherwise though, he loved how lightweight and yet sturdy they were.I think these made a great Father's Day gift and event; everyone had fun throwing them and trying to hit the target, and it was a great way to enjoy being outside. Obviously, be mindful where you throw them and keep them away from little kids, but older kids and adults should have a blast.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"This was such a decadent tea to drink. As soon as you open the packaging, you are hit with fruity and floral scents. I loved the small cloth bag that held the tea, but ultimately, I felt it somewhat silly, as I wanted to be able to have some instructions and details about the tea. I ended up leaving the cloth bag in the box, which felt a shame to hide the cute bag.My sister and I had the tea hot; I would also love to try it cold. I probably steeped mine in excess of 5 minutes; it never really got a dark color so I was a bit confused when it was done (at least visually).

"Evie Spooner lives with her mom, Bev, and her step-dad, Joe. After the War, the family reunites, but it isn't easy. One day, Joe comes home to whisk them away to Palm Beach. But in Palm Beach, Evie meets Peter, someone Joe knew. While she starts to develop a crush on Peter, other lies and truths come to the forefront and before she knows it, she's the only one who can keep her family together.Judy Blundell is quite the prolific writer. She is also known as Jude Watson, who many Star Wars fans may recognize as the brilliant mastermind of the Jedi Apprentice Series, several journals (including the standout, Darth Maul), the Jedi Quest series, and finally the Last of the Jedi series. They were all about middle grade reading levels, and I got more enjoyment from the Jedi Apprentice series than the others, but for Star Wars entertainment, this was some of the best reading enjoyment you could find.Anyway, Jude Watson impressed me so much, I wanted to read more from her and stumbled upon her real name, Judy Blundell. I think I've been pretty honest that I don't like World War 1 or 2 novels nor am I a fan of anything too ""modern"" (i.e. McCarthy/Eisenhower, 50's, 60's, you get my drift). However, it was my desire to read Blundell's non-Star Wars work that really drove me to purchase and read this book - even if it took me years after purchasing to read.What I Saw and How I Lied is really a fascinating character study, a mystery of sorts and a coming of age novel. The characters are just so well done, from Evie to her mom to her dad to the Graysons to Peter. I wouldn't say they are all top-notch ""likeable"" people, but they are flawed. Imperfect. Joe has a temper - but he really does love his wife and daughter and wants to do right by them. (I also think he shows potential signs of PTSD, which made me think of all the men from WWII who came home with PTSD but never got it treated.) Bev has a wandering eye, hates being a housewife - but she LOVES her daughter and would do anything for her. And Evie comes across as naive, but when she needs to grow up, she does so.There is so much STUFF that happens here. We talk about the continued persecution of the Jews - in the US! We see slut-shaming and victim-blaming in its 40's glory. (Never once glorified though BTW.) I had hazy, summery vibes, reminders of childhood books like The Pink Motel, a book my mom read to me in the summer after 3rd grade, and that I've loved to death ever since.I think if there is a flaw in this book, it's that it's so full with all these tiddly-bits, I'm not sure how to tie them all up in the end. Ruthie...Mrs. Grayson...Peter...murder...lies...adultery...coming of age.In some ways, though, I feel the ending of this coming of age novel was more powerful than a similar one I read for book club, A Northern Light. At the end of the day, Evie does something big, something that sacrifices her character for her parents. Is it right? It's hard to say - but one thing that Evie comes away with is that she is her own person, with her own voice, and her own choices, and no longer will she bend and sway to the rhythm of other people.This was a powerful book, one that definitely stuck with me, but also one I feel you have to be in the ""right"" mood to read. It's not happy or super uplifting, but it's important and impactful.Judy Blundell has really showed me that she is a great crafter of words, that she is just as good outside Star Wars as in, that she is better at young adult than middle grade, and that more Young Adult authors need to write like she does - conflicted characters, great stories with touches of realism, and important messages without the feeling of being clubbed over the head. I would definitely pick up another of her books in the future.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Robie is staying with her Aunt ""AJ"" when AJ needs to leave for a ""consulting"" gig (what she consults, I never really knew). She was going to stay by herself, but a near miss with Random Dude in Honolulu scares her off and she heads home to the Midway Islands where her parents, research scientists, are staying. But she slips on the plane without anyone knowing (???), and then the plane comes crashing down. Now she must stay alive on a raft in the middle of the Pacific and hope that someone comes to find her - even though no one knows where she is.This is basically a little bit of ""Life of Pi"" with a dash of ""Gravity"" thrown in. So basically, been-there, done-that, got the t-shirt - but at least it was interesting and defied some of the stereotypes I was sure that Bodeen would use.Robie wasn't the most ""likeable"" of characters - certainly not like Pi Patel or Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity. (BTW, yeah, I get that ""Gravity"" had a lot of coincidences and goofiness, but I FREAKIN' LOVED IT SO STFU!!) However, I was impressed that she really took her survival in her own hands and DID something. She survived based on her wits and her knowledge of marine life, and that really made me respect her. She had her screamy, out of control moments, which were a bit annoying, but they didn't define her, they didn't hold her back and make her useless.There is a ""twist"" of sorts in the book, which I pretty much guessed, but I still respected it. (view spoiler) It would have been very easy to make this a ""romance"", but Bodeen didn't go there.Also, throughout the book, Robie makes some tough choices. She is trying to survive, and some of her decisions are based on her need to stay alive and eat. This isn't the Hollywood, ""Everyone is OK in the end"" type of decision either, and I definitely respected Bodeen for ""going there"".This wasn't the most earth-shattering, unique survival book out there, but it was smart enough, entertaining enough for me to finish in a 4 hour flight (less because I slept through part of the flight and finished WELL before we landed). I think older teens could appreciate it, and it sure gives you more to think about and ponder afterwards than far too many young adult (and adult!) novels.3.5 rounded up to 4.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Sabriel is going to boarding school in Ancelstierre when she receives a ghostly message from her father. She takes her father's sword and belt of necromancer bells and heads to the Old World to find out what happened to him. Along the way, she teams up with white cat, Mogget, and Touchstone and heads into the lands of the Dead and Nearly Dead.Fantasy is a genre that is filled with a lot of men doing wondrous things, but not so many women. And if there is only one thing I get to choose to applaud about Sabriel, it is this: Sabriel is a pretty kick @$$ female character.Abhorsen, Sabriel's father, has been basically training her to be a big-time necromancer all her life - so when he disappears, she doesn't for a single moment flounder and wallow and whine about what's happened. Nope. She immediately suits up and heads to the border to go to the Old World. She fights the Dead, often times single-handedly, and she doesn't end up flat on her @$$ crying for help every time she gets a boo-boo. Sure, sometimes she needs Mogget or Touchstone to save her - but that's what companions are for. You are allowed, in my book, to need to be saved once in a while, as long as the rest of the time, you get to prove that you are actually as great as you say you are.Sabriel is the female character we need to see more of in ALL genres. We need more competent, capable female characters who don't need constant saving, who don't constantly think about the set of hot abs at their side, who aren't completely clueless about their capabilities and skills. Who are the freakin' heroes of their own freakin' story.So. Why the 3 stars? Well, how do I say it? The story itself is rather dry. Emotionless. Kinda - distant? Sabriel is somewhat of a specter. It's hard to feel what she's feeling - which is why when the romance appeared, I was rather surprised and didn't buy it. The way the story is written is pretty perfunctory - decent for an adventure story, but the magic and the surroundings are pretty sketchy and somewhat vague.It's not that I didn't like this book; I did enjoy myself (particularly the end) and I would heartily recommend to everyone. It's just that it's not a book that whisked me off my feet and made me fall head over heels in love. And that's perfectly fine - I'd rather read a ""good"" book than an ""awful"" book any day. And what really saved this from mediocrity is the fact that Nix made Sabriel such an awesome character.I have ""Lirael"", so I will be returning to this world; I am hoping that my second time around, I'll get more invested in the characters and the world.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Nonexistent.Sabriel overhears a sexual encounter in the next room of the hotel. Nothing explicit.At times, this could be quite violent and gory - if not explicitly, then implicitly.

"I was really excited to request these as my home desperately needs curtains for my living room. But now that I have them, I can't really say I actually want to hang them up. They remind me too much of cheap, plastic tablecloths that you put down, trying to keep the table clean AND look stylish, but really, you only get a moderately clean table (because they end up sticking to the table and leaving a mess).If the fabric is ""lace"", then I'm a monkey, because this is like no lace I've ever seen. It's coarse and rough and crude and all sorts of tacky - what you expect from a machine that's pumping out hundreds of yards of this stuff per hour. I suppose if I were a college student, it wouldn't be bad, but at $20 for the set, no thank you! It's not very pretty, they aren't going to block much light or retain much heat, and they aren't that inexpensive.I may change my mind about these when I actually hang them up (if I hang them up), but as of right now, I have no desire to because they just look so tacky. But everyone's different - maybe this pattern and style is just what you need for your place, and it'll look amazing.

"I LOVE THESE!I recently got a new bed and a new bedframe. The only ""problem"" was that the bedframe was just low enough that most of my plastic containers would no longer fit underneath. Not to mention, now that I have actual fall/winter clothes that need to be put somewhere out of the way, I'm really running out of closet space for them. So now I have a space/storage issue.I think these two are meant solely for comforters (it at least claimed it could fit a king's comforter in them), but as soon as I got them, I immediately stuffed them full of my winter clothes and some extra blankets. LORDY, could I fill these guys up! One held at least 5 blankets (probably twin or full sized) and all of my winter leggings/tights. The other one held all of my winter clothes - the sweaters (around 5, undershirt AND sweater overshirt), dresses (at least 3), and running suits (2X, and we're talking pants, undershirt, sports bra, and jacket). I was just pleased as punch with how full I could fill them - and then zip them right up, no problem!The next awesome part was stuffing them under the bed. Because they are soft and flexible, that meant it was easy to wedge them under my lower bedframe and smoosh them together between two of the bedposts underneath. Now I will say, it felt like one of the handles might have torn slightly (I did wedge the two together between two of the bedposts underneath because that was the best location), but really, the handles were a DREAM.I absolutely love them to bits! Hopefully, they also do a good job with keeping the items clean (though my apartment isn't that prone to bugs and the like).Definitely worth the price!

"I love Ahava Dead Sea Water Mineral Hand Cream.My skin can be sensitive, particularly the areas with psoriasis. I also can easily get sick from the overly sweet-scented lotions out there. And then there's the lotions out there that just seem to make your hands greasy and don't have any affect on the softness or moisture of your hands.But Ahava is not any of these things.I can apply it to my psoriasis and not end up with a burning sensation running down my arm. It has a beautiful, light powdery scent that feels clean and fresh and doesn't make me want to vomit after being on my hands for 15 minutes. (Oh, and also, the scent has staying power! Imagine that!)

"As I mentioned in my review of Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua, I mentioned my love of Calvin Klein Euphoria and that is what drove me to choose both Eternity Aqua and Obsession.Calvin Klein Obsession has been around longer than either Eternity Aqua and Euphoria - since the mid 1980's. It is a guy's scent, but neither my sister nor I are opposed to occasionally wearing men's scents. It's nice not to have all those sweet florals all the time. So for this review, I had my sister help me quite a bit, as she was the primary wearer of the perfume.My sister first noticed that it was a long-lasting scent that really retained its original smell for almost the entire duration of the perfume. She could smell it several hours after application and not perceive any significant fading later.The smell itself was a different story. She thought it smelled ""cheap""; it was a pretty straight-forward simple scent primarily composed of musk with very few other notes she could detect. It was not a terrible smell to wear, but it just didn't stand out very much nor did it really ""jive"" with her personality and what she likes in a perfume. She would not be opposed to  wearing it or potentially buying it, but she indicated she would not spend full price on it.While I didn't wear Obsession to the extent of my sister, I found much of her comments to be the same for me. The scent was nice, but it did not stand out. You didn't go, ""That person is wearing such an expensive, distinct scent!"" Instead, it smelled like a generic men's cologne - pleasant, cinnamon-y and musky, but nothing noteworthy. I suppose this could be because of its age - that so much time has gone by, everyone has tried to imitate Obsession.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Empress Orchid (Empress Dowager Cixi) has lost her beloved husband, the Emperor Hsien Feng. Together with Empress Nuharoo, she raises their son, Tung Chih to be Emperor. But there are trials and struggles, internal and external, not to mention a media and Western world that loves to portray her as a tyrant and despot. Who is the real Empress Orchid? Maybe this book shows a side that traditional historical writers have omitted.Nearly two years ago, I had the great opportunity to read""Empress Orchid"", a fascinating look at Orchid from her childhood to when she became Empress. This book picks up almost immediately after it - but instead of focusing on a tighter timeline, it goes from 1861 to the time of her death in 1908.And right there, that's the number one complaint I have about this book. In trying to cover nearly 50 years, Anchee Min has to pick and choose what to focus on in her book, to summarize big events and sail over dozens of years to make sure she can fit everything into 308 pages. I think that's a shame because truly Min is best when she is letting the characters talk and move through this magnificent world without a time constraint. It is my wish that instead of a duology, this had been a trilogy.The first 20 or so pages were pretty rough as a LOT of summarizing and ""time warping"" occurred to get Tung Chih from a boring age 5 to a more interesting teenager and actual Emperor. A part of me wanted to give up, even as I was telling myself, ""But 'Empress Orchid' was so good! Where is that?!"" Fortunately, Anchee Min then pulled the reigns on the speed and FINALLY we got some really good in-depth moments with Nuharoo, Yung Lu, Orchid, Tung Chih and more.This sort of pattern - summarizing, then slowing down to get into a scene - pretty much takes place the entire book, though the beginning and the ends are the worst offenders. It might be annoying but when Anchee Min stops to tell her story - WOWEE, it is awesome!Min knows how to paint a scene and make her vibrant characters jump to life on the page. She also knows how to communicate this very different culture to a Western audience. Throughout the entire story, I grew to empathize with Empress Orchid and the troubling case of China - how all these Western countries were wolves, waiting to feast on China's corpse. It makes me really sad at these moments to be an American and to know my ancestors helped to tear apart another country, all in the name of Imperialism or capitalism or what-have-you.I had no knowledge of Empress Orchid before these novels, so I wasn't aware that she was considered a tyrant and a despot. But after reading them, I can't see how a person could consider her that way. I'm sure that there is probably some truth in the middle (isn't there always?), but with very few cases (Stalin, Hitler, etc.) I have a hard time buying the ""evil tyrant"" stereotype.The very end was so very sad and bittersweet, I wanted to bawl on an airplane (and I never cry). To see her work so many years to hold together the country she loved, to work in an man's world, her words against men, when everyone said horrible things about her, seeing so many of her loved ones die before her, and then to die without being able to be with the one she loved, having to love him from afar and in secret - it's a very sad story. A good, sad story, but a sad one nonetheless.""The Last Empress"" isn't perfect, but it's damn near close to it. Anchee Min does such a delightful job with this story, giving nuance to history, and it was a joy to be able to read it.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I like the color pink and I don't like my bathroom to look like something out of a funeral home - old, dreary, boring. My last bathroom set was basically the ""kid's"" sealife set from Target, which I loved. But I wanted to spice it up and Grandma also gave me flamingo pink towels, so I chose this ""14 piece set"".I use air quotes because if you really boil it down, this is absolutely NOT a 14 piece set. Sure there are 12 hooks, a mat, and a shower curtain, but who buys only one shower hook? Really?This would be a good starter set, say for a kid going to college or a person in her first apartment. (I guess a kiddo bathroom too, but geez, why do kid's get all the cool bathroom sets??) You would still most definitely need to purchase more items, such as another bathmat, to really make this work, but for what it is, it's not bad.I use the shower curtain over a glass window, so I don't need a liner, but I would recommend it. I had a cloth shower curtain previously with no liner, and that was a mess. I initially located the mat near a door and that was not fun - the mat was so thick that the door had trouble opening. Also, it's not a terribly big mat, so I'm guessing you might place this in front of the toilet/tub? The hooks are good, simple design, and yet they look really nice with the curtain.Other than deceptive marketing, the only other qualm I have is the $30 price tag Amazon is showing. That seems an awful lot for this set, when I'm pretty sure I could get all three items (note how I counted the 12 shower hooks as one item!) from a place like Ross' for less.Oh, and some people don't like pink in their bathrooms.

It's got this woodsy, yet feminine and floral scent that I just love.I loved Euphoria so much, I thought I would expand to try Calvin Klein's other scents. Hence why I chose Eternity Aqua, a scent that's been around since 2012.Top notes - White peony, crisp pink lady apple and cucumber waterMid notes - Tiare, magnolia, gardenia, jasmineBase notes - Sundrenched woods, cedarwood, transparent muskWhen I used Eternity Aqua, the words that came to mind were ""fresh summer breeze at the beach"" and ""clean"". The cucumber was definitely apparent to me, not so much the peony or the apple. It almost smelled more like clean towels or blankets without the nasty chemical scent. After a while, it settled into light, airy floral mix - I can't say that I detected gardenia and jasmine, but it was a light floral scent, not too heavy and still harkening to spring and summer and sitting by the beach.The scent lasts a decent amount of time. The initial spray isn't too strong, and it lasts about the standard 15 - 30 minutes. The next few hours, the scent is much, much more muted - I found I had to sniff the application spot to detect it (though to be honest, isn't that what adjusting to your own scent is all about?). I think I can go about an entire work day with the scent on. One of the things I do love about the scent is that it isn't too strong and in your face. It smells clean and breezy, not too girly, not too husky.That said, I don't know that I would put this as one of my ""signature scents"". I like girly scents like ""Intimately Beckham"", but it smells just a wee bit too ""clean"" like detergent for my tastes. But it's a great scent for a day on the beach or for summertime or to give yourself a nice aroma without burdening your coworkers with a nasty scent.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I accidentally received this product from the Amazon Vine program when requesting a different Pantene product; they have since sent me the correct product, but I did end up using this for a short time.At first, I was a bit surprised how small the tube is, but then I did that thing called ""reading"" and realized that this product isn't for daily or every shower use but for weekly use. It's a far more in-depth treatment for all your hair problems.The cream is most definitely thicker than I am used to. I used a good quarter-sized amount for my shoulder-length thick hair and left it in for a few minutes before rinsing.I feel satisfied with the results. I color and sometimes use heat (flat-iron, blow drier) on my hair, and this product seemed to treat my hair nicely. No build-up, soft hair, without being too voluminous (my hair has enough volume, it doesn't need anymore from products). Depending on hair length and thickness, I don't think this would last longer than about a month of weekly uses, but at $3.99 (Amazon price) and using it to set your hair back on track, I think that's an OK price to pay. As an added note, it seems to work nicely in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Dry Conditioner too.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I color and flat-iron/blow-dry my hair, so making sure my hair is healthy and properly moisturized is important to me.Entering Pantene Pro-V Expert Dry Conditioner.The tube is 8 oz and fits nicely in my shower caddy - always an important concern! I love how, when it stands up, it stands, lid side down. That configuration always works best for me, allowing the conditioner to naturally fall ""down"" and make getting every last bit out of the tube easier.The product itself is tan-colored, rather pleasant smelling, and easy to squeeze from the tube. I used about a rounded quarter sized amount for my head of hair (thick that just touches my shoulders) and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing.I am pleased with the results. My hair feels softer, even though I have blow-dried my hair, and fluffy due to no build-up (fluffy is something I'm not a fan of, but oh well - that's my hair, not the conditioner). I also enjoy the smell my hair has after using this product. The price seems a bit steeper than I would normally pay for a conditioner, but since this is a specialty one, I could imagine using it to get your hair to a nice state and trying to maintain with a cheaper brand.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Zayne Carrick is by no stretch of the imagination a great Jedi Padawan; but when he stumbles onto a startling scene, suddenly, he is wanted by the law and the Jedi Order. He ends up teaming up with a small-time scoundrel, Marn Hierogryph, and two junk yard dealers, Camper and Jarael, to flee.I suppose I ought to toss my Star Wars nerd card out the window for my next statement. I think I'm probably one of the only self-proclaimed Star Wars nerds in existence who has never played the Knights of the Old Republic video game. (I have been remedying that by watching a fantastic Let's Play, hosted by a friend, and dayum, what fun!)And as a Star Wars nerd, comics had never really been my thing. In later years, I've come back and tried them out, but really, a lot of Star Wars comics are meh to awful.Not so with this comic.John Jackson Miller and I have had an up-down relationship. Loved his ""Lost Tribe of the Sith"". Bored stiff with ""Knight Errant"", both the novel and the comic. So I had no clue what to expect with him and KOTOR. And you will be pleased to hear that he came out on the ""Lost Tribe of the Sith"" side of awesome.This comic has all the fun you want in a Star Wars story AND a comic. Great characters. Witty dialogue. Intrigue. Mystery. Chases. Fights. All of it is here, and not tossed together in a salad, where the carrots get stuck all at the bottom of the bowl. No, it's put together with thought and care.The art was great. To be honest, I tend to like art that almost seems to ""disappear"", if you will. Art that lets the action speak for itself, to let the narration and dialogue carry the panels, instead of funky lines, weirdly drawn people, or odd color schemes. Sure, it's fun sometimes to read a Hawkeye, Vol. 1: My Life as a Weapon type book, but when sometimes, I just want to read the story, not get caught up trying to figure out what the names of the 13 men who all look the same are.In short: this comic was a true joy to read. It's so great, I've bought volumes 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 and have put on request the rest from the library. This is definitely one of the few Star Wars comics that I want to own and that I want to be able to go back and read and reread.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Wanderer, an alien ""soul"", takes over Melanie's body - but unlike most other possessed bodies, Melanie doesn't disappear. Wanderer learns about Melanie's life - and other stuff happens.What that stuff is, I won't know because I'm tired of falling asleep every time I put this audiobook on.DNF at 28%.The worst thing I think a book can be is boring. We all want a fun, exciting, gripping book - that is the reader's ambrosia. But even a truly awful, terrible, waste of paper book can be fun in its own way. Hell, people gather around the TV for bad movie night, what's so wrong about ""Bad Book Week""? But a boring book - a boring book sits on the nightstand night after night, staring at you, telling you that you should read it but giving you NO REASON WHATSOEVER to pick it up.This is a boring book.It's a shame to say that after Twilight, because in many ways, I do think it is a stronger book than Twilight. I feel the writing is better, the characters are better, the STORY is better. And yet, I don't think Meyers has learned enough, has pushed her craft far enough to leap from ""one hit wonder"" to an author a person returns to again and again. She can't seem to figure out a pace that keeps the story moving forward while also building a world around her.Twilight was pretty awful, but at least it was memorable. ""Host"" is that book you read and two days later, you will wonder what was going on. I mean, I've been listening to this on audiobook for two weeks, listened to about 28% and still can't really tell you anything substantial that has happened. I used every excuse to get out of listening to this and I had to force myself to listen to it on audiobook every time.The characters couldn't draw me in. The worldbuilding couldn't draw me in. The story didn't draw me in. The pace sure as hell didn't draw me in - the pace is slower than a snail, crawling, wriggling, inching along so slow that molasses pours faster than the pace in this book.And the romance! GOOD GAWD, the romance! Because goddess forbid we have a novel without one! And goddess forbid we have a romance that isn't the same old Girl wants sex, Boy tries to preserve Girl's ""purity"". What happened to two adults having a conversation about sex that doesn't involve 1) hinting that sex is paying the guy back for something or 2) excuses for not having sex including someone not being old enough (why did Melanie have to be 17 and Jared much older than that? Does the 1 year age REALLY matter in a post-apocalyptic world?)? (Though I will shout out that Meyers did address birth control. And while Jared does tackle Melanie when she tried to evade him, I never saw any creepy Edward-stalker behavior in Jared)And still I kick myself! Because this is truly an intriguing idea - what happens when the alien takes over a person's mind? That's the other side of the ""Body Invasion"" equation and this could be absolutely enthralling! And yet, Meyers couldn't make it interesting in the slightest.Also, before I forget: Kudos to Meyers for setting this in the Arizona desert, her homeland. I think that was a good call, because I could actually FEEL the desert surroundings.So, I throw in the towel at 28%. I know, I made it throw the awful ""Breaking Dawn"" but couldn't manage this. But again: Rule of Boring. This certainly isn't the worst Meyers has ever done, but neither is it anything that makes me think she's an author I need to follow and read everything she's done.""Twilight"" started an era of my love for Young Adult Urban Fantasy; ""Host"" marks the bookend of that era.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Protein powder has a bad rap and probably worthy of it. I've had a few myself, and some of them were awful. Either they mixed terribly (and there is nothing quite as awful as snorting up a big chunk of wet powder) or they tasted like flavored cardboard.But this - nope, not at all! This was delightfully tasty and mixed incredibly well!My running partner and I try to make sure to renew protein and carbs after our runs, so we gave this a shot. One of us tried it with water, the other with almond milk. While the water shake was OK, the almond milk was the clear winner - it ceased to be a chore to drink and was very tasty. And we both felt very refreshed after imbibing.I would DEFINITELY be interested in buying this again!

"More recently, I've tried the Barilla Plus Farfalle, which was really good - cooked well with a great flavor. Barilla Whole Grain Rotini was good - not great, not blow-you-out-of-the-water fantastic, but not disgusting or disappointing either.My sister and roommate cooked the pasta for the minimum time, and that ended up with rotini that was on the other side of al dente. It made a fair macaroni and cheese casserole, holding the cheese flavor well, though I'll be darned if I could actually taste the whole grain. There wasn't much of a nuttiness or any sort of ""whole grain"" taste to the noodles at all. It didn't seem to make as much as I remember from the Farfalle - we had only one dinner of mac and cheese (for two people) and a lunch (for one) leftover.This may seem overly critical for a 4 star review of pasta; in truth, I wouldn't mind buying this again as it made a very decent mac and cheese. But definitely next time, we need to cook the pasta less, if we want to end up with that al dente texture.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Years ago, I went to the doctor, and she told me, my blood pressure was high. I needed to monitor it and bring it do, either by weight loss, exercise, etc. So I ended up buying an Omron Blood Pressure monitor (I don't recall the exact model, and it would be about 10 years old now, but it was something like the Omron BP760N 7 Series).Fast forward a few years, and I still occasionally struggle with high blood pressure (at this point, I think it's a genetic/weight/exercise thing). So I still like to be able to monitor my blood pressure.This Omron Blood Pressure monitor is pretty fantastic. Instead of relying solely on batteries, you have the option of plugging it into the wall. The cuff is very wide, which is good for a variety of arm circumferences. (It fit my arm, my running partner's arm, and my sister's arm fine.) The instructions are simple to use, and the display is fantastic! Very large, easy to read!Now, you can set the time and date, which is important for the other function of this monitor, one I haven't fully experimented with, the tracking. If you want to keep tabs on your blood pressure over time, I would definitely recommend getting batteries for this unit. As you would expect, if you only plug it in, the date/time will be erased every time you unplug. So either use batteries or keep plugged in at all times.Other than that, I haven't tried out the tracking, but I have intentions to. I love how it can store values for two people - another item I will experiment with! I'm an engineer so I do love to be able to track data.This is a smart, easy to use monitor, even if you don't need/want the saved data. Omron is a great brand; I've used them for years and see no reason to change.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Are you aware that The Hunger Games is popular? Do you have a passing knowledge of ""We"", ""Brave New World"", ""1984"", and ""Fahrenheit 451""? Do you value a hot set of abs over story?Well, the latter question isn't entirely true for this book. But still, once again, we have yet another cash-in on The Hunger Games popularity trend, one that, once again, focuses more on making sure our It Couple get together in the end than basic things like character development, nuance, and a gorram world that makes half a lick of sense in the 2 seconds you squint at it.Lena Holoway lives in a world where a ""Cure"" for deliria - aka Love - has been developed and is administered on all 18 year olds. Of course, she ends up falling in love, doesn't want to give up her love, and then vows to remain ""Uncured"".The sad thing is, it's obvious Lauren Oliver is a decent writer. The pages just ooze with her adept writing skill, and I actually grew to like (somewhat) Lena and adore Lena and Hana's relationship. The sad thing is, I think Oliver felt she had to write a dystopia (and a trilogy) in order to get anywhere in today's market - and so, Delirium was born.Just like with ""Shatter Me"", ""Divergent"", and just about every other YA ""dystopian"" novel out there, the world-building is complete and utter donkey poo. It doesn't hold up to even a modicum of inspection. And throughout my time reading this book, I couldn't for once just barrel through and ignore it. The problems just kept jumping out and smacking me in the face. Questions leading to questions leading to more questions:How do humans survive without love? Why does this suddenly make them almost mind-numb, emotionless robots? Does love somehow get rid of fear and anger and greed? How was it determined that LOVE was the great evil behind wars and famine? What about...greed? What about...anger? What about class? Race? Sex? Sexual Orientation? Employment opportunities? Religious differences? You are telling me, getting rid of love somehow is going to make the poor Muslim from Pakistan lie down with the rich Christian from Oklahoma? (Or is religion gone all together? Or replaced by this ""new"" gospel that's alluded to in the book of Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh?)Why is it SO IMPORTANT in this love-less society to get married - the institution most marked by that emotion? Why bother with any choice in mate selection - if there is no love, why not just match couples up based on what their offspring would be or do away with that and just artificially inseminate? If people need human companionship or sex, why not just make ""community"" marriages - in essence, like ""We"" or ""Brave New World""? And why must these kids be paired at 18, with particular emphasis on the girls to get married? Wouldn't it be better for these women to use their skills at jobs? Or are there not enough jobs, what with no art? And if there's no art, what's the point of entertainment? Is it like ""The LEGO Movie"" where everyone sings, ""Everything is Awesome""??? Is the entertainment bland and safe, just the same book and movie over and over and over again, like it is today, even with this very book? (zing!)Why 18? How can a loveless mother or father care for a child? Why hug her baby or carefully tend his daughter? Why live together with an essentially arranged match when you don't love that person?How can you feel muscle tear from bone and ligaments from bone and yet STILL be able to run and run and run for days - and this is AFTER falling from a 2-story building? How can a person who has never driven a motorcycle figure one out in the middle of a chase? How are all these underground music festivals going on with NO ONE noticing? How does Lena go from good girl to suddenly sneaking out nearly every night, skipping out in the middle of work? Does her aunt never check up on her or notice this? Why did Lena take the pills that were OBVIOUSLY tranquilizers from Rachel? And why is ONE girl and ONE boy enough concern for helicopters and multiple cop cars? Why don't they just shoot the perpetrators instead of trying to apprehend them at that point? And why does every author insist on painting Romeo and Juliet as a love story, a romance?!! It's a tragedy!These are just a few of the questions that constantly bombarded my mind as I listened to this audiobook. I tried to ignore them, but like with ""Divergent"", this world makes no sense. WHATSOEVER. There's no indication of how this could happen, of how so much and yet so little of the world has changed - love is outlawed, but marriage is OK? (And don't even give the tepid excuse ""This is young adult, they had to get married!"")So yeah, if you can ignore that, unlike me, maybe you'll be better off.If I'm completely honest, the characters range from OK to meh. Nothing horrible, nothing outstanding - though I will say that Oliver's are more engaging IMO than Veronica Roth's, particularly the Lena-Hana relationship.And that's I think my biggest problem. The Lena-Hana relationship was really good! Hana carries the role of ""rebellious one"" that incites our mediocre protagonist to revolt - so why did we need Alex? Why couldn't Lena's love for Hana have been the THING to drive Lena to eschew this society and rebel? (It was, but it wasn't until Alex that Lena decides to throw caution to the wind and hang out almost exclusively with him.) The Lena-Hana relationship has a lot more depth and development than ANYTHING in the Lena-Alex relationship. And it would be nice to see a non-romantic love emphasized in a book.But no, that would mean no honey-eyed, marbled ab hottie in our book, so of course, we have Alex. Bland, boring, safe Alex whose backstory makes no sense, from getting to where he is in the book to some of his knowledge about Lena's past. (No spoilers.) The best I can say about Alex is that at least he's not a typical d-bag boyfriend like, say, Patch from ""Hush, Hush"".The other characters are pretty awful. Carol and Jenny, shrewish and mean. Gracie who can't speak (and no one is worried or seeking treatment for this?). Every ""bad guy"" getting this awful voice (sorry Jessica Drew! You did okay with Lena, Hana, and Alex, just why did every bad guy have to have an evil car salesman voice?!), have this awful conversation amounting to, ""I am so evil, I go home at night and kick newborn puppies UP THE STAIRS!""I think the thing that torques me off about this book/trilogy is the fact that, with a few tweaks, this could have gone from generic YA fauxtopia to a half-decent modern dystopia. At the very least, at the end of this book, I know two things: I wouldn't mind checking out Oliver's ""Before I Fall"", and that I won't, under any circumstances, be checking out the sequels in this series. Oliver seems to be a decent author, but this isn't a decent dystopia - though I am putting it at the same level of ""Divergent"" because of the Lena-Hana relationship.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I like almonds and they are pretty good for you. Sure, you should probably be careful of all the additives (like this product no-doubt has), but sometimes it's nice to have a bit of a kick.These almonds have that kick.The first taste I had, they were somewhat strange. It was a great, delightful crunch, followed by a clean break of almond, but the flavor was a bit odd. Raspberry, but it almost melded oddly with the almonds. However, after a few bits, the taste seems to improve and mellow out, and these were rather tasty and addictive.My sister tried these and definitely liked them. I also gave some to my running partner, but he was not fond of them. He screwed his face up after munching on a handful and grabbed the packaging to examine them.I'm not sure if I would jump on buying these again - maybe for a game night or a movie night with friends. They'd make a novel treat for the coffee table, I believe. I just wouldn't snack on them every day.UPDATE 03/02/2015: Last night, I had a game night at my home and served these to my guests. Most of the guests found them at least somewhat tasty (one did not like the taste at all, as it tasted way too raspberry), but all of them were pretty much in agreement that while they wouldn't mind trying or nibbling on a couple of these almonds, they would not be a staple in their cabinets.Brought to you by:*C.S.

More and more, we've been seeking out whole wheat pasta, in an effort to be more health conscious.Barilla Plus Farfalle had great results. The instructions were perfect - easy, and the time was on point (10 minutes for a nice al dente noodle). My sister and I used curry for both times we cooked with these noodles and they held the flavor well AND imparted their own somewhat nutty flavor to the curry.

"This was one of those $1.99 books that Amazon was practically giving during the most recent holiday season. Being a big knitter/crocheter (I don't judge!), I thought, why not?This is a fun, little booklet with a quote, followed by a brief anecdote, closing with a ""lessons learned"" tiddly bit. They are pretty light-hearted, goofy, showing the love of knitting and the foibles of having a crazy hobby.That said, I'm glad I paid only $1.99. Most of the scenes are a mere 1 page long and even then, they filled maybe have the page (on a Kindle!). Also, some of the scenes were quite repetitive - the hoarding of yarn, the scouring for sales, knitting everywhere, how kids don't appreciate knit gifts, etc. If I had paid more, I would have been very upset.Avid knitters will appreciate the most, followed closely by those who know avid knitters.

"Given that I read and reviewed the book on which this is based, I suppose I should give this graphic novel a proper review. The story is essentially the same as the book: Holston, the sheriff, heads out to clean, leaving an opening. Juliette takes up the job and starts to learn that there is some deception occurring in the Silo.This was an OK interpretation of the book, but I think it really pales in comparison. The art was confusing, the story was rushed, and the characters felt distant and flat.SIDENOTE: I also didn't like how some of the characters were drawn, specifically that Juliette didn't look more like Michelle Rodriguez, but I realize that is a personal preference more than a real knock against this graphic novel.The artwork is very dark and smooshed together, making SEEING this incredible world of the silo difficult to visualize. I feel like I had a better vision from the BOOK than the comic. Also, the flow from one panel to the next is a bit challenging to track.The story was on hyperspeed! The novel was HUGE! And this 100-odd pages of a graphic novel was the entire omnibus, Wool! While on one hand, I appreciated the trimming of the fat (my complaints about the book included one about how it meandered and wallowed in fluff), but on the other hand, lots of story elements get condensed or simplified, characters are omitted (what's the point of mentioning Scottie and Shelby if you barely see them?!), and in general, the whole feeling is one of ""Rush, rush, hurry to the next scene!"" instead of letting the story sink it.Lastly, the characters. I had no connection with ANY of them. Not Holston, and his tortured self-exile into cleaning, to follow his wife. Not Juliette, in her quest to uncover the truth. Not Lukas, in learning the secrets of the Silo. They all were pale, pale, boring, flat counterparts to the novel version - but no wonder! They had to be so flat, to fit in such a short format!Honestly, had this been expanded to at least two volumes, I think the story and characters would have improved exponentially. This is an intricate story, one that isn't done justice here. Palmiotti and crew did a good job of trimming some of the more boring parts of Wool, but in doing that, they also took out the heart.This certainly isn't the worst graphic novel out there, and if you really want to know what Wool is about, it's a good introduction and/or refresher. But I definitely consider the book to be the superior format.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Maise O'Malley has one messed up life. Her mom runs a meth lab out of their house; Dad is missing all together. And Maise spends the time when she's not monitoring her mom's overdoses by sleeping with older men. It's at the fair where she meets a man and later has sex with him in his car. But she leaves him behind, afraid of what might be. Fast forward a few weeks to senior year starting and Maise realizes that ""Evan"" is Mr. Evan Wilke her film studies teacher.Can they keep it together the whole year? What is even drawing them together - is it really love or is it just the danger of being caught? And what secret is Evan hiding from her?I like older men; I joke with my dear girl friends that the silver-haired foxes really do it for me. The other thing I love is the teacher/student relationship. There is just something so sexy about a teacher and a student forming this bond.That is what drew me to this book - that teacher/student relationship. And for much of the book I really did like what I was reading. I really think the first half was much more solid than the latter half - the latter half just felt like maybe Raeder wasn't sure what should happen. Or maybe she had to cut out scenes and such to fit it into a page count. Whatever the reason, the last 50 or so pages is what caused this to lose a star.But the positives.I really loved Maise. Finally, a woman who loves sex and is somewhat experienced! I'm tired of reading about all these sexless virgins that need to get with some domineering, borderline abusive boyfriend to learn how awesome sex is and become an overnight sex vixen. Women are sexual beings, people. No shame there.I also liked Evan. Evan could easily have been that domineering boyfriend, but he wasn't. He respected Maise's limits, even though he was her teacher and much older than her. Oh, and I liked how he was actually older than her - none of this ""she's 18, he's 23, oooooh, how DARING!"" No. That's just lame.I also loved how Raeder actually addressed the difficulties of such a relationship. They are both from different generations, different backgrounds. Both of them have their trials, and it isn't just washed away with sex. Maise in particular ponders what draws and keeps them together - is it their forbidden relationship or is there something more? They also don't declare their love to each other and start going swoony-eyes all the time.And yet...a major plot element in Evan's life kinda tarnishes the whole romance. I won't spoil, but it was enough to make me question the conclusion.But really, it was old that the teacher taught film studies. Wow, here's a lot of heavy-handed allusions to classic movies! We can be romantic and artsy. It particularly struck me as odd because Maise just seems to suddenly want to be a film director. Where did that come from? And of all the ways to get out of this town, your tickets is the hope of being a director? Seems  a bit...uncertain.The other characters were mixed bag. I liked Maise's mother and Wesley, really didn't like how Hiyam (one of the only other major females in this book) was a b!tch, thought Siobhan was a bit too perfect for her own good (though I appreciated how Maise could actually have a decent role model), and wanted to love Gary, but hated how caricatured he was (especially since I felt Raeder was drawing on Gus Fring in Breaking Bad). In general, there weren't all that many females in this book (Mom, Siobhan, Britt, Hiyam, Park's girlfriend, etc.), and Maise could be rather judgmental about them. And while the cast was small, it also had quite a few positive males, but not nearly as many females.The story is really where I have my problems. Again, the first half is solid as Maise and Evan tempt fate and have sex and figure out their feelings. But then you have a Gary Rivero subplot. And then a Hiyam wants coke subplot. And then Wesley is a creeper subplot. And then just all of a sudden, we learn that Maise has been using her cellphone to video record all these scenes to make this movie. So has Wesley. And their movies tread that line of what I would think would be acceptable to show in a high school film studies class. In fact, after that, I'm surprised that Evan wasn't asked to leave.The conclusion flounders around as Maise and Evan figure out ""What next?"" and go back and forth and back and forth on whether or not to be together and figuring out how to wrap up the subplots as quickly as possible.At least the ending is pretty sweet and appropriate, if it does lead to the reader wonder, ""So, how long will THAT last?""The sex scenes are very decent, pretty hot, but never shoved in just to meet a sex scene quota. It's pretty graphic, so if you don't like sex in your books, avoid.I must admit to feeling a bit disappointed when I finished. It was good, but not the great awesomeness I was expecting - my fault for putting it too high on a pedestal. I realized after reading this that yes, I still do love teacher-student romances, but I prefer the college type: brooding college professor and young, inquisitive student. But again, this is my fault for not realizing it.So at the end of the day, solid 4 stars for some good characters, some legitimate drama and some good sex scenes. This won't be a book for everyone as there is a LOT of swearing, sex, drug usage and talk of abuse. But in the market where New Adult seems to mean ""virgins learning to have sex"", this definitely bucks the trend and has something new and interesting to say.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"For my birthday, my sister made the most beautiful banner to be hung at the venue where I was staging my party. Naturally, I wanted to have something to hang it up.Unfortunately, these did not work for that venue. The arrangement and location of the banner just didn't make using these make sense. However, when we brought the banner home, I thought I would hang it above my door.Before you hang these up, I should bring up some noteworthy items:+ Is your location clean, free of dirt?+ Are you trying to place the strips on textured wall?+ What is the weight of the item you want to hang and how many of the anchors do you want to use?I wiped down the area and placed the strips, but the banner almost promptly fell. I thought maybe using tougher strips might help, so I pulled out my 1-lb rated strips. Still fell. Then I used all four anchors. One anchor fell the first night; three days later, the rest followed suit.I didn't have particularly good luck with these, but I think there were a lot of factors to this:+ The banner was slightly heavy (although I wouldn't put it past 2 pounds).+ I have heard of a specific wall cleaning treatment to prep for these, which I didn't do.+ My wall was textured, which made getting a good stick tough. I did try on the wood framing around my door, but the location was too low and I wasn't getting much better contact (the frame was beveled).However, I did like how easy it was to wrap the string around the anchor, and the strips never damaged the wall.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Evangeline ""Evie"" O'Neill has been sent to live with her Uncle William Fitzgerald in New York because of her deviant behavior and a party trick gone wrong. But while there, a string of mysterious murders occur, and Uncle Will is on the case.I tried to keep myself from saying this for the longest time, afraid it would curse me, but now that I'm done I can finally say it:I loved this book!FINALLY, I found a young adult paranormal book that didn't want to make me gouge my eyes out! This book had all the elements I love:1) A well-developed female character. She's fun, fun-ny, upbeat, sometimes silly, sometimes selfish, sometimes vapid, but also smart and willing to say ""I was wrong"". She doesn't collapse and have to have a guy save her at the last minute. She talks back to people and stands her ground. She DRINKS alcohol and gets drunk! (This isn't to say drinking to get drunk is a good thing, but it's nice to see people act like freakin' people in YA novels.) AND she doesn't ONCE slut-shame her girlfriends.2) Not an over-emphasis on the love story. For the most part, Evie isn't on the hunt for a guy. She has some sexual chemistry with Woodhouse and Sam Lloyd, and Jericho is sweet on her, but really, it's more about her abilities and the murder mystery. Now, the last 20% or so adds Jericho as a serious interest, which I thought unnecessary and silly (Mabel is sweet on Jericho, and it only seems that Jericho is even included when he gets injured and tells his sob story). We have a secondary love story, the one between Theta and Memphis, which is pretty awesome, even though it's basically glorified Love at First Sight. I think it was more tolerable because A) it WASN'T between primary characters, B) it wasn't the emphasis, and C) it was well-written.3) Great atmosphere and surroundings. Bray did some serious research on her time period, and it shows. While for some, it got annoying hearing various characters sling around 20's slang, for me, it was WONDERFUL to hear characters talk like they might have actually spoken in the time period where they live.4) Wonderful secondary characters. The cast is so diverse and populated with wonderful characters - not just cardboard figures running around, CHARACTERS. My favorite, by far, was Theta, but I also enjoyed Gabe and Memphis (actual black characters, showcasing another wonderful aspect of the 20's, the Harlem Renaissance, DO NOT FAINT!!), Will, Mabel, Henry... And what is even more awesome, is that their backstories tread that perfect line of drama. Theta's backstory is pretty freakin' rough, and yet not once is it as overdramatic as, say, any of Anita Blake's disposable boyfriends.I wasn't even sure I would enjoy this, because the entire plot basically revolves around a spirit let loose during an Ouija board game and deals a lot with corrupted Christian spiritualism. Number one, Ouija boards are just really silly boards that people use in party games. Number two, I just don't like stories where their plots hinge on the occult, particularly ones that contrast to Christianity. (Don't ask me why - maybe it's burnout from the years in the evangelical camp.) That said, the story itself was pretty well-done and, dare I say, legitimately creepy. (Though I personally feel it would be almost be more creepy to have a character use the legend of Naughty John as the basis for being a serial killer.)I love so much of this and yet I still waver between 4 and 5 stars with extreme hesitance to pick up book 2. Why? Well for me, it's all because of the last 5% or so of the book - the last bit that feels more like a setup for the next book rather than a proper conclusion for the book I'm reading.I'm not a fan of cliffhangers, and I'm not a fan of authors leaving huge long trails of story threads, basically demanding readers come back for more. I'm a big girl, and if I love something, I don't need to be connived into reading more.But despite the bumps at the end, I really enjoyed myself reading this, much more than I could ever have hoped for. Libba Bray wrote a compelling story set in the Roaring Twenties with a solid cast, and I'm just pleased as punch that I found a book I enjoyed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIURPUIY81SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0449808734#wasThisHelpful","R2OIURPUIY81SS","AQCQ5F0OJXMG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQCQ5F0OJXMG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With food EVERYWHERE and not all of it of the ""healthy"" nature, it can be a challenge to satisfy the body and the taste buds while also maintaining a healthy weight, particularly for a person who has a history of difficulty in keeping weight off. I have lost and kept off over 70 pounds in the past 2 years using Medifast, but you know, I get tired of eating their bars all the time (and they aren't particularly cheap). So I'm always looking for other foods to check out.I've tried the South Beach Diet Toffee Nut Snack Bar, and while the nutrition facts were well-within Medifast guidelines, the taste was something to be desired (I wasn't fond of the fake toffee taste while my sister didn't mind it). Balance Bar Bare Mixed Berry Nut has more calories, more carbs, more sugar, and less fiber, and you can tell with the improved taste. DEEEE-LISH. There was a distinct and very yummy cranberry taste, and the balance (ha ha!) between the nuts and the berries was spot-on. Also, whatever syrupy concoction used to adhere the dried cranberries and the nuts was not too sticky and sweet - again perfect. Of course, I wouldn't want to eat several bars in a sitting, but as a quick snack or in-between meal, it is more than decent.The current package sells them for about $1.39/bar, which is about what you would expect to pay in the grocery store. It's also encouraging to see that the ingredients list doesn't contain any weird, unpronounceable chemicals; on the other hand, there ARE still a lot of syrups in this bar along with Tapioca, for those with Tapioca allergies.I would definitely buy and eat these again. They are a decent price with decent nutrition facts and pretty much all recognizable ingredients.

"Brad Raines is a blond George Clooney. He's a womanizer and has been placed on the case of the Bride Collector, a serial killer who drains women's blood before killing them. Oh, and he lusts after Nikki, his partner, because she's hot. Nikki also lusts after him too.DNF at 82 pages.I really truly tried. I selected this book as part of the Vine program because my dad likes Ted Dekker. But I should realize that just because we both happen to like science fiction and fantasy does NOT mean all our interests overlap - for instance, he likes a lot of weird 60's and 70's action/scifi movies that no one has ever heard of.The 82 pages I read and 130-odd pages I skimmed were ""bad"" but not terrible. The characters were pretty vapid and boring from blond George Clooney to his moony-eyed partner to the baddie. (Good lord, what a bad call to have a third person POV from the baddie - talk about getting rid of all suspense!) The plot was interesting, but honestly, the idiot FBI agents just didn't convince me they knew how to actually solve crimes instead of going all 90210 soap opera on us. (Oh boohoo, blonde George Clooney was in lurve with a woman who committed suicide!)NOTE: This is NOT me undermining suicide! It is me being upset at how badly written it was.Instead, these agents just float around for 80 pages before deciding that the killer MUST be an intelligent mentally ill person because...he hasn't been caught yet??? Because of a ""poem"" he wrote??? Not what I woudl call the most convincing of evidence, even if you were grasping at straws! And then when they go to the Center of Wellness Institute, we spend way too much time with ""quirky"" patients than with competent agents directing an investigation.That's when I started skipping every other chapter and then skimming. And still nothing was convincing me to get invested, so I jumped to the last two chapters.The last two chapters REALLY disappointed me. I won't get into specifics, but the treatment of rape/sexual assault/violation REALLY put me off - along with Brad acquiring a love interest so quickly, a character suddenly being healed of all mental ailments, and the quick wrapup.After this book, I am not impressed with Ted Dekker and would think long and hard before ever picking up another one of his books. Maybe this was something he wrote on an off day, but considering he was a well-published author at the time of this publication (2010!) does not make me hopeful about the rest of his books.Sorry, Dad, we'll just have to agree to disagree!Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Alexander the Great is dead (this is not a spoiler), and the various men and even women who knew him (or of him) desperately claw to get on top of the pile and to rule over the massive Empire Alexander carved.At it's most basic, that's exactly what this story is, though there is far more going on that this one sentence cannot get into.I'm sitting here, thinking, and I don't even know how I would begin to do what Renault did. What happened after Alexander died, the chaos, the power-seeking - there's a LOT of STUFF that happens, many people clawing to get to the top. So many people, all with different motivations and hopes for the kingdom, whether it be unification or just a small place to call his or her own.I loved the first half. LOVED. Slowly, I'd been ""getting"" Renault and her craft as I've read through her Alexander the Great trilogy, and it was the first half of this book that everything clicked. I loved the characters, the way the story flowed - everything.The problem happened as soon as we did the year jump. In previous books, time does pass, but it's nothing quite as jarring as seeing the big block letters ""320 B.C."" on the top of the page. I think, in order to show as much chaos and all the different peoples' intricate plans, Renault felt she had to do the Time Warp. And I don't know if it quite succeeded. When you jump a year, there are things that happen - such a Ptolemy moving to Egypt and taking over governorship there. This is something that is a given; the audience never sees it. And it feels weird that I should just accept it happened, when normally, this would be one more piece in the puzzle. (In fact, I think Ptolemy in general gets the shaft because we hardly see him at all in the book. And for all that Bagoas is talked about on the cover, he disappears after the first time jump.)We have quite the build-up to talking about Antipatros' reign - and then fast forward to the end and boom, yet time for another power struggle! What about the politics in that year of his reign? You cannot tell me that life was hunky-dory while he was ruling, that Eurydike and Roxane and Kassandros had just thrown their hands up and accepted his rule.These are just a couple of the instances where I felt that I was only getting a small, small snippet of the most ""exciting"" portions of post-Alexander life. In many ways, it felt more like an anthology, a collection of short stories than a full-length cohesive novel.And really, the disconnectedness is what makes me rate this lower. There's still a mighty good story - I loved Eurydike, even if she was incredibly stupid at times - but it feels like excerpts of a story instead of a full blown one.Coming to the end of this book, I felt kinda sad. I've been Buddy Reading this trilogy with my friend for over a year now, and it's sad to leave the fascinating and exotic world of Alexander behind. I have really grown to appreciate Renault and her way with words and history. To people who think all history is boring, lemme just say: If you find it boring, you are reading the wrong author! Because history is absolutely FASCINATING in the hands of a competent author.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Over the years, Pumpkin Spice has become the taste of a season, starting from end of September to January. So who wouldn't want a bit of Pumpkin Spice added to his or her coffee as the Trick-or-Treaters swing by or in the midst of Thanksgiving dinner?I'm more than a bit of a coffee fanatic, and I love pumpkin spice, so this was a no-brainer choice for me.So the package is easy to open, but my first problem occurred when inserting the pump into the bottle. The bottle is filled so high that pumpkin spice spilled out of the bottle onto the sides and counter - everywhere. So it seems that you actually have to unscrew the pump, pump out some of the creamer and THEN screw the pump onto the bottle.This product doesn't need to be refrigerated and also is touted to last a long time. These latter two things kinda spook me - products that don't need to be refrigerated and last forever make me think there is more Chemical in them than Pumpkin. I'm trying to be a bit more conscious of what I eat, so I call that ""problem the second"". (Some people may not care.)The taste is absolutely fantastic. I loved it, as did my sister (who is a big pumpkin spice fanatic). But the third problem was that for a 16 oz cup of coffee, you need to pump SEVERAL pumps of pumpkin spice before you begin to taste it. One pump is equivalent to one of those tiny cup things and that is 25 calories. So one or two pumps isn't a big deal; it's when you past about half a dozen pumps that you start to wonder if it's worth it.Also, as a warning: sometimes the pumpkin stream gets off-kilter and may go in a non-linear direction, which makes catching the pumpkin spice a bit of a challenge.For the workplace, I could see this working pretty nicely. Even for the home, it's not bad if you only use a couple of pumps. Just be careful setting it up and then watch home many pumps you use, else this special treat could make you look like Santa Claus this Christmas.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I cook and clean, but come on, I don't love love it. (Except for cookie baking - I LOVE that. Waistline, on the other hand, does NOT.) I cook basic meals that are mostly edible, but nothing to write home about most of the time. And I clean when I absolutely need to - which is typically when guests are coming over, or I am in that ""OMG MY HOUSE IS A DISASTER"" mood.But even my limited experience in the kitchen has taught me how invaluable having an apron is. I absolutely hate having to change my clothes because I dumped flour on myself or because they are wet from washing dishes.Last night, I got all 1950's Domesticated Wife (minus the rockabiliy skirt and husband) and decided to test two Vine Products: this apron and Mop N Glo. Obviously, this review space will favor the Floor Cleaner.Now first, I must say, as I was using this, I was thinking, ""Well, the cleaner is only as good as the mop."" Because let's say your house is like mine, and you have those tiles that have all that texture. You could have the best floor cleaner in the world and still not get it clean unless you sit there scrubbing over the @#$%ed thing for half an hour.This is kinda my experience.I have two types of flooring: tile and vinyl. After removing everything from the floor and then sweeping, I promptly sprayed Mop & Glo everywhere on the tile. Then I looked at the directions. (Because that's how the pros do it, amirite?)I have a Clorox Ready Mop, one of those gizmos with pads that you can remove and throw away. It's worked great for apartment life, as I don't really have any large spaces with vinyl or tile (kitchen/bathrooms and the mantle/entrance respectively). So after spraying down the Mop & Glo (watch, as it does come out quite well), I put some elbow grease into it and started scrubbing.In the tile, there was one particular spot that was in one of those ""textured areas"" that was the inspiration for my insight into the merits of floor cleaner vs the ability of your mop. I probably went over that area about two dozen times before it was clean to my liking (and trust me, that's not that high). But could I say it's the floor cleaner's fault that the goo was in a divot and the mop was a flat pad that had trouble accessing all the vagaries of the floor? I don't think it would be fair to knock Mop N Glo because my mop is flat and the floor is not.ANYWAY, the rest of the tile seemed to clean well enough, and it dried pretty quickly as well.I moved into the kitchen and then proceeded to squirt product all over the floor. My sister had recently used a steamer mop on the floor, so it wasn't all that dirty anyway, and I didn't really notice any difference. But it the few areas that were a bit dirty did seem cleaner. And the floor was nice and shiny.And, of course, I don't have hardwood floors, so I can't review that side of the product.I feel like Mop N Glo was about the same efficiency as the other floor cleaning brands I've used. It does seem to work and also makes your floor shiny, but I really want to stress that it is also contingent on the mop you have.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Obviously, this review space will favor the apron.One of the things I love about the apron is how there are two sashes to tie - one around your neck and one at your waist. This is great to get the apron to cover the right spots - from about just below the neck to, well, whereever the skirt ends. (I have a cute Wonder Woman apron without the neck tie and it just flops down somewhere at breast-level, which just feels awkward.) There was plenty of room in both ties for adjustment. I wear about US Size 12 jeans to give an indication of waist/hip size, and I'm confident both wider and slimmer ladies will have no troubles tying this around your waist.While I love the pocket, I found it a bit weird there was only one, and that one was under my left hand (I am right-handed). I thought perhaps two pockets would even out the design and allow more flexibility to both lefties and righties.The skirt is adorable, but it's gonna take awhile to get a nice flounce to it, like shown in the image. Packaging hammered it pretty flat, and even though I've hung it out for nearly 2 weeks, it still hasn't puffed out. I am wondering if a good clean in the washer and dryer will do the trick.As for Apron in Action, it works great. I used it while sweeping and mopping, and I hardly even noticed I was wearing an apron. The skirt didn't get in the way of sweeping and mopping or bending over to sweep up the detritus into the pan.And while I got this through Vine and didn't pay, even the price tag of about $20 isn't half bad. Not for the thick material, the cute skirt, a pocket, and the two ties.So even if you aren't the epitome of a 1950's Domestic Housewife, I think you should find this apron is pretty decent. I definitely did.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"Jaime Waterman is half-Navajo and full renowned geologist, one of a team of explorers to Mars. The international team lands on Mars, explores, makes way for Jaime ""Marty Stu"" to call all the shots, comes down with a ludicrous disease (that would be improbable to get period and in the timeframe Bova suggests), and then gets stuck in a crater - perfect for Jaime Stu to come and save the day.My childhood dream was to go to Mars. I dreamed that I would be an engineer on a first Mars mission (I think my goal was to have landed in 2014 oddly enough!). I came up with my first words for my first step, imagined who my teammates would be, planned out what foreign language I would learn (Russian, of course)...And then I grew up and realized that things change when you grow up. There is a part of me that would still LOVE to be the first to step foot on Mars, but given the decimation of the US Space Program, that dream is even further into the future.So as a last vestige of the wide-eyed, imaginative girl that I once was, I bought this book. A friend recommended it as well, so I bumped it up the list. And then I nabbed an audiobook at the library and squeezed it into my packed reading schedule.When I think back on my experience of this book, I see this book hitting all the marks that most people think of when they think of science fiction in general, hard science fiction specifically:Racism? Check.Sexist characters? Check.Robot characters? Check.Male character who can do no wrong and always gets his way? Check.Science and technology for science and technology's state? Check.Politicians are BAD, science is GOOD? Check.Strawmen politicians and reporters for the scientists to show how science is good? Check.About the only thing it is missing is Little Green Men parading into the picture.I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this book. And I did love it when Bova shut up about his awful, stupid characters, their awful, stupid drama and looked at the science and world of Mars. Great stuff, completely captivating. But if to get to that stuff it means I have to spend even an hour listening to Jaime call himself a ""Red Man"" or laugh about the ""privilege"" being a Native American gives him or comment on how childish Joanna looks all the while wanting to seriously bone her, I think I'll check out, thank you very much.Where Bova fails primarily is the characters. They are weak, badly written, and dull - basically, what everyone tells you what to expect from science fiction. From Jaime Waterman to Ilona Maleter to Tony Reed to the Russian astronauts with difficult to spell last names (I listened on audiobook and have no ear for spelling out American names, much less Russian ones), all the characters are about as interesting as coffee grounds. They have one note, one character and that's it.And what's worse, when Bova attempts to create diversity, much headbanging ensues. I would applaud his non-white characters, his attempt to include women if they weren't SO BLAND! If they actually FELT like non-white, non-American characters, instead of whiteboards painted with green and yellow and orange paint! If the women weren't all grouped into whores or madonnas.And Jaime - God, I hate Jaime. He's our protagonist, which means everything he does is perfect and wonderful. He thinks there is something to be discovered in the Grand Canyon of Mars? The ENTIRE mission plan must be changed so they can investigate - who cares if Patel has other plans that he has spent decades on, nope, gotta follow Jaime's intuition! Jaime can sleep with Ilona, but Eddie sleeping around, even though they aren't in a committed relationship? What a vixen!The other grating part of the story is the ludicrous ""Mars virus"" that the crew catches.HINT 1: It's not a virus.HINT 2: The meteor shower that happens earlier in the book is the cause of this ""virus"" - a twist that MIGHT have been clever had the disease NOT been one that takes at least 3 months to actually show signs! And even then, it's nowhere near as deathly as is shown in the book!As for the plot: well, it's dated. A bunch of late 80's/early 90's politics crammed into a scifi book. It was mildly amusing in places, but not very believable or well-done. After awhile, I just wanted it to be OVER.And of course, the only female high-ranking official is a cutthroat b!tch. (I wouldn't have a problem with this if there was more than one female politician - women can be b!tches too after all!)This was narrated by Stefan Rudnicki, who had read the ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" that I was greatly underwhelmed with. The good news is that he didn't completely bore me with this book as he had with the previous (Obviously I don't care for Bradbury in audiobook form). The bad news is, his accents are silly, and in one case, he gives a character a Russian accent when the text EXPLICITLY STATES that that character had no discernible accent. FAIL. Still, he does have a soothing voice, and it's not completely grating to listen to.What is most disappointing is just how mediocre this book is. From a science standpoint, everything is sound and very probable. (Now politically, I sincerely doubt the crew would look this multi-national, but that's just me.) The subject is fascinating. It's the characters and plot that just flounder and flail. Boring. Racist. Sexist. Badly written. I will not be returning to Mars or any other planetary location with Ben Bova anytime in the future.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I first encountered Katana in the New 52 Birds of Prey line. I enjoy reading comic books about female superheroes, which aren't very common (though there are more now than I get the impression there used to be), so when I saw this trade, I was intrigued. I had heard Nocenti had a, erm, ""iffy"" writing style, but I am always willing to give new authors and new books a chance.With this one, I am so glad I got this from the library, though I am ashamed that I made them spend money on it.It is BAD. The writing is pretty awful, the art is all over the place, the plot is incomprehensible, the characters are bland and colorless. It's everything I detest in a comic book.Trying to think about what the worst part of this was, I would have to say the plot. Nocenti seemed to change the plot on a panel-by-panel basis. One panel would feature Killer Croc - then next page would be Jack Ryder. Flip a few more pages and we are fighting Coil. It was just so impossible to follow!Then you have the revolving door of artists that appear in this comic. Cliff Richards and Alex Sanchez were just two of the FIFTEEN artists, pencilers, colorists, and inkers that worked on this trade. I won't profess to have read a LOT of comics, but the ones I have read, there were no where near this many involved in the art. So no WONDER the art was all over the place!This comic was such a trial to get through, I could only read a few pages at a time. And that tended to give me a headache, trying to figure out who that character was, why I should remember so-and-so and to figure out what was going on.Not recommended!Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I am not quite sure what person goes to the store (whether physical or online) looking for bum paper and says, ""Hm, you know, I REALLY want my toilet paper to smell. And I REALLY want my toilet paper to smell like chamomile."" Personally, when I go to get the paper for down there, I want something soft and something that won't fall apart as I'm taking it off the roll. (I mean, there is NOTHING more annoying than being in that store's bathroom and spending five hours sitting on the john, taking individual pieces of TP off the roll because the sheets are so flimsy and awful.)But someone thought there was a market for toilet paper ROLL scented chamomile. Because technically, the paper isn't chamomile scented (that might create particularly painful problems down there, depending on how sensitive your skin is). No, the roll is scented with chamomile.The thought process I suppose is this: as you take off sheets of the TP, wafts of chamomile shoot out and fill the room with the scent of - chemicals? Because this doesn't smell quite like chamomile. Not sure really WHAT the scent is - or if I would like having this scent all over my bathroom after someone drops one. If I want my bathroom to smell nice, I do want normal people do - I put air fresheners. Or *gasp* clean!Only...that's not how it worked for me. As soon as I opened the package, I was inundated with the chemical smell of faux-momile. You can smell a TEENSY BIT as you unwind from the roll, but then we get to the other problem with this paper, the Most Important Problem:It's ROUGH. This is NOT the most pleasant paper to feel on your bum. It's got the quality of a lot cheaper brands out there (we're talking Store-Brand's-Name TP here), and absolutely nothing like even the cheapest Charmin product (Charmin Basic). This is NOT something I would spend $40 (current Amazon asking price) for 48 double-rolls.I really don't recommend; or I should say, I think the better option, if you are really concerned with scent, is to buy one of those cheap $1 air fresheners and buy some quality SOFT toilet paper. This product is smelly, but not in the pleasant way, scratchy, and rather pricey.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"The year before I moved out, I started to accumulate the various items a person may need when moving into a new apartment. Towels, dishes, utensils - and knives. My first knife set was a $20 bargain from Walmart (don't judge!), with 6 steak knives, a paring knife, a serrated knife, a chef's knife, a santoku (I think), a bread knife, a sharpening rod, and a spatula (yes, a spatula!).But when you pay $20 for a knife set like that, you can't expect much. The handles were wood, so I didn't put them in the dishwasher, but the steel still got stained, they didn't cut so hot even when sharp, and the block they came in was at such an odd angle that you either had to not put them under cabinets or move them every time you grabbed one.This knife set is HEAVEN.There aren't as many knives, but I find I don't miss them. These suckers are SHARP and cut AMAZING. The steak knives slide through chicken with no problem, even when you aren't in the best cutting position. The chef's knife is FANTASTIC! It just slides down cucumbers and zucchinis, giving me some of the thinnest, most even slices I have ever been able to prepare. Cheese is no problem for the chef or santoku knife - and I don't have to worry about brie bunching or crumbling on the blade anymore.The handle give a perfect combination of grip and comfort, and I LOVE how they are not wooden. The blades are sharp and shiny. The block is a gorgeous almost mahogany/cherry color - the picture doesn't reflect the gorgeous texture of the wood. And the angle is slim and PERFECT for fitting under the cabinets!Compared to the $20 I spent for the last set, almost $80 may seem like a lot, but I really think it's worth it. The quality is just there.I'm surprised the only ""instructions"" are ""Handwash with warm soapy water"" printed on the box, but otherwise, I have plans to pick up the OXO sharpening rod soon, this set has impressed me so much.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"In November of 2012, I started on the MediFast program to lose what ended up being over 100 pounds. In my health venture, I expanded to eat a lot of different ""health"" foods and protein bars. Some were very good; some were not so good. Some were healthy; others were not much different than candy. But that balance between ""nutritious and healthful"" and ""just a hair's breadth away from a cheeseburger"" can be tough - and then throw in the taste and texture factor (trust me, I got horror stories), then it's a challenge.I've tried Atkins bars and shakes, but never South Beach Diet bars. As bars come, they are pretty good. They are your standard granola-type bar, but nowhere near as sweet as I've tasted (a GOOD thing). They have a nice crunch, good texture. I was not fond of the rich toffee taste, but my sister also tried one and she liked it a lot and said she would definitely eat these again. So...your mileage may vary.I was VERY pleased at the nutrition information. It is hard to find ~100 calorie bars with about 10grams of Carbs and not filled to the brim with sugar and salt (also, 7grams of fiber!). I would take care to look at the package for allergen concerns - I have no milk, soy, or nut allergies, but it looks like there are quite a few of those in these bars.I don't know the price of this item, but I think a reasonable price of ~$6 would make me definitely pick these up again (this is MUCH LESS than I typically spend on MediFast or other brands of bars). The biggest factor for the lower rating is that I personally was not fond of the taste, but my sister said she liked the taste, so I think this is personal preference not ""Healthy food = yucky taste"". But if you are watching your calories, carbs, and sugars, this is DEFINITELY a product to check out.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I've run for 1 year (yay for me!), but my goals are, at this point in my life, primarily reducing my time on 5K runs. I haven't done an 8K, 10K, half marathon or marathon, though I do feel at one point, I'd like to try.What all this blurb means is that I would classify myself as a casual runner, one that enjoys to run but who isn't the most experienced in the field. I won't be able to compare with other compression socks out there, nor to give a good idea how it works in a variety of different runs.I saw this product and thought it would be great for running and especially for my weak knee. And I found this to be true. The socks fit wonderfully - I wear a size 9 women's shoe - and once they were on, I hardly felt they were on and honestly didn't want to remove them. They worked great for my run (they wicked nicely and didn't feel sticky at all) and, best of all, they washed brilliantly.They seem to be a great sock; now whether they are worth what seems to me to be a rather high price tag, that I can't say. I at least have really liked them and almost wish I had more than one pair so that I could wear one while washing the other.UPDATE 12/08/14: These socks continue to work great. I've been using them pretty much once a week, washing them after every use, and they are holding up nicely in the wash. Furthermore, I feel like I do run better with fewer post-run pains when I wear them. And then, it's wonderful how my feet aren't sweaty and disgusting afterwards.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"This age of smartphones is great; constant access to emails and internet, no more pulling over to ask directions, no more standing in line without a book being bored stiff.But that also means the darned things always need to be powered up. Especially in the car, when you aren't' using your phone (PSA: Don't text and drive people!!!), so it's a perfect time for a power up?I got this primarily because my old charger was built only for the iPhone 4S and was, therefore, not compatible with the iPhone 5S lightning port. (I am still unclear of why it needed to be changed.) And so far, the charger is working just as I need. It doesn't seem particularly fast (it charges at a little more than 1%/min), but hey, at least it can move you from being in the red to being in the green! And if you're commute is long, it's better than nothing.The plug-in to the 120V power is a lot smaller than my previous one, so it sits nearly flush. It was a bit of a challenge to plug in, as it was snug. I haven't used the cable to charge to my computer, but given my previous experience with these types of cables, I have no double it will work. I definitely like how I don't have to worry about plugging in the cable, correct symbol up anymore.The Vine only offered green, but I would have preferred pink (I'm a pink girl). Regardless, the cord does stand out, much better than my black charger, so it's easy to find in the mess of cables in my car.Price-wise, $35 (which is what is showing at the time of the review posting) is ridiculous. I believe you can get the Apple charger for about the same or less. At least, I spent $20 for a new cable and could still plug it into my old charger base, which is what I had been doing before I got this. However, if you absolutely don't have anything for charging your iPhone in your car, this is not a bad deal at all (especially if the cable can be used to connect to the computer - I will have to check that part out in a later update).UPDATE 11/02/15: Bumping down a star because the cable, 1 year later, is now torn at the connection to the lightning port. This is the first time in the 4+ years of owning an iPhone that my car charger cable has broken.

"I love coffee. No, I ADORE coffee. I love the flavor, I love the community that comes with it (""How about we meet for a cup of coffee?""), I love to find small independent roasters and try their bean. I own a French Press and a Toddy Cold Brew system, and am looking into a filtration system for pour-overs. I've even been considering roasting my own beans! If I spend a lot of money on a monthly basis on one consumable item, it is coffee - from independent shops AND beans (no Folgers for this girl!).So when the Vine Program offered up an automatic espresso maker, I didn't hesitate one bit. I JUMPED on the chance.The Pre-Review:Day 1: I open the box, DELIRIOUS with excitement. I check the instruction booklet, which is very simple: pull out water tank and fill. Fill bean hopper. Attach power cord to machine and plug in. Turn on and hit power button on the front.The problem happened when I hit the front power button. The machine whirred then abruptly stopped and the ""Fill Tank"" button lit up. Strange. So I opened the water tank and filled it slightly more. No change. Then I removed water. No change. I removed the tank and put it back in. Still no change.Well, then I started to do all the following after turning on and off the machine and unplugging it. No change.I spent a good hour that first day with no change. The ""Fill Tank"" button remained illuminated, I was royally PO'd and in an incredibly sour mood.Day 2: I emailed Phillips Saeco Department and scoured the internet for help. I posted a comment on a fellow Viner's review. (Results of this action: I never heard from Phillips Saeco as they ONLY have a customer service telephone line, which I will get into more of this later. The Internet had nothing on this error, and the Phillips Saeco website's only advice was to remove water tank and fill. As for the Viner's review, my fellow Viner did not have my problem; that espresso machine worked right out of the  box.)Day 3: I emailed Amazon Vine to let them know my problem. They could not send me a replacement, but gave me an extension on the reviewing time. (In case you aren't aware of the rules, products must be reviewed within 30 days or your Vine account is ""on hold"".)In the meantime, I pulled out the machine and tried to plug/unplug, turn on/off, fill/remove water from the tank with no results. At the end of this fiasco, I set aside the problem for a few days, so frustrated was I.One Week Later: I checked into calling Phillips Saeco, as I never got an email response. I live on the West Coast and their hours are 8am - 8pm ET, which converts to 5am - 5pm. Excellent, so that means I either have to get up super early or get time off work/call during lunch. I was tired of having a huge machine take up room in my apartment so I called during work. I was promptly given a representative who told me to ""Remove and reinstall the tank 15 times, making sure there was no dust and debris"" to reset the sensor. Given by this point I had ALREADY removed and reinstalled the tank 15 times, I was desperate enough to try. I took off early from work and gave it a shot.No change.I called customer service back and after a short wait, got a new representative. He told me to try to ""Remove the tank, reinstall, then turn off/on the power"". I had already done THIS about 80 times as well, but I humored him. Needless to say, this did not work.But then the best thing happened. The representative told me that he would send me a new machine and have me ship back the faulty machine (on Phillips Saeco's dime!). It would take a week, since it was Friday, and they couldn't process until Monday. I didn't have to send the broken machine back until I received the new one either.I was HAPPY. FINALLY, things were looking up.One week later, I came into the apartment to see my sister had received a brand-new Saeco Pure Automatic Espresso Machine. Part of me was scared to remove it and try to use it, for fear of seeing yet another ""Fill Tank"" error (or perhaps some new error).I followed all the instructions to the letter, taking care to be slow and cautious. But I needn't have worried because it started up on the first button!The Review:The priming process was fairly straight-forward, though a bit long (and it DOES use up your beans, so don't run good, expensive beans when you are going through the priming process!!). You basically run through the entire tank of water, so it probably took a good 15 minutes. But after that, everything was smooth sailing.I estimate that a tank of water can make about 10 espressos, less coffees. The beans last slightly longer (you can fit a 12 oz bag of beans in the hopper which is GREAT!) AND they are ground by the machine itself, so no guesswork here! The machine is a bit noisy, but it is quick and makes great coffee. I've had it, my sister has had it, and I've shared with several others, and everyone has said that it is a VERY good cup of coffee. Smooth, great flavor, no Char-bucks burnt taste to it. I've not used the steamer, as I prefer Americanos and I drink only almond milk which doesn't necessarily steam well, so I can't comment on that function.Refilling the water tank and the coffee hopper is a bit of a pain in the butt because the new working model I got has doors that move straight up, instead of panels that can be removed. So that means, you either have to place the machine with no or high cabinets overhead or move it out from underneath every time you need to refill. Given that most of my counterspace has cabinets over it, this is quite the pain in the butt.Cleaning the machine is pretty easy. Depending on how many cups of coffee/shots of espresso you make determines how often you need to dump the grounds, but it is easy to remove that compartment (though you do need to twist the steamer to remove it). I've also done the weekly cleaning, which is fairly simple, though removing/replacing the coffee grinder is a bit tough. That said, there's a nice little brush that comes with the machine and it brushes the excess grounds right into a removable plate, so that makes the weekly cleaning easier.The biggest reason this doesn't get full stars is the fact that the first machine did not work when I got it. If I had spent a full $600 on this product, I would have been FURIOUS and have probably returned the machine promptly. While the customer service was good (I was afraid I would have to FIGHT to get a new machine or to have them pay for it to be repaired) and DOES somewhat make up for this, I think the hours are highly restrictive to people living anywhere but the East Coast. But the machine itself, when it works, makes a good cup of coffee/shot of espresso, so now that I have a working machine, I am VERY pleased.UPDATE 12/08/14: I have since tried the milk frother twice with almond milk. (I don't drink or buy regular cow's milk.) The first time, I don't think I steamed it long enough because while it had a great froth, it was cold. The second time, my cousin, a barista, came over and frothed the milk, and it turned out perfect.I also have bought decalcifier to use on the machine, as I've heard it can help keep the machine running in tip-top shape.

Salazar Sanso apprehends her one day and coerces her into a deal - he will spare Janeal's father, who is making a deal with the DEA, if Janeal can find the $1million her father is hiding. This leads to a explosive confrontation which changes her life - along with the life of her boyfriend, Robert.DNF at page 193; skimmed the rest.My dad is a big fan of Ted Dekker. I thought, ""Well, Dad likes Ted Dekker, I should give him a try to!"" I inherited my love of science fiction and fantasy from Dad - why not a love for Ted Dekker too?Perhaps if I had tried one of Ted Dekker's solo books or one that Dad recommended, I may have had better luck. But the book I got, ""Burn"", didn't impress me. I tried years ago to read this, but could never get much past the first chapter. But this year, my goal is get through my backlog of Amazon Vine ARCs and unread books on my bookshelf, so I settled myself down and read this.I actually found, once I powered through the beginning, it wasn't half bad. The problem comes when Part 1 finishes and Part 2 begins. Part 2 is so slow and boring. Characters just wander around on the page, having mindless repetitive conversations that go nowhere. It's incredibly dry and dull.Not to mention, while I never liked any of the characters, I didn't start to actively dislike them until Part 2. Janeal is a selfish brat in Part 1, but can you blame her for wanting to get out from her dad's wing and want to make her own way in the world? Especially when her community ostracizes her for being only half-gypsy? I can't. Sure, her METHOD of accepting Sanso's offer (after his combination kidnapping/blackmail/""Offer you can't refuse"") isn't awesome, but she's young, naive, and stupid.Part 2, though, it's obvious that the authors think that any successful, ambitious woman is evil. Janeal works her way to the top of a ludicrous ""All Angles"" magazine - a magazine I have trouble believing could tread that miraculous line between accommodating BOTH conservatives and liberals. She is unhappy and discontent, and you can see that in the abusive boyfriend who likes BDSM (fortunately, she dumps him quickly), the fact she drinks a lot, the fact she has no regard for anyone else's personal life, the fact that she constantly has migraines.Compare that to Katie, who is a burn victim with scars and no hair, who lives peaceably in a women's commune. She is passive and demure, out of the limelight, content with her life, gentle, and sweet - basically, a ""good Christian woman"".**SPOILER**Skipping to the end, it's clear the ""good Christian woman"" gets rewarded with the ""evil ambitious"" woman's money, and then promptly spends it all on halfway homes. Because a ""good Christian woman"" would NEVER do anything with that much money other than give it away and live in humility and simplicity.**END SPOILER**I think Robert was meant to be a Love Interest, but I thought he was absolutely awful. He was supposedly Janeal's girlfriend, all the while his actions to Katie made it seem that he was potentially fooling around with her. At the very least, he was pulling along two women.As for the baddies - laughable. Needed Snidley Whiplash mustaches to make the image complete.Other than the poor way women are treated (one woman is body shamed as being so skinny, she obviously doesn't enjoy life), the story is just BORING. It just doesn't go anywhere fast. And that is my biggest problem with this book. I could handle the characters, even if I hated them with a fiery passion, as long as the story had movement forward.Perhaps Ted Dekkery/Erin Healy fans will like more; if you are new to either, I wouldn't recommend this as the first book you try.Brought to you by:*C.S.

"This started out REALLY good. I loved John Byrne's introduction, where he talks about the Perez reboot of Wonder Woman, Speculators, and the atmosphere of comics in the 90's. Wonder Woman was great in Byrne's hands as she fought off crime...And then the story walks in, musses up your hair, and walks off, to be replaced by a silly story of an ancient Greek mechanoid being activated by a 14 year-old whiny punk.Wonder Woman is great. I even like some of the art. But the Darkseid plot (what is it with my stumbling upon this character) goes nowhere. I get it's probably part of a longer storyline, but I had expected at least a LITTLE closure and not the wide-open doors that I get at the end of this.And the last issue, Lifelines, is complete goofball. Wonder Woman doesn't even save the day! It's the stupid punk kid who activated the damn thing that fixes it.Obviously, I'm obsessed with Wonder Woman, so it won't make or break my love for her, but geez, talk about a disappointment!Brought to you by:*C.S.

"It's Twilight if Bella were a boy and Edward moved down South instead of Bella moving up North.And that's the plot in its basic elements. Because really, take any Young Adult book published in the last 10 years, and that's this book's plot, characters, setting, and story. Sure, some people are like, ""But this is different! The protagonist is a boy! And it's got Southern Flavor.""But you know what? A duck is still a duck if you put it in a chicken suit and sit it out on your back porch. It doesn't matter if it's dressed like a chicken, IT'S A DUCK.DNF at 36%.I bought this many moons ago because of a pretty cover, and I was a Young Adult junkie at the time. I finally decided to read it because 1) I'm trying to weed through my bookshelves and 2) I found the audiobook.Let's talk about cliches and tropes for a moment. Sometimes, they can be useful - a quick descriptor for people, a typical plot or character for a story (like the down and out Private Detective or the Rebellious Emo Teen). Most of the time (99% of the time, to be precise), though, cliches suck. They suck, because they are boring, they are overdone, and they have no nuance.This book is loaded with Cliches. Let's take a look at the Wheel O' Cliches for more examplesWheel O' Cliches:+ The Main Character (MC) reads; he reads classics; his favorite book is a classic that, not only is the discussion book in his English class, but ALSO relates to this book's plot+ MC has quirky ""friend"", whom he uses and doesn't do anything else with+ MC wants ""more"" than what his town provides+ Absentee/dead parents (Quadruple points because both the MC and the Love Interest have them!)+ No/incompetent adult figures+ New kid arrives at school, weird because her uncle is a recluse, but super gorgeous and very very hot. Needless to say, she's the Love Interest (LI).+ LI writes emo poetry, which makes her Deep and Meaningful and More Understanding than All the Other Girls+ LI is UNIQUE! and SPESHUL! because she wears long ripped up skirts with Converse Chucks+ MC and LI are mopey, emo teens who are all like, ""BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS MY PAYNE!!!""+ MC has visions and dreams; one such dream features LI before she even appears physically in the book. Of course, MC falls in lust with her.+ No one ever says anything that is on his or her mind; they just play ring-around-the-rosie with information until about 1/4 of the way through the book+ Slut-shaming!! Because if you wear a black bra and a short skirt, you are totally a slut!+ Bitchy cheerleaders+ High school DWAMA+ Falling in lust before meeting/at first sight+ All conversations center around Love Interest+ Potentially racist characters (Amma sounds like she's supposed to be a Mammy black stereotype)+ Potentially stereotyped setting (small town rejects any newcomers, Southern hospitality, everyone knows everything about everyone else, etc.)+ Neither the MC nor the LI can just ask, ""Hey, you wanna date?""+ Neither the MC nor the LI have any sort of real sex drive. They are perfectly content with blushing and giggling about how Deep and Unique the other person is.Even *I* didn't realize how bad this was in the cliche department until I started to type it out! Look at that list! It's enormous! And that's only in the 36% I could stomach!The two highlights of this book were as follows: Macon Ravenwood (whom, thanks to the movie, I imagined as Jeremy Irons) and Ridley.Why is it that authors can never write stories about the interesting characters? I don't care about Dork In Disguise (Ethan as interpreted by two 30-something women) and Emo Poetry Girl (who cares about their names, they don't even really matter in these types of books) - I'd much rather read about Ridley and Macon!At the 36% mark, given how reliant this book is on cliches, I can already imagine how the book ends, and I don't like what I expect. So I decided to end the payne now and stop. To be fair, this book isn't THAT bad (the writing is mostly competent and fortunately Ethan is not abusive like Patch from ""Hush, Hush""), but if you've read ANY Young Adult Urban Fantasy, you can predict from page 1 what will happen. It's terribly generic and formulaic, and I don't really recommend to anyone, unless you absolutely LOVE everything from this genre, particularly ""Fallen"".Brought to you by:*C.S.

"I was somewhat disappointed with this lantern when I opened the box and found it was made from molded plastic. I guess I was expecting something a little more authentic. It also has an odor which seemed to dissipate once left to air out for a few days.Attached you will find  two metal handles for carrying, since the lamp itself is lightweight, I am assuming the handles work best for hanging or attaching the lamp to a backpack, tree etc..The lantern turns itself on automatically when it is slid opened and off when closed to save battery life. I nice feature is how it lights up immediately so you have the option of using only a portion of the light.It's very portable and I can say it could be used for campers as an extra/emergency light. Kids would love this lamp and I feel it is more suitable for them and not for the serious camper. I also feel it can be used around the home as a utility or emergency light.If you are a serious camper looking for a inexpensive lamp, I would say move on, this is inexpensive but not a lamp for you.Rating this light in comparison to others similar here on amazon.

"I have nothing negative to say about this light. It has great features and it's convenient rotation of 360 degrees works perfectly just about anywhere it is mounted. Light installs easy and quickly, just add a screw where you want it mounted attach and your done.This light has really come in handy for a hallway leading to the bathroom in my home. The auto-off by day sensor is really advanced and the motion detector is very sensitive. The light immediately lights up when anyone enters the hallway at night and because it shuts off within 30 seconds, it eliminates any needs for an annoying nightlight that would stay on all night.I can think of numerous places throughout my home and yard where this light would be perfect, it's just that versatile. Other great features I like are include the range...15 feet, quality and durability...it's waterproof, holding up to outdoor weather including snow and ice. The brightness...it's super bright and it's awesome that the bulbs last up to 50,000 Hours. An added bonus... it's also great that it can be used as a flashlight.I totally recommend this light to anyone looking to light up an area in their home. Whether for use indoors or outdoors this light can't be beat. If you looking for quality motion detection lighting for small areas around your home, purchase a few, you will be glad you did.A sample was received to facilitate this post.

"This shower head is a blast and larger than I expected. It was easy to install, no tools were needed and it works perfectly with my standard plumbing. It covers a wide area of my shower, again, something I wasn't expecting but am very happy with.All five functions worked perfectly for me and the pressure is great. The swivel head comes in handy for those height adjustment that come with different people using the shower. Not sure what the aeration is for, lets just say it's a unique setting.

"I found this Calily Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Diffuser to be just as described. It is super quiet, easy to use and requires no maintenance. The light has three settings, color changing, fixed or off for a white light effect. It emits a quite beep when you turn it on or changing modes.This little unit is simple, yet so versatile. Use it as a mini personal humidifier or set the color changing switch to the off mode and the light becomes a nice night light.When set to the 7 light mood enhancing setting, the colors blend beautifully from one color into another. I really enjoy the steady swirl it emits while the mood lighting is on, giving it a mystical feel.It's small enough to fit just about anywhere in the home or office. It stays cool with it's auto shut-off when the tank is empty, this is also a great safety feature.For use with essential oils, fill with warm tap water, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil and you are ready to go. The unit does not require filters or distilled water making it cost effective.If you add essential oils, be sure to only add a couple drops when using in just one room, a little goes a long way.I totally recommend this unit to anyone looking for an essential oil diffuser. It's a fun gift for tweens and teens, while it's ease of use makes it a great gift for seniors.A sample was received to facilitate this review.

"There are many devices like this one out on the market, making it difficult to choose between them all. If you are in the market for one, I would recommend you give this Naturalico unit a try.I am very happy with how this device worked for me.

"I really like the look and feel of this shower. It has a very high quality design and feel, making it much heavier than I would have imagined it to be. The water flow and pressure this shower head puts out is comfortable, yet also very soothing. The 8"" pad design allows ample coverage when showering.It is very easy to install and sealant tape is provided. It fits onto standard shower plumbing with no tools are needed. I had it installed in less than five minutes and was ready to shower.It's Unfortunate, I could only give it four stars due to the swivel function design. The area where the shower head turns could really use a swivel ball design that would lock it into place. This would then allow for different angles or even just a higher adjustment of the water stream. I personally didn't have a problem with this, however, it was an issue with another family member who is taller than my 5'6"" height.I feel a design change to this shower head providing customers with a swivel custom feature, would be the perfect solution to this otherwise perfect Luxury Rain shower head.A sample was received to facilitate this review.

"I have mixed feelings about this device. I have two dogs, Beagle/Shepherd mix and a Dachshund Mix. Our Beagle seems to notice the alarm however, it is still somewhat difficult to control her with this device. The hair on her back stays up and she whines and walks around basically talking back to me. I do believe this is the Shepherd in her, as she is very protective. On the other hand, the Dachshund mix does not like this high pitch sound at all and he immediately leaves the area.One problem I do have, is with the aesthetics of this device. It would be so much more comfortable if the button was larger and centered, making it easier to find when the dog is frantically barking and you are in a hurry to use it.Due to my mixed review, I would not recommend this device for a german shepherd or a very large dog, unless the dog is very docile.This product was purchased by me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U4NQRVB406AS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0J58FY#wasThisHelpful","R2U4NQRVB406AS","A3R7PQAHD3NZM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7PQAHD3NZM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first saw the cover of the movie Frontera I realized Ed Harris was in this movie and couldn't wait to see it.  I have seen a few Ed Harris movies but couldn't picture him in what looked like a western.  The movie, and Ed Harris, didn't disappoint.Ed Harris plays Roy, a retired sheriff from southern Arizona who has a ranch that borders on the Mexican border.  After a tragic beginning involving his wife (played by Amy Madigan), Roy's life and attitude are tested.  He was never happy about the Mexican's crossing into America through his property and now views what happened as even more reason to stand by his beliefs.  But are things really what they appear?While the movie hits kind of a lull in the middle when it tries to show the plight of these people attempting to cross over into America, it has quite a few twists and features a few well known stars including Harris, Madigan, Eva Longoria, and Michael Pea.Without giving too much away, I will say that the ending may frustrate some people but I found it to be a good one.I would recommend it to people, especially anyone who likes Ed Harris.A copy of this film was provided to facilitate this review.

"My husband and I had tried quinoa once in the past year. The recipe we used at the time just wasn't a good one. Our quinoa turned out hard and bland and we couldn't understand what all the hype was about with this grain.We had learned the health benefits. Our struggle was with making this grain enjoyable to eat and incorporating it into our regular diet.I was willing to put this great grain to the test again and it turns out The Quinoa Recipe Book, by Julie Jones, was perfect for us. I like how this recipe book is small, compact and has a great selection of quinoa recipes. This book provides over 30 recipes for breakfast and brunch, lunch and dinner, and desserts with photos included.This book is very inspiring and all the recipes are simple, creative, delicious and quick. I learned more about the health benefits of this grain, how to prepare it over the stove, in a microwave and rice cooker. I also learned there are different colors of quinoa and even, how to make quinoa flour.I am looking forward to preparing many of the recipes in this book for my family.

"I have found that jumping rope is a very easy and inexpensive way to get a workout in. But my old jump rope which consists of rubber tubing and plastic handles is pretty much outdated.Having a chance to review this Speed Jump Rope by Naturalico left me impressed by the quality and overall how smooth these little ball bearings feel when I put this jump rope in motion. It allows me to start my jump slow during warm-up, then smoothly switch...going faster while the rope moves evenly in continuous motion throughout my jump.If you are looking for a quality, inexpensive jump rope, I recommend the Naturalico Speed Jump Rope.This jump rope is versatile and easily adjustable with nuts. Just loosen the nuts by hand to shorten or lengthen the rope. This adjustable option allows other members of the familylike my husband who is tallerto use the jump rope.You can also personalize this jump rope by removing end caps, adjusting (see instructions below), cutting with wire cutters, then use the end caps to recap the cut ends.This jump rope also includes a nylon bag carry case for travel and storage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21LLAV64XKASH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIQ3VWM#wasThisHelpful","R21LLAV64XKASH","A3R7PQAHD3NZM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7PQAHD3NZM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I sat down to watch this new Pierce Brosnan film, I wasn't sure what to expect. This film is based on a novel by Nick Hornby, someone unfamiliar to me. The main actor, Pierce Brosnan stars in this dark comedy about 4 strangers who meet while attempting to commit suicide on a building known for its suicide attempts.The odd quartet features Martin (Brosnan) as a former TV star who had an affair with a woman he thought was 25, only to find out she was really 15.  The group also features J.J. (Aaron Paul) as a front man from a band turned to being a pizza delivery man, Maureen (Toni Collette) who is the single mother of a severely disabled son, and Jess (Imogen Poots), a young woman dumped by her boyfriend.  Their reasons for wanting to die are varied yet have similarities.  Both Martin and J.J. have fallen from grace as a star and would-be rocker while Maureen thinks her son would be better cared for if she weren't around and Social Services cared for him.  For Jess, of course, it is the usual thoughts after being dumped by her boyfriend.Except for Brosnan, who's comedy seemed a bit forced at times, the other three characters were enjoyable to watch, except maybe Maureen's portion of the story in regards to her son.At times I found the movie witty, other times it was very emotional and sad. This film is an unpredictable roller coaster ride that I would only recommend to those with an open mind.We gave this movie 3 stars due to the fact that it had some slow spots and Brosnan's not so great attempt at comedy.Still, you could do worse in a movie and overall, I liked it.A sample was received to facilitate this review. All opinions provided are an honest review of the film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TWGN03WED9OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L6AW8Z8#wasThisHelpful","R1TWGN03WED9OE","A3R7PQAHD3NZM0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R7PQAHD3NZM0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first saw the Ozeri Ultra 42 inch Wind Fan - Adjustable Oscillating Tower Fan with Noise Reduction Technology I was impressed by the space saving design.  It looks very modern and fits any dcor.  Its slim design is great for small rooms and it's quiet motor generates more air speed with less noise than any other fan that I have heard.It is hard to say whether I was more impressed by just how quiet this fan was or the air that was generated.  It features 90 degree oscillation for optimal air circulation and it is whisper quiet.Assembly was very easy with only a few screws to put together the base and the optional spacer between the base and the fan.  Total assembly took only a few minutes.It came with a ""mouse looking"" remote control that worked well from fairly good distances and it stores safely and conveniently right under the top of the fan lid.  The fan includes a 12-hour timer that can be set in 1 hour increments with just the push of a button.The fan features three airflow patterns made to foster sleep, relaxation and comfort that are already pre-programmed.This fan is quiet, easy to use and the front grill slats are recessed, making it a great fan for families with small children and pets. I would definitely recommend the Ozeri Ultra 42 inch Wind Fan - Adjustable Oscillating Tower Fan with Noise Reduction Technology for any household.A sample was received to facilitate this review.

"I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching Ice Cold Gold - Season 1 on DVD.  There are so many reality TV shows out there and thought this might be just another boring show but I was immediately drawn in by the beauty of the scenery and the variety of the cast of characters.Ice Cold Gold features eight members who together form a mining company called Sixty Degree Resources.  This group of men are trying to strike it rich in one of the most beautiful, yet dangerous parts of the world.  Mother Nature provides only a small window for them to search for the treasure they seek as the arctic summer lasts only two months where the longs days melt away some of the snow covered terrain.From rock slides to severe arctic ice storms, this group must endure all that is thrown at them if they want to mine one of the most remote areas of the world.The group features Eric Drummond who is a licensed hydro-geologist and engineering geologist along with a crew consisting of a pair of brothers (Jesse and Josh) experienced in hard rock mining, a driller (Americo), a demo expert (Zach), a dredger (Chad), a wilderness and survival guide (Jack) and a gem recovery expert (John).My intention was to watch an episode or two each night until I finished the series but watched them all in one night.  The 2-disc set was more than I expected and would appeal to a wide variety of individuals.

"Honestly and truthfully, I had no idea these doodle books were even available. When I offered to review this book it was during the holiday season. How ironic, here I was reviewing a book that would help me with the stress that comes with the holidays and I just couldn't find the time to give it a review. If I couldn't find the time to read some quotes and do some doodling, how could I find the time to relax.Overall, I feel when it comes to stress, we seem to always find the time to feel stressed but not the time to relax or use the tools to help lower our stress levels. When what we really need, is to allow ourselves the time to relax and not allow stress take control of our body and emotions. Does this make sense?Daily Zen Doodles is such a simple book, you may look at it, read the quotes and decide this book will do nothing for you in regards to relaxation and stress. This is exactly what I found myself thinking, that is, until I gave myself the permission to act and actually do some doodling. I other words, I took time out for relaxation and to find a stress free place to be, even if only for a few moments a week.There isn't anything I didn't like about Daily Zen Doodles. It is what it is, a book to doodle in or write a daily affirmation in. It is a tool that removes you from the stress environment, allowing you some time to focus and relax. It fits nicely into my bedside nightstand or into my handbag when on the go. Make it a daily habit to allow yourself time to relax and release stress by using this simple book. Overall, you will find yourself feeling better physically and mentally.A copy was received to facilitate this review.

"A great griddle. We use this with our induction cook top. We used to have an electric top and used an AllClad aluminum griddle, but and after we moved that wasn't an option since induction requires magnetic materials to work. This Caphalon griddle fills the gap and allows us to use the induction and still have a griddle.It is quite a bit smaller than the AllClad aluminum one and since it's cast iron it requires different care and handling. We can cook about 1/2 a package of bacon on it at one time, just to give you an idea of it's working size. It comes already 'seasoned' so you don't need to worry about preparing it, but it's a lot heavier too so you do need to be careful not to drop it (it'll shatter!). Cleaning it is a little different too. clean with a brush and after it's dry you should re-spray it with cooking oil and wipe off the excess.If you already know how to deal with cast iron, and you need a griddle and don't mind the smaller size, this is a good choice. If you need a larger cooking area then get 2 or consider looking at other options.One last point, be careful with this on your cooktop since glass surfaces and be scratched by metal. Avoid sliding this around when it's in use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25H8A319AV8LU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IAVJOK8#wasThisHelpful","R25H8A319AV8LU","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very shot memory stick. I used this in my car to provide music playback. I looked specifically for a short memory stick since I would be leaving this plugged into the car's USB plug almost full time. This way it won't catch things and snag.SanDisk makes good memory and has been in the business for years. Yes, sometimes there are bad individual untis, sometimes I'm sure there are even bad batches, but overall I've been very happy with Sandisk memory (I have CF, SD micro SD and USB formats from them) and this mini thumb drive in specific fit's the needs I have for storage in my car. I don't need super fast memory, so I haven't tested that aspect, but USB3 speeds should be good enough for most general purpose storage needs and transferring songs to this memory stick on my computer (MBP 15+retina, late 2013) was quick enough that I didn't have to worry about transfer rates.

"These are well machined, solid connectors. Use them before trying to connect the speaker cable to the speakers if your amplifier and speakers have the banana plug connector/posts. My rear channels (Polk dipole surround speakers) had a colored (red/black) plug in the bana plug, which popped out. My center channel doesn't support the banana plug, but my front left/right floor standing Polks do, as did my Denon receiver, so once I measured out the cable lengths and screwed on these connectors, plugging everything in was a piece of cake. I got one wire backward which was picked up when I did the Audyssey sound checks, so flipping around the plug polarity was a piece of cake.The trick to these connectors is to push the cable through from the end and then have it fan out at the end so it will be pinched when you screw the 2 pieces together. The fastest way I found to do this is to unscre the connectors so you can see all the way through the hole, then lightly twist the speaker cable and thread it so it goes through the end easily then when it comes out at the hole use another plug end to push the cable part way out the side of the hole, then screw connector together, pinching the cable strands. After the first 2 it's quick and easy.No sound distortion, good connections and easy assembly and management. I wish I had these years ago.Don't forget to buy enough for both ends of the cables, and if you have patch panels for the speaker cables, you might need even more!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JT5G1CMMIPGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0097JLRFM#wasThisHelpful","R2JT5G1CMMIPGW","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"good mount for the GoPro but the screw that holds the case to the arm isn't a thumbscrew, it requires a Philips screw driver and the size/length of the arm segments means this doesn't fold up very small. While thet's not a big problem most of the time, I sometimes have the camera mounted high on the windshield and want the camera to be mounted high too (keep it out of the sight lines), but it's not possible with this arm to keep it folded up since that's not how the arms are designed.Besides that, the suction cup and lock mechanisms are very good and hold the camera securely. Overall this is a well thought out, well designed and well built product.This isn't a knock against the product but just a general piece of advice when using suction cups to secure items. Check your windshield where you think you may use the suction cup. If you have the shade dots (nearly flush paint dots on the inside to add some tinting, usually right around the edge of the glass), they don't work well with suction cups.

"Very easy to setup. I only installed one so far and did some speed tests. Using Ookla I was getting 125Mbps using a wired connection to my HP switch. Going wireless with this AP I got just over 100Mbps. Not too bad. I'm using a MacBook Pro 15 from late 2013 and my Internet connection is the 125Mbps connection from Comcast.The setup application uses Java and works well enough. Setup is easy but I tried to 'cowboy"" it at first and needed to do a factory reset on the AP and try again before it worked. Just make sure to read the dialog boxes (I didn't the first time). So far it's great and I'll be buying 3 outdoor APs and a 2nd indoor AC AP to make sure I have good coverage around the house and yard.It's nice these APs come with the POE injectors, although that requires an additional AC plug for the injector near the switch. The 24 port fanless HP switch I have doesn't do POE and my Juniper EX2200c has a few ports that stopped working, so I'm stuck with the HP switch for now. I don't want to use the Ubiquity Edgeswitch 24 (ES-24-250W) switch, although it does do POE, the Edgeswitch isn't fanless and the network gear is all in an open rack in our master closet, so I'm going for quiet. Maybe if I needed 10G uplinks or L3 routing, but I just need a high density L2 switch and I already had the HP.Anyway, these Ubiquity APs are nice. Very clean and low profile design. The square design is a little different, but only the AC model is square.

"These are really nice pans. We've had a set of All-Clad aluminum pots and pans (with the anodized gray exterior finish) for 15 years... we got them for our wedding. Now we're moving to a new house that has an induction cook top and the old pans won't work. Induction tops require magnetic cookware. We thought about getting those small metal rings that heat up and transfer heat to the pan so we could keep using the wedding set. We also looked at converting to a gas cooktop, but neither option was good for various reasons (cost and inefficiency being the main ones).So I went to check if All-Clad had induction compatible ones and of course they did. 3 Different models. The D5, the Bright stainless and the copper core. The copper core doesn't get good reviews due to uneven heating, which left the D5 and the other stainless. Both seemed the same, although the D5 is their newest line, so I went with them.No regrets! These are as well made as the originals we had and look like they will last 50 years (or until the next new heating technique makes metal pans obsolete). Everything about All-Clad coos sets is high quality. They come well boxed and protected. The finish is perfect on every item and they have a few nice little things that my old set didn't. Besides the 5 layers to better distribute the heat on the bottom, they also have a small ridge at the base of the handle to rest your finger on and so you don't get too close to the hot pan. Nice but subtle touch.I think my only complaint is that the 10 piece set (which is what I bought) needs a few more item, like a small frying pan for melting butter and maybe a steamer but the 14 piece set doesn't have these, just 2 large pots and lids. Not that helpful. To me the 10 piece is a very solid start for a cook set and you can fill in the missing pieces that you need for your cooking style.If you're looking for stainless, stick (opposite of non-stuck) cookware, this is the best set you can get. Do it and enjoy a lifetime with these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCVMEPQLOQ40/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZNCMBQ#wasThisHelpful","R3CCVMEPQLOQ40","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fun game for parties with a mix of kids and adults. Great for those with tweens that want to play too. Do it now before they turn into teens and don't want anything to do with you! It's a matching game where you have to find the matching image on each card. Call it first and you keep the card.

"My daughter loves it! It easily packs a lot of clothes and a few stuffed animals when we travel. Be aware that it's bigger than a normal carry-on bag. I have been able to get it into the overhead bin but it was difficult and required the bin area was a little flexible.Around the airport it's great. My daughter can sit on it and balance on the 4 wheels. Rolling through the Seattle airport it turned a lot of heads! The wheels flash and she appears to be floating along.

"A good sharpener for your knives that have a decent (but dull) blade. The holder and ""stone"" are good quality, holding the ""stone"" firmly and being stiff. It's taking a little ""getting used to"" to sharpen my knives with this diamond stone (vs the traditional honing stone), but after a few  less than successful attempts I finally have the hang of it and can (and have) put a decent edge on all the kitchen straight knives and my pocket knives.Don't try to use this with a serrated blade, it won't work, otherwise, it's goof for most normal blade lengths.You may want to consider a sharpening guide if you're getting this, like me, without much experience. The guide will help you avoid scratching the finished surface of the blade (if that's important to you) and will help put the right angle on the cutting edge so you don't round the current one or blunt the edge.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SUNFW1685H0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6L6FA#wasThisHelpful","R2SUNFW1685H0K","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This isn't a stunt kite so flying it takes a little getting used to if you're already used to smaller parafoils.The backpack it comes in is nice, keeping everything together and the control bar is good quality as are the lines and bridle. In fact, everything about this kite is high quality, it's just not an agile kite (it turns slowly). I haven't yet reconfigured it to a 4 line, I've only flown it as the 2 line with control bar as it ships, and to be honest, it's been a bit frustrating. The controls seem to be reversed, but to be fair, I've only flow it twice on very light wind days and it was 'wallowing' so I may bave been trying to over control it and dumping the wind instead of turning it.

"Nice case for the Note 4. There aren't many choices for accessories on the Note 4 yet, but this is a good one to protect the phone. This case protects all 4 sides of the phone and the clear back keeps the apparent bulk of the case minimized. This does make your phone wider, taller and thicker, such that the already fair sized Note 4 will be even bigger, but the soft plastic/rubber feel will give you a better grip so you will be less likely to drop the phone and protected in case you do.Please note that this case won't fit the wireless charging back when that's released (assuming it's like the one for the Note 3), so be aware of that if you're considering going that route when it's available. I had the wireless back for my previous Note 3 and the only option with that back is the bumper/ring style cases (or using the wireless charging enabled S-View flip covers). I don't know if the insert style wireless charging antennas will work with this, we had some luck with an S3 and a wireless charging antenna with a hard plastic case, but the case never really fit the phone properly with the antenna inserted inside the back cover, so we ended up not using the antenna on that phone. A 3rd party wireless charging antenna inside the back cover may work with this case since it's not rigid, but since there are no wireless charging options of any kind at the time of this writing (Nov 1 2014) there is no way to be sure, but my hunch is it probably won't fit properly and you'll need a bumper style cover too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JOEPGYXNVGDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAWPVXM#wasThisHelpful","R3JOEPGYXNVGDX","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So far this is great but it does add a fair amount of bulk to the 13"" Air. The laptop is no longer razor thin at the front edge and no longer has the sharp edges that can be easily dented from normal use!The fit is secure on the Mac once you get the clips on. Be careful to make sure you get all the clips over the edge, otherwise the shell may pop-off unexpectedly. I had a little difficulty getting all the clips on the first try.This shell has a glossy finish, not the soft touch/matte finish of the other shells. This glossy finish means you will see all the finger prints when you carry your Mac around. If that thought bothers you, consider the matte finish, or get a small microfiber cloth to wipe the fingerprints off. This gloss finish will also show all the scratches you get from normal use, so be careful when moving the laptop around. However, since this shell is there to protect the laptop, each scratch in the plastic is a scratch avoided in the aluminum of the laptop. That's a reasonable tradeoff for me.I haven't had any problems with the back edges breaking, like others reported, but I haven't had the shell too long and I can see how it could happen since there's not a lot of plastic on the back 2 corners. Just be aware and be careful.My only complaint is the price. Many other shells are available and Speck is the most expensive of the main stream ones. If it's any consolation, they cost the same on Amazon as they do at the Apple store. I got a pink one for my wife when we bought her 11"" Air, it was the same price as here on Amazon. The advantage of Amazon is they have all the colors available. Not so at the Apple stores.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R144Z91TFM1CL4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DE8EHJU#wasThisHelpful","R144Z91TFM1CL4","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for a secure way to hold my Note 4 in the car. This mount works pretty well. The arms for the phone are spring loaded and hold the Note 4 with a Spigen Air cushion bumper case securely. You can even put the phone in 1 handed once you get the hang of it. I haven't tried the tablet holder part yet, but it seems like it would hold pretty well too. I bought this for my phone (phablet?) The base can take either the phone holder head or the tablet holder head. Either head slides into the top part of the base on a rail with a plastic spring lock that's molded into the part. iKross also includes a small extension that allows you to offset the head from the base by about 3 inches, however in my use, I found that the offset extender caused the phone to bounce too much and that the press lock on the extension didn't engage properly with the base and the phone holder, so it had a tendency to slip out. I just use the phone holder/head with the base directly and have no phone bounce and it's locked in place.The tilt and rotation adjustments allow you to get the phone so it's legible and not crooked. It takes a bit of trial and error to get it right, so please don't do this while the car is moving!The base is interesting and works well in the cup holder.  You need to be careful to avoid over expanding the base when you put it in the cup holder. This expansion is what keeps the holder stable, it's expands to keep the mount stationary. It has a collar that you twist to expand or contract the base. The base has 4 sections that expand from the center when you twist the collar, expanding the  bottom half of the base in 4 pie shaped pieces. There's an edge (rim) around the expanding pieces that seems like it can sit flush with the top of a cup holder, or, in my case, can sit inside the body of the cup holder. I have the base all the way down in my cup holder (2013 VW Passat TDI SEL in the US) and the rim seems like it could be expanded enough to break the cup holder body if you weren't careful. You just need to take time to make it tight enough without going crazy and you should be ok.This design will only work with cup holders that are sturdy since this works by applying pressure to the inside of the cup holder. The cup holder that you put this mount in doesn't need to be a single continuously piece, but it will have some pressure put on it by the holder so it can't be a skeletal frame design like BMW used in the E39 (1997-2003 5 series) or some of the newer BMW holders that pop out from the dash board near the vents. I think Porsche uses this in the current 911 models. It should be good in most GM cars that I've seen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QHX4V275224M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0IQVCS#wasThisHelpful","R1QHX4V275224M","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great hard case and a very good fit for my Audio Technica ATM-M50s. You don't need to collapse the headphones to put them in this hard case. The case offers reasonable protection from crushing so you can take your headphones with you on trips. There's space in the case (between the headband and above the ear cup) to store the leather bag from the headphones, the spare cables (straight, both lengths, didn't try the spiral cord), the 1/4"" adapter and maybe a small headphone amplifier.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that since this case is so large, it really needs a strap or loop so it can be attached to your bag. For example if you have a backpack and you're flying, this case is fairly large and will take up a lot of space inside the backpack. It would be nice to clip it to a loop or secure it some other way outside the backpack. The only thing you have on the outside on this case is the dual zippers. The finish of the outside is a semi-rubberized hard plastic and the zippers seem to be high quality and move freely, without binding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13N19BK2ZAI0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NE7B06#wasThisHelpful","R13N19BK2ZAI0R","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great drive, fast and quiet with good capacity. The really odd thing is Amazon limits you to a maximum order of 2 (lifetime!!), at least they did at the time I ordered these (Aug 2014). When you're trying to populate a NAS with 4 or more drives (common!) and you can only order 2, that's pretty silly.

"So far this NAS is great. I've had it 2 weeks now, so not a lot of run time yet, but setup was super easy, it took about 10 mins to install 4 4TB Seagate NAS drives (ST4000VN000). There have been 2 firmware updates already, so there are probably some stability issues lurking with the original software, but I haven't experienced them yet. I'm replacing an old ReadyNAS NV+ and the speed difference is night and day! Directories load very quickly (using a single GE link right now and connecting through wireless at 150Mbps (2 MIMO) speeds at the laptop. I've setup a  Time Machine partition and have 2 MAc laptopns (OS X 10.9.5) backing up to it. I also had the ReadyNAS push the directories of 60K+ pictures and 900MBs of music over without any problems, although it took a long time to complete.In terms of noise, it's very quiet. I haven't measured the DBs but the fans are spinning at low speed, around 400 RPMs and the drives are very quiet too. My only complaint is that with the original firmware the SSD that I'm using (OCZ Deneva 2 250G) isn't recognized correctly. It reports an overtemp but says the drive is OK. I don't think it's reading the registers correctly and that may be the reason I can't use it for SSD cache. I just upgraded to the current firmware this morning and the drive can now be see by the cache settings, so hopefully that's resolved.I haven't tested Plex yet since I use a Mac Mini as my Plex server for faster transcoding, but will eventually migrate to this NAS for that too since it has the extra cores (and is the reason for purchasing this over the lower CPU models).So far, this has been a very positive experience.The packaging that Amazon used was very low quality cardboard and the shipping container arrived fairly banged and torn. There was a lot of tape added to hold the cardboard together, I assume UPS added that. Thankfully the packing from QNAP was only slightly damaged on the outside but the Styrofoam packing inside did it's job and there's no visible damage to the NAS itself. Come on Amazon! Please use better packing for $1100 electronics!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5E55PXJVZ4BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MEVYBAS#wasThisHelpful","R5E55PXJVZ4BK","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, here we go again. I seem to be down on APC lately. They once were a great company but that was a long time ago. See my other review of a APC UPS for a really bad experience with APC support. This time it's false advertising in the recycling plan. The description clearly states""APC recycles used batteries and almost 100% of the battery lead content is reused, protecting the environment. With each purchase of a genuine APC replacement battery, you get free freight back to APC for proper disposal of your old batteries (currently available in USA only.)""This was one of the main reasons for buying a genuine APC replacement battery instead of relaceing the unit completely or going with a 3rd party battery for less money.There is no return shipping of any sort. APC is partnering with call2recycle.org which then searches for a loal recycling center that you can take the battery to. Mine is at a Home Depot several miles away. Sure, it's not too much hastle for me to drive 30 mins to the HD on my weekend, but that's wasting my time when I purchased this replacement for the easy recycling. That's clearly false advertising and even borderline bait-and-switch. Shame on APC/Schneider Electric. This is clearly a cost cutting move that shifts the cost directly to the customer (in terms of my time/gas/frustration). That is not what I purchased this unit for.-3 stars for false advertising!Otherwise, the battery is an exact match/fit for the old one in my BT1000.If you do purchase this battery for your BT1000 and don't mind having to drive somewhere across town to recycle the old battery, then realize that there is a correct side and incorrect side to insert the battery... have the cable on the right side of the UPS, where there's a cutout. Also, there's an up and down to the battery that's not labeled. If you have to twist/rotate the cable to get the key in the plug to align, then take the batter out and flip it over that way you won't have to stress the cable and the cover will fit back on a little easier.Correction/edit 10/2/2014. I made a mistake with my original review and I'm leaving it above unchanged but setting the review to 5 stars. The URL that is referenced is not very obvious on the page and it in turn takes you to another page which then links to the UPS page to generate the return label. It's convoluted but it is there. I was incorrect about that in my review. The direct URL to the UPS login page to generate a return label is here for US customers: http://www.apc.com/solutions/display.cfm?id=35898A73-5056-AE36-FE910E4E9F5B9B7B&ISOCountryCode=us&tsk=j337w&pc=13729&keycode=j337w&promocode=13729&promo_key=137290I don't know why APC doesn't just put that on the page instead of all the other stuff about buying a replacement battery or upgrading the UPS with a trade-in value.Anyway, bottom line is the battery is good, it fits and is recyclable so if you need a battery for your BT1000, this is the one to get.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DZU00SL9AZ1L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00094OX2S#wasThisHelpful","R3DZU00SL9AZ1L","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great batteries for bikes. I've use this brand in Honda and BMW motorcycles for years and they last well. Recommended!Make sure you follow the instructions... after adding the acid you'll need to let the battery stand for a while with the top cover on loosely, then connect it to a charger until it's fully charged... then finally seal the top cover.

"Apple created a nice, feature packed mouse and it works well with Macs, however there are some things you may want to be aware of that can frustrate you, unless you know what to expect:1) the scrolling sensitivity on certain apps (Microsoft Office 2011 specifically) is way too high. This got really bad after the Mavericks release of OSX so it's something in the mouse driver, but it can't be tuned down (made less sensitive) without messing up scrolling in other applications.2) Mavericks also seems to have broken stray finger detection when clicking, so you will click and your other fingers will be read by the mouse and the window will scroll. This happens with all applications and is Mavericks specific. It didn't happen in Mountain Lion or earlier versions but those had different problems and are best avoided anyway.3) MagicPrefs! If you get this mouse, you will want to get this free utility to adjust things like the scroll area (see #1 and #2 above). If you have problems with inadvertent scrolling in applications (i.e. your other finger grazes the side of the mouse) then this app will reduce the area on the mouse that detects scrolling. It does a bunch of other things too, but this is the single best feature. (This is not an age or degenerative nerve damage thing, it happens when you use this mouse and Mavericks)Overall this mouse is great. I've had mine for 2+ years now and it has held up well to daily use, including the Teflon skids on the bottom. Battery life is decent, lasting 2-3 months and it doesn't get confused when other BT devices are in use.Be aware that this is not an ergonomic mouse. It hurts my wrist after a few hours of use and when that happens I need to switch to a different mouse for a few days. Your experience may be different but this started after using this mouse. The problem is that this is a good mouse for productivity so I keep coming back to it. Much better than the corded Apple mouse with the scroll ball.This mouse works with Windows too (I use it with Win XP, Win 7 and Win 8.0 - haven't tried 8.1 but I don't see why it wouldn't work there too), but only for basic mouse functionality. So if you use Fusion, Boot Camp or Parallels, the cursor will move, the mouse will support left and right clicks and it will scroll up and down, but don't expect page forward/backward swipes to work or any of the fancy programming you can do with MagicPrefs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNI12FAEF6FC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NX0M8C#wasThisHelpful","RNI12FAEF6FC9","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This shell for the Macbook is a perfect fit with vent holes in the right places and all the ports have easy access. The plastic feels a little flimsy when you receive it but after putting it on the Mac it's just right. The texture/feel of the rubberized finish is just enough to give you a little extra grip on the laptop. I'll report back over time to see if it has developed any cracks or has come loose. So far so good and I'm very happy with the purchase.Update after several months of use: It's holding together ok, but I'm taking away 1 star since one of the feet fell off. It's still sticky, so I put it back on, but I'm now watching to make sure it doesn't fall off. I don't pull/drag the computer across any surfaces, so it's the adhesive that's not holding up. My laptop stays indoors and doesn't travel, so I suspect that if you were more active with it, you might be ""footless"" before too long.

"This is a nice, compact, fairly quiet and fairly fast BR/DVD/CD player. It's really nice that it only needs a single USB cable. It's odd that it uses a USB mini (not micro) on the player side, since it seemed like those all went away a few years ago as all the phones have standardized on the micro plugs.For DVD/CD playback and recording it works great out of the box for both Mac and Windows 7. I did a quick test burn on a Win7 laptop (64 bit Home Premium) and it quickly and error free burned a few hundred megs at 24x to a CD. On a MacBook Pro late 2011 (running OS X 10.9) it worked nicely with nothing extra needed, as both a DVD and cd player (perfect for Air or Retina machines). For BR playback I needed to use Macgo (I used a trial version) as that seems to be the most popular SW available. It worked well with no stuttering or problematic playback of movies. I tested with the BR Avengers and BR 5th Element. Keep in mind that for BR playback there is an extra cost on top of the player itself. Macgo is currently priced at $40 (including a 30% discount) so factor that cost in if you need BR playback on the Mac. The same is true for Windows, where the price for the BR playback software seems to be about the same. The player does include some bundled trialware software for the PC, nothing for the Mac, but regardless, it's trial-ware and will eventually require you pay extra for the SW. I haven't loaded that SW but it looks like it's PowerDVD and you will need at least the Pro version to play back BR since the Deluxe version only plays back DVDs and not BluRay (look for the logo!)I should also point out that there are a lot of discussions out on the web about using VLC on Mac and Windows, and that may work for some discs but the encryption keys seem to have changed so only some older BR discs will play using the 2 files you need to add to VLC. Be sure to do some research first if you play to go this route.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4V51TC74PXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AO1XFM0#wasThisHelpful","R3B4V51TC74PXP","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fun set of quotes from Warren Buffett's letters to share holders with some comments from the author included. It's a fun read but the quotes are taken out of the letters so lack the message and context. The author admits this is the case right from the start, so it's not a fault, just a feeling of missing information. For information about the person, I prefer the book, ""The Snowball"", which goes into Mr Buffett's life history and puts a story together that connects the dots and paints Mr Buffett as a real person, with real struggles, conflicts and successes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37YZXLCQADBJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008G6S37M#wasThisHelpful","R37YZXLCQADBJ8","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fun game with Lego characters, and probably one of the best to date. I really like that like the other Lego adventure games, you unlock the characters on each level and can use them in the free play mode later. This is a fun game for me and my daughter to play together. She's 9 and has a lot of fun with me or with her friends when they play together. There's no ""grown up"" language and the violence is limited to disassembled Lego pieces. The game is long and difficult enough that younger kids will get a lot of game play out of it. My daughter will sometimes need my help to solve the puzzles to move on, but for the most part she can play it alone when she wants. There's a good variety of characters, including some female characters, but my daughter prefers playing Superman since he flies.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHT34YBLHL5KE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B98HF1O#wasThisHelpful","RHT34YBLHL5KE","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Fits in the phone, under the OEM cover, without any problems. It will create a small bulge in the OEM cover, which may cause some cases to have slight fitment problems. We have a cheap 2 piece hard plastic cover we picked up at a mall kiosk, and it just barely fits together now.Be aware that if you use a magnetic mount phone holder in your car (e.g. Infiniapps or imagnet) then don't use a wireless charger. The metal plate you use to hold the phone on the magnet will interfere with the wireless charging and may get excessively hot if you try to make it work. I recommend using one or the other, but not both.Otherwise, this wireless charger works well and fits nicely. It connects to the 2 charging points inside the Samsung S3 phone's battery compartment, has a small adhesive tab to help hold it in place inside the phone and it works. It doesn't come with any instructions, but it's straight forward to install:1) Open the phone's battery cover and locate the 2 copper colored metal tabs one the phone next to the battery.2) on the wireless charger, pull back the cover for the matching 2 metal connectors on the tab. On my Sainsonic antenna it was glossy black paper-like cover on the connector of the antenna3) align the 2 metal contacts on the wireless antenna with the 2 matching points near the battery on the phone4) test fit your cover and case to make sure it all fits back together5) if everything is good fit-wise, then open the phone again and remove the small paper cover (on the antenna) that covers a small sticky patch which will hold the antenna in place on the battery. Don't try to peel open the antenna, it's just a small patch of adhesive on the antenna. Press the antenna in place, making sure to align the connection points again.6) reassemble the cover and case and that's it, you're now ready to enjoy wireless charging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R118EWAV3ULRU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C3DKSRM#wasThisHelpful","R118EWAV3ULRU9","A1OPKNO7IXWV27","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPKNO7IXWV27?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design of this HRM is nice and clean. The unit itself is a little bulkier (thicker) than other units like the Garmin Premium soft strap (also sold on Amazon). The battery cover uses a coin to twist open and the unit uses a single 2032 lithium battery. It's a robust design that allows users to easily change the battery. The strap is decent, flexible and appears strong enough for several years of use.The only problem I had, and I'm hoping I'll be able to resolve soon is; I can't use it since it won't pair with my Samsung Note 3 phone. Both are supposed to be ANT+ compatible, but my phone has never been able to see any ANT+ accessory. I suspect I'm doing something wrong and hope to sort it out quickly.Update 3/28: The ANT+ service was disabled on my phone. Everything is great now.

It is durable & very well made, plus since it is so thick it won't get tangled up, which is great! This is just what we needed for hooking up the blue-ray player!

"We had been needing a steamer so I was excited to get this one, especially since it is collapsible as it takes up less space than most. Since it is expandable & collapsible it is made to fit a variety of different sized pots which is nice. It is stainless steel so that means it is dishwasher safe, which is always a plus. It comes with some legs that need to be attached to the bottom & one is used for the center on the inside of the steamer for removing. If you squeeze to hard it will come out, so I wish it was actually a ring like in the picture shown, & definitely a little bigger as you can't see it if you have too many vegetables in the steamer, so that part could definitely use some improvement, & at first I thought that mine was just missing a piece.

"This Bluetooth speaker by Abco Tech is super nice, my husband & I both like it really well! It sounds amazing & is pretty loud too! It is super easy to pair with your phone & to use! It has 3 powerful suction cups on the back which made it great to stick on our refrigerator & we can jam to music in the kitchen & I can even answer the phone when someone calls as it has a built in microphone on it, which will really come in handy when someone calls in the middle of preparing dinner! It also has an FM radio on it & a digital clock which is great! The LCD screen lights up blue which is another big plus! My husband has a few Bluetooth speakers & this one is his favorite out of all of them! I also love the fact that it is splash proof, because in a house with young kids you just never know, especially when I have mine in the kitchen, but it would also be great in the bathroom, shower, or near the pool! It is NFC capable as well!

"This backless/strapless bra comes packaged inside of a little black box, but is also protected in a little plastic case inside. It is nude in color & has no back nor straps making it the perfect bra for strapless dresses & halter tops! The sizing is perfect & fits me just as expected! It goes on quickly & easily as it just sticks to you! It is also reusable as long as you make sure you don't put it on when you have lotions & oils on your body, always shower first! The cups are soft & lightly padded, which is nice. It is also easy & painless to pull off, unlike some sticky bras, plus it works as a push up!

"These teeth whitening strips are very easy to use & stick onto your teeth extremely well! I was actually surprised by how well they stuck to my teeth as I remember the crest whitening strips sliding around some, but not these! You are suppose to wear them for 30 minutes, but the first time I used them I only wore them for 10 minutes until I knew that they didn't irritate me any. I don't like the heavy, goopey gel that is left on your teeth after you take them off, & it definitely has to brushed off! My husband didn't seem to mind it & has taken over them. He has used half the box, a weeks worth & his teeth are noticeably whiter! He is excited to see how white they are after the other 6 packets!

My daughter of course wanted the pink one in her room & we put the blue on in my son's, & the white one in our bathroom! They automatically shut off during the day which is great! My daughter loves having a pretty pink night light in her room & my son can actually sleep with this one in him room, even right beside his bed as it isn't super bright like his old one was. I really like the one in the bathroom & can't believe I didn't have one in there before now! The outlet it is plugged into is up on the wall above your head, so it lights up the toilet area well!

"This infinity fiber lash mascara is pretty nice! I have used younique as well as a couple other knock off brands & this one has to be the closest comparison to younique & one of my favorites! It comes in a nice little box & the mascara tubes are on a silver satin like material. The silver tubes make this mascara look expensive. The spoolie brush on both the transplanting gel & the fibers are nice & easy to use. You can use it with or without your regular mascara, I have done both & both looked good. Be careful not to use too many fibers or you will get that spidery look & will experience fall out & have little black hairs all over your face!As long as you only put the fibers on the middle to the ends of your lashes, don't use to much, & remember to seal it with a second coat of the transplanting gel, you shouldn't have fibers fall in your eye or on your cheeks. The fibers are 100% natural fibers taken from the companulaceae of green tea & this fiber lash mascara is a lot easier to wash off than the others too which is a major plus! I like these mascara a lot, especially for special occasions, but I don't find the 3-4 step process necessary for everyday wear.

"These sunglasses are very nice looking with their red & gray frame. The lens are polarized which adds on to the looks! They are light weight & comfortable, but I have gotten my hair stuck in the sides with the way they are made a couple times. Which isn't a problem for my husband, but when I tried them on my long hair got caught. They come in a little black drawstring bag with a cleaning cloth included.

"Last night I finally got around to bathing the dogs & used their new shampoo! Sadly it arrived half empty as the cap came loose during shipment, but at least it smells good because it was all over everything, so they should definitely have the cap taped or something. My Pomeranian has extremely dry, itchy skin & so I always try to use dog shampoo with oatmeal in it. This one also has shea butter & aloe vera in it so it soothes & relieves dry skin, & conditions & moisturizers their coats making them smooth & tangle free, plus leaves them smelling nice, with a light scent of oatmeal. This dog shampoo is safe to use because it is 100% organic, & soap free! The only ingredients are coconut, olive, & jojoba oil, lemongrass & rosemary essential oil, organic aloe, & rosemary extract.

"I was so excited when my new silk pillow case arrived & couldn't wait to get it on my pillow! I have been wanting a silk pillow case for awhile now as part of my new hair care routine, which involves taking better care of my hair by avoiding color, heat, & styling. I know that the friction from cotton pillows pull on your hair & can cause damage & even breakage, & with my hair already being bleached, dry & weak that is the last thing I want! Using a silk pillow case has more benefits than healthier hair though as it also helps prevent wrinkles, like those lines you see across your face when you wake up after sleeping on your side or stomach! We all know that sleeping on your back is your best bet when it comes to facial wrinkles, but I know I sure don't find that too comfortable!With this silk pillow case your face & hair just slide right acrossed it when you roll around. Plus your skin keeps its moisture as silk doesn't pull the moisture out of your skin like cotton does! It also helps prevent tangles & boy do I need to get my daughter one since she tosses & turns so much! It is also great for healthier eyelashes, not to mention it keeps you comfortable & cool when you sleep! I'm pretty sure my husband wants a silk pillow case too now after how much he heard me go on about how well I slept on it! And, needless to say now I really wish I were sleeping on all silk! I also love that the underneath side is made with 100% cotton so it doesn't slide away from you! The zippered closure is awesome & a definite plus! This mulberry silk pillow case is also hypoallergenic & even dust mite resistant! It comes packages in a nice little black gift box so it would make someone a great gift!

"Stevia has a bad rap because almost no one in the U.S has ever tasted product equal to the quality of this product.I've been selling Stevia for years into the Nutraceutical Industry and been forced to use my companies expired samples for personal use because we don't sell under 5kg Qty. The cheap stuff sell 20 to 1 over the Gras level quality product. The garbage you commonly find on the market  [usually 90% Steviosides OR LESS] is 1/4 to 1/3 the price of this product, Available at a fraction of the cost  everyone markets the cheap stuff and depends on masking agents to cover the bitterness or just plain sells an inferior product. It's a shame that no one knows what true stevia tastes like. Truvia what a joke. [Explained Later]When comparing Stevia look on the label. Does it say Reb A [Rebauside A] 97% or above, if it doesn't specifically mention  Reb A [Rebauside A] then it's the cheap stuff. Reb A is a constituent or Glycol of the Stevia Plant which is 200-300 times sweeter than sugar, 0 Calories, and approved by the FDA for Food.I've sold and tasted the two and I can tell the difference, and the taste and concentration  of this product is spot on with authentic Gras caliber Stevia. By the way I don't sell to this marketer and don't have any interest other then to educate others.This is the real deal. It does not have that bitter aftertaste associated with Stevia. It doesn't have dextrose or any fillers so you'll need a super small spoon or be prepared to use very small amount.Stevia 95% and above has Gras or Generally Recognized as Safe. This means that the FDA has approved it for use in common food and beverages. Any lower grade Stevia has to be sold with a Dietary Supplement Warning Label.This is the same stuff that they use in Truvia but without the Fermented Corn Starch, sorry meant to say erythritol, that they cut it with. Truvia is a joke, it is heavily cut Stevia, while I've been told that it's good in Coffee, I'm not a fan of fermented Sugar Alcohols.From Live Strong""Sugar alcohols such as erythritol are difficult for the body to digest, which can cause digestive problems if you eat too much. Symptoms include diarrhea, gas and bloating. The amount needed to cause symptoms varies greatly based on your individual tolerance. Some find that even small amounts of sugar alcohols upset their stomach, while others can tolerate higher amounts before they experience gastrointestinal symptoms.""Until you've tasted this Stevia you aren't qualified to judge Stevia as a sweetener.What it's good for:Tea - Green Black pu-er Chai you name it and it works great.Great to boost the sweetness of any Fruit Drink Such as Cranberry JuiceGreat to boost the sweetness of any fruit such as Grape Fruit, or Black Berries, Blue Berries, StrawberryGreat to sweeten Yogurt, Cottage Cheese and FruitSmoothies etc..Great with VanillaWhat it's not good for:Coffee- Aargh Tastes Horrible Alone.Hot ChocolateYes this product is more expensive then the commodity products but it's also much more expensive to manufacture and the marketers cost is higher too.Try it!As the old saying goes,  you get what you pay for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD6G1MCIXTRT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPS40WS#wasThisHelpful","RD6G1MCIXTRT1","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update after around 40 to 50 hour Burn In:All week long I've been burning them in. Used a program from Jbuds butbut mostly just playing them overnight with a Classic Rock Station from Slacker going.There is definitely a difference in sound. They keep getting better.I compared them again against my Sony's and realized that the Sony's aren't picking upnuances of the instruments. Also initially the treble sounds were muddy, that muddyness is going away.Will continue to burn them in for another week until I have around 100 hours on them.My impressions of the Earbuds are that they are incredible on the Treble and Bass Instruments etc.But I've noticed that the instrumentals often comes through stronger than the vocals. This is across different Gendres of music.It's like you hear all the Instruments Clearly and in the forefront but the vocals are in back of them. I haven't figured outyet if I like this or not. In one sense I'm listening to music in a way that I've never heard it before, but on the other sideI'm accustomed to voices being in the forefront.By the way Jazz and Classic and Opera are tremendous.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Just got these in today and ergonomically these are the finest earbuds that I've ever seen or owned.I'm a loop em over the ear guy. I learned a long time ago that it's the most secure way of wearing earbuds.If you don't like to wear your earbuds looped over the ear. Move on these aren't for you.These have a stiff loop that feels secure and comfortable. One of my complaints has always been that if I take a earplug out of my ear to listen the earbud will out. Not with these. The loop will hang from my ear.My second major complaint is that I always have trouble finding the buttons on the earbuds. I have a Moto X so I knew ahead of time that I wouldn't be able to use the volume buttons.  No problem, on my Android phone I found a program called "" Head set Button"". The way I have it set is that I press the center twice and the volume goes down to a set limit, I set it at 45% then it automatically goes up until you stop it by pressing the button another time. Works even better then using a 3 button controlWhat is outrageous about this headset and no one has remarked on it, is that it not only has a center button but also clicking right and left side simultaneosly does a center click, If you look carefully you'll see a deep indentation, when you press the indentation you either push the button orthe Plus Minus buttons simultaneously. Is that cool or what. This is the easiest darned button that I've ever used. It's just so easy to find.Finally the headset has nice long cord. I like to put my phone on my desk, in my car etc and with the long cord I don't feel constricted.Now for the bad, I'm not an audiophile, just an average Joe, but I compared the sound to my $20.00 Sony Earbuds and truthfully my they may have been the same or gulp maybe my Sony's a little better until reaching highest volumes. But I'm not disparing,  before buying these I read an article in a Audiophile Magazine where they changed the review on these after burning them in for a week non stop. So for the next week it's burn in time, I'll be running them almost 24 hours a day,  and I hope to return to this page with an update telling how wonderful they sound.Based on Build Quality, 3 year warranty and the outrageous ergonomics even if the audio doesn't improve, these are a keeper!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6T7APB45DA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ELAM8NC#wasThisHelpful","RC6T7APB45DA7","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hurray, this review has the most helpfuls of any negative review also the most unhelpfuls.I'm happy that I could make even 1 person aware of the defects in these headset. The most important reviews are the ones that help others to avoid making a mistake [For their situation] or reinforce the decision to buy because the defect doesn't affect the buyer.Everyone has a opinion about the star system. My opinion is that if what you buy didn't work out for you and that the reasons weren't disclosed on the description or on the manufacturers page, then it's your responsibility to make others aware of the shortcomings.Sennheiser does not have a updated compatibility page for compatibility with different phones. Their page states that it will work with most smartphones. No where on the internet was it disclosed that not even the middle button wouldn't work with certain phones. I extensively researched these before buying them. I read articles, reviews etc.. and information about incompatibility wasn't available. I even asked a sales rep on a  site specializing in Headphones if just the middle button would work and he said ""Yes"".Verbatim from the Sennheiser site it says ""Samsung Galaxy, Sony, Htc, other tablets and smartphones."" I though I fit into other category. My expectation was just for the middle button to work. These are proprietary buttons designed for certain phones, if you don't own one of those then be careful.My second issue with the Headset is that the location of the Microphone on this Headset is proprietary and not normal. It is positioned higher then any other headset that I've ever tried. While fine if wearing under ear, when worn over the ear it was exactly 1/2 inch below my earlobe. I've owned at least 10 headsets from different manufacturers and this is the first time I've encountered the mic being located less then 3 inches below the earlobe. Maybe this is common on high end headsets, I'm not sure.I loved these In Ear Headphones, the sound even without break in was superb and rich sounding. I found them to be very comfortable.If I had a Samsung Phone I'd give them a 2 Star. If I had a Samsung and didn't wear looped  over the ear I'd give a 5 Star. The position of the microphone was a deal-breaker.My expectations weren't that high:In my Moto X, I wasn't expecting all 3 buttons to work, but just the center 1 as with every other Android Headset and Apple Headset that I tried. I was expecting not to have the volume controls, but  thought that the middle button at least would work. With a middle button I can use a program like headset control to  raise and lower headset volume using just the one button. Most importantly I can pause the Music. On my Moto X none of the buttons worked. By the way the plug is thin and easily plugged into my phone, so this is not an issue of case blocking complete contact of Headset Plug.My expectation for the mic was that it might be a little high as many headphones not specified for looping over the ear, but not only 1/2"" below my earlobe is not normal.I would highly recommend these Earphones to a Samsung, Sony, or HTC user who doesn't wear them looped over the ear. As stated previously the sound is very rich. I absolutely hated returning them.But if you own a Moto X No Way, or Smartphone that is not Samsung, Sony or HTC, then be careful. If you wear looped over the ears then this headset is definitely not for you.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZUR9ND9I0P5N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3RFFV6#wasThisHelpful","RZUR9ND9I0P5N","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Probably would sound great as is on studio monitor style.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++This is a review about the Moto X in general.Just received my Moto-X Gen 1 phone using Republic Wireless and I'm impressed as heck.I'm switching over from an Iphone 4s. I had nothing but trouble on Android and went to Iphone 4s around 2 years back and have been very happy except for one major issue.The lowest cost programs use the Sprint Towers and my house is a Grey Spot, tower just doesn't work well . I started with a Moto E for my Daughter $100.00 for the phone and $10.00 a month for unlimited Text , Calling, but Internet only through Wifi.Her phone comes in and I'm amazed. Her $100.00 phone had a screen that was way bigger then my Iphone 4s and she was receiving and making calls without issue from the house.I did the math and figured out I could buy a Moto X get a unlimited 3g plan and save around $15.00 a month which will pay off the difference in selling price of used Iphone 4s and New Moto in 7 months.Let's talk about the Moto X in general.Android has finally come of Age. I like this phone more than the Iphone 4s. The screen is way bigger but the form factor isn't much larger.Seems around as zippy too.Suggestion to new Android users. The trick is don't add too many 3rd party apps and just work with Standard Google and Google Apps that comes with phone. If you add launchers and too much customization programs you are going to slow down the phone. The beauty of the Moto X is that the devision of Motorola that makes it was bought by Google. So the phone has a very pure android interface.The custom Programs Added by me are as follows:Shake- This cool program let's me shake the phone and have Google Now Appear. Move it back forth and recents show up, shake on the side and phone turns on.How cool is that.Giganticon -AWidget which allows you to make front screen Icons big without messing with the Launcher. Basically it just adds an icon with a shortcut and you can adjust the size of the Icon.Swift Key-A keyboard that rocks, bigger then the standard Google Keyboard. Predictive text.To Do Reminder from App Innovations is excellent reminder/alarm program.Battery Widget Reborn - Shows your battery % agesThen I added the usual, Audible, Slacker, Waze, Yelp NetflixHere is what I love.Touchless ControlsI have always hated having to push buttons on my phone. I just want it to do what I want it to do without me touching it. Google and Motorola really nailed it on the Moto X ,Initially I was hesitant about Touchless because you have to say OK Google Ready. Google is invasive enough without me having to say their name 20 times a day. Also the phrase is long. I looked on the internet and found a loophole.There is an alternative to saying ""OK Google Ready"", looks like the engineers at Motorola left a Backdoor to use a simpler and shorter phrase ""OK Moto"". This shorter sounding phrase sounds better to my ears. It was very easy to implement when you train it to say"" OK Google Ready"", just say ""OK Moto"" instead. It'll pick it up and memorize.I went a step further and added a program called Shake and by shaking the phone the Google now interface comes up. But the Ok Moto still comes in handy when driving.Touchless Control Rules. I don't have to hit any buttons to get into voice commands. No more pressing button for 4 seconds to wake up Siri. To make calls or open/switch to apps Just say ""Ok Moto"" Call [Person] or open [Program] No more of the two second press to get Iphones Siri to respond.I'm finding that Google Now is around as accurate as Siri, also they have a setting to personalize it IE Learn and if you leave that setting on it appears to keep getting more accurate.Next Moto adds a feature called assist to the phone. It detects when I'm driving and if someone calls me, It says [Caller] is on the phone do you want to answer. HOW COOL IS THAT. And of course when I'm driving using the Touchless ""Ok Moto"" I can do most things without ever having to reach over and touch the phone. This is both convenient and much safer then reaching over and pushing a button for two seconds..I give the Phone a Five Star rating because Motorola and Google have nailed it on providing a great user experience.Though it may not have the Latest Greatest Processor, or the Highest resolution, I find it zippy and doing the job.Apple you goofed, the Iphone line doesn't pay attention to the touchless experience. Until you integrate touchless controls into your phones, Motorola and Android have surpassed you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLIP54SEO3V7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E92B88I#wasThisHelpful","RLIP54SEO3V7G","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mr Two Thumbs put this on with no problemsI must have looked at every screen protector out there.I'm Mr Two Thumbs and was fearing putting on a protector. I decided against the ones that use the liquid because knowing me, I'd probably flood my new Phone.Yes it took me around 3-5 times with the same protector to get it right. But the protector is thick enough and not too sticky that I couldn't reseat it until I got it right. Bubbles were easily pushed out of the way. I used my fingers mostly.

"I got the Carbide Series White and Black and it's Beautiful. I just put together the cleanest build ever. There are no cables showing through the windows and every wire is strung through the correctly placed grommets with precision.This case has full tower capability in a small form factor. [Drawback in Negatives section].It will accept a Dh-15 Fan [One of the Tallest Fans Ever] Extended Motherboards, Extra Long Video Cards, Extra long Power supplies. And all this in the form factor of a corpulent Mini Tower.Now about the size. I compared it to a minitower on a co-workers desk and it was only 1 inch higher. It's probably twice as wideIt is the first high power computer ever that I was able to put on the desk at my house. Any Mid or Full size tower is simply too highand deep. Also for stability reasons I wouldn't feel comfortable.Transporting this case was a dream compared to my Mid Tower.  While not a really light case,  it's a lot lighter then myAll metal Haf 922 was. I would not suggest that anyone looking for a mobile case purchase this. Too much plastic and plexiglass to scuff and break.Especially in the White and Black model.When transporting from my office [Where I assembled it] to my house I used the black cloth cover that came with it. Soit arrived immaculate. Kudos to you Corsair for including the cloth cover. A necessity for a machine with exposed white plastic partsand a immense plexiglass type side window.Putting in my car was easy and I followed this technique.I moved the passenger side chair all the way forward. Then I put it in the back with thefront facing backwards. Then I moved the passenger side front seat all the way back and reclined it.Perfect, because this is cubular the center of gravity is stable and it didn't' fall over.In addition carrying it around, I found it easier to hold ,the lower profile box shape is just easier to carry.Now to the negatives.1st and Biggest Negative -Possible Deal Breaker. The biggest drawback for some would be that it has limited 3.5"" and 5.25""  Slots. My build all fit.The Two  5.25 taken by a BluRay DVD Burner and a Lamptron Fan ControllerThe Two  3.5"" by a 1tb Velociraptor and a 1 tb CaviarMy 540Gb EVO SSD Drive taking 1 of the 6 SSD SlotsI believe with a little mickey mousing I could add another 2 3.5"" drives,.2nd Negative Possible Deal Breaker- and a reason this case may end up $30.00 to $100.00 more expensive.Warning Will Robinson the DVD Burner is positioned  sideways and many drives won't' operate that way. in normal position. I found I could tip the case at an angleand the burner would open. Then put it back to normal and the burner had no problem working sideway. To operate normally you need a slot burner instead of tray burner and theydon't make those in 3 1/2 or 5 1/4 size. So you need to get a Slimline Slot Burner a frame by Digistor and cables around $100.00. Or one company sells it pre-assembled for $110.00Any way who really wants to be tipping a high end system. I don't need a superior player for the most part. So I ended up buying an slimline external USB DVD Writer for $30.00. I almost never watch BD movies so I'll leave the BD Player in and just use [by using the tip method] a few times a year for Blu-Ray ovies.Another thought, if you are into CD - DVD Rom Copying etc and have lot's of burners then this is not the case for you.3rd Negative: Possible Deal Breaker - If you plan to move this case around a lot.  lot's of plastic. This is not a sturdy and indestructible definitely do not go drop kicking it around the fields.4th Negative- Annoying but not a deal breaker. If I'm going to spend this kinda money on a case, I want my build [through the window] to be immaculate. Well the Motherboard 24Pin Connectors closest Grommet Top Grommet is blocked by the 5.25"" Cage. Their is no way you can get those connectors to slip behind that cage. YOu have my motherboard and you want perfection then you have to remove the cage.I'm telling you almost the longest part of the build was dissasembling the case to get that rack out.Attn: Corsair, if you are listening, your manual is really lousy. There are no instructions on how to do this. So I had to figure out through Trial and error. I repeat your manual sucks! Not a clue. Hey if my whole build is going to be seen through that huge side window it's gotta look awesome and the cables be arranged perfectly. I would think anyone buying this case isn't going for a mediocre build.Removing the 5.25 cage was a necessity for me. In addition, it's hard to secure the 5 1/4 in the slot. I forgot to do it while open and I think I'm just going to use a temporary style glue to hold them in because taking that rack out is a bear of a job.I was really conflicted on whether to give this product a 4 star or 5 Star. Really I wanted to give it a 4.5 but that doesn't exist.So while pondering this dilemma,  I went out and looked at the Assembled system  , the white on black [Sharp as heck], and the huge Plexiglass window [showing my cleanest build ever]. I just had to give it a 5 star.After taking it home and seeing how it fit on my desk and the great trans portability I see no need to change the 5 star. There is no other case that I'veseen that offers so much in such a small form factor.As long as you can live with the pausity of 3.5"" and 5.25"" bays and aren't looking for indestructibility, you will be very happy owning this case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ER8JD70Y4BYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H8JLM94#wasThisHelpful","R2ER8JD70Y4BYC","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a monster of unit. It's huge. Luckily I have a Haf 922 which is a very roomy midtower. I checked compatibility first and it fit. Be careful and make sure that your case is big enough because this unit is big.The reason why I tried this is that after 3 years or so my H-55 went bad on me. I didn't like that on opening the case I saw the slightest condensation of chemicals on the side. Also the stories about the ones that go bad and irrigate your system make me shudder.So I went looking on the Internet for the best Air Cooled Fan around and this is the one that had the best reviews and benchmarks.I bought the  highest stock voltage CPU on the market AMD 9590 and wasn't sure if this Cooler would be strong enough to keep temps down.Normally I do my own work but I didn't even attempt to do the install this myself. This Cooler is just so Big and my CPU so small. I was right because It took over an hour for the guy at Fry's to assemble and install it.His initial words to me were. Shouldn't this chip be water cooled. Won't it run too hot. I told him that I had investigated and that this Air Cooler keeps up with the higher end stock water coolers and if it didn't keep the CPU cool, it's on me.Finally we fired it up and ran 8 cores of Prime 95, Small Units Maximum Heat. The CPU Socket didn't go higher than 55"" C and the Core CPU was in the 40s' C Wow!!This Fan disproves that Stock Air Cooled is inferior to Stock Water Cooled.Quiet, did I mention that this Air Cooler is very quiet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGA4FUOZKSZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJY25NI#wasThisHelpful","R2NGA4FUOZKSZQ","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've held up posting a review for 4 months because I wanted to see the durability of this Remote. It's been great. Haven't had to change  the batteries. And it's saved me aggravation a few times.Reason why I bought this is that I have a Stimulus Collar with two pieces. 1 is the remote and the other is the collar. Well the remote kept getting misplace. I'm very organized with my stuff. But with 3 children. You can imagine the strange places it ends up. I lost the first one and after spending $80.00 to replace it found it in my back under the rear car seat.Every time it disappears I go looking with my keyfinder and I've found it in such odd places as, in the bathroom [Took off to give dog bath]. Under a bunch of papers in the living room. In back of the couch. [Fell behind cushion].

"My Radeon Saphire HD 5870 Fan broke and I replaced it with a EVGA GeForce GT 630 1024MB GDDR5,. I decided to return that card because it reacted badly with the Bio on the Asus Crosshair iV motherboard. While moving it around to different slots, I didn't notice that a screw had fallen onto the Motherboard. I noticed the fallen screw and like a lame brain fished it out while the Computer was running and fried my motherboard.I replaced the motherboard with a Gigabyte 990FXA-UD3 the problem went away but I had already initiated the return and I wasn't happy with the GT 630. It couldn't handle Crysis [The original].Did a lot of research and just couldn't bring myself to spend the extra $70.00 on the GTX-760. I bought my Asus GTX-660 at $185.00 delivered with tax. Anyway I was very hesitant about the install. I had read in other posts that Windows 7 64 Bit might have problems with it. Some said to use the Asus Drivers, and some said to use the Nvidia Drivers.Well I installed the card, with no problem then fired it up, and nothing on the screen, I have enough experience that before panicking I make sure everything is plugged in so i checked and sure enough, I had neglected to plug in the DVI plug for the monitor. Plugged it in and showed black screen. I waited a while then I turned off the computer [Hard Off] and fired it up.Computer fires up and the monitor looks perfect. The proper and most updated drivers from Nvidia were installed.I installed GPU Tweak and it wouldn't work on the card, Whenever I tried to change it wouldn't save. This may be because I used the Nvidia Drives and not the Asus. But I suspect that the settings are hardwired into the GPU Bios.  I installed Zotac Firestorm and played with it and according to furmark, I was able to increase the score in 1080p from 1888 ot 1960 or a 4% increase. More then that and crash. That extra 4% made a difference in Crysis at the toughest points.This card is enough for the majority of Gamers.Crysis is the torture test of games and I played 1920*1080 with antialiasing 2 and all high settings never going below 30 FPS with most of the time 40 to 60 FPS.My View1. It does use a 6 Pin Power Connector2. It is a long card but was a little shorter then my 58703. It is very quiet.4. My case has excellent Airflow and the card never went above 60"" even when being benchmarked with Furmark5. I will repeat this card is very quiet and runs cool6. My experience is that it works flawlessly with Windows 7 64 Bit and the Nvidia Drives work great7. Overclocking this card was difficult when using Nvidia drivers but at it's stock speed it's very good.8. My plan is to run two of these in SLI supposedly two of these in SLI is equivalent to a $1000.00 + Card","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2X0VVKEATM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00919CI5Q#wasThisHelpful","R1I2X0VVKEATM5","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptic and fully prepared to write a 1 star review and pan this product as a Fraud.First let me tell you how it works.It's nothing more than a rectangular plastic piece with the top side being a rubbery material that is the sharpening surface.You do nothing more than rub some shaving cream on it and then take your razor and push it forwards. The contact with therubbery surface aligns and sharpens the blades. Super easy.It comes with a stand. I put the sharpener in the center of the stand and then lean my razor up against it.Perfect for corners.Amazingly it works. I'm using it with inexpensive Fusion Blades from China so my cost savings aren't so high, but if I was using itwith the American Fusion Blade, this would pay itself off within the Year. In addition there is the benefit of a consistent shave each time.Positives1. It comes with a stand. I put it in the corner of my bathroom and no one bothers it. Mostly Sigh..2. It's very easy to use3. It works4. Same Shave every timeNegatives1. I wish that the stand was more customized, since it's designed for universal application that  won't happen.I used the same blade for 2 months and only had to change it because my wife cleaned the bathroom and left the stand outin the open. My daughter when curling her hair proceeded to knock it onto the ground, destroying the blade and my$175.00 Art of Shaving Razor Handle [Over 10 years old] Luckily I epoxyed the handle back together because Art of Shaving hadlowered the quality of there products and don't produce a heavy etched handle anymore.Normally my blades last around 2-3 weeks. Extending to 2 months without quality loss is pretty amazing.What impressed me is that every shave was the same.Normally the first shaves are great then slowly the blades dull and the shaves get harder.Then I change it when I start to get my first strong Rash, Razor Bumps, or cuts.I am using this sharpener before every shave and each shave is the same.By the way I use the Bigelow Italian Shaving Cream, Great stuff, slippery enough to not get cut andunslippery enough to allow the razor to cut the hair and not skip over. Perfect for the fusion.I have the worlds tenderest skin and toughest beard. I've went to professional barbers with straight bladerazors and ended up with irritation and cuts. So if I endorse the sharpening quality of this product thenit's a winner.One Tip.The first time I used it the razor had been in use a week and it kept maintained it at exactly the same setting.This time I used it from day one and it's shaving exactly like day one. So start using this immediately becausemy experience is that it maintains the sharpness of the blade. But doesn't sharpen it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34D750NBPNX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082BSXTO#wasThisHelpful","R34D750NBPNX0","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update after 1 month: The switch from TOTW was flawless, and since the switch her stools have been perfect, she eats less and a fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it. This food has made her much more active.

Well her bowels have always been a little loose on the TOTW Bison formula.I figured that this formula is close, the differences is that the main ingredient is Bone Meal instead of Meat and rice which I think she needs to bind her. Thus difference in price.So far the switch has been flawless, no diarrhea and we are at a 2 weeks and 50/50 mix, Actually, I'm not sure if it's coincidence but she has become much more active and requiring more exercise.So if TOTW becomes too expensive, this may be a good alternative.

"I have an space between my upper teeth that get's gunk caught in it and infected. I also may or may not have had tooth pain caused by a cavity. Not sure if it was pain transference.I was going to use Clove OIl which helps a little but is not too effective. But couldn't find it. So on a lark, I took this tea tree oil and rubbed it on the gum and on the tooth. Amazing, it instantly numbed it, much better then clove oil. Then when I woke up in the morning the infection and pain were gone.Now once or twice a week I put some drops on top of my toothbrush and/or floss it in. No infection since then.

"These batteries don't have the lowest resistance off the charger. But they are workhorses.For example on my Mod running at .33 OHM on a fully charged battery I'll get approximately 3.4V this is on a battery that is 6 months old and I'll be replacing so a new battery may give better results. I'll come back and update after I buy a new set. [Soon]  My Sony 30 Amp battery that is around 6 month old but hardly used, possibly abused!  gives me a 3.6V on the same setup.The difference is that after 10-12 hours of vaping I'm at a level of around 3.2v and after 3-4 hours my Sony 30 Amp 2100 Battery is toast.They have only lasted me around 7 Months but remember that I'm at very high tolerances and a 7 month lifespan is very good for a battery that is being used at close to it's maximum tolerance and that at times has been over-discharged.They are rated for 10 Amp Continuous and 16 or 17 Amp Burst. So check your resistance on the Ohm Chart. My preferred .33 Ohm is within the Burst Tolerances. If you sub ohm below .27 Ohm than you are beyond the tolerance of the battery and use at your own risk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24O13B9QRTGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9AKIVQ#wasThisHelpful","R24O13B9QRTGW","AL2J625PUH5VW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AL2J625PUH5VW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being a huge Greek mythology fan I get excited when I stumble on books that use it as the backdrop of a story. The Olympic Cove series is one of these books. So far there are three installments out, this being the third. Each book can be read as stand alones however, it is best to read this according to their publications. The plot is quite convoluted as well, so start with the first. Thankfully, Nicola Cameron did such a good job, I read the second book without getting lost.Deep Water is not an MM, this is an MMF story involving Poseidon, Amphitrite and their long lost agapetos. The prophecy was clear, they the god and his wife were to have a third but finding that third would mean the beginning of the end of happiness. The series opens with Poseidon and Amphi separated for about seven thousand years. The loss of their agapetos seven millennia past drove a wound between the mates they never once thought could ever be healed. When the Fates inform Poseidon they used an old but never forgotten thread, the news spark the renewal of hope. Unfortunately, there is a weakness: the old soul is human.The story is told from three main points of views as well as the POVs of some of the more important side characters. Where once the agapetos was female, now it is male so the confusion is mainly on the characters themselves.Thetis is still around, unfortunately, and is getting meaner and more cunning. Her interference on the lives of Poseidon's territory is causing havoc on the environment and it is frustrating to read the gods and goddesses battle it out then deal with fighting on another day. Poseidon trying to right a wrong done eons ago is also wearing on him especially when his plans get waylaid by miscommunication and hardheadedness. The author managed to integrate the mythology into a contemporary setting and make it work. It was a fun read. In the end, there is an HEA and rightly so, the getting to that point was an interesting read of erotica and action with a dash of the mytho/sci-fi.The only thing I should warn hardcore MM readers out there, this is an MMF and so involves scenes with between the the men and the men with Amphi. Yes, readers, there are quite a few MF scenes here as well as a lone FF. I must point out, it was a necessary read and it answered a whole lot of questions left open in the previous books.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROBSRU2D5FOVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PLGH98#wasThisHelpful","ROBSRU2D5FOVJ","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of all things sci-fi but I am also a huge nerd for the Greek Gods . Strange isn't it, to refer to the mythological beings when reviewing a science fiction/fantasy novel? Truth is, I was reminded of those myths even when the setting is in a galaxy different from ours and involving advanced technology such as those we see in Star Trek and Star Wars. You can be sure that Star Gate is thrown into the mix as well. It is the interfering beings, though, that made me think Greek Mythology.This is set in a time and space where the highly advanced beings guised themselves as gods and seemingly did not interfere with the lowly lifeforms they created or took a hand in developing. Seemingly for just like the gods, they interfered only when the world or universe was in trouble and so had to took a hand in fixing stuff. In the meantime, we see a galaxy dominated by a volatile and warlike female race who enslaved men for their pleasure, needs and service. These women remind me of the Amazons of old. Caught in the middle of it all is a slaver, Taine, a red skinned being much resembling the demons of legend. He buys a young man, Sunshine and gains an apprentice, Tanner. The relationship that develops between them is peppered with BDSM elements that are not BDSM per se because it is a cultural thing going on here and Taine is just doing his job.This is a huge tale told and there are a lot of characters who come in and out of the story which could confuse the reader. However, I am quite used to this type of story telling because, again, I am used to the way myths are told. There are side characters who pop in and out because they are needed to pop in and get out as soon as they did their interference into the lives of these three men. The god-like beings are the main culprits here for they are interfering busybodies and prone to arguing with each other much like when the gods hold their meetings on Olympus.There is action, speculation, violence and elements that may trigger some readers but these are all essential to the telling of the tale. However, once the epilogue closed, I wondered. There has to be a follow up to this story, there are a lot of things dropped that opened a Pandora's Box of questions and they would involve Taine specifically. Also, someone is not done with Taine so I am left even more curious.Overall, if you like sci-fi and myth mashups, this is the right one for you. Written very well to open the imagination, the images that come to mind as the story unfolds can be quite intriguing and graphic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7YLZBCBVARET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1513702262#wasThisHelpful","R7YLZBCBVARET","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I got the draft for this ARC, I prepared myself for a good read with loose ends that may need to be ironed out. The usual stuff one would expect from an ARC. Surprisingly, this particular work of Etienne read like a retail copy.This book opens a few years after Clyde and Bobby have had their required time in Atlanta. Carlyle, (a.k.a. Clyde) is about to take his board exams while Bobby is ready to retire from the city lifestyle even if his career is at that point many only dreamed of. Both ready to turn from the city, they look to home and Blue Ridge. Their lives passing daily in an almost humdrum way and the only excitement is looking over plans for their new home overlooking a ridge with orchards either side of the view. It's a nice boring life that is, until a worker stumbles into two skeletons from what was obviously a moonshine shack. It should have been an open and shut case but instead, they stumble into a troubled sheriff's office and the real Carlyle is back. As their day to day experiences become more interesting every day, both Bobby and Carlyle begin to wonder the kind of future they are about to face.Set in the days when gay couples were sneered at and beaten up, Bobby and Carlyle live the life as close cousins who choose to live and work together. The support of their immediate family and good friends make them realize they are more lucky than most. When they see they could spread the love around, they don't think twice and face a new life.The story of Bobby and Carlyle is familiar in a way. It reminds me strongly of the relationship between George and Mike of the Avondale series who are very strong and masculine. They are never open to public displays of affection as they knew they had to protect themselves from bigotry of the days but never fail to speak and act their love with each other in the privacy of their bedroom.No, this is not a romance, far from it but there is romance in private between the men. This is more a story of how they are living their lives and how they face up to responsibilities. They make decisions together as well as support each other in every way possible. They are partners. No, there's no romance. Just two men loving each other.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R223JF7WJPU29R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014C3XA9I#wasThisHelpful","R223JF7WJPU29R","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a trilogy but there are only two books out so far. This review is based on the first two books.Em went into a relationship that soon turned sour and abusive. Not in the physical sense as readers are more familiar with, but the mental and emotional kind. His partner of five years made him feel less than what he was and it came to the point where he could no longer think past his insecurities for fear of failure. The one good thing is Em's best friend, Joss, who not only made sure to get him bodily out of that relationship from hell but to get him back on his feet. This story takes place around two years later when Joss decides that Em is ready and so makes the moves and talks for him.Penn was standing in as a barista for his mother's coffee shop when in walks a very interesting but quiet man. It is the friend, Joss, however, who makes sure Penn sets his eyes on that quiet man and both men make plans. Penn arrives at Em's place ready to take him out on a date. He did not expect Joss to be there taking prom pictures of them. Neither did he expect Em to come with a bit of baggage. Instead of making him disinterested, however, Penn's protective instincts kick in and the date proceeds. Their first date is what sets the pace for this first installment. Penn makes sure to gain Em's trust and in the process, delights in Em's intelligence and courage. Breaking down Em's barriers sounds easy enough, but to actually step into the personal space is a different matter altogether when the body is willing but the mind screams NO!Book two opens with Em and Penn in a trusting but budding relationship. Em's trust in Penn is on sure footing and Penn's love for Em is verbalized and expressed openly. The problem is Em's inability to say the words back but his actions speak louder. Penn is set to wait out patiently for that time when Em does say the words but is in no hurry. It is when the parents from hell call Em does Penn realize the why's of Em's resistance to saying the L word.Em and Penn embark on this particular journey filled with distrust for the parents who abandoned Em. In the process, they meet an unusual character who, with his dog, enter the house where a reading of a will is set. Why are the parents all set to embrace Em once more? Why was Em even called in? At the end of this installment, readers are left with a lot of questions that are sure to be answered in the third and final book.The back to back read is what made these stories work for me. If I had read these months apart, I would not even have bothered. This is the weakness of a trilogy story for it sets a certain pace but is too short and the HFN is hanging. Patience is sometimes not a virtue readers hold on to. That said, I would recommend the reading of this trilogy like I did, back to back. Thankfully, even with just the two books so far, it is enough to gain my curiousity meter pinging and wanting to find out how it will all pan out for Em and Penn.Note: Joss is a very interesting supporting character who steals the show when he does show up.

"Feat of Clay is the story of Tate Williams and Clay Mortimer. For those of you who have read the Men of London Series, Clay was a side character mention once or twice. Think Sight and Sinners (Men of London #2), Draven and Taylor's story. Clay is this big, macho, really dominating and assertive character who controlled his high-profile Mortimer Investigations with an iron hand. This is where Draven Samuels worked. We caught a glimpse then of a man who was troubled for his lover, someone unnamed. That lover was Tate. The stunning opening scene sets the pace for this book. The darkness is almost palpable and the emotions Tate is traumatized to remember and feel are horrific to  read.Tate is a dedicated investigator who can act the part if need be. This ability is what made him the perfect undercover agent to infiltrate a drug cartel. What went down in book two is what sets the plot for this installment where we get to see the return to the darker and more erotic side of the author. We read through Tate's struggles and wonder at his artistic streak which helps him cope with the issues he has to live and dream through. By his side, ever the supportive lover and childhood best friend, is Clay.Clay, for some reason or other, remained an enigma to his friends and those working under him. Draven wondered time and again about what really made Clay tick. When he discovers the truth about Clay and Tate, he is surprised and happy but at the same time, worried. Clay feels the pain of his partner and lover and has to stretch his patience to the maximum to guarantee their relationship never falls apart. Tate's PTSD mood swings can give the reader (and Clay) whiplash at times for their intensity and seeming lack of logic. However, Clay perseveres as does Tate. It is only as the read continues will one realize that deep down, both men have this unconditional love kind of relationship.As usual, this is an intense read. What Mac Nicol book is not? At times the darkness of her work can send the reader into the nightmares of her characters. At other times the humor pushes its head out and allows the reader to snort with laughter. And then there are the times where her characters leap out of the pages and seem more real than fiction.Tate is an intense character. I think this is one of Ms Susan's more intense one, other than Alexander Montgomery of Saving Alexander. As for Clay, he is just as intense but is more subtle so comes out the supportive character of the two.This is the fourth book of the Men in London series. It is darker and a bit more intimate in the psychological sense. Each and every book is a standalone but the stories and characters are all interconnected in one way or another. They all come highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FD83RAQB9Q9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W8W7CU#wasThisHelpful","R1FD83RAQB9Q9Q","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first book of the Mates series was Wake Me Up Inside and it was a delicious romance between an alpha shifter and his childhood best friend. The second, Until Forever Comes, was about a wolf shifter and a vampire. This third one is about two young alpha-in-waiting who come from different, neighboring and, for all intents and purposes, friendly packs. These three stories have one thing in common: the important information regarding same sex mating was never mentioned in the annals of their oral and written history. Imagine their confusion when they meet their true mates in the form of men. There is confusion, there is misinformation, there is trouble at every turn. If we add in the element of un/misinformed alphas and pack members? tsk tskThis third installment is the book I had been waiting for since I read that second book. There were details there vaguely touched and had remained a mystery. Until now. Answers are finally revealed through the mind of Samuel Goodwin, one of the young alpha-in-waiting. His is a brilliant mind and he learned all things written from books and unwritten from his beloved father, the current alpha. Although he is physically strong, his mind is really his main strength, and as the story progresses, it is soon apparent why he may have to rely on this mind rather than his brute strength.The other young alpha male is Korban Keller. He also comes from a long line of alphas but their reputation was not that good. This is the same pack that abuse and shun member shifters they deemed different, and gets into trouble with other packs when members decide to relocate. Korban is different, though. He had recognized his true mate in the young Samuel way back when they were children and although it is this realization that would later prove to be his strength, many also considered this a weakness and could prevent his taking up the alpha role.So what do two young, strong, alpha males do when they end up as true mates? Other than the usual angst of being the same sex and the expected pack rivalry, they both have to deal with a tragedy that strikes them at the most unexpected time. This was a heartbreaking event that changes the course of how each young man would live their lives and how they see their future roles as alphas of their respective packs.There is a saying: ""from the ashes of tragedy rises the true strength of the alpha."" In this case, two alphas. Each man must deal with their tragedy, their mating, and the politics within the shifter world. Who will win out in the end?Those who had read my Review for the second book know I did not like it in the least for it was too erotic and angsty and I felt that the plot suffered from it and prevented said plot from moving forward. Then again, that was my opinion then and I trusted the author. How happy was I when she comes up with a gem of a third book that not only surprised me with the turn of events, but detailed the much needed information, getting this story arc beyond that of the usual MM shifter romance? Let's just say: I jumped up and down and threw a fist pump. Totally unexpected, beautifully executed.This book is a beautiful balance of heartbreak, romance, eroticism, political intrigue, action and mystery. The story developed so well it did not drag once. It was lightly written (despite the events unfolding), making this a fast read. It's action packed scenes were not limited to the shifter battles and fights but instead extended deeper into shifter politics. Twists into the plot turned this unpredictable and very intriguing making it a harder read to put down for then it would mean having to disturb the flow of the story and the time to get to that end. So yes, I read this in one sitting.A one hundred percent improvement from the second installment, this is definitely a must read. For those who have not read the first two books, it should really not be a problem, but it would mean missing out on a great series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DDU3OTBXKWJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011STPGGO#wasThisHelpful","R1DDU3OTBXKWJR","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first edition of Until Forever Comes and it was a huge disappointment. I rated it a 1.5 stars. You can read the original review here. Thing is, the story of the wolf shifter mating with a vampire had been introduced into the first book and when it was finally their story to be told it fell short of expectations. When this second edition came out, I was ready, set, go to take a look, hoping this time, Ethan and Miguel's story would be told in the way I am accustomed to this author's style.Cardeno C. lived up to the challenge and came up with a truly remarkable back story to the Mate series.Where at the first edition I complained about all sex and no story development, the author tweaked it so this time the read still has all the scenes but the story of Miguel and Ethan is given a boost and made it more comprehensible and romantic.This book is a back story, as I have mentioned before. It takes place decades long past when the packs stayed clear away from the humans they considered half-souls, those without mates. The bigotry is there but they are becoming a dying breed. They do not yet realize they need to integrate with human society that dominated the planet for the packs to stay strong.Miguel is a vampire of several hundred years and he sees the need to invest in properties that would guarantee the vampire food and their anonymity. He is one strong and volatile vampire who is hungrier than most. When he stumbles and takes a sip of Ethan's blood, he is aware of the young man as a shape shifter. What he is unaware of is that Ethan recognizes the other half of his soul. When Miguel nearly destroys himself in becoming feral, it is Ethan who steps in to complete him. What both did not expect was bigotry from the shifter and vampire sides. They are the key to the whole series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GF784237FG71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011STPHA4#wasThisHelpful","R2GF784237FG71","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first edition of how an alpha wolf shifter held on for so long on a long distance relationship with his childhood best friend and mate. It is one of the most romantic I have ever read from this author.Zev Hassick grew up knowing he was an alpha and he asserted his dominance over the pack from day one. As an alpha in waiting, he stood proud and tall over his generation and made sure they never stepped out of line. He was a child of the modern world and seeing as their pack had to brush shoulders with human, he managed to convince his father that sending him and those his age to the human school is the best way to integrate themselves without revealing their true nature. In the process, he gets to go to school with his wolf's puppyhood friend, human Jonah Marvel.Jonah never thought it strange a particular 'wild' wolf would come up to him at odd times to play and just be kids. As a toddler, he didn't know any better. As a teen, he never thought over the simple fact this wolf was his age and still be in its prime. All he knows is, when he needs it, the wolf is there. At school, he became best friends with Zev who seemed to be different from the rest of them but reliable and trusted by Jonah.As the two grow up, there is the pull of attraction, trust and love which develops. Zev earlier on realizes his love for Jonah may be something out of the ordinary. Jonah just knows he loves Zev. When they declare their love for each other, one would think they would immediately get their HEA. This is not what happens.Zev, as an alpha, is a planner and looks to the future. He sees Jonah as part of the pack, as his mate, and the pack healer. As Jonah needs years to complete his medical training, he cannot afford to lure him in before that time. The years roll by and Jonah starts to question his relationship with Zev. It takes every bit of planning, cunning and manipulation on Zev's part to guarantee Jonah become his alpha mate and be accepted by his pack. If his plans fall through, he is ready to turn his back and be with Jonah.I really loved this story. It spans several decades and the unfolding of Zev and Jonah's maturity is a great read. When they finally reach their HEA, I got the full blast of a romantic fulfillment that made the heart thrum. These two men are key to what unfolds in the third book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKV2SFT7WQ03C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0137I04VQ#wasThisHelpful","RKV2SFT7WQ03C","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Danny's Dragon is not a paranormal or shape-shifter story. It is actually a story about two regular men who eyed each other from a distance not wanting to make the first move for fear of rejection. One was born in the year of the Dragon, Dave, and the other was born in the year of the rabbit, Danny. Hence the title. The way I understand it, the rabbit and the dragon are a compatible yinyang.Both Danny and Dave are not out to their families and that is what drives this story. Danny is of Chinese heritage and culture so is fearful of how his parents, especially his mother, would react when she finds out. Dave comes from an abusive family and has the same fears. However, Dave comes from a more battered life because of the ghost of his lover and best friend. When the past comes to haunt both men, it tests their resolve to remain true to themselves and eventually the world. Dave does not handle it well and it is Danny who becomes the firm staff he could rely on.This is a really sweet romance (laced with some bit of philosophy) between two imperfect men whose inner strengths only come out when the pressure is on. Surprisingly, Dave who is the bigger of the two, comes out the one who needs Danny's support and love more. He is full of doubts while Danny's quick and analytical mind is more decisive.Each chapter is introduced with a character from the poems of Lao Tzu and it prepares the readers of what is to come. I found it quite interesting the author chose to use the poem as the anchor to the whole story for if one were to focus on these intros alone, one could already get where the story is headed.  As I love philosophy, I quite enjoyed trying to guess where the author would lead it to end.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWXPPT616YLNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011S2O2ES#wasThisHelpful","RWXPPT616YLNR","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyond the Surface is a second chance at love story. It is a story of how two young men loved then parted because one could not face life as a gay man and the other could not face life deep in the closet. Years later, they meet again and what should have been roses and daisies lighting the fire of passion and romance became full of anger, sarcasm and a whole lot of misunderstanding.Deep in the closet firefighter and survivor of 9/11, Nick Fletcher is a hard man to like at the beginning. He was far from PC, he was snobby to those whose life did not center on machismo, and he was lacking in understanding as to why he constantly plagued by foot in mouth disease. It does not help he has a huge guilty complex the size of the USS Enterprise because he survived and those on his team did not. His secret life as a burn victim advocate just adds to the weight he carries. Tough life he's living.Julian Cornell is a fashion designer who is well on his way as a one show wonder. He put all his aces into his second show but gets slammed by the critics, the media and his fellow designers for putting up a show of copies. He is devastated both financially and emotionally. It does not help meeting his old lover, Nick, who is proving to be too much of an A dollar dollar hole.There is a lot of conflict going on here and we expect a whole lot of angst and drama. In fact, there is a whole lot of angst and drama but not the kind you expected. With Julian down, it is Nick who surprisingly comes up the savior. He shows Julian what life is all about and introduces him into his secret life as a burn victim advocate. Julian is surprised but then sees that indeed there are others out there whose lives are in worse situations other than not wearing the right clothes.This is a love story that grew out of miscommunication to a whole other level of understanding and helping each other out. The two young men who parted are not the two mature men who have gone through hell of different waters and fell in love again.Heartwarming, sweet, and romantic, Felice Stevens has written a beautiful story about how love can be rekindled even if all seems hopeless.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18Y5Z9G5ZIKPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JB97QY#wasThisHelpful","R18Y5Z9G5ZIKPS","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bey Deckard has this talent for giving us short reads that pack a punch. This particular one, diverges from his usual path of strong, macho men who live life with passion and BDSM leanings. This one is actually sweet, yes it is sweet, and involves a transgender for the main squeeze. Not so different from all the rest out there you say, and you may be right. The element that makes this different is the author himself who just manages to get his strength into his characters and make them unforgettable.The Complications of T is a title that plays on two words: Tim and Transgender. Tim is a trans and had gone through a complete transition so is more sure of himself and in what he wants and needs. He wants and needs Stuart but there is a but.Stuart is a great actor but just like a lot of actors, fall victim to the need of money rather than craft. His movies are not directed nor written well. Sound familiar? I mean, I enjoy those films that make no sense yet get my heart pumping because of the action sequences and flash, boom, bangs. Thing is, Stuart thinks he is blasted left, right and center by a certain movie reviewer. Guess who that turns out to be?This is a novelette of sixteen thousand or so words and in this short story, we see Stuart connect with Tim and himself. In five short days, make that six, he gets to finally face facts and may just now find the courage to get over himself. What he needs is a break, from Tim, get back on the right path and cultivate his craft.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3723DQ4UVIENV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145TLEEW#wasThisHelpful","R3723DQ4UVIENV","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A nerdy geek who loves to bake brownies falls for a tough macho SWAT officer who lives just next door. The brownies bake, the Nutella scents the air, the resulting chemical reaction: a funny, sweet, strangely romantic story. Why strangely romantic? Well, I got distracted by the brownies for it colored my imagination. I was caught between the romance between the men and mine with the imagined scent of Nutella spread over brownies. Am I going on an on about the brownies and Nutella?I admit it, I just fell for this story, cake and all. There was just something so sweet about Spencer's personality that took me in from the moment he appeared on the page. As for Quinn, he is a macho macho guy and the fact he likes men, well that was the icing onthe cake for me.This is not a short story but it is so fast paced it might as well be. That is my meter for knowing I totally enjoyed myself reading how Quinn and Spencer finally do the good thing and just get into each others' lives. Not to mention the hoarde of supportive family members and the insane SWAT teammates who drop in for brownies, home cooked meals and Magic Mike.Short (not short), sweet, light, funny and delicious.

"When grandmother Jewell dies, Eric Allen finally gets to live his life. The inheritance left him allowed for a business venture with his best friend. Of course, his inheritance is really the problem here for what is money? Isn't it the root of all evil? In this case, Jewell's children and their beget wanted the money. Problem: Eric is the only heir. How much is involved? Well, not much but enough to get the green eyes of jealousy to turn towards what is presumed to be prey - Eric. You see, Eric is gay and had been kicked out one Thanksgiving day when he told all he was gay. It was Jewell who took him in and in the process, introduces Eric to a community of men and women who acted as uncles and aunts. Aunts in particular is a tough lawyer who with her wife, became the second parents to Eric even at thirty three years of age.Then there is Nathan. He loves Eric like a brother and have been besties for a long, long time. He is also quite the thorn on the side. Someone Eric cannot ever ignore. He is the one who spurs Eric on to make a life changing decision: open a resort exclusively for gays. The venue, a fixer upper. Of course this is where and when Tim comes in.Tim, the handyman, is an opinionated, macho tough handyman. He takes one look and takes charge of making sure the resort is up to specifications and realistic expectations. He is a hard character to nail, no pun intended. In fact, I kind of only have a vague idea of who he is as an individual. He is fascinating and made my imagination go a little wild.The premise was good. The story line fascinating. Where did it go wrong for me? Maybe it was my expectations on how the story would go based on the blurb? The plot flowed well even if the romance between Eric and Tim was a bit like looking into a faraway horizon. The one who took my attention was actually Nathan, the best friend who pushes Eric to make something out of his life. I am quite intrigued by his story when it is time for the telling and want to find out if he really is going to end with the one I wish him to end up with. Now for Nathan, the evil brother, hmmmmmm.... I leave it at that. So setting my initial expectations aside, I did enjoy this story so am going to recommend it to those who would like to give this a chance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LZLO7YU37BXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013ODNM3G#wasThisHelpful","R3LZLO7YU37BXD","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love reading about vampires and cowboys and have done so separately, never together in one story. Bulls and Blood is an alternate universe paranormal romance where the vampires finally decided to reveal themselves to the world and immediately showed the puny humans they were a race to contend with and never to subdue. They are a law unto themselves and powerful. The other supernaturals also came out of the wood works and soon the world as the humans knew it, was never the same again. One of the more powerful vampire families are the Thorns. Turned centuries earlier by one Master, the seven unrelated men from all walks of life became bonded brothers. They moved to America for some reason or other and there established their ranch where the rich vampires came to hunt prey but not kill them. It is all for fun, you see. Of course, there are rules to be followed and one brother, Wesley, the youngest but second most powerful, follow the rules to the letter. Until Mino.Mino is a human but finds himself strangely attracted to the quiet accountant Wesley Thorn. Although a vampire, Mino is strangely unafraid of the manvamp and finally realizes, after five years, he either makes a move or die pining. He moves and Wesley reacts. In the best way possible.On a side note, the other characters are introduced in this first book of The Blood & Thorn Ranch series. One in particular, a Thorn brother I won't reveal, is truly most intriguing and leaves me with a sense of anticipation for when it's his turn to get his story told.This is the first book of the series so does fall victim to the usual first-of-a-series-blues: it leaves the reader hanging on loose ends and questions unanswered. On the other hand, this is a different sort of vampire and cowboy story which makes my curiosity meter ping wildly.I would recommend this to vampire and cowboy lovers out there who want a different sort of story in an otherwise very familiar world of the paranormal M/M romance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ91Z0TT4L6FY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011L3G1WU#wasThisHelpful","RJ91Z0TT4L6FY","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Two very driven competitors on the motorcycle racing circuit go head to head as they always do when an accident everyone fears happening happens. Left confused, full of guilt and seriously questioning their roles as racers, Javier and Glen find themselves thrown together to make sense of it all. The resulting romance that develops between them was both unexpected and yet expected. Their outing is also unexpected but expected.And that is the root of this read. The unexpected is expected. Question is, how will they both survive?The beginning of the story established one fact: the hatred between Javier and Glen. They are tough competitors and also kind of childish in their drive to win the race. This part is successfully written.The following chapters after the accident, that is what I am at odds with. Their romance is a given, this is an MM romance after all, but the aftermath of their outing was too romantic a look at the way the sports world treats their athletes.The good thing about this read was its fast pace and it was light enough to breeze through, like one would a fairy tale. This is a fairy tale story, despite the angst, and that is why I liked it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X0ASPSYEOQ8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0137VU8JQ#wasThisHelpful","R2X0ASPSYEOQ8U","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Forever in the Sun have two stories in it. One is the wedding of Dylan and Lucas. The wedding where everything that could go wrong did and hiding what went wrong from the affected people took a lot of stealth. It was short, sweet and lots of good fun and giggling throughout.The other is how the mystery of the love letters between Peter and Alfie  finally gets its day in the sun. The feuding was stupid, but then again, what feud is not? Also, the angst between Connor and Shaun is purely a matter of miscommunication. Connor is trying to be the good son, or in this case, nephew while Shaun is just trying to get the truth out. Why not? What is the shame of two men loving each other when they were still alive? So someone does not get hurt? Again, sweetly done and gives the reader a light feeling of joy. Especially around the parts where the letters and sketches finally tell their all.Two stories, one that makes you laugh, the other makes us smile with tears in our eyes. Both are sweetly written.

"The end of Charlie's Hero was the stuff that made me jump with excitement for it held the promise of Andrew's story. With Andrew's Promise, we get what the author promised and more for this is a really sweet story of love, perseverance, forgiveness and acceptance.Andrew is Josh's older brother, the one who gave up all to guarantee Charlie get the chance to live the life their father made sure to give them. Andrew's life was normal, a widowed father and a younger brother living in one house. They were friends and family and life was good. Andrew made plans with his best friend, Tanner. They were to take six months off from life and go on a grand adventure. Andrew had it all mapped out and Tanner was excited to see all the places they had dreamed of going to since they were young kids. Unfortunately, life took a tumble, as we all know, and Andrew could not keep up with the adventure and instead had to stay and take care of his younger brother. When Josh found his happiness with Charlie, he had been hesitant to reveal to Andrew he was gay. To his surprise, Andrew did not mind in the least. Curious why, Josh finds out at the last chapter of his book what Andrew was really all about.Tanner had loved Andrew for so long and was heartbroken when Andrew could not go with him to the adventure they had planned for years. To make matters worse, Andrew turned his back on their love. At the time it happened, Tanner did not really understand. Ten years later, he reaches out to Andrew and fortunately, gets the answer he wanted and needed.The story is, again, very simple. Love given a second chance. Love conquers all. Love is a many splendored thing. Simple plot. Sweet story. With Nic Starr making sure to put the smile on her readers' face, this is a favorite story to read over and over again.

"Set in an alternate universe, Trasmundo: Escape is the story of Luka who was labelled and thrown away much like the Jews were in WWII during the dark times ruled by the Nazis. In this world, Luka struggles to survive and almost did not make it but for the unexpected helping hand of an unknown old man. Was he dreaming? Was it wishful thinking? Was it delusion? Or was it some sort of divine intervention? I don't know, neither does Luka really. Point is, he got away but then stumbled into the path of a wayward, bearded soldier who is tough, rough and threatened to kill him. Fortunately, the soldier is more than just what his uniform portrays him to be and ends up a good Samaritan instead. Their journey thus begins and both go through periods of distrust that soon grew to something else. Their story is not ended, we still have a ways to go to find out if they are going to make it through or not. Point is, this story is incredible in its penning.When I grow up, I want to have Varian Krylov's talent for the written word. When I grow older, I want to be able to have at least half her talent in photography and Bey Deckard's talent in mashing up images and come out with a cover that is simply, original and perfect.The first time I read Varian Krylov, I felt inadequate in every sense because she manages to just wrap the readers in a cocoon of emotional images it is hard not to drown in her tale. The way she tells the story, the way she makes the characters leap out of the pages, it is strange she is not picked up by a 'reputable' publishing house and given a footing in the 'published' author world. As it is, I am just thankful I have been given the chance to read her stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJYBY302RRYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01271HY0S#wasThisHelpful","RMJYBY302RRYP","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"~~Dni(ela)   love & semi-colons~~, in her GR review was right on target when she said the only thing she hated about this book was that it ended. Amen!Jules was that interesting femme character in Top Me Maybe? and that cover? You see that cute little guy there with the interesting eyebrows and heat-filled eyes? Oh my, that is definitely our Jules.This read was quite interesting and impossible to put down. Eventually, the pages hit 100% and the fuming need began. I have a personal request for Ms Northcote: please please please please! I need more Jules!!!From the time Jules opened his mouth in the first book to the last page where he finds his hair all tousled up (no spoilers, you have to read why his hair was all messy!), I didn't want him to stay quiet. Of course, his thoughts and insights were a bonus for me from the way he observed his love interest, Gareth, to the way his nimble fingers combed through the hairy beary chest of the man, oh dear. Talk about mental images that refused to go away!This is the best short light read story I have read in ages. Like, AGES!My Rating: (4 of 4 Stars) 5Based on Short&Light Read Category but with a plus! This was simply awesome :DAs for the author's note where she says don't need to read first book? Don't listen to that advise. Get the first and enjoy more of Jules...Now, how do I rate a short&light read category with more than a 4????Serious problem but here is my solution: My Rating: (4 of 4 Stars) 5Based on Short&Light Read Category but with a plus!

"Oh dear, I really expected something less than what I read but thankfully, I got a good read and a new series to look forward to. This actually turned out to be fun and a mystery thriller.The hedgehog Avery is quite the diva and he shows it in the clothes he wears, the way he speaks, the way he chooses his shoes, and the way he looks down at blue collared workers who just happened to be were-shifters too. That he is living in the were-shifter territory through their alpha's good graces does not matter. What matters is that he is comfortable in his condo and shoes. If only he did not get into trouble with a loan shark and almost loses his life only to be saved by the one wolf shifter he swore never to be indebted to.Dylan Green is a wolf shifter and beta to the alpha. He is a mechanic and is successful at it. He is also quite the big bad wolf protector to those under his alpha's protection and does not hesitate to push his weight to do his duty. That is, until the cry came from the hoitytoity hedgehog who looked down on his grease stained fingers.What is the real issue here? Well, fact is, Avery and Dylan? They are mates. How this could happen, I have no idea but they are. Now, why are they not mated? Well, it was not the social status thingy that tore them far from each other. It is that Dylan snubbed Avery. Then again, Avery snubbed Dylan. Erm, just who snubbed whom? Aha!This was quite the entertaining read, and not that angst ridden either so it was quite fast paced. The erotic scenes were quite fascinating and involved the canine knotting but then again, it is a hedgehog so I had other ideas which did not come up. The arc that drove this story was not the mating, even if the blurb did suggest otherwise. It was actually the mystery of the disappearing girls within the alpha territory. Avery found himself in the uncovering of the mystery and made him a solid hog by the end of the read. That kind of confused me a bit for I was expecting something else, because of the blurb.Be that as it may, this was, yes, an entertaining read and I do love mysteries so that satisfied the element for me. If only the blurb said otherwise then I would not have been confused. If you love mytery thrillers and a bit of knotting experience, then yes, this is recommended.Note: Copy provided by Pride Promotions for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q8UA67B7OZCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012BVE0YM#wasThisHelpful","R2Q8UA67B7OZCQ","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Twins Jet and Gray Black are part time musicians with a good following. Their daytime jobs is in education and they are both happy as much as they could be. Things could be better, but they are not. The point is, they survived and they are accomplished in what they do. Better, they are respected.One night they lost their home and it seemed they had nowhere to go but an expensive hotel or an inexpensive, dirty motel. As they thought over how their life could go down the drain thanks to one fire, they are approached by none other than a fireman who they recognize as someone who is not only their loyal Black Brothers fan, but is the same man who Gray has long been attracted to. It helps they know him from a distance as he is someone who follows their act around. Is he trustworthy? Well, Jet seems to think so and Gray has to grit his teeth and follow where his brother leads.Kris has had a long crush on one of the Black Brothers, Gray to be specific. Sure, the twins are identical, but there is just something about Gray that grabs Kris' heartstrings. If only Gray were as nice, as charming, as amusing, and as open as Jet, then Kris would not have a problem. Opening his home to the twins was a move made from the heart as the two really did need a temporary home until they got back on their feet. On one hand, it would lessen the loneliness Kris felt living alone in his old house still filled with the furnishings from an era long past gone. On the other hand, maybe he should not have offered his home because Gray was nasty. On one foot, Jet was a blast and Kris never ate better. On the other foot, Gray went out of his way to make him miserable.Gray has his reasons for his anger issue but really, should he have made Kris be at the receiving end? Maybe he should give Kris a try? Well he did, but then Gray backtracks and there the story really begins and goes on. Seriously, there were times I wanted to bitch slap Gray and wished for Kris to fall for Jet instead, but No! RJ Jones has to guarantee it is Gray who is the love interest. Why? Well, she had her reasons and by the end page, she was right, I guess. It took time for me to love Gray, an instant to love Kris and about a sentence to love Jet.I love RJ Jones but much as I love her, this was a bit of a longish read and the angst sort of dragged on a bit. However, drag or not, the end was what this book needed and more, it was well worth the wait through the drama.If you don't mind my rambling, look to the rating and yeah, this is a recommended read. Well worth the anxiety I had to go through to get to the happy ending these two men deserved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLCJO1LC1KIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011AKK3DM#wasThisHelpful","RBLCJO1LC1KIJ","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shiki is a friend of mine, then again, so is Blake. These two men I've been observing for almost a year now, I think, so of course I had to read their story. Which has not yet ended, by the way. Shiki is as cool as cool can be, Blake a more quiet enigma. Both men are gorgeous inside and out. If only they had come together sooner, maybe what they had to go through could have been avoided?No, this is not a true story, no werewolf/shifter/paranormal story is. Unless I am totally missing something? These two men are quite real to me though for they are my friends. You can check, if you can, on my FB page. They are role play characters two awesome authors play along with others. This is how their story unfolded but the nitty gritty details, all here is laid out in the book. And oh, wow, this is truly a wonderful read.It all begins and almost ends with Shiki losing his two husbands for reasons he could only guess. His inability to find the answers is just one of the few things that drove him on a suicide mission. As beta of a powerful clan, he is not only powerful and highly skilled, he is deadly. With the exchange of blood from both ex-husbands during their supposedly happy times, he is changed. For the better? For the worse? One could only guess and that question is what drives the conflicting lower-powered clans to think they could bully their way through taking over what they most definitely cannot. Shiki has to get out of his depression and do something. And he does. The journey to that point where he  finally found the energy to get up and be out there as beta, now that is what this read is all about.It is a heartbreaking story, Shiki goes through. Two men help him out. Ganz and Blake. But it is Blake who finally gets him to get out of his funk and face the world and responsibilities. To finally live again. Have the strength to let go of a past and be someone else who is most definitely changed but wiser and more confident. He is the only one Shiki knew he could lean on without fear of being babied. Of course he is, for Blake is the one best friend he grew up and trained with. As for their romance? What others saw for years brewing, both men never smelled. Well, they buy food, they don't cook. You know what I mean. If they did, they would have noticed the wonderful aroma of unconditional love.Now, I am biased, I already said I love both men, being friends and all. As for Alina, well, this gorgeous Romanian is one of the besties on FB, everyone knows that too. But I never mince words when it comes to her writing and her style is right on target for what I am constantly looking for. Narrative, image-filled, emotional. She can turn text into a movie in my mind. The action sequences here, they put bushido movies to a test. As for the characters, think cosplay and you get the full blast of her men. Yes, she's really good. As for Blake, I know the author behind the man as well and... let's leave it at that. Talent wise, that author is undeniably up there on my faves list as well. Point is, this story could never have come at a better time. Why? Well, pick it up, take a read, and find out why I loved it so... Get ready for the ride of your life.The story will continue and as for the questions left hanging, I know some answers, but mostly, I don't. I have to be impatient.. erm, sorry, patient.Note: I know Alina is sorry/not/sorry I cried.

"Where to start on this review?  That is the question.  Spurred On by Jon Keys is a retelling of the Cinderella story, but with a male in the lead and set in the land of cowboys.  Instead of a ball there is a rodeo.  And, theres no need for a fairy godfather when theres a mystical medicine hat stallion to help the hero.First of all, I am a huge fan of fairy tales and revised or reimagined fairy tales (except for certain TV shows which seem more soap operaesque to me).  But I digress, back to the novel at hand.  I absolutely love Jon Keys fairy tale.  For the most part, it actually does read like a modern fairy tale without being hokey.  The author gives us a hero we can root for, as well as a great love interest.But, there are a lot of problems with this book, most of which I dont believe are because of the author.  I usually start a review talking about the cover and so Ill start there.  Im reminded of two movie reviewers on an old sketch comedy show who used to say hated it.  That pretty much sums up my feeling about the cover.  There is a problem with using models on covers.The men in the novel are over the top, incredibly good-looking.  I know looks are subjective, but to me the models on the cover look nothing like the characters in the book.  That is distracting because while I do like to imagine the characters myself, the cover is there and quite frankly I dont find either man remotely handsome (no offense to the models) or cowboy rugged.The boots on the cover look great, and the original Cinderella is really all about the shoes anyway, isnt it? (LOL).  The horse was such a big part of the story that I think instead of the men, it mightve been nicer to have a horse and rider in the background and maybe a silhouette of a man in the foreground.  I know, I shouldnt judge by what ifs, but heyits my review.Editing, or rather lack of editing, is a huge problem in this book, which Ill address at the end of this review.  For now, Ill focus on some of my favorite things about Spurred On.  The fairy tale inspirations are all over this novel without it ever seeming trite or silly.  I absolutely love the interactions between the lead character Kegan and the horse.  The horse has a real personality and character all his ownperfection.  All of the characters fit the story exceptionally well, without any missteps on the authors part.Brilliant idea Mr. Keys!  The whole story is original and inspired, yet harkens back to the original Cinderella with a nice almost reverential or respectful feel.  The elements are there, and one would know that without the author telling us, but Jon Keys is in there too in a witty and imaginative way.  He really has something new to add to the old tale and its not just because its now an m/m story.  Changing the setting works wonderfully, and believe it or not the cowboys and rodeo action do have a magic of their own.Now for the bad.  And one thing I will say is that a gifted author like Jon Keys needs to find a publisher who knows what editing actually means.  Decadent Publishing does have editors on staff (trust me-I checked), but the first thing those editors need to do is look up the word editor in the dictionary.  Maybe the horse from the story could explain to the editors at Decadent Publishing what editing means, since clearly they have no idea whatsoever.Yes, Im going on a rant here for reasons which I will now state.  Even the information that went out to reviewers was filled with typos and misspellings.  When this title was sent out for review I had misgivings.  The story immediately drew me in, but the typos were evident from the first line.  Let me just give some examples.In the summary of the story in front of the book there is this line:The only bright spot is a Cole, whos admired from a distance.A Cole?  This is a book featuring cowboys and horses, did they mean to say a colt or is the cowboys name Cole.  Cole is a cowboy in the story, so the a should clearly have been edited out of the summary saying what the book is about.  Then there's the first line of the book:Once upon a time Isnt that how all fairytales start?First sentence and there are two mistakes.  Its one sentence not two, so 'Isnt' shouldnt be capitalized.  And, according to Miriam-Webster 'Fairy tale' are two words not one.  Kegans best friend is named 'Alec' but at one point the name is spelled 'Alex.'  There is also some overusing of words, which a good editor should spot, since its their job to edit.  Yes, Im harping but bad or non-existent editing is getting to be a major problem with books which Ive been given to review.  And, before anyone asks, its easy to tell when an author has real talent and is good, and when the editor does her job poorly.  Even the best authors need editors.  A lot of times they get caught up in the story or characters and end up with typos or simple mistakes. Thats when the editor is supposed to come in and do their job of editing.  Wheres a magic horse when you need one?Well, enough of that.  Would this book have generated a perfect score if it had perfect editing.  Probably not quite, but pretty darn close.There is one thing that left me a bit perplexed because, to be honest, I wasnt sure what I thought about it myself.  Thats the topic of sex in this book.  Im not familiar with this publisher with the bad editing (yes, Im rubbing it in-they deserve it for letting the author down), so I dont know if their books are known for having a certain amount of sex or not.  The earlier parts of the book dont have sex, then all of a sudden near the endbam!  Now, being a male I can certainly appreciate hot man on man sex between cowboys.  Certainly there are more than a few female readers who appreciate it as well.  And the male couple are definitely extremely hot, to be blunt.  OK, OK, so there was hot sexwhats the problem, you ask?The problem is what your views would be on reading about Cinderella rimming Prince Charming.  On their wedding night mind youso it is within the confines of the matrimonial bed.  Hmm you maybe start to see where Im a bit confused as to what I thought about this.  Dont get me wrong, this is definitely an adult book right from the beginning.  Its no childs story, but there is a fairy tale sweetness and charm about it that makes me think twice about those hot, juicy love scenes near, and at, the end.  I havent really made my mind up about all of that.  On the one hand doing the sex scenes in a more fade to black way would retain the fairy tale feel.  On the other hand, it doesnt pretend not to be an adult book.  Either way, readers will have to decide on their own about those scenes.  On a side note, there was some (just a bit) repetitive use of phrases in the love scenesand I dont mean the moans and groans.At long last, here are my final thoughts on Spurred On.  The length of the story is perfect, and characters are endearing and fit the story well.  The story is such a creative rendition of the Cinderella fairy tale that its going to boost my rating up a star despite the horrendous editing job.  Someone at the publishing house isnt doing their job or doesnt know how to do their job.  Time to clean house, I say.  Its very easy to lose readers, especially when you have mistakes in the summary of the book.To author Jon keys, I dont know you, but I loved the whole idea of this book.  It put a smile on my face.  Thank you.  And find a publisher with better editors, you deserve it.Great story, fantastic characters, fun weekend read!  The story definitely pulls this rating up from what I thought would be three stars because of the lack of editing.Four stars  * * * *","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R278H8MQZXW0AJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01255TL34#wasThisHelpful","R278H8MQZXW0AJ","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One young man is determined to win in a reality singing show which is much like a mashup between AI and The Sing Off. Cody is not willing to compromise or take risks: he wants it all. Until Lucas Norwood comes in and threatens his determination. Complication: Cody likes Norwood and Norwood is kind of virginal in a farm boy sweet kind of way.There are a few elements here that did not quite work out for me, like Norwood's virginal persona. I won't expand on that one, I just find it fairytale-like. Then there was their competitiveness which dominated most scenes. It kind of bothered me for their need to outshine the other barred my way into thinking they were going to have a future together. I guess I wanted the fairy tale to extend to their relationship and I did not quite catch on to it. Of course there were instances I just wanted to slap some of the biatchiness going on in the sidelines and offstage from the other characters and frankly distracted my quest for the romance to develop between Cody and Norwood. In short, the read dragged quite a bit and only did pick up in the last chapters which made it a longish read I did not expect from this type of plot. I guess I ask too much and if I am rambling, forgive me!Much as the premise hooked my interest, it took me some time to get to finish this read without descending to skimming the many pages. Thankfully, there was enough of a good read and plot twist in this writing that made me continue and finally reach the end. That ending was kind of sweet, but was it the one I pictured it to be? I don't know. All I do know is that I love Annabeth's style of penning the word, it just did not quite hook me goofy for this one. That said, I would still recommend this read, it is good and entertaining and kind of quirky in some instances.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAORQY2QLSBDH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEOHQP4#wasThisHelpful","RAORQY2QLSBDH","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last time we read Skye Jones was about Kayley Edwards and how she got claimed by mates Luke Johnson and Sean Wallace. That was then. This is now about Dylan and Aeron. On its own, it is an awesome, if not surprising, installment to the Wild Hunters series. Also, it is a fantastic standalone read that kind of took me for a loop. Why? Well, this is really different.Yes, we have a shifter who lost his mate and is drowning in sorrow. Then Aeron Lombardo comes in the picture and suddenly, Dylan is fighting off his guilty feelings over suddenly being thrust into another mating. One he is not ready for. Aeron though, he is more than ready, especially as for the first time, he feels safe and wanted. Then the secrets Dylan keeps rears its ugly head. The family tree Aeron is from, creeps out from the frames. The vampire that destroyed Dylan's life, is coming for him, his new mate and his mate's family. Who does he call? Luke and Sean and the rest of the gang of course.So what is so different about this plot that made me give this a high rating? Well, the action scenes, the twists in the plot and the way the whole story ended, is why.Skye Jones has this knack for telling a story without going uber uber about it. You know what I mean? There is action, there is sex, there is angst, there is drama and best of all, there is an HEA. But the way she reached all those points is what made this a fantastic, if not a bit scary, read.I would suggest reading this installment and if you missed the first one, link is down there. That one is a menage and we get a good dose of what those three here in Claimed by Desire. We get to think, let me read that again, just to get the full satisfaction, once more, of a good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XE7IXV9XEVXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0104X9COC#wasThisHelpful","R1XE7IXV9XEVXG","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally! We have Ross and Kyle's story which had teased us from the very beginning. Clearly, it was about time they got their HEA. But did they really?Kyle is the boss of Bodyguards, Inc and Ross is his easy to tease PA. Kyle is unreachable and kind of aloof. Ross is easy to react especially when his stapelers are concerned. When it is Kyle's time to go back on the field, it sets him to wonder if this was his time to get the happiness the rest of his team seem to fall into when out on a job.Stefan Mortimer, former friend and teammate to an unnamed special force in the US, calls and Kyle has no choice but to do as bid. His cover: honeymoon with husband in a nice little hotel. His mission: guard a geneticist without him realizing it and make sure to keep him alive.Ross is definitely up to the task so even if he could not be an Ethan or a James, he can definitely act the honeymoon husband to his long time crush, Kyle. How he gets information is another matter. How he keeps safe, well, that makes Kyle insane.This was a fun fun read and I finished this in one go. The pace was fast and so made the read quite light. It is a nice installment to the series and finally got my curiousity satisfied. Now, the question is, how long is it before job and personal lives intervene with each other. For now, everything is fine but the way I read it, there is more to these men than meets the eye. As for Stefan, we get him next installment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MTB1VQJMBMA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0130WMBOC#wasThisHelpful","R3MTB1VQJMBMA9","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoy reading the Mark Julian, Vampire P.I. books. Each installment is a stand alone so it does not matter which number you come in, you never get lost. The least one does get is pure entertainment with a twist.Mark Julian is a centuries old vampire from the Roman Empire days. Once touted to succeed Caesar, he was attacked by and accidentally turned into the undead. In fear, Caesar casts him out of Rome and nullifies his marriage to Caesar's daughter. Angry and lost at the unexpected turn of events, Mark wandered the world using his skills as a warrior and tactician to forge his way through life. As his talent for solving mysteries increase, he gets lonelier but for a few close friends. Then he meets one Vinnie Pasquale, a detective of the NYPD.This installment is the fourth and opens to a dark place for both Mark and Vinnie. Where they were once closer than close and about to marry, the previous case caused Vinnie's mind to twist in trauma and spurs Mark's place in his heart. Mark is lost and basically on a death wish. Quite timely as this is the time when a vampire killer is on the loose and many are falling under a bow and arrow.The difference in the writing of this story from the rest of the installments is the focus of the author into the minds of the side characters. We take peeks into vampire turned victims lives, the killer himself, Tortego's confusion how to approach the dilemma he is caught in and of course, Jamie and Jean Claude, best friends and work partners of Mark. Although this may sound like a confusing shifting POV storytelling, it really is not. And I guess that is where the magic of a good storyteller came in handy.The mystery unfolds and till the end, I truly never guessed who the killer was and when revealed, never found out his benefactor. The arc of the four books are coming together nicely and even if the holes are plugged and the relationship of Vinnie and Mark is assured, we are still left wondering where the next installment will take us.For those who never read this series, it's about time to pick this up. For those who do follow it, this is a great installment. Overall, a great mystery read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1567GDO38W8B8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0113C3UNM#wasThisHelpful","R1567GDO38W8B8","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tommy was a battered boyfriend but somehow he managed to get through the fear of it all and took a chance to leave and be free. And safe. With the help of his friend and a lone policeman, he was finally able to spring out of the house and relationship that was more a prison than a home. Now this is where the story begins...Tommy, probably as a delayed reaction to the whole experience, becomes someone I did not care to like at all. In fact, he made some drastic and obnoxious decisions that made me question his sanity. Why? Because they were all actions that cried out for help and even he himself could not hear the screams.Sound familiar?Well, it should. Many a times men and women coming from an abusive relationship end up in another one because they seek an answer they did not even have a question to. That made Tommy such a real character to me.Now, who is Marcus? Well, he is a man who also went through the ringer and he had been in that dark place Tommy was when they first meet in martial arts class. Tommy had wanted to learn self-defense, yet another familiar move for those who got caught against a wall of hatred. In these classes, he learns patience, how to listen to what his body was telling him, and to trust his instincts. Although these three were not enumerated verbatim in the book, that is the gist of the class and Tommy absorbed the lesson like a sponge. In the process, he grew as an individual who finally looked up one day and saw that there in front of him, was Marcus. As the two began their relationship, we readers get the romantic aspect of Tommy's story.As for the evil ex, I am just glad that Tommy did not have to use his newly found skills for what is lesson behind martial arts? Think first, act later. Trust in instinct. Don't hit unless there is no other recourse. Tommy listened and acted on his instinct and that was not to back down from  a bully who is in actuality a weak individual.  This change in Tommy? That was what made him a better person and someone I really liked.What got my attention? Despite the angsty premise, this turned out quite the sweet, light story to read. And the best part? I didn't have to suffer through uber emotions that dragged on for several chapters.If you like a light, sweet and semi-angsty stories this is the one for you.Note: Copy provided by author for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WL6L6YC09XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011H33IOS#wasThisHelpful","R30WL6L6YC09XP","A1CFUY37L6TKHC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1CFUY37L6TKHC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Every time I get a device that is accompanied by cheap earbuds (which includes most devices), I immediately toss it and buy a set of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds.  I was offered a set of of SoundPEATS B-10 in exchange for my honest opinion and accepted to see how these compared to my usual Skullcandy earbuds.In terms of sound, the B-10s are fine for the price, but I awarded 2 stars (I don't like it) because it is missing something that I consider essential--a collar that can be slid up the wires so that they are less likely to tangle when folded up not in use. (See photo. The while earbuds are Skullcandy with a collar.  The black earbuds are the SoundPEATS without a collar) I spent so much time with tangled earbuds before discovering that many models (most?) have such a collar, that I no longer by earbuds without it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGNOW56YBVX5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016OF0IDI#wasThisHelpful","RGNOW56YBVX5J","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ah!  In the ear!  I've tried two models of Brainwavz over the ear earbuds.  I like the sound and I tried--really tried--to use them, but ended up putting them aside over frustration with the over the ear design.  Is there a trick to it? Does the world need a YouTube video showing how to use them properly?Finally, an in the ear version.  I tend to use inexpensive Skullcandy earbuds.  I guess the ear and brain adapt because they don't sound so bad when I listen to them, BUT they pale in comparison the the Brainwavz models when I move from one to the other. The Brainwv earbuds have a much fuller well-defined sound. There's a lot of music that I've been missing.I was given a set of earbud in exchange for an honest review.  I will continue to use these earbuds long after I file this review.  But here's the hard question.  Suppose they were a loaner.  Would I buy a set?  I've afraid the answer is probably no. Not because I don't like them, but more because I'm cheap(*), I like having a set of earbuds to keep with each of my devices, and I've got a lot of devices (4 mp3 players, 4 tablet, numerous laptops.  The price of the S3s pretty much rules that out for me.When I came here to write my review, I looked at some of the other reviews to see what kind of a reception the S3s were getting.  I had to double check to be sure I was on the right page.  These earbuds are NOT noise cancelling.  They are excellent noise isolating earbuds, so much so that I'm accused of ignoring others when it's just that the S3s are blocking them out. However, there is no noise cancelling circuitry.------But not totally.  The first thing I do with a device that comes with earbuds is toss the earbuds in favor of a set of low end Skullcandy earbuds. Spending 4 times that to replace the Skullcandy earbuds with S3s gives me pause.  They are nice, though.  If a were given a set of the earbuds as a gift, they would certainly be used rather that join others in a drawer, never to see the light of day.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRAGG1F1UQETQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162C1P9O#wasThisHelpful","RRAGG1F1UQETQ","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got here by Subway! That is, after ordering a few of Subway's chopped salads, I thought, ""Why don't i do that at home?!""This is my second mezzaluna. Third?  My first attempt was the OXO Good Grips Salad Chopper and Bowl.  I don't think the OXO's double pizza cutter chopper counts as a mezzalune.  The OXO was tiring.My second was a Amco Stainless Steel with Silicone Handle Mezzaluna.  I much preferred it to the OXO cutter. It still took a good deal of work because the blade is not terribly sharp (but, still, handle with care!).  However, the blade cracked even though I used it only in the OXO bowl.  Still, I liked it, so I ordered another in the hope that the first was defective.At the same time, I ordered the Kunh Rikon because I like their knives. They're the only ones I use in my kitchen.This is a sharp mezzaluna--weapons grade.  Well, not really.  Their knives are sharper, but this mezzaluna should always be sheatheed when not in use. Don't throw it into a drawer without the sheath. It makes fast almost effortless work of chopping salad! I had to learn to back off from how hard I was using the Amco. Now, I feel like the guy in the old Ginzu commercials.  Chop, chop, chop. All done!I use it with my original heavy-duty plastic OXO bowl.  The Amco didn't cut the bowl,  The KR does!  It's like watching hair grow.  You don't see it in any single preparation, but over time the surface of the bowl is all cut up.  I myself would not use it in a metal bowl for fear of dulling the blade.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJLI0O4BYG9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSDXP40#wasThisHelpful","ROJLI0O4BYG9Z","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(PLEASE, let this be the last rewrite! If there was ever a product that made me wish I didn't review things, this one-with the many rewrites-- is it!)I've had two of these.  The first ukulele I received was unplayable because of many frets with ends so sharp that I had a real fear of cutting myself if I weren't careful, especially with slides.  The distributor contacted ME to explain that it was likely that I received a defective item. I could believe this.  Inexpensive items often don't get the same quality control as their more expensive brethren.The distributor shipped a replacement. It was better.  I didn't feel that I might actually cut myself, but still too scratchy for a uke I'd play or recommend. I would investigate other brands or a higher price point before buying another of these were I in need of them for a club or class.I gave it a powerful negative review including a video demonstrating the scratchiness of the frets. Now, a week later, the uke doesn't feel as bad.  This makes me wonder if it might be a humidity issue.  If the ukes (any wood instruments) are stored in an environment that is less humid than the one in which they are made, they will shrink as the wood dries out.  Wood shrinks more than metal, which can lead to scratchy frets.  The reverse occurs when the ukes are returned to a more humid environment.  The wood expands relative to the metal and things are better.  I first learned about this years ago when my sister purchased a Taylor Leo Kottke 12-string guitar--NOT a cheap instrument!--with the same problem.My final bottom line (please, oh, please!):  I'm leaving the rating at 3 stars. These ukes aren't for me.  Once burned, twice shy. I'm still going to dress the frets so that they don't become scratchy as winter approaches and the humidity drops.However, I'm starting to understand the range of reviews here. Many are extremely positive.  Others, like me, have problems with scratchy frets  It would be best for these ukes if they could be made with the possibility of shrinkage in mind (Yes, my sister's guitar has the humidity problem.but I've never seen it with any of the dozens of instruments I've owned over the years.) The seller is more than willing to work with anyone who gets a particularly scratchy instrument. Since these ukes are subject to an issue that does not seem to affect other models, the 3 stars seems right.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFDLWGK0M0B7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AT9IW0M#wasThisHelpful","RFDLWGK0M0B7K","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested them.It's hard to know what individual numbers mean because a device isn't going to draw more than it wants to draw. Connecting a device to a 5V,2.1A and seeing it draw much less than 2.1A doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem with a cable if the device doesn't want to draw 2.1A.

"A took off 1 star for something I should have checked in advance--noise level.  It is not silent.  The good news is that the sound is NOT the while of a disk drive. It's the low(er) frequency sound of a fan.  Still, it's there while in this day and age there's no need for it.------------------------------------------------------------In 2013, a Kickstarter project proposed a device named LIma that would plug into a user's router.  A portable hard drive would then be plugged into Lima. Lima would allow the user to access the drive form any device on the user's network.  In addition, programs and apps would allow access to Lima and its attached drive from outside of the network.  Sound familiar?As of August 24, 2015, things are a mess.  Transfer times from a computer to Lima are extremely slow.(~10GB/hr?).  After users complained that Lima not make a copy of its files on the hard drive of the user's computer, Lima now claims ""only"" 10% of a disk's free space for a cache.  The Android app is no longer working.  The project's blog is why I no longer back Kickstarter tech projects.  I'll wait to see whether a device makes it to market.All I ever wanted was access to a considerable music collection from any of my devices.  Sound familiar?

"Well, that was quick.

We were looking for something to provide the finger some support when we thought about these gloves. (As explained in the original review, the low rating was because it aggravated her *left* hand.) Not only did it make her finger feel better, but it made her entire hand feel better.So, 5 stars BUT there are situations where they may not help.

Hers is osteo, not rheumatoid, so she has bone rubbing on bone.  The worst is at the base of her left thumb.  The glove felt good on her right hand, but it aggravated her left thumb to the point where she's decided that she can't use them.  She told me to add that in her case it was difficult to remove the right glove because it required the use of her left thumb.  These gloves could have been a real boon had things not been so advanced with her left thumb, but unfortunately they are so for her the gloves are not usable.More than any other product I've reviewed, YMMV.  It depends on the user's particular circumstance. With the money-back satisfaction guarantee and the way the gloves felt everywhere else other than her left thumb, we find ourselves in the awkward position of suggesting they be given a try. even though we've awarded two stars because they failed to help in our situation..","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M0AW7TKFTD59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VTR6MNW#wasThisHelpful","R3M0AW7TKFTD59","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The SM-1 tuner has an interesting set of sounds.  Other than that, it's hard to think of anything else that recommends it.Let me be straight up front:  I LIKE Snark products!  I have nearly two dozen Snark tuners (one for every instrument and a box of S-3 minis ""just in case""). So, for me to be negative about a Snark product means that I have serious concerns.* The touch screen is a not terrible responsive, I find it difficult to set it at the tempo I want..* I find the quiet blinking option almost unusable (YMMV). The blue horseshoe blinks, but it's not terribly bright relative to the rest of the screen,*The blue horseshoe may start up to light up the same time as the beat, but it takes the merest fraction of a second to reach full intensity. That causes the impression, in the 120 bpm range, that the blink and the beat are the slightest bit out of agreement as though the beat ever so slightly leads the blink.* There is a flip out stand on the back so that the metronome doesn't have to lie flat on the table. In what I consider a major design flaw, the portion that flips out from the back runs up and down the length of the battery cover.  It's designed in such a way that the battery cover comes off when the stand is flipped out too far.The SM-1 is compact, but so is the Korg MA-1 (http://www.amazon.com/Korg-MA1BL-Visual-Counting-Metronome/dp/B0055BMQG0/)..The Korg KDM-2 (http://www.amazon.com/Korg-KDM-2-Advanced-Digital-Metronome/dp/B001EWN72Q) remains my own personal favorite.  However, I admit it has been years since my last exhaustive look-see at metronomes.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MP56LDGI1D2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJHI6KQ#wasThisHelpful","R1MP56LDGI1D2P","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"2 stars=""I don't like it"".  However, how you'll like them depends on you.  Here's what I see as the issues.(+)* Nice sound, better than my Skullcandy, not better than my Phiatons.  (More expensive than my Skullcandy, less expensive than my Phiatons).* They come with just about every type of tip you can think of.(o)* DO NOT try to use these as in the ear buds. (Okay, who am I to tell you what and what not to do?)  However, if you use them as in the earbuds you may find the cables heavy and that the buds don't stay in your ear;.* However, THEY WORK FINE as the over the ear style they were intended to be.  I found their seal better than my that of my earbuds.(-)* They're bulky and I find them awkward to put on. No big deal you might think, but I feel like why should I have to deal at all? I found it awkward to put the cord behind my head with my mp3 player in my shirt pocket.  I've had some trouble keeping the cables over my ears.  Maybe this wouldn't be a problem with practice, but practice to use a set of earbuds?!?!?!Bottom line: nice sound, but awkward trumps sound.  I'll stick with what I'm using.(I was sent a set of earbuds to review. They did not come with a return postage envelope.  If they had, I would return them and not miss them.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VFZEGHPNES7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4UQ6U8#wasThisHelpful","R3VFZEGHPNES7W","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I CANNOT BELIEVE I AM GIVING THIS 1 STAR DEVICE 3 STARS.!This tuner deserves 1 star because it is only a matter of time until its ratchet fails and the tuner will no longer stay on the instrument  The reason I can't award 1 star is because I continue to buy and use them. It is otherwise the ideal ukulele tuner where weight is paramount if the tuner will be left on the instrument most of the time.  If the ratchet didn't fail, this would be one of the easiest 5 star reviews I've written.Also, I have a workaround for when one fails:* I put the tuner on the instrument.* I squeeze it to how it should be if the ratchet hadn't failed.* I slide the tuner off the instrument without moving the ratchet.* I use superglue to fix the ratchet so that it won't move.* I let the tuner dry overnight, just to be safe.* I slide the tuner back on the instrument.So, flimsy = 1 star.  Without flimsiness, 5 stars.  There are things one can do should (when) the ratchet fail(s). I give up!  3 stars.My original reviews follow.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This could have been a great tuner.  It's one of those situations where first opinions can be misleading.  I got one, disliked it for the reasons stated below, and threw it in a drawer.  Lately, I decided that this tuner would be IDEAL for the ukulele, where weight is paramount.  I have a few ukes, so I bought two more!  What I' now finding out is that the ratchet system wears out, and no wonder. The ratchet is an inexpensive piece of plastic with tiny grooves. There's no spring. It appears that its the piece that fits into the groove that's worn out. No matter which part it is. It will no longer stay on.  It's a shame.  I was really starting to like this tuner and change my rating to 5 stars for use with a ukulele.  But, one star it is.----------------------Most other tuners have s spring loaded clamp that affixes the tuner to the instrument. This one doesn't.  It has a ratcheting device.  You squeeze it. and the tuner is ""held in place"" by pressure and slight friction from rubber pads on the inside surfaces. There's a plastic piece on the back that holds the ratchet closed.  Touch it (like when an instrument is in its case and the tuner touches a surface) and the tuner pops off.Those looking for something small might consider a Son of Snark (aka mini-Snark).","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNLY6NQ31BFTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FKF1PY#wasThisHelpful","RNLY6NQ31BFTI","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow!  It's just as advertised...and more.  What the listing does not say (and, for that reason, I don't know whether it will always be true) is that it comes with one Guitar Extension Pack.The stand is one piece, collapses, and comes fully assembled. I got mine to hold 3 open-back banjos.  It does that just fine, but I couldn't help thinking that it might be a bit wider than necessary and perhaps I could have gotten something a bit narrower. But, the light bulb went on almost immediately. I slid the spacers to the left, still leaving a comfortable amount of room for each instrument, installed the extension pack, and the stand now holds three open back banjos and a dreadnought size acoustic guitar.  Four instruments that used to take up a room now occupy only a corner of it.Somewhere (maybe not here) states that the stand can hold up to six guitars. I can believe it if they have thin Strat or Tele types of bodies. Not 6 acoustics, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCBGHEIWDR0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N1JFXK#wasThisHelpful","R3CCBGHEIWDR0O","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Paige capos of this design get 5 stars.  They do what they do extremely well.  Just as good as the ultra high end and ultra high end expensive McKinneys and Elliotts.  Uniform tension across the strings.  Not too little, not too much.  (Unless you set it that way on purpose!)However, for an ""off label"" use--a UKULELE CAPO--I award it 4 STARS.[Everything that follows is about Paige capos.]I'm looking for a ukulele capo that I can slip over the nut when not in use.  The guitar capo is too wide. (It works, but it looks like it violates Mr. Natural's rule about using the right tool for the job.) The regular banjo/mandolin capo is oh-so-slightly too narrow.  I was hoping the wide banjo/mandolin capo would be just right.  It's better and it works, but it's still a bit wide. The ideal uke capo would be between the banjo/mandolin and wide banjo/mandolin capos. Still, I don't know anything that works better if being able to slide the capo over the nut is an important consideration, unless one wanted to spend 7+ times the cost of a Paige for an Elliott.  That's a bit much, even for me...at the moment, anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1414B1NYZ212M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B1L0MM#wasThisHelpful","R1414B1NYZ212M","A3SDJ70H00OQCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SDJ70H00OQCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Everything fits and looks exactly like the photo except the wrist cuffs, they are really big. I added more velcro to make them tighter, a safety pin or 2 would work just as well. GREAT HAT.

"VERY PRETTY, great price! It looks like the photo. The corset alone is worth the price of the entire costume. It comes with a very cute, very short, fluffy tutu that has crinolin under and satin over, it has a drop wait so the tutu doesn't bunch up under the corset. Also included, unattached elastic arm ruffles with a pink rose on each, as pictured. The corset covers ""enough"" on top as long as it isn't worn too tight, if you want it more revealing (push up) buy it tighter, it is very flattering. The corset is lightly boned and has back hooks, not laces or zipper. You will need help hooking it, or do it in the front then try to yank it around. This is a short sexy costume, meant for night clubs, etc. not family friendly because the tutu is very short. I switch the tutu with a long yellow satin skirt so I can wear it as a normal costume and it looks amazing. I ordered one size up because I expected it might run tight. I wear a 34/36 C/D depending on the bra, but I'm little,5""2"", size 3 jeans, medium top, the large fit absolutely perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZ9J0PA0UTNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GIBJN9E#wasThisHelpful","R1CZ9J0PA0UTNT","A27TRXKVO0M82J","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27TRXKVO0M82J?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great Beast costume, it runs a little large, but the way it fits it is barely noticeable. I will need to stitch the wrist cuffs because they are very large, and the sleeves are long, and I will dart stitch the waist in the back. The jacket is a pullover, it doesn't button like a jacket. The hood is amazing! It even has the braid down the back with the blue bow just like the movie. The ascot around the neck completes it, the center medallion on the ascot is just a cheap cut out of gold cloth, but you will be pleasantly surprised when you see this.

"I went up to a large in this Cinderella costume because I bought the Leg Avenue Belle costume in Medium and it is tight. The large Cinderella is huge.

"As long as you know to order up one to two sizes, these corsets are beautifully made, high end corsets for a great price. There is a trick to hooking the stays, do the bottom stay, then the top stay, after that hooking up the middle stays will be much easier.

"I like Gary's approach.  He is a straight shooter and it really seems like he genuinely wants to help people.  I stumbled upon this because he is speaking at a conference I may go to and I wanted to read about his story.  His father's work ethic obviously was passed on to him.  Gary has been able to make a name for himself for hosting Wine Library TV, which discusses wine tasting flavors and he gives his opinion.  The Wine Library is a store in NJ and is considered one of the best Wine stores in the country.  Gary has been a large part of that growth.  There is no denying his ability to build a business and to brand himself.The reason I am giving this book 3 stars is because it is dated.  A lot of the book is about branding yourself.  Gary suggests doing this by creating your own website, and blasting yourself out there on social media.  This is all old info, albeit, still very sound advice.  I agree, it's important to get out there and make a name for yourself.  It's easier said than done.  For those that don't have the extroversion to go out there and start a youtube channel, or find a way to gather 30,000 twitter followers, the task is daunting.  Gary suggests using a ""Flip Cam"" which I haven't seen in years.The point is this.  Get out there and market yourself.  Whatever it is you're good at and passionate about, get out there and build an image and brand based on that.  I wish this book was updated because I think it needs to be.  The world, and technology in particular, change at a rapid pace.  This is basic information in this book.  I still believe it's worth the read because it's pretty short and easy.  It's not a timeless classic, but it's still a good read.  I hope to hear more from Gary in the future.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JQQMAEPUXEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WUYQSW#wasThisHelpful","R27JQQMAEPUXEW","A5EYM297GCV6K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5EYM297GCV6K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been doing Hot Yoga for a couple of years now.  I have gone thru multiple mats.  Even more expensive mats, I needed to add a yoga towel  in order to not slip.  With the Joyne Serenity, the mat truly doesn't slip.  There is even so grips on the bottom of the mat, so that it doesn't skid on the floor.  It's also very comfortable.  The Joyne Serenity Yoga Mat also has memory foam-like material.  This makes it super comfortable and much easier to perform poses on your knees or your head!  It's about 68 inches long, and I didn't notice any chemical smell or anything out of the box.  Like anything new tho, I would recommend rubbing it down with a little soap and water before you use it.  Anyway, I am sure you will love it, whether you do heated or non heated yoga.

"This Neck Massager Pillow is really good.  I seem to gather a lot of tension in my upper back and shoulder areas.  I have been trying many other things like tennis and lacrosse balls, which are ok, but i get tired after a little bit of use.  With this Heated Shiatsu, I am able to sit back and relax and let it do the work. I have used this while I am in bed watching TV.  It comes with a car charger as well in case you want to strap it to your head rest.  I am debating whether or not to bring it to work.  I sit at my desk all day and I am sure this would really help.  The reasons I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is , I wish there was more variation.  Meaning, I wish there were different speeds, vibration or something else that could vary massage session.  The heat is also ok, but I don't feel it as much as I wish i did.Overall, its a very good product and it feels well made.

"This selfie stick is really well made.  It comes with an attachment for a cell phone and also a GoPro.  You can fit digital cameras on it also.  The Cell phone holder fits with my iPhone 6 Plus case.  The twist locks are easy to use and the pole feels sturdy at full length. 2 other features I really like are the strap that unscrews so you can mount the stick on a tripod, and the clip it comes with so you can clip it to a bag or belt loop.  If I had to pick potential negatives, the handle is short so those with monster hands may go past the foam grip.  The other thing is while it does extend, there are poles that do go a bit bigger.  Neither of these bothered me but I wanted to point them out in case they bother you.  Overall, this is a great product, and certainly one of the better quality ones out there.  The reason for the 4 stars?  While I received this at a discount for my honest feedback, I think the regular price is too high.  I think there are other sticks out there that may have more bang for the buck.  Other than that, it's a quality product.

"Very easy to install.  I took off the wall plate, unscrewed the switch from the wall.  I only had 3 wires.  2 black and 1 copper ground.  I unscrewed the wires, and used the provided yellow caps to connect the wires together ( the Lutron wires come already connected to the unit so you have to use the screw caps to connect the wires from the wall).  It didn't matter for me which black wires I connected, so i just used the ""bottom"" one to connect to the left Lutron wire, and my old ""top"" wire to connect to the Lutron right wire( right meaning if I am facing the back of the unit from the wall).  It was a little tough shoving the wires back into the wall, but I got it done.  I'd say the whole thing took me 10-15 minutes.  I am medium handy.  This is actually the second one I've done.  The other I installed was a 3 pole switch was a bit more involved.  I've also installed 2 solar timers which the 1st took about an hour, because I had to continuously run up an down the stairs to turn the power off , test, etc.In any event, don't be afraid.  Just shut the power off and make sure you only need a single pole switch, meaning there is only 1 location to turn the light on, as opposed to a 3 way pol, meaning there are 2 different switches that control the light.  If you need that, it's slightly more involved, but Lutron sells that as well.

Body fat was around 11.5% , but too many Christmas cookies got me recently back over 12.5% ( since starting Max 30, trending back down ).

As with most other workouts, as much as I Loved it, I started to plateau.  New Year, new program, I randomly stumbled upon Max 30 in Men's Health.  I had no idea it was coming out and I was pumped and ready for the change.Generally, I like to start new workouts on a Monday, as that's how the schedule for Max 30 sets up ( monday-friday), but I couldn't wait, and started on a Saturday.  Ok enough BS , let's get down to bizness...The Workouts:As I stated earlier, the calendar starts on Monday.  U do 5 workouts, then 1 optional light recovery workout, followed by a day of rest.  The workouts are all 30 minutes ( hence Max 30) , except for the Pulse (optional) workout which is only 20 minutes.  There is also an ab workout that you can add which is 10-15 min.  Each workout ends with a 2 minute cool down.Weeks 1 and 2 schedule:Cardio Challenge- Pretty standard Insanity style.  Jumps, sprints, burpees, and some absTabata Power- Intervals with 20 seconds on and 10 seconds offSweat Intervals- Similar in style to Cardio ChallengeTabata PowerFriday Fight, round 1: Absolutely brutal.  No water break for the first 15 minutes. Awesome workout, but tough.Pulse or RestRest.After 2 weeks u substitute Tabata Power with Tabata Strength.Month 2 adds MAX OUT Cario, Power, Sweat, Strength and Friday Fight round 2.  I will review these when I get there.Are the workouts hard?Yes!  But that's what you want right?  Perhaps you are a Beachbody vet like myself , or maybe you are a treadmill junkie looking to make the change.  Unless you are seriously overweight or have major health issues, you can do Max 30.  I get exhausted, and I get short of breath and I'm dying for water, but I make it through and by the end of the workout, I feel amazing.  You sweat like you can't believe, but the workouts go by fast.As much as I love p90x3 (it's my favorite Beachbody workout), I didn't come close to sweating like I do with Max 30.  Shaun T is the ultimate motivator.  He pushes you to succeed, like having a personal trainer right there with you.  The big thing with this workout is that Shaun T invites you to write down your Max Out minute.  For example, let's say you push to 11 minutes, then finally you're just dying for a break, you've maxed out, and you write down which minute that is ( there is a little max out timer on the screen ), and you try and push just a little further than last time.Cons?Only 1 right now.  There is no really intense stretch at the end.  The 2 minutes is  a brief cool down and very light stretch.  After a workout like that, I feel you need a real stretch to properly prevent injury.  That being said, I do appreciate the brevity as I know they are trying to keep it around 30 minutes, and I can always do extra stretching on my own.In conclusion, I really love Max 30 and I'm pumped they came out with it.  I skipped T 25 because I heard mixed reviews.  This to me is an awesome workout.  1 caveat tho.  You can do as much Max 30 as you want, but if you eat lots of cake , sweets, and fried foods, don't expect too much.  If you are investing in this workout, invest in yourself, and the food you eat.  Little by little make smarter decisions on how you eat, follow his program, and you will be looking and feeling great in no time.  I'll be back for more detail.

"I love my new Yoga towel!  I have been doing Hot Yoga for over a year now and I've gone through 3 different towels.  There was something wrong with each one.  The ends would curl up or the sides would bunch,  I would slip , and the towel would smell.  With this new towel, I get none of that.  The towel is thicker and weighs a little more, so it doesn't bunch up on you.  I'm very happy with the towel and i recommend it to anyone using it for Hot Yoga.

"Admittedly, I am probably not your prototypical reader of this genre.  I am a 35 year old married male with children.  That being said, one of my guilty pleasures is reading a feel good Christmas book every year; that and watch Christmas originals on Lifetime and Hallmark.  I can admit that I am in touch with my sensitive side, especially during Christmas time.  I decided to read this book based on the reviews and I was pleasantly surprised.The book has your typical layout.  Lonely divorced woman meets someone to share the holidays with.  Of course, she has a sad back story.  In the end, they are happy.  Pretty typical stuff.  So what was so special about it?  Well, it was a bot different in terms of how it was set up.  The story is that Elise enters into a ""contract"" with a guy from her building, who is also sick of spending the holidays alone.  With this contract, she will attend all of his holiday parties, and all expenses will be paid.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but I was sympathetic towards the characters and I had a clear picture of them in my mind.  To be honest, when I first started reading it , I rolled my eyes a bit.  I've read too many cheesy Christmas books in the past.  But about 30 pages in, I started to look forward to reading it.  I'm glad I stuck with it.Hurry up and read it.

"This book has been very helpful to me getting up and running with my blog.  A lot of people write books about how to blog just so they can throw their websites or other products in there for you to buy.  And while I'm all for promoting your product and brand, for some people, we just want to know what to do!  I don't want to hear about how I can click the link to your website, or your affiliates sites.  This book goes in depth, teaching you about the actual business of blogging.  I have literally read about 10 books about the subject.  I've learned a little from each one, but if you are gonna choose 1, this is it.  I have gone through it twice now.  Also, for those looking on how to setup wordpress, I recommend Wordpress for Beginners by Dr. Andy Williams.  Also, sorry 1 last thing. If you are gonna start an online business, I suggest subscribing to Kindle unlimited.

"Costs a lot because it's one of the few RIGID WATERPROOF  ornanment containers. The others look like your heirloom glass ornament  bulbs will fit fine but crush and break to shards the second the dog sits on them or the carrier gets smushed in the closet, or is all cardboard and will mush up if it gets wet in storage, and has some fabric cover that gets filty dusty in no time.

Mine ARRIVED wih one of the corners dented, and so the thign had to be taped to hold.I kept it. I would imagine many of these crack during shipping but it's STILL the only rigid one out there, and for the cost of a iece of duct tape (the universal solver of all problems) it was not worth the hassle of return to get another probably cracked one anyway.Downsides- WAY expensive, cracks easily.

"Best cost per quality- best heavy duty wire shelving EVER.I wish I found the Omega Precision BEFORE i got the cheaper stuff. And, Omega Precision is not even expensive. Tiny bit more, because the quality is not 'cheap'- the quality is OUTSTANDING. It's real, quality steel, and real heavy duty design- buy it for life. It is built to hold a rated limit, but it will withstand a lot more than that. (don't DO that- but if you're sick of sort of 'works for now sort of) Get the real one.  Best casters ever, by the way. I've purchased, used, assembled a LOT of many brands of wire shelving. Good stuff, but- the casters are weak, or the stuff chips, or it won't come together twice, or it won't fit standard sizes, or it's weight-over-rated and gets bendy, or it lands shakey and stresses it'self out.Not Omega precision. Wish I found this much sooner. This is the one I've been looking for but thought it cost thousands of dollars for this quality. NOPE! The tall one i got, no 'little rods you screw together and hope for the best' as you load it down with your tools, or stored boxes, or heavy pots and pans.My tall steel rods came separately SOLID high-grade steel, will last probably a few lifetimes, and still LOOK GREAT!  They are the real deal for long-term heavy storage, no chipping, flaking rusting, straining or bending with these.They have sizes to choose from. I wanted something TALL. I don't want to buy everything 60"" or under, I want all the storage space. And because I load things down (don't we all...)  it really HAS to be heavy duty. And it has to have wheels, and GOOD wheels at that. (casters alone, are either cheap, or very costly.)  AND- I needed long and narrow, to go next to my refrigerator.I'm sold on this. I tried others but this is the real deal. They are all modular, and if you have to add, Omega has a lot of options. (and if you hit the hardware store for an add on, it will fit, so you'er not limited that way.) This conforms to the usual standards in sizes, but BETTER than what's in the hardware store, for your basic unit.I like and am going back to the same company, because they also have this quality for wall-mount shelving. (I'm sick of those wire closet shelves- white wire adjustables that look like a dish-drain, and always get gooey, and fall down after a few years)This Omega company, it turns out, makes gorgeous chrome (two different styles) for heavy duty adjustable closet shelving.  They have full serivce add ons, not just 'chrome buy and go'. They have  butcher block liners for kitchen use that are amazingly cost effective, as well as anti-microbial shelf liner, I looked them up- they have full support and all the add ons I wanted but was unaware of or thought I'd have to get piecemeal and hope for an okay fit. They have tons of options and the company stands behind them. (Best customer service ever.)This is the one to get.  They stand behind their products, it's true industrial grade but works lovely for a house /apartment and the whole line is industrial grade interchangeable with professional add-ons and options at household, not huge industrial costs.You see one for cheaper with little plastic wheels and screw-together construction and no real other options for shelf lining or other usage, no coordinated wall shelves.  Or it's not the right size but you'll make do, or it doesn't really fit other systems.Skip that, and get this one. Then  thank yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NWJK0A0XSN3P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007OXR4GE#wasThisHelpful","R3NWJK0A0XSN3P","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stil cannot believe they send mattresses in the mail. This came rolled up. Nobody knew it was a queen sized mattress.  (they put it in a heavy plastic vaccum bag, suck the air all the heck out and roll it up.)  It's heavy but- the days of having to arrange mattress delivery are history. this is 'click. mattress you can carry in it's box or bag.) Open it up and it 'inflates'.  In less than an hour it's a mattress. Overnight or so (jump on it) and you can put your must have separate purchase dust and bug/ allergen cover on it. (Don't put that on right way. You can sleep on the mattress in an hour or so, and put sheets on certainly. But you'd want to give the mattress a day or two to fully fluff, before putting any protective cover on it.)It's real quality. The look is great, the quilted top really is breathable and comfortable and it's an ecellent several layer memory foam (so it HAS some body to it. it's not all sinking into mush you can't get out of).if you've had memory foam before, the ones with denser regular foam sandiwich below with some gel foam and some ohther stuff and JUST a few inches of that wierdly comfortable visco-eleastic  is the better way to go.  (I've lied down on '$2000 solid block of costly memmory foam"" and it's too danged gushy. Not 'soft'- just oddly gushy.) I will update a I use it over time, but for ~$400  (less, I think) for ""Quality Memory foam gel- nicely styled, nicely quilt topped Mattress In A Can""- I could not be happier. I've spent a lot more on a lot lower qualtiy mattresses.Ps- if you're torn, the click and ship roll up spring pillowtop is also good. But innerspring v memory foam gel is personal.)This is a total HIGH RECOMMEND.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GKIXV2M93M72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWXTXBO#wasThisHelpful","R1GKIXV2M93M72","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love these so much I bought two. I foster animals so, tons of pellet litter, tons of dry food. Nobody wants lots of odd random storage or things air, moisture and PESTS gawd forbid, could get into and who wants to lug those pet totes around?Problem SOLVED.  Airtight durable locking storage WITH scoop, in GREAT colors, ON WHEELS.  Not heavy duty wheels- and the wheels do not lock in tight. If you lift the tote, they can sorta slide back out.But rolling heavy duty (I really pack these things) air tight, watertight, pest tight storage that can sit under my kitchen table and look neat.The WHEELS and the Airtight were the selling points. The PRICE is great.  I had one for almost a year, for litter, loved it so much I got another one for dry food.Plus you get the airtite other storage box (and it's a generous size) coordinated for your other pet stuff.I've spent more on pet food and litter totes that were not nearly as good.

"Sterlite makes good not too pricey  plastic storage but you really have to buy in bulk to get a value.I'm a little iffy on this STYLE, in that the plastic itself is a bit soft, pliable. SO- if you overstuff these (and who doesn't overstuff storage- these are good sweater boxes, winter or summer clothing storage etc.) the lids DO tend to smoosh up. There's no tight waterproof seal, no rigid grip all around the rim. So I'm now wary of two locks on the long end).That said, 12 pack is a GREAT  good truly stackable locking storage. WAY bonus points for the color. Would buy again for some purposes.

"I got this when Feline Pine sold out to  Arm and Hammer, and A&H turned excellent Feline Pine into regular horse bedding anyway, but at a specialty cat product price.Note- for  kitty litter- I use the pine pellet litterbox and recommend it. that $20-10 shipping $30 dollar- so, expensive for an open  pan-style-  cat litter box has saved me a fortune in clean up, in litter cost, in evil muddy dusty bad-for-cats clay litter. Any pine beats clay and the drop down pan system, all my cats and fosters love not getting their feeties wet. Great system these sieve down pine litter trays.Back to THIS product?  A bit of pine dust, crumbly, but now Feline Pine is cheap chop anyway but costs more.this- $8 plus $17 for shipping- that's $25 dollars for forty lbs of very entirely serviceable all pine cat litter. GREAT(A note. I tried using wood stove pellets also- they're cheap. BUT - most are made of mixed wood- hicory, etc. These do  not smell good with wee, and do not absorb wee and break apart as readily. If you've jumped the costly Feline Pine ship when they sold out, this bedding is great, there are good horse beddings out there too- just the same pine pellets cheap in bulky but non pine Stove Pellets are not good for kitty litterboxes.)UPDATE- The prices for this, and the price and formulation of Feline Pine changed since I first wrote this review. This now costs $1 dolalr per pound through Amazon distributors and is no longer a good buy!  And the price on FB is down- I find it on pet supply websites (with free shipping on orders over $50, so I get cat food with it) and now FPs formula is better, AND the price comes to about $20 per 40lb bag including (free) shipping.Whatever you use- this or FP or another pine pellet litter- there are many easy bargains. If you pay more than 50 cents a pound (or less) for pine pellet litter, including shipping, you're paying too much - look around on pet sites or check back on Amazon for bargains on say, Feline Pine or other pine pellet products.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MIDHHQ0YJOEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F2QO8U0#wasThisHelpful","R2MIDHHQ0YJOEK","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these once, trying to get cheap resuable washcloths KNOWING- and be advised, that these are BABY washcloths. I just wanted something inexpensive and thin that I could use a lot, thin enough to wipe and wash and then toss in the laundry without thick ones (lint buildup) and without the cost of laundering regular 12x12 ones. They ARE soft and great and a bit smaller for babies, but they are ALSO really durable for quick wipes, body or sink baths.I have purchased bulk cotton washcloths. Turns out they cost more to launder and aren't as soft and don't hold up well.Here is the real bonus on these small, but soft  NOT thick cloths- they are super-durable and while soft on skin, they hold up GREAt for household cleaning.My first pack was for elder care.  My SECOND purchase- best value in durable household cleaning cloths!  I highly recommend them for all these things. Babies, elders, frequent washings without high laundry cost or shredding and falling apart or lint (they're virtually lint-free) AND- they actually scrub without damage (even though they are very gentle on skin, so it's a magic trick how this is so) they scrub kitchens, windows, floors, furniture etc without damage and wash clean well.this is excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AM0UEFY42PS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0071H0M76#wasThisHelpful","R2AM0UEFY42PS6","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is as thick and fluffy without being also cheap and linty, as you want a bathmat to be, it comes in sizes (my bathroom is small- so I got a soft absorbent thick durable bathmat that looks GREAT- really luxe modern clean, not like a 'towel, but on the floor'- AND because I could order the 17X23"" - I could get that at a decent price for quality  WITHOUT being obligated to spend more and / or buy the 23X30 or any other larger 'on size fits all' thick bathmat.How does this help? If you've ever laundered your bathmats, you know they soak up laundry and dryer money and energy.This is great, any size, the quality is real fluffy bathmat, not cheap.

"Got this to wear under turtlenecks and pullover sweaters this fall  / winter. Went small so it would fit under those. It looks nice but feels a bit cheapish. (Like, I would get it a gain maybe but really I'm on a mission to find something soft and non 'stinky microfiber' or supercostly tech-gear - also stinky microfiber with some 'anti stink'. My cotton stuff doesnt NEED anti-stink technology in the first place.) This runs small.  It follows the formula of reverse-vanity sizing and comes from the land where everyone is sort of supermodel thin or pre-pubescent even when they're a full grown adult.But it's a decent enough quality. It's just not AS comfortable and it does run tiny-gal-tight, which I hate. I don't need 'big', I just feel a bit ripped off when the one that should fit, it just runs narrow everywhere, just to save the mfg twenty cents in materials. Hey.Not two, but not four.

"This is a bargain. Good fit, cheap cotton 'derwears you can toss out frequently. But - and there is NO misrepresentation, you can see from the photo- you will be stuck with four pairs of white cotton undies and and at least two pairs you consider ugly.  I haven't worn white cotton undies since I was 10 years old, and yet, I pass them off as 'chick tighty whities for ladies' to myself with some ironic humour. (and if we are really talking 'undies', gals- buy a bottle of peroxide, use it on even  your colored underthingies. I'm very clean to begin with but I thought ""wow, undies need oxyclean or peroxide."".For the bargain and every day use, this is a quality brand that fits the way you'd expect, and the small fits my oversized ass so that's a bonus- I'm not a 'small' for anything BUT bulk underwear, but the medium (6) was big.This is a great staple (yay. Except for frilly special stuff, I'm done with everyday undies for six months or so) and they are, as 'derwears should be, more or less disposable. (they will last. but daily 'derwers should be tossed frequently. And if you've spent $15 dollars a pair on 'really cute' but cheap ones, you know you should do that but paid too much. So hygiene take a back seat).  These you can toss sort of guilt free if the wash or hand wash doesn't come out they way it should after a few wearings. They always tell us to toss those things, here you're not throwing out your paycheck. Or holding onto ones you should toss 'just a little longer, so cute, cost so much'.At this price, with this quality and more durability than they need to have,  while no glamour obtains, the kind of thing you feel fresh (cotton! No tag! Elastic doesn't crimp or peel off!) - they're really good go-to stuff.And if you are a shopper, and have (as I have) bought for $5-20 each 'cute panties!' that looked cute but rode or felt like hell or fell apart or..  it turns out whatever color these are, they are great go-to good fit, 'tighty whities for gals'.Why the missing final star?  Because, come on, FOTL, put at least ONE really awesome cute pair in each pack. They ARE ladies underthingies. Would it KILL you to do some designer print instead of just 'well, dots, stripes, at least that's not ugly'.If they swapped a white pair for anything cute (hey. purple.

"This is a perfectly good compact motorized fold up treadmill, which works just fine.  I almost did not get it, I am glad I took some negative remarks about it with a grain of salt, and did NOT worry and go for much pricier equipment. This is a low-to-mid priced folding but not compact, MOTORIZED treadmill, in NARROWER size for small spaces,. It's perfect. I really like it. I saved a mint. I have USED other gym and home treadmills, but have not owned others. This is just what I wanted. Read on if you're on the fennce abut this- it's really good!Caveat:  this review is from a SHORT LAZY person, in a studio apartment- I can't comment on long stride, or if it works for big-and-tall persons, nor households looking for large or fancy (laptop or phone plug in, or work-desk enabled, or high variable incline or multiple home heavy use, or wider, nor- really compact- machines.)  But for a regular user, in a small apartment, this is GREAT- the negative reviews are not necessarily entirely true. (Though excercise equipment is very individual- so no dis on any other reviewers' experiences) .- Setup in under 20 minutes -solo (I'm 50 years old, not an athlete or gym rat)  It weighs sort of middling for treadmills, getting it out of the box was the only 'hard' part. And not that hard. Assembly was a complete piece of cake.I'm glad I disregarded some negative reviews on this - I almost did not buy it- almost got one a lot costlier (on a credit card. Debt. Yike!) but this is a great little (heavy, but compact folding) walking AND JOGGING, Sturdy, Quiet, Freehand- walking AND jogging machine,1- Yes, you can jog - it is not just for walking. It's well-sturdy enough for jogging.2- Yes, freehand walking and jogging. NO you do NOT have to 'hold onto the bars' unless you have a sense of unsteadyness, prior injury, etc.  Eg- I'm uncoordinated and a total klutz. For walking or jog, I DID get the benefits of the arm-swinging balancing-  that was a dealbreaker for me with treadmills. I read ""you MUST hold the bars"". I took a shot. Works fine, truly, freehand for me, the ordinary clod. (NOTE: I cannot give medical recommendation- so DO know your own balance and limits, check with your doctor etc.) But I found the stated I found the REQUIREMENT that you 'grip the bar'-  even for a normal klutz with no sense of coordination- was excessive. I had NO problem at 1-3 mph (walking speeds) walking and jogging,  freehand for long time periods. Like, I was reading the manual and watching tv.)3- This is STURDY. The tray/ dashbord is cheap, - some space for a book or magazine, and two cup holders for your gin and tonics (j/K) but no real 'working table' as such. (forget that. Get a different treadmill.) But the machine is very sturdy and metal, blalanced- no rattle, thump-a-thump etc.  I'm impressed!  I expected it to be all but disposable.But this was really adequate (MIND YOU I AM SHORT) - for walking and jogging, freehand, while reading and watching tv. (It's not recommended that a person be distracted, but it's not a flimsy thing that will topple or explode or fall over or so on.) Nice reasonably solid feel. (I've seen $1,300 treadmills that are HEAVIER by far, but not appreciably STURDIER for normal use.)  But- pay SOME attention. ANY treadmill can throw you clean into a wall if you hit it on, or hit a fast speed.) But this is not wobbly badly made thing overall.4- QUIET Motor -  Yay. BIG plus.  I expected and worried it would sound like a lawnmower. In a studio apartment with neighbors all over- I worried that a lower cost machine would have a loud motor and be a thing that also registers and transmits footfalls (Brzzzzz! Bonk Bonk Bonk!- ""Oh, I see the neighbor got a treadmill."") NOPE. It's not silent but it's really quiet. I don't have to raise the tv volume (which I keep relatively low), I don't have the 'oh there goes that MOTOR"", and it doesn't klonk when I jog. (Note: Secure all bolts AND the console screws tightly, and re-tighten them as needed.)It's really surprisinly quiet. My sewing machine is noisy. My FAN is noisy. This thing is just a steady low not-unpleasant hum that lets me know the machine is on. But does not let my NEIGHBORS know, nor do you hear it from the kitchen.Go with the motor treadmill if you are not an athlete and have no willpower. I looked at the $100 dollar cheaper 'no motor' treadmills. For that, I can just use 'pavement' or 'the park'. Which I never do because my laziness spectrum is vast but as to things I've at least sort of sometimes dabbled in or do once a week un-dilligently - semi-yoga stuff?  okay. Light weights?  okay. Stretching, okay- feels good if done short term. but AEROBIC stuff? No WAY!. So I need the pavement moving underneath me on it's own to motivate me to move forward. I would take a cab from my door to the corner bodega if I could. I'm THAT 'walk-lazy'. I will help you mover your furniture from your apartment up and down four flights of stairs slowly as to lifting and 'hard work' - while sweating profusely, but if someone has to make a one block run for potato chips, it will be 'you, not me'MOTORIZED treadmills solve the motivation problem and THIS has a relatively quiet, relatively smooth motor, it starts at 1mp always so I don't fling into the wall, it moves up in 1/10 mil of an hour increments, so I don't go from 1 mp directly to two (you CAN, but you have the butto that slowly gradually increases speed at your direction- it doesn't 'automatically speed up')I clip the 'stop' thingie- the clip- the magnet that auto- stops it, the lanyard- whatever that thing is- to my NECK not my waistbelt. I want it to brake if I stumble, not 'by the time I've already fallen down'. But it has a slow brake, It doesn't 'jerk to a stop, on a dime' making a stumble into a disaster.  It's a great thing. It goes 'slow, slower, stop"" so you can catch your balance, without getting chewed into the machine.This machine- granted- has NO bells or whistles on this thing- effective but obviously cheap console. (mph, miles, calories burned, cupholder for your whiskey sour... j/k.. cupholder, water-bottle holder (two, in fact) and you have to put your finger on an alleged 'heart rate monitor' but no plug in pulse ox or heart rate, no ""google maps.  It has a few 'excercise' modes, but, I have not explored those and I probably never will. If you want a machine to be also a sort of workout trainer buddy, you will have to spend a lot more to get the fancy computer stuff. I have enough apps on my phone to cover that.But it HAS an incline and it forces you to lift your feet.  And if you want NO inlcine, it is enabled to remove the incline for flat walking if you have knee injuries or so on.FOLDING- It does fold. Not tiny but it DOES-- fold and latch for upright, for  'out of the way-ness'.  It will not fold into a 3"" flat but it is not an 'always out and huge' thing. It is the dimensions they state, but in real life, that is bigger than it looks. That said, fits in my cramped tiny apartment reasonably okay. It's not 'compact'. But I don't want anything  so compatct that is also too flimsy. Plus if I store it under the bed, it will build itself a forever-home there, and I want to USE it. For things besides 'Just a handy clothing rack'. Which is what I see many treadmills and excercicles used as. I leave mine out. Not decorous but it is not UGLY, and it does say ""Less of a sofa spud than I used to be"" so that's fine, as decor goes.It is about $300, and it is a 'no frills motorized'. In sum,  I have used ,but have not OWNED other treadmills to compare it to. I live in a studio apartment, and I am not athletic.-this is small but it IS heavy (for stability) so don't expect 'small equals portable' in terms of weight, but it is for Walking, freehand, Jogging, freehand, it has a long enough bed for a reasonable stride, you can use the dashboard thign for reading- it holds a book magazine or table.I'm really REALLY impressed at how much BETTER than described, this is. I cannot speak to long term wear- but so far, it's quite, it is sturdy, it is small enough but also BIG enough (for a shot person), it is surprisingly QUIET, and it works freehand for a balanced strided very well.If you were going to go with a non-motorized because of noise, consider this instead if you need motorized motivation. (for $100 more, I have a treadmill I will USE!) and if you were thinking it would cost at LEASt $600 to get a decent treadmill and really more like $1000- and up, unless you need the 'trainer' features, this is great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38YY7LYTYQ08I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007O5B0LC#wasThisHelpful","R38YY7LYTYQ08I","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good for smoke and mild mold mildew- BETTER than expected. And not a heavy perfume odor- but it does HAVE a perfume scent- but evaporates quickly, removes mild musty or cigarette lingering.  But it is NOT an industrial deoderizer. For that you have to was the thing and for mold- bleach or a mold eradicator, and for smoke- quit smoking, open windows, wash fabrics, wipe surfaces to remove tar residue.

"Unlike the hosptital brand I was using, these come individually wrapped. Which is really great if you want to give an infirm or elderly person a hard time at or after each meal or oral hydration moment, a nice fussy time trying to open the plastic package, while also contributing to a lot of waste.  Yes it's more hygenic for throwing in your purse. But very few people who actually use these, are using them while running around town or commuting.  And here, the individual packaging DOES count, because it's just fussy and they fall all over when you want an open bag in a drawer or on a counter or medicine cabinet.The product is okay but there are better ones out there, these are sort of cheap. I can't explain what it means for an oral sponge to be cheap. But if you've seen them, these are the type that is smaller and less flexible of a sponge and not as beneficial, doesn't hold fluid as well, and doesn't last long enough as a toothbrush.More on quality, less on fussy unnecessary packaging. BUT- if you DO need individually wrapped ones, this IS the product for you so three stars, not two.  There are better ones out there. Next time I copy down the hosptial brand and get that one.

"Very good book, got it for myself and home aids with my father. Surprisingly informative for a 'layperson' guide- easy enough for those without time to do biology, but enough real solid swallowing disorder information to be informative even if you've been speaking with your (or your loved one's doctor and or speech / swallow therapist. BUT- it is a layperson guide. AND  it has a bias towards hyper-restrictive soft diets, overly broad (as in institutional settings.) Do note that dehydration and getting adequate nutrition are risks of the (often overprescribed) Dysphagia 1 (all puree and honey thick liquid) diet. It does not advise people to use this as a rough guide, but TAILOR the diet to your or your loved one's specific abliities and needs. No diet is good if the person then refuses to eat or drink enough to stay adequately hydrated and with adequate nutrition.

"I hate folks who review plants without having planted them and seen them grow.  But here I go- I had to give a five star, when I just got my plants yesterday and here's why:  So often, photos are lush blooming trees, but plant comes small, dry withered, etc. Here, they show you a small but healthy plant- and you get a really healthy plant!  (Note- sometimes plants and cutttings come dormant, which I think some people mistake for 'the plant is dead'. Please do give brown dry plant arrivals a shot, if you can!)I ordered two plants. They are not shipped BY Amazon so I didn't get Amazon updates in my e-mail, AND, me being lazy, and expecting a big package for plants, I didn't even THINK to check my little mailbox for the tree seedlings. DOH! The plants came PRESTO- two days later, and sat in my mailbox. (MY bad ENTIRELY. If I had even so much as checked my order on Amazon OR my own mailbox, I'd have seen readily that they'd arrived. The grower updated me via amazon, with shipment tracking and all. I just waited for a 'box' and didn't even think to check my mailbox or look track the order.)Stupid me left my plants Five days in my mailbox- but the plants came out- PERFECT-- healthy, watered, lovely green leaves and the height you see in the photo- yet not overwatered either- great healthy roots on both!I was thrilled that they were grown, packed and shipped so well that my own stupidity didn't kill them. Not only that, they transplanted into soil (i used a commercial 'citrus & cactus' potting soil) and they're both now very cheerful and happy on my windowsill- BECAUSE the grower grew and packed them so well.Note that I have an indoor apartment building mailbox, but ordered them while we still had late cold-snap and they survived the mailing just fine, and very gently packaged as as well. I don't know if these guys could survive five days on a sub-freezing outdoor box or porch, but they were cared for very and shipped very well.They say to leave packing off the reviews, but live plants are one 'product' where shipping and packing are integral to the quality of the product. Five stars on BOTH counts for this plant.I will update on how the plants do, but they came SO healthy- in spite of my own dumb error - but a five day wait and opening the box to find happy green well packaged, well-tended little 5"" or so plants smiling at me? How they do is now up to me- I'll treat them well from here on, and let you guys know how they do. I hear people get lemons from seedlings in as soon as one year for some plants, two for others. I will update. But the company and plants get five stars. Biggest bang for your Meyer Lemon buck! Happy healthy- and 'idiot-proofed' - plants in the mail!

"Hi, This is a must. I've bought many kitchen and working aprons before- which were nice in the photo, or 'a great deal' but in person- were short, or skimpily made, soiled and pilled easily, or- poly-cottons that just looked 'plastic-ish, or cheap. This is poly cotton for cleaning but looks classy. Very good detailing. This is not a heavy canvas, but it is no lightweight- nicely substantial,washes out great. The styling is full, generous and long enough. It is adjustable at the neck- and still covers your legs/ pants even when pulled 'short'. And the striping pinstripe is well done, hides stains while working, really looks good. It IS premium-it's a far higher quality than I anticipated and especially at the price. Very professional, works and looks great in a home kitchen as well. Skip the fancy print high priced flimsy ones, or slightly cheaper industrial whites which which tart crisp, but get- and stay- looking dirty, quickly- and get this. Premium quality, low price.

"Period. I've used a bunch of them. This is a bit gangly-looking. And it makes more noise (it does) and takes up a bit more room of course than the more covered, low profile ballers we all get.But this will do huge AND very small amounts. It holds a TON of yarn for larger things, if you're combining two strands or more, it puts a bit of a twist into them to keep them together (WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT FEATURE you won't find in most yarn ballers.) and it is STURDY and well-designed. (It clamps to almost any table. Though I put padding to damp the winder-grind noise from my wobbly wooden desk, you need not.) .If you are wondering- the design is open so you might think it 'catches' more yarn by misake here and there, gets tangled. This is a beauty-feature though. If you've ever gotten yarn or threads caught in the 'closed-mechanism'  style ballers, which are supposed to be closed to prevent yarn-tangles - but never do, and had to pull yarn out of a closed-mechanims (with pliers etc)- this is low enough that it seldom catches stray yarn, BUT- when it does, you can untangle it from the mechanism in a jiff. without pliers.I've had six ballers, electric and hand crank. This is the best.  (But you may want this as a 'second' to your small baller, which is more quiet.)Big capacity, adds twist to multiple yarns, easy to use, fast wind ratio, ergonomic on the wrist, hard to break this thing, well-made, I just can't recommend it more highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R388X90YMGV8LX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078T6KQY#wasThisHelpful","R388X90YMGV8LX","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Plastic drinking straws are ubiqutous and dirt cheap. But these are wonderful and worth it. (Note: if you're budget bulk purchasing for a cafeteria, institution or large costly one-off, or you need sanitary paper-wrapped straws for public use- these are obviously not for that.)But the colors here are decorous, sophisticated and eye popping. I cannot TELL you how much a difference it makes to spend the extra on these colors. They're  just great. Even just sitting on the counter, they just MAKE the place cheerier, make people happy. (Friends want to take them home and re-use them. For a drinking straw?? That's impressive!)My only comment is that for I think, a bit more (prices on Amazon fluctuate a bit) Faberware has a product that has a different, and also unique but slightly more subdued tasteful color palate. (beiges, orchids...) I get one pkg of each brand- they coordinate rather than clash. (Which to choose? Both!)But by the time you're talking about the huge added bonus- real surprise and happiness that a small item can make, this sudden cheer and tastefulness of 'huge color palette of flexible drinking straws'- you've already hit it out of the park.I'm frugal, especially with disposables- yet, these? SO worth it. Worth every penny over all the 'pretty' but kiddie-color ordinary straws, and worth it over the volume discount ones. Try them. You will be hooked.

It's cheaper- I priced it, for long term, but also cheaper for even temporary use- dorms, short vacations, small parties, than shiny metal-like plastic.Best I've found, of all sorts of 'bargain' options.

"I highly recommend Kendall's Xeroform, AND I highly recommed the hard-to-find but so-worth-it 4""X9' roll form of the product. And this one was not overpriced, which also matters when you use this regularly.I'm doing leg-sore care for an elder.  If you're reading this, you probably already know Xeroform is medicated moist (petroleum jelly) barrier gauze. It's not just 'petroleum jelly and/ on gauze' and the medicated moist but drying agent makes a difference. Xeroform costs a lot but it is entirely worth it.  We tried dressings with petroleum jelly, with triple antibiotic (which is also good) but Xeroform is not just 'convenient' (while pricey) it very MUCH helped with elder skin sores/ blisters/ abrasions.This recommendation is for Xeroform, but also for the 9 FOOT roll form, which is hard to find. Tearing open individual little one-time application packets of smaller Xeroform is more sterile, for deep wounds or in a contamination-likely environment - BUT in a clean Home-care and clean would care setting the roll outperfoms the packets.I find we go through so much of it, that the 4""X 9 foot ROLL is a) Hard to find- so, thank you Amazon and Amazon vendor for making it available- but also makes wound care faster. You can wrap an entire limb without peeling open packets- OR you can cut it to length for larger or smaller coverage. This is really important for wound care, but also for the quick work when dealing with a painful sore on a (here, also impatient and somewhat confused) elderly person- to have a good medicated dressing, AND- to be able to do the job- get the length you need, without stopping to open multiple packets, and so you use what you need, and spare the person time, and save in waste and clean-up. Just be careful not to contaminate the unused portion of the roll - I put it back in it's pouch and then in a seal-baggie. But as to keeping bandages clean and  unconaminated- you already know this.

(It's about a foot or so hig and a 'rectangualr foot' all around) But if you planned it as rolling seating and storage or as anything you could put weight on- think of it as not having wheels. Even though you probalby bought it FOR the wheels.That said, still looks great, still works as visually fine storage and you can still sit on it for low work or put your feet on it, and put on slidey- thingies to slide it around or away.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VPNJ7AFE4E55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089W8TZY#wasThisHelpful","R2VPNJ7AFE4E55","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This item is plowed with undeserved high ratings.Shame shame shame on Eureka's well meaning department of 'theoretical engineering' for making the world's chic-most  heating unit / weight lifting equipment and otherwise born-wrong and set to break waste of money. Save yours and get an even lower cost and slightly less attractive one.Ditch this, and get the Mighty Mite BAGGED vacuum, or the Pet one, or if you're noise-tolerant, a bagged Dirt Devil.Pro's - Under $100 dollars, Bagless, Less noise, hepa, large wheels, easy open canister, small light easy manoevering, genuine quality metal wand, ergonomic curved handle set of attachments and crevice tool, no loss of suction, retractable cord, compact, emits nice 'new car' smell.Cons- All of the pro's are deficits PLUS there are cons - like, this product line overheats and breaks readily (and that's a pretty serious design flaw.)  There IS a lemon in every lot, so any high volume item will have a number of one stars, but BAD DESIGNG affects all the units the same.Under $100- get a bag vacuum for that price, and lower. 2 Less noise- you can't TELL if it's cleaning, so the trade off is you THINK you've cleaned when you haven't. The familiar rattle of something hitting (even losing suction IN) a bag is a GREAT thing- trust me, you'll see.3- Bagless: I cannot THINK of a worse design for 'easy clean' than this particular bagless design. A) you take it off the  insertion/removal site has NO lip, so as you remove it, you dump dirt on your floor. b) it gets static and so the dirt sticks ALL over the inside.  You don't flip the lid open and empty it. You actually have to take the whole thing apart and rinse it, or there's just dirt all over, and by the way, emptying it even without that throws dirt all over (negating the hepa filter. And negating having vacuumed in the first place. Re-using a bag, those even EMPTY far more neatly.)It's really convenient BUT- only if you really enjoy the convenience of cleaning up a huge mess of dirt on the floor AFTER vacuuming and then having  doing the equivalent of a small sinkful of awkward sticky dishes.Hepa- again idiotically bad design. Hepa filter is in the wheel, so it happens to pop out if you bump into anything. and blows dirt all over. B- it has a side vent, not a rear-vent so you're happily blowing the dust around that you want to vacuum up- Chase away, my friends, it's a new form of excercize.Small light manoevering- LOOKS ARE DECEIVING- it only rolls forward and back. Enjoy carrying your heavy new vacuum around your place. And, enjoy the convenience of not being able to easily store this massive klunky design. Maybe you can throw out six pairs of shoes or rent storage from the guy in the next apartment. But those are your 'small convenient' storage options if you don't live in Suburbia (and if you do, why did you get an apartment vacuum?)Happily it won't damage the furniture too much as you snag it on everything you own. Because, again, it only rolls forward and back- and not particularly well. But at least when you carry it, it also weighs a ton.Quality Metal Wand- nice work, you seldom see these on anything under a hundred dollars. But what the heck were the engineers thinking? ""America's small home dwellers simply don't get enough of a workout doing housework. Let us add a few unnecessary awkward pounds to that equation""  This is great for people who like to wear ankle and wrist weights and look forward retro clunky storage and that 50's housewife feel. Save the chrome for the NON-portable appliances. Like, refrigerators, stoves and wine coolers.Comes with attachments- the awkwardly ergopsychotic handle is great for catching and clogging with things that cannot be removed by even the most dedicated plumber. Which is really only a problem for that percentage of American households that has a fur bearing pet, a child, or anyone who drops anything. That's almost nobody- no worries there- great OVER-thinking! The geometry is also fabulous for those of us who vacuum in a ballet first position- this will ONLY ever pose a problem for the handful of folks who like to clean UNDER their furniture.Comes with cleaning Attachments- how swell of them to include a high quality suction brush. Which only cleans backward, only when held at a certain angle, and which has front brushie- things- all of which a pretty hefty and complex design youd' think would be good for you, except it's not. It prevents the vaccum from being able to pick up- dust, hair, dirt and almost anything you'd want off your floors. BUT- at least the crevice tool is 4"" long- shortest one I've ever seen. Which is great for cleaning all those crevices you can clean WITHOUT a crevice tool. (Really what was the point of that??)  And there is some other wierd thingie that also takes up space and does nothing.What it lacks is any sort of small tool that fits under furniture (even with the yoga-enhancing freakshow of an 'ergonomic' handle and heavy long metal wand...) or a small ordinary funnel cleaner that allows you to vacuum up things that are in the proximity of the business-end of the sucker-device, without also being directly underneath the hyper-articulated tools it comes with.  So, you clean 1/4 of the area in twice the time. (Look out ZUMBA!)Retractable cord- what better thing to do with a retractable cord than to allow it to roll up and cause all kinds of heat and also absorb heat, directly from the motor WHILE you vacuum!Doubles as a space heater with fan, and so much the better because if there's one thing you LIKE in a vacuum you DON'T like- it's the vacuum's own engineering-built-in predisposition to commit suicide.Here's it's lifecyle. It's pretty! It's quite! It weighs a ton, it has more suction that you EVER want this side of a sawdust factory! And it's all designed to defeat itself! it sucks up EVERYTHING. Then you add an attachment and it sucks up NOT MUCh, unless you are getting drunk and playing twister with it! Then it just SITS there making you drag it's hulking mass around and moving furniture on it's behalf! Then you try the small attachment and end up crawling on the floor the long heavy wand was supposed to make EASY. Then you empty it and dirties the Room! Then you clumsily dismantle the Easy Clean Dust Compartment. Then you Wash it. Then you dry it! Then you go for the NEXT area while half the cable cooks the motor and the motor cooks the cable. Then it sucks up something TERRIBLE when you toss and just use the want without the goose or donkey attachment that fits nowhere and picks up nothing! Then the ""no loss of suction"" looses suction!Then it overheats and dies! And you get to go nowhere because you thought it was great and tossed it's supplies and it's a NIGHTMARE to return this broken piece of garbage.In the meantime you've lost ten pounds, and since you can't even GIVE it away or fix it, you have a lovely item that is just big enough to make a large modern art sculpture on your dining room table.Jolly testetment to bad design. I'd Bronze this hunk of junk if I could, it's the 1974 Pinto of vacuums!","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28IA0KM831NLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007JN6MQC#wasThisHelpful","R28IA0KM831NLY","A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HPNQ3IOQXTR7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Must admit that I had never heard of this movie.  I was home alone & bored when I was searching for something to watch.  Accidentally ran into it on Prime Instant & decided to give it a try because I'm a fan of both Nicolas Cage & John Cusack.  It starts out slow & moves along slow.  I started to turn it off.  Then I realized 30 minutes later that I was still watching.  Not even sure why but it just kept drawing me in.  The intensity began to increase & I needed to know how it ended.  Although I'm usually pretty good at guessing the endings to most movies, I wanted to see how this one played out on its own.  Yes, the setup of this movie was slow & detailed; but that made the ending twice as much fun!!!  What I hadn't realized was that this is a true event that occurred from 1973-1983.  That made the whole thing a lot more interesting!!!  By the end of this movie, I was emailing my friends & family to be sure to watch this one when they got the chance!!!  It's one of those movies that you're not sure you like until it comes full circle at the end & the way it is drawn together makes the WHOLE thing worth it!!!  All in all I am NOT sorry I watched this movie!!!  Honestly, I probably won't watch it again when alone & definitely would NOT buy the DVD.  Still it was well worth my time watching it on streaming; & IF in the right mood, I would not hesitate to share it with a visiting friend.  I just wouldn't want it sitting around collecting dust!!!

"This debut novel in the new 'A Fixer-Upper Mystery' series, was fulfilling and enjoyable as well as suspenseful.We are introduced to an woman contractor, Shannon Hammer, living in the town of Lighthouse Cove, CA. Hammer Construction specializes in restoration of Victorian Homes. In fact the entire town has been listed as 'Historical.' So, Shannon has plenty of work. What Shannon doesn't have is a boyfriend and so the story begins.Blind dates are risky endeavors, no matter whom sets you up on the date. Shannon's friend, Lizzie Logan is the type that wants everyone to find love like she has so much, in this case, that she didn't do the proper vetting. After a scene on the beach, Shannon wants to desperately forget she ever heard the name, Jerry Saxton. However, someone else has decided to grant her wish, only a bit more permanently than Shannon had in mind.With a hunky new Chief of Police, curious neighbors, loving friends, and be still my heart- a glamorously famous author helping her, Shannon must solve the crime spree and find out who are truly friends or not!Now, I did get confused regarding this character and asked myself if I hadn't just read another in 'the series'. Then, I remembered this was a debut by the author of the  celebrated 'Bibliophile Mysteries.' Yes, Shannon has the same job as another well-known mystery sleuth. Yes, they both live in CA. However, Shannon is not at all like the other San Franciscan sleuth, and this book was a great cozy murder mystery that I will look forward to continue to read as well as the other series.Great news for cozy murder readers!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19E1DDIK53KL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451469194#wasThisHelpful","R19E1DDIK53KL5","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And, it is clear that Jenna keeps no secrets from her friends,that of hers, or others. However, Jenna's 'secret admirer' gives her romance a push which I was glad to see.All in all, this book was a good cozy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCXTEQHKV7XP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425258068#wasThisHelpful","R1MCXTEQHKV7XP","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This novel begins the series. It begins with a bucolic introduction of the town, St. Denis, and it's Chief of Police, Benoit Courreges, known as Bruno. Bruno, is a former war hero (Bosnia) and likes his lifestyle, friends, and the fact he has never had to shoot his revolver.All this may end, when, a gruesome and atrocious murder occurs and suddenly, drugs, and wounds from the Nazi occupation rears it's head. We learn of various factions of Le Resistance and the evils of war that was visited upon inner France.This book is a cozy but not. The crimes and passions are very realistic and will cause some great physical and mental distress.I felt compelled to finish this novel. Why? Perhaps because I served stateside during the Vietnam War and worked with the injured coming back, damaged beyond a young woman's help. This book is very well penned and the author did deep research.All villages have their secrets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6N56RZW4KBXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030745469X#wasThisHelpful","R6N56RZW4KBXC","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just finished listening to a grand opera. Only, in this case, it took the form of a murder mystery novel. I have long been a solid fan of the 'Chief Inspector Gamache' novels. They have always reached a part of my heart, soul, and mind that only great literature can. What did I think as I heard 'Ave Maria' in my heart and shut the final cover with tears streaming down my face? I give it a standing Ovation.Ms. Penny has allowed us glimpses into several souls of the characters I, and others, have grown to love and admire. While we are learning about these persons, the mystery is woven in. The search begins to find the master of the crimes and the suspense mounts. The conclusion was exactly as it should be. Yes, this was a grand opera in print.There are moments of sparkling laughter and light. There are looks into the very hearts of the characters, and we learn the deep, but dark motives and methods used by the assailant.I, was concerned when the Chief Inspector retired. I feared we would lose our beloved brave man and his friends and family. I was worried that Three Pines Valley would fade away like Brigadoon. I am so glad to say, this novel proves that I was worried for 'naught' as my British Mum used to warn.This novel will be kept and re-read as the others in this remarkable series. I pray there are dozens more to come. Ms. Penny has incredible literary talent!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10J6W4VYRBRVR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250022061#wasThisHelpful","R10J6W4VYRBRVR","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the fifth novel of Bud Shumway mysteries, I think...what kooky, fun, quiet desert towns in Utah's high desert, that is except for those weeks. What weeks? Why the ones that find a modern Shakespearean troupe (Hip Hop Bard?), a silver mutant school bus complete with hippie kids, Rolls Royces complete with gourmet chefs, local Liar's Club meetings, a watermelon parade float, mixed with suspicious deaths, and purple hair!This was one fun read. I've had a run of good books lately, but as for pure amusement, this sleepy seeming, murder series is a guaranteed joy.Bud Shumway is currently the retired sheriff of Emery County. He, and his family, a wife and two dogs live in Green River, UT. Just a phone call away from the current Sheriff Howie, Bud's former deputy. Bud finds he needs constant advice from his former Boss, even though he is wearing his wife's gift of a bracelet with WWBD on it (What Would Bud Do.) That will give you a hint.Well, with a dead body up in Thompson Springs, Bud joins up with Howie, after all you can get a decent burger at the Silver Spur Caf, and finds himself not only mixed up in a Witness Protection Program situation, but re-thinking his retirement.I adore this series, that I found years ago as a 'recommendation' on Amazon. I'm so glad I clicked the button to 'learn more.' It's a good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB6870CV1NZQY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0984935673#wasThisHelpful","RB6870CV1NZQY","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly enjoyed this fifth book of a quality murder mystery series, ""A Haunted Home Renovation."" This book contains everything you look for in a page turner. There is murder, glamour, history, laughter, romance, suspense, and danger, and always good for a mystery...multiple mysteries beneath the surface.The location is Marin County, California. This is a well-known beautiful coastal (Pacific) ocean area. Perfect for relocation of a fourteenth-century ruin of a Scottish Monastery. The construction proves to be tricky, as there are considerations of California's strict earthquake needs etc. There is also the slightly nerve-wracking attacks on the construction crew by a Knight with a broadsword! There also appears to be a woman in distress who is quite active.Enter our favorite historic renovation contractor, Mel Turner. No. Not a man, but a clever, and talented former anthropologist woman. Mel's resume includes solving murders and ghost encounters on previous projects. Which is why her boyfriend, Graham called her in. There has been issues keeping the construction crews on site.Mel who is tired of finding bodies and ghosts truly wants to refuse the offer, however, jobs are slow in her field and she needs to meet payroll and keep her crews working. As she checks over the job site, a cranky county building inspector dies and the main contractor is accused. Mel is suspicious of the circumstances and after some deliberations, joins the team.I often find it difficult to write a review without 'spoiling' the tale for you. This was a gem of a story and a solid mystery. Please treat yourself as we glimpse into history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UF6IM5ZIECH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451465806#wasThisHelpful","R1UF6IM5ZIECH6","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this book quite readable and informative. The main focus is an updating on his work regarding the Kensington Rune Stone. Mr. Wolter had written with another person his detailed study of first encountering the rune stone. I had not read that work.This book was written in the format of his personal case study journal. We are taken through the events by day, told whom was present, and given an extensive reference and index for further study, is the reader chooses to.The Hooked X is one of the runes that appeared to be an 'a' in ancient Gotlander (Swedish) language. The hook might have been a mason's mark or it could mean something else. It does appear from reading this text that it is a substitute, at the least, for an 'a.'Now, I read this book not knowing anything of the language of Runes. I have always been interested in ancient alphabets (long story there.) So, I began reading and running to research Gotland etc. Fascinating information and language.The period being looked at is 1400's but the tale begins in the 1100's with the establishments of Cistercian Orders of Monks. Then it blended into a look at the Knight's Templars and onwards. Right into Sacred Geometry.The book was an adventure. Mr. Wolter has done extensive research. The conclusions are both valid and open to your own interpretation. On the whole, I was caught up in the search for the true meaning of the Hooked X, and fully realize that no firm conclusion has been reached yet. The working theory of Mr. Wolter's is intriguing but also controversial. I look forward to his further studies. I will also seek out more Knights Templar research.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHCILWWLPIZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0878393129#wasThisHelpful","R2GHCILWWLPIZS","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Emma Whitecastle, famed television psychic finds herself with boyfriend, Phil, and 4-time Great Grandmother Granny Apples, a ghost with a personality, have been summoned by one of Emma's yoga class members.It seems that the two sisters are arguing over selling the family restaurant. Simple? Oh no.The backdrop is glorious Olvera street in Los Angeles, CA. Now, this brought back favorite memories for myself, as my Mother would take me on a long bus trip from Long Beach to eat lunch and shop on the colorful and exciting street. The mystery is intriguing and I was introduced to a new character, Jeremiah, who I do hope we see often again.As simple as the story sounds, the situation is far more complex and dangerous than it appears at first glance. There are murder attempts, stalking, thefts, and more!Added to the mix, Emma is not truly welcomed, even by the person asking for her help. Something is not as it seems.The description of the foods, colors, smells, and environment kept the pages turning for me. The humor had me giggling, chuckling, and then roaring out loud (woke the entire house at 3a.m.) The gentle romance cheered my soul.I feel this series is as strong as the debut was. I'm hoping to read the next volume in my near future, the fact that it isn't published yet, is a minor inconvenience.Join me for a Margarita, and a bowl of guacamole and chips.

Shockingly, the victim is garbed in a controversial fish net called gill-net. As Chloe worries about the death, she finds that history and modern days seem to be overlapping. There is much written and found about the light keepers and the owners of the Viking Hall and Boat House, but little is known about the fishing village made up of immigrants from the Scandinavian countries.As a side story, we have Chloe herself. Chloe was eager to take this respite from her normal job to give herself some space to think about her life and personal relationships. Chloe also realizes that she has an almost sixth sense...that of being able to immerse herself in the past of the area she is working in. Hearing children's laughter leads her into further studies of the lighthouse but is that what she is supposed to do?This series draws me as it is based upon true historic sites. Ms. Ernst blends reality with fiction in a smooth seamless style that compels me to continue reading. Almost like weaving a gill-net.

"This novel is the sixteenth in a long running, gentle, and well written cozy murder mystery series, 'A Scumble River Mystery.' After all this time, we readers have grown invested in the characters, especially the sleuth, school psychologist, Skye Denison and her fianc, police chief, Wally Boyd.So, I opened this volume with excitement...Skye and Wally are getting married...but what will the clever author, Denise Swanson put in their way? There has to be some issues or crimes or, goodness me, Skye's Mother to interfere with the smooth calm ceremony. Yes, you've guessed from the title...The Librarian.The temporary librarian of Scumble River, Illinois, is certainly one to make an impression upon the local citizens. Not a very good one either. Although Yvonne Osborn appears to have walked off a fashion runway, her personality would not win her any titles. Yvonne was a person who saw black and white and believed in fairness, honesty, and justice. She never worried about doing or saying the 'right' thing, as she just couldn't 'not' do the correct option. This attitude had cost Yvonne her first marriage, troubles with her husband's business partner, and almost cost her daughter her university dreams. So, was it any surprise that Yvonne popped up dead? Nope. However, since we are fans of this gentle series, we know the journey to justice will be filled with humor, suspense, twists, and turns as the locals come out to help the crime fighting duo...One of the best under-stories running through this novel was the unprecedented quietness of Skye's mother. We know she has a huge, warm, and loving heart, but oh Nellie, this goose dressing woman is a schemer and interferer....what is she up to? Do not read the ending first as the twist is just too delicious to spoil.This book was filled with wedding issues and humor and yes, a good murder mystery. Some would say it was a 'chick-lit' book, but, come on now, this book is a cozy and what can make you feel more cozy than a setting of Christmas weddings?Now, if there would be a crime on the Honeymoon???

Chloe must solve the crime to help her friends out.This novel was filled with suspense, strong writing, sharp character development, and a great setting. I became involved with the characters in the first novel ""A Plain Death,"" and found this novel to be as good if not better. I look forward to reading the next novel...""A Plain Disappearance.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SGDD78A3Q2FA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1433676982#wasThisHelpful","R3SGDD78A3Q2FA","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was gifted this excellent read by the clever author. I had read an earlier novel in this 'A Rhodes to Murder Mystery' series and loved it. As happens all to often, there are so many new releases penned by quality authors that I overlooked the following additions to the series. My error and my loss. To Kill A King, is easily the best novel in the series and even though it was written in 2000, the folks at Worldwide Publishing, making a wise business decision, picked it up and reprinted the complete set in 2013.So, this book is book number three and we find Caroline Rhodes, a registered nurse, comes to the aid of her best friend, Molly O'Neal, R.N. in the busy ER department of Ascension Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. Molly is desperate. Due to the egotistical and Don Juan antics of Department head, Dr. Roger MacGuffy and the senseless directives put in by Director of Nurses (DON), Angela Horowitz, the crew is off to a poor start. The EMS (Emergency Medical Services) co-ordinator is upset since her workers can't aid in the ER any longer, there is romantic harassment going on between Dr. MacGuffy and all single women. Add to the stress, is the feeling of paranoia among the staff, certain that two of the employees are 'spies' of Dr. MacGuffy and Ms. Horowitz. There is no harmony or camaraderie within the department. To top off the situation, Chicago is experiencing a Summer of intense heat and patient loads are almost guaranteed to increase quickly. Caroline finds herself not surprised that staff is leaving without notice.The crisis reaches a climax when no one can find the despised DON, and upon checking on her, Angela Horowitz is found dead! Murdered. All too quickly it becomes common knowledge that Caroline had help solve a few crimes back in her new home town.Could it be jealousy? Perhaps, just professional hatred. Or, rumor has it...the Mob? Whatever the cause, when other staff is found dead, Caroline, and friends and family flood the ER Department to solve this confusing, twist filled, crime spree. The hospital must be made safe again for patients and staff!I truly like the character Caroline Rhodes. I like her daughters, her amusing and amazing friends, and even the policemen. To my surprise I quickly recalled the characters from the first novel which I read quite awhile ago. The story and logistics of the first novel came back to me easily making this novel enjoyable. I wish the ending had added a bit more of Caroline's friends but that would have made the book an additional hundred pages or so...I'm o.k. with that...This is a series that I hope the new publisher will ask the author to continue. I would like to continue to follow Nurse Rhodes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REBUY8H8JZTM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=148008722X#wasThisHelpful","REBUY8H8JZTM7","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The connection between Suzanne and her Mother, Jake, Grace, and dear friends in April Springs is admirable.I read this series because of it's gentle edge. It is a cozy and as such means no moments of painful suspense. Just solid good writing. Also, wonderful donut recipes, including healthier baked versions. A pleasant read for all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DEH1NBW8M90D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1490480307#wasThisHelpful","R1DEH1NBW8M90D","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am slowly going through my upside-down TBR (To Be Read) piles and found this Southern Treasure from release date of January 2013.

Everyone that knows the hapless man is aware that there is no possible way of his being guilty, but it falls up to Glory and Karen to solve the crime.Glory also finds a bit of romance and aid in hunky Bookstore owner, Jake.

"Do you enjoy a good action packed mystery novel set in a cozy setting that will get your blood quickening? If so, run out and purchase this book. Trust me you will find your pulse begin to pound.Being a cozy mystery novel, the fourth in this excellent series, A Manor House Mystery, I set back in my upholstered chair with a calm cup of tea to enjoy renewing my book friendship with Museum Curator, Grace Wheaton, and her boss, Bennett Marshfield. To my delight, I found we were 'vacationing' in Tuscany. The description of the location, smells, air perfumed with Olive Oil, and more quickly transported me there with the duo. Grace and Bennett were guests on their last leg of a two-week vacation/work trip to France and Italy, of Bennett's long time friend, Nico, a fellow Billionaire.Something was just off at the villa though. Grace and Bennett overheard heated arguments in the hallways. There was tension among the staff and family. We learn that the Son was estranged from the family, and even worse, Bennett finds a skilled forgery of a skull crafted by Picasso! Not wanting to worry his ailing friend, Bennett decides to keep the information to himself until they return to North Carolina. However, even that becomes a trial. The private jet is cancelled due to a mysterious arrest of the pilot, and forces the couple to join another jet leaving the next day, leased by a rock band.I could go on and almost tell you the entire plot and scenes but it would spoil the book for you. I will just say...fasten your seat belt and get ready for a bumpy ride. Ms. Hyzy is an amazing action scene author. She puts you right in the scene and you find yourself caught up in the action. I'm still recovering from the trauma.Each novel in this series is gaining strength and content. It is so well crafted that I'm amazed we don't hear more about the book. Please go out and tell others about this series, and the White House Chef one also. They are truly worthy of note.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT3AX6KCP5X2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425259668#wasThisHelpful","RT3AX6KCP5X2D","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Kath Rutledge, inherited her grandmother's fiber and fabric store, The Weaver's Cat, in Eastern Tennessee. The Quaint town of Blue Plum quickly adopted Kath into their community. Grandmother had a following that adored her but also felt she was, shall we say, a bit quirky. Kath learns that that might be due to the ghost in her house that now loves living at the 'Cat.' or the fact that Gran's journal mentions she was a witch! Either way, Kath is learning to embrace her new life and treasure each member of her Posse!Did I say, Posse? Oh yes, well you see, Kath happened upon some bodies a bit back and her fabric ladies (and one handsome man, Joe,) helped solve the crimes before Deputy Sheriff Clod, oops I mean, Cole Dunbar was able to.This second novel of the series, A Haunted Yarn Shop Mystery, finds the ladies all together at Debbie's Cloud Hollow Farm to see the lambs, sheep, and learn dyeing of fabrics. Instead, the group is shocked to find a double murder scene where the female victim is the daughter of Bonnie, one of the group.Bonnie and Debbie both want Kath to investigate. So does the Posse, and Geneva, the Ghost. This crime is exacting on Geneva as it seems to bring back memories of terrors past.I have to say, that I love the characters in this book. It is a gentle cozy and that is just what I wanted to read when I picked it up. Geneva is my favorite. She, for a ghost, has a heck of a personality. I loved the naming of the 'cat.' I like Kath as well. Kath has a natural feel about her as you sense her confusion but determination in this new life she is carving out for herself.There is a bit of romance but it is on the back burner and that is fine and believable. I like Blue Plum and really am beginning to forge a friendship with Ms. MacRae's fictional characters. This series is one that may become addictive to you. I hope so.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PDBZHLM4YB3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451239563#wasThisHelpful","R3PDBZHLM4YB3Y","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

His bosses at the FBI feel the member died of natural causes but James senses malice. Soon it appears there are even more deceased that are possibly connected...but why would someone do this heinous act?We readers are carefully lead through the investigation that involves many of the actual Society's employees and even some Board Members. Each plausible theory is almost spelled out for us as we follow Nell's intricate trail through the facts. So, imagine our surprise when...well, I just won't tell you as it would spoil the surprising treat of the ending.Also, in this novel, the relationship of Nell and James is moved forward and in good time.

"Brooklyn Wainwright, a reputable bookbinder is startled by an unexpected visit from her chef sister, Savannah. Savannah, owner of 'Arugula' a vegetarian restaurant in the Sonoma County, CA town of Dharma, has come to ask Brooklyn to repair a rare cookbook to give as a present to a fellow chef.Brooklyn doesn't want to give this book away as it is rare and very old. In fact from the 18th Century. However, Savannah is insistent so Brooklyn agrees. As a Thank You, Savannah arranges dinner reservations to the Chef's grand opening in San Francisco in the Mission District. The Chef is Baxter Cromwell, Savannah's ex-boyfriend, television-land's Bad Boy Chef, and an all around jerk.Baxter has decided to open his restaurant with two weeks worth of his favorite old friend chefs. Opening night, Savannah is featured. Brooklyn and her live in love, Derek Stone, a former spy and now CEO of his own high security firm, doesn't know what to expect when they arrive, what they didn't expect, however, was to find Baxter dead on his kitchen floor with Savannah kneeling over him with the murderous knife!The three await the police and make a cursory search for the rare cookbook, after all, it wouldn't have anything to do with the murder would it? When the book comes up missing, that is exactly what Brooklyn begins to ponder.This sounds like a rather regular murder mystery...but what a person who is not familiar with this excellent series doesn't know is this mystery, is as usual, character driven. Ms. Carlisle has the unique ability to make her characters, not only believable, but interesting. Brooklyn and Derek are a society couple, but yet, you can see yourself joining them with a pizza and beer. I'm also in love with the family and residents of Dharma (Brooklyn's home town.) I love that the 'Flower People' have grown up and created their own form of an established life style. I favor the positivity versus the normal negativity that is type-casted for a 'flower person' of the sixties!We are actually solving two mysteries...murder and the rare book loss. The stories weave in and out and both are solved at the ending quite satisfactorily in my opinion.I look forward to the next installment eagerly. I'm never disappointed. I doubt you will either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CFVQ6G59HUGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451415965#wasThisHelpful","R3CFVQ6G59HUGC","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The seller demands cash but the deal, is just too good to miss. The seller is Elise Whitmore.Next, Dev updates us on her love life. She is torn between Deputy U.S. Marshal Jake Del Vecchio suddenly back on the job and undercover, and Dev's former beau, Dr. Noah Underwood, back in her life after thirteen years.As we are reading along in the midst of a work/date dinner fundraiser where Noah and Dev are reconnecting, we are shocked by the news that Dev's BFF, Boone has been arrested for the murder of his client, Elise Whitmore!What is going on? Has this something to do with the chocolate molds? Since Noah is no fan of Boone's, Dev flees the fundraiser with girlfriend, Poppy, the estranged daughter of the Police Chief. Soon we are getting all caught up with Dev's family and friends.This novel is a cozy murder mystery as well as a romantic suspense tale. I found both equally compelling to read. Yes, this series is like catching up on the lives of the Shadow Bend citizens and I enjoyed reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13P4WQQ7DWP34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451239423#wasThisHelpful","R13P4WQQ7DWP34","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this novel in one evening. Yes, the way the dialog flows made the story compelling and made me have to see what happened next. I truly enjoyed the reading experience this book gave me.We have the main character, whom I fell in love with almost immediately, Pippi O'Brien. Pippi is a former stock trader (Chicago floor,) and now is working hard at being a 'Resale Merchandiser.' Which means she dumpster dives and resells what she finds. Of course, she also goes to yard sales and other venues to find her 'deals.' Pippi isn't rich, however, she is happier than when she was in the 'industry.'Pippi was busy looking through garbage (legal) at the curbside of an affluent home, when she happens upon a suspicious article of clothing...this is when we learn that Pippi has an over active imagination or is it? Well, when her boyfriend, police detective, Sean Panelli, is called out on a homicide at the very home Pippi had been at...she 'figures out' the first murder scenario in a rollicking fast-paced adventure to find the killer. As the scenarios change, alter, and deepen, Pippi takes us readers on a humorous trip. Can she be correct? Or, is Pippi in danger, after someone plants evidence in her apartment.This novel was a surprise to me. Especially for a debut novel. Ms. Furlong-Bolliger is a talented author and I certainly look forward to future tales by her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23BZSFF9GQKYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937273911#wasThisHelpful","R23BZSFF9GQKYG","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This debut novel has a lot going on in the storyline. The main character, Jenna Hart, a former Advertising executive and widow, moves down south of San Francisco, CA to live next to her Auntie Vera, her Father, a former FBI analyst, and friends in her childhood town of Crystal Cove. Auntie has sold Jenna a business that she had intended to open decades earlier but hadn't due to something personal in her life. The new business is a combination Cookbook store and Cafe. It is an unique bookstore as it specializes in cookbooks but also, cooking implements, and a reading section with mysteries and other fiction revolving around cooking.The cafe is high-end delicacies. Auntie has sold the business but is actually the in-house manager as Jenna adjusts to her new job as 'owner.' A former high school friend of Jenna's, Katie becomes the head chef, and as time moves on, another friend, Bailey appears to work in the store.Jenna is also adopted by a precious kitty, Tigger which adds a great deal of mystery to the story plot. Jenna meets various persons and has an unusual interaction with the Police Chief's mother.There is a lot of action in this book. It begins simply, the store is opening with a guest cookbook celebrity, Desiree Divine, a former college room-mate of Jenna's. To everyone's shock, Desiree is found murdered by Jenna, which makes her the main suspect. Yes, Jenna tries to figure out who the killer is, but the journey to the truth is anything but simple.This novel is unique as the characters develop their personalities. We have psychics, both human and animal, artists, thieves, identity thefts, fakes, cooking lessons, reunions, humor, and more.As a bonus there are wonderful recipes at the end which are geared to regular and non-gluten baked goods. As a gluten sensitive, I certainly appreciate this careful attention and having something I can bake!I look forward to Jenna's next adventure as she becomes more part of Crystal Cove.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKEB3YPV2BS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425258041#wasThisHelpful","R3DKEB3YPV2BS7","A3NPRWXTO85BJ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3NPRWXTO85BJ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first novel in a series that is unique...both the main character, Darwin Winters, and a Mastiff, Karma are psychic! That puts a difference in the crime solving that was special.Darwin has moved to St. Pete, Florida to begin her own independent life. Finding herself away from family (a psychic one that is alluded to,) she is naive in the ways of the world. Darwin works in a Pet Boutique with a lovely woman, Sylvia, but she is still lonely.

Since Darwin found him and the police insist that it is a suicide, Darwin finds herself in a quandary. Karma says he was murdered but...?There was a fun romance that threaded throughout the novel and added some break from an intense murder attempt.

This eighteenth novel has Lori Shepard, and friend, Bree Pym searching for a missing family and trying to rescue a Russian Prince.A wee child tells Lori about the holding of this Prince, against his will, in a dungeon in a manor house near Finch. Lori thought it was a dream story until she finds physical evidence that the imaginative child bases her stories upon reality.Off we go with Lori and Bree as they travel from astounding house to house to seek and save the Prince. Threaded throughout is a recipe that is treasured and shared with the readers.This book is a cozy. Pure fun reading and took me about four hours to devour it. Now to wait for the next story.

However, when I used it as prescribed the HCF definitely helped me focus.

Once the installation is completed the outcome is extremely nice, very flat and even.

"GORGEOUS!!! I can't believe how beautiful this bracelet is! The crystals really sparkle and the quality is very nice. It also has a nice weight to it and the rose gold color is so pretty! The clasps is easy to put on, it's a better quality clasp so it makes the bracelet look worth a lot more then the listed price. I've found no flaws with the bracelet. I did however feel that the velvet bag the bracelet came in didn't do the bracelet justice and made the bracelet look cheap at first until I took a good look at it.

"I love the red color! It definitely screams ""Look at me!"" and that's what I want because as a mother of 3 kids, I am very forgetful! Many times I would have bills, letters, reminders, or other things that I need for the next day so I'll leave it on the table to make sure I take it before we leave in the morning. Well, sometimes we are in such a hurry I forget to take the things from the table. Having this organizer hung on the front doorknob is awesome! The pockets expands a little so I can actually fit a good amount of objects in there. There is a small detachable hook which is perfect to hang my house key on. When I take the dog for a walk, I just take that extra key and place it back when we get back home. The faux leather looks very nice, the only thing is I wish it had more attachments on the front, maybe for my glasses but that's just my preference. I could just stick my glasses in one of the pockets. ***I received a sample of this organizer at a discount to test and offer my honest opinion. So far I love this idea!

"Love the pretty color! It's a very sleek case. I use it everyday but I'm not sure how well it will protect my phone if I was to drop it. I'd prefer the frame to be raised a bit more to protect my screen but I added a glass screen protector so I think that should be fine. This case has 2 layers, the grey rubber then the plastic. Once I inserted my phone into the rubber case, I found it a bit hard to insert it into the plastic case. A part of the plastic by the volume button cracked. It's not noticeable and nothing was affected by the crack...I probably would've given this case lower stars but I was probably too rough when trying to put the case on, plus the color is just so pretty and it doesn't make my phone bulky like my old case...so I'm a bit torn.

"Just what I needed for my craft projects! My kids love buying these cell phone jack plugs, when we buy them they usually have a charm hanging from them that adds some dcor to the phone. Having these blank ones are perfect since we can now create our own! My daughter plays soccer so I'm thinking of hanging a chain from the top hole and adding soccer theme charms to the chain. She can give these as gifts to her team mates. I haven't checked if any of the 100pcs are flawed but I'm used to buying craft supplies in bulk and there is always a few that are flawed so it's expected. If you need exactly 100pcs, I would recommend buying two bags to be safe. This bag of 100pcs is priced less then the cost of some of the premade ones we usually buy from the stores so this is a great deal. Works very well for something so small. It reminds me of a pocket size stapler. It only uses two AA batteries for it to work, has magnet on the bottom so I have it conveniently located on my fridge. I tried different ways to reseal my bags of chips using this tool but found it best when I used it as if I was using a mini stapler. I'll create a fold and ""staple"" along the fold to seal the bag.

"Very nice size picnic mat! It's easy to unfold and fold, I love the attached handles which make it easy for me or my children to carry. Included is four picks to hold the mat down. I would probably use it for the beach or on soft soil. The park we were at had very hard soil so the pick did not insert into the ground and since it's made of plastic, I didn't want to break it. Metal picks would have been better but picnic mats usually don't include picks anyway so this was a nice bonus.

"I love the feeling of this eye mask! As soon as I placed them under my eye, I noticed I needed to adjust them. I was worried it would be too sticky and pull on the already delicate area but it cane off easily and I was able to readjust it with no problems, It feels like a soft cooling gel. It's not overly cooling but you can feel a light coolness. This is all preference but I actually liked the large size of these pads. To me, the more area it covers the better! Plus I have a round face so I liked that the pads weren't small. The instructions say to leave it on for up to 8 hours so I actually slept in mine. It was really comfortable! The skin around my eyes didn't look as dry as it usually does. It looked a little brighter too! I can't wait to see the results when I finish my first box!

I don't feel this pill will help me lose weight fast but it will help me lose weight at a safer pace because it curbs my appetite.

"My son is having a Birthday party in a couple of weeks so this is perfect! The quality of these props are excellent! The props are thick and will hold it's shape.The instructions are clear and easy to read. Everything is packaged well and all supplies are included such as the double sided tape. The tape is thick so the holding stick and the prop will be very secure and won't fall off. The instructions say you could also use hot glue to attach it but the provided tape worked well for us when I tested them. There are so many options of props to choose from and I'm thinking of decorating a few glasses with  rhinestones and glue a few feathers on the hats to make them more creative. 62 pcs is a lot, so after the party, I'll be giving them away as party favors for our guest to take home.

"Works very well! I usually place my wince back into my fridge after I pour myself a glass of wine, if I want another glass I have to go back into my fridge again.

I just keep it in my freezer overnight if I know I'll be opening a bottle of wine the next day, I also make sure my wine bottle is chilled before using the chiller. When you're ready to use it, attach the pour/spout to the rod, uncork your wine, and replace it with this chiller. The rod will keep your bottle of wine cold!

"I'm always trying different weight loss pills, I'm always trying to find one that give me energy and helps curb my appetite. The directions say to take two tablets with food twice a day. For me, I take it in the morning with breakfast and again during a last lunch. It does help curb my appetite, I feel full much faster and have no cravings for snacks. I did have a slight boost of energy, I'd compare it with a large cup of coffee. I'm already used to drinking a lot of coffee before taking diet pills so the caffeine may have a different effect on me compared to someone who hardly drinks coffee or soda. Some diet pills makes my heart race so I really like that this pill doesn't have that effect on me. I received this bottle at a discount to test and offer my honest opinion.

Plug it in, fill it with water up to the max level, add a few drops of your favorite essential oils, and press the on button. Right away you will see the beautiful colors of this diffuser. There is no option to turn the light off but the diffuser will automatically turn off when the water is depleted. I love keeping this in my children's room. It's their night light and depending on what oil I add, it keeps the mosquitoes out! You have a choice of Continuous mode which will last about 3 hours or Intermittent mode which could last for 6 hours. I received this unit for free to test and offer my honest opinion, I love the simplicity of this unit. It looks great too! I also highly recommend purchasing the Calily essential oils to use with this unit.

"Very cute puzzle! It has numbers from 1 to 20, most puzzles I have only go up to 10. For each number, there is a little groove which is perfect for a child's finger to pick up the number. Most puzzles do not have a groove and we end up turning the puzzle upside down to get the pieces out. For each number there is a little character, for example, number 1 has 1 elephant, 2 has 2 fishes, 3 has 3 pencils and so on. I received this puzzle for free to test and offer my honest opinion.

I hate wearing lingerie or anything sexy but this actually looked great on. The quality is fantastic, not too thin or too thick. It was strong enough to hold in...whatever needed to be held in lol! I love the lace up back, I was able to pull it as hard as I could and it didn't break, the ribbon is very strong.

"First, I love the size of this aerator and that it includes a stand.  I noticed, depending on the wine, the aerator has a different effect. I recently have a love for wine am still clueless of the  different types of wine and how they're supposed to taste. I just know what I like. So depending on what wine I use this with, it sometimes enhances the flavor and a few times it actually made the wine taste a bit lighter...like I was drinking juice. Very interesting how something so simple can cause an effect on the flavor of wine. I try to slowly pour the wine through the aerator and it gives a subtle whirl sound.

As you can see from the photo, the top is the before and the bottom is obviously the after because it's so clean!

" 1:49 MinsI always wanted a facial steamer because my pores are always clogged. I was hoping a steamer would help open my pores to prep it for extracting black heads. This Mira facial steamer is a nice and compact. It's very simple to use, just add purified/distilled water to the water tank then turn the switch to ""on"". You will notice a blue light and within a minute you will be able to see steam forming. In the video you will notice the steam blowing away, this is because my window was right there so I'd recommend using this away from a window or I usually use the steamer with a towel over my head to keep the steam on my face. I received this steamer at a discount to test and offer my honest opinion. I really love it! After I steam my face, I'm able to easily extract blackheads, then apply my acne ointments. Since the steamer helps to open my pores, the medicine is absorbed into my skin much better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R9512S2K3EBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011CZ8XKU#wasThisHelpful","R3R9512S2K3EBE","AJ6OU6CM3KV02","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ6OU6CM3KV02?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was surprised how much I loved these gloves! I already own a cut resistant glove but every time I wore them I felt my blood circulation was going to stop. It was just way too tight and it was the only size available. These gloves from Mosiso are easy to put on, I can move my fingers, and have a comfortable grip on my knife. I use these gloves whenever I need to clean and cut fish. These gloves work very well to protect my hands. After use, I wash them in mild detergent and hang dry.

The cool nylon material stays in place, I own a few other bandeau hardly wear them since it always needs to be adjusted or the padding is awful and makes my bust look flatter then it already is. I wear a 32A and received a size Medium. Great fit! The pads actually made my bust look a little bigger and yet the pads are not very thick at all. I wore this with a sheer tank and love it!

"I never knew there was such a tool as a soil meter. I definitely have black thumbs, every plant I buy dies within a week or so because I never know if I'm over watering my plants or under watering them. I would just go by the look of the soil and water when it looks dry. Right now I only have cactus plants in my home so when I received this tool I decided to purchase a small strawberry plant to test this tool with. It's interesting how this tool works, it requires no batteries, starts off at zero and as soon as it's in the soil it starts showing the results depending on what you're measuring. There are three options, you may switch between ""moisture"", ""light"", and ""ph"". Obviously the lighting for my plant is all wrong since it needs full sun to thrive, the PH seems to be in the right range, at first the soil was dry so I watered the plant and now it shows as ""wet"". This is such a cool tool to have, my 5 years old loves his strawberry plant and with the help of this tool we are now having a fun learning experience together. I received a free sample of this Mudder 3-1 Soil Meter directly from the company to test and offer my honest opinion. I'm really happy with it, if I had any problems with it I would have contacted the seller first and write my experience here but I had no problems using this tool and any questions I had regarding soil I found online.

"""Beginning Judo: The Ultimate Guide to Starting Judo"" by Jeff McCall is your ""how-to, go-to"" for anybody who has ever been interested in the modern form of martial arts.The first half of the book discusses the history and development of Judo as well as its many forms.

"Leading Change From Within is quite possibly the most unique leadership book Ive read in quite some time, because it focuses heavily on the importance of servant leadership. This is an idea that is all but lost to most middle managers, who focus on what their employees can do for them as opposed to evaluating how they, as managers, can propel their employees to greater heights of performance and productivity.Brian Strobel provides a very detailed method by which managers can motivate their subordinates. Through looking first within themselves, these leaders can then be the role models that their companies need to effect true change. Strobel points out the importance of managers to make themselves available to their employees, rather than the other way around, in order to develop a highly effective organization.The book is laid out in a very neatly organized fashion, and is written well. Managers of all levels can benefit from the advice within this book, so I strongly recommend Leading Change From Within to anyone with managerial responsibilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BFCBKPMQNMFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKZE11U#wasThisHelpful","R3BFCBKPMQNMFV","ATF6GJCPVY3ML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATF6GJCPVY3ML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, assuming another identity comes with a price and while Liv wants to save her marriage to David, as David slowly recovers she finds out that David has other plans- plans in fact to even destroy her.Filled with strong female characters, passion and a sinister plot that slowly unravels, Thirty Days of Red is a must-read for any fan of both romantic and thriller novels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R150YK96PEL0UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WHFQZ28#wasThisHelpful","R150YK96PEL0UL","ATF6GJCPVY3ML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATF6GJCPVY3ML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Remembering to Breathe: 5 Easy Exercises for Caregivers to Reclaim a Healthy Work-Life Balance is the perfect book for nurses, nurse assistants, doctors, or anyone who works as a caregiver. Whether its in a hospital or nursing home, assisted living center or day care center, this book is chock full of working strategies to help you deal with the stress of your day-to-day job and not let it ruin your home life. For that matter, many of these tips would be helpful for anyone who works in a stressful environment (and who doesnt?)The exercises that Melissa Valdellon outlines are both practical and effective, and are designed to nip your stress triggers in the bud and help you work your way through them. The book is well-written and perfectly organized, and has several alternatives for when a particular exercise just doesnt fit your lifestyle. One of the most effective exercises for me has been to live in gratitude. Valdellon suggests taking some time at the end of each day to list at least three things you are grateful for. This helps put the day into perspective, setting aside the negatives of the day and focusing instead on the positives.All in all, this is an excellent book well worth the time to read it. It will help you deal with your stress in more positive ways, leaving you a happier, more carefree (and productive!) person.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15X7ALTPN5LF0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692402926#wasThisHelpful","R15X7ALTPN5LF0","ATF6GJCPVY3ML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATF6GJCPVY3ML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vampire Americana is not your typical vampire novel, and thats a good thing. I became sick of the standard blood-sucker fare after the second Twilight book, and almost passed this one up. The description struck me, though, as evidence of a book that would be different from the rest, so I decided to check it out.R. G. Tamaki has created a new future, one in which vampires are out in the open, actually registered and regulated. The main character, Jim, is far from being the usual perfect vampire. Instead, hes nervous and even a bit slow to react at times, making for a very likable and well-developed character.All of the characters, actually, are complex and nicely developed. The storyline is both fresh and traditional, since it beckons back to the age-old battle between vampire hunters and the vampires themselves. Even though the story is somewhat predictable, it has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting.If you enjoy vampire tales, give Vampire Americana a try. Its far from the typical fare, but its a very enjoyable read with amazing characters and vivid descriptions, along with plot development that will, pardon the pun, suck you in and keep you reading until the wee hours of the night or later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H3XO4J204PWD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCS50OW#wasThisHelpful","R2H3XO4J204PWD","ATF6GJCPVY3ML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATF6GJCPVY3ML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shadow of the Makarios is an epic fantasy story in a time that is mostly bereft of new works of this magnitude. Its definitely a long read, at over 500 pages, but every page is filled with action, vivid imagery, and the age-old struggle of good versus evil. Through perfectly-described settings and well-developed characters, Grant T. Reed moves the story along page after page, keeping you enthralled as you take in the suspense and intrigue of the twisty, turning storyline.If youve read any of the books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, know this: Shadow of the Makarios might just be this centurys Lord of the Rings. Reed has Tolkiens flair for storytelling and world-building, and every part of his fantasy world, Eyndegaria, has been intricately planned out. The book doesnt bog you down in tedious details, though; it reveals exactly what you need to know about the world, when you need to know it.Reed is a fantastic author, and I hope he continues writing books set in Eyndegaria.

"As a married man, Attract a Girlfriend didnt seem like it would be too applicable to me at first glance. However, reading this book has helped me to rekindle some of the spark in my marriage, since it has helped me to better talk to my wife and understand her point of view on a lot of things. There is quite a bit of information in this book that would have been helpful when I was on the dating scene, and almost all of it remains relevant once youre off the market and are with that girl of your dreams. The book is well-written and easy to read, so I strongly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRCP2VJ47265A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REXIGYS#wasThisHelpful","RRCP2VJ47265A","ATF6GJCPVY3ML","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATF6GJCPVY3ML?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Savage Run is one of my favorite books of 2014. Part of this is because Im a huge lover of dystopian novels, but the book is mostly one of my favorites because it is executed with flawless attention to detail and the art of the written word. The world created within the pages is definitely our own, but significantly changed by the catastrophic event that has created a world with an amazingly detailed and original caste system and many technological advances that put the book sometime in the future.The book gets your attention quickly, and holds it firmly with a storyline that is original and inspiring. The characters are very well developed, and the pacing was top notch.

The writing is above and beyond anything Id hoped for, and the imagery was vivid and fantastic. If you are a fan of books that provoke deep thought, youll definitely enjoy Lilyred.

"A Students Key to Ancient Greek Thought is exactly what the title implies, and does an excellent job of providing that. The book is meticulously researched, and offers the reader an outstanding level of information on ancient Greek philosophy. The text is clearly written and provides knowledge on all of the great minds of the ancient Greek times, such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and others. G. A. Rauche has organized this book in a sensible way, addressing first the principal features in Greek mythological thought, then the characteristics of Greek philosophy, and then drilling down into the various schools of thought from ancient Greek times.

"Mischief, Mayhem, the Blue Men of Minch is a wonderful story, and an amazing mixture of various different genres. The author points out in the description that the book is great for people who love the fantasy (nonsense) of the likes of Terry Pratchett as well as those who enjoyed Nancy Drew or the Hardy boys books of years gone by, and the book is definitely well-grounded in all of those genres. Equal parts fantasy and suspense, the book entertains from beginning to end. The character development is wonderful, and the plot has just enough suspense and twists in it to keep things interesting.

Instead, the novel is a unique love story that follows some all-too-real paths, and features fantastic plot and character development along with a compelling story that will suck you in and have you coming back for more.The chemistry between JD and Melanie is nothing short of electrifying, and you can sense both of them struggling to come to terms with the fact that each has finally met the one.

"If youre looking for a unique diet that actually allows you to eat the foods you enjoy, check out The Old Chocolate Diet by Diana Artene. Artene has developed a common sense way to manage what you eat without forcing you to sacrifice the foods you love. Instead, you eat sensible amounts of the food you want, when youre hungry, but only eat enough to make you feel full. You wont feel compelled to binge eat, because you wont be depriving yourself of the good flavor that gourmet food brings to the table (pardon the pun).

"Over the last several years, I have purchased many different brands of microfiber towels and none have really ""grabbed"" me the way the DII brand has.  I have always took issue with some microfiber towels not being very absorbent nor thick enough to really do large jobs. These microfiber towels have a special blend of microscopic fibers woven into hooks & loops, creating tiny scoops which attract, absorb and wipe out grime for lint free cleaning. They are ultra absorbent - holding up to 7 times in weight in liquid, dirt or grime. Also, when used while dry, microfiber is positively charged and naturally attracts negatively charged grease, dirt and dust.These towels also are pretty odor free as long as you rinse them out well after each use.

"Brookstone's outstanding outdoor wireless speaker and docking station has been in our house for almost 10 years!  I love the portability, the light feature and that it is able to be left outside/waterproof.  This is the 2nd speaker I have purchased as the first one lasted close to 9 years with some serious, HEAVY use and abuse!  We love to hook it up to our Grace Digital Internet Radio, IPod or TV!I looked at other outdoor/wireless speakers but I just couldn't find one that I thought I would like more for the price range.  Again, this speaker is weather-resistant and features omnidirectional sound in yards, patios or anywhere else within 150 feet of your docked MP3 player or stereo. There are 3 audio channels prevent interference with other cordless devices, while the 5"" woofer and 1"" tweeter deliver dynamic bass and bright, clear treble. Uses an AC adapter (included) or 8 D batteries (not included). The universal dock connects to any stereo or MP3 player, streaming your music through walls, floors or ceilings via a clear, strong 900MHz signal to the Outdoor Speaker. Runs on included AC adapter, or 6 AA batteries (not included).Updates to this unit would be GREAT after being on the market this long.  The only update from the original speaker I bought is the docking station.  It used to be a thin silver receiver/dock. Obviously, this unit is a big seller for Brookstone. However, the only thing about this speaker and dock is that it would be great if the unit was BLUETOOTH enabled and if the dock would charge your IPod/IPad/IPhone or other phone/peripherals while sitting in the dock and/or in use.All in all, STILL a SOLID 5 STARS!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPCHK7AU32WN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Z4S3WY#wasThisHelpful","R3DPCHK7AU32WN","APDPA11IZPYLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDPA11IZPYLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered ""Nest"" to read with my granddaughter, who is 10 years old and in the 5th grade.  One of the reasons why I thought this book might be an interesting read is because of the time period the novel is set in, which is the summer of 1972.  I, myself, was born in 1970 and I enjoy reading books and my granddaughter and I REALLY enjoy watching films that are set in the 1960-1970's, such as ""My Girl"", ""Now & Then"", ""Pleasantville"",  ""Mermaids"" and other films in that genre. That said, I would DEFINITELY recommend that this book be read WITH a child until they are at least 12-13 because of some of the thematic elements such as mental health institutions in the 70's, disease (this novel deals with Multiple Sclerosis in a young mother) depression, dreams unfulfilled, suicide and death.  The characters in the novel are ""fleshed-out"" and the story itself is a ""tearjerker""...  Be ready to answer tough questions from the child you either read this book with or give to as a gift.  ""Nest"" covers multitudes of human frailties experienced in life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZSYNBAQNHQO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385386079#wasThisHelpful","R1ZSYNBAQNHQO2","APDPA11IZPYLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDPA11IZPYLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my 2nd ""Juice Beauty"" product review.  I have combo skin and am 44 years old. I have used this product four times for 10 minutes each in the last two weeks as recommended. Directions say, ""apply a generous amount to face, neck and decolletage area."" I would NOT suggest a generous amount.  A dab'll do ya!  I put a very thin, even layer over my face and neck.  In about 2 minutes, there is a tingling, but it was not uncomfortable at all.  My skin was a bit red after rinsing but quickly returned.  I did ALL of my ""peels"" at night so if I did have a bad reaction, it would hopefully be gone in the morning.  I had no lasting side effects.That said, this product is a bit pricey for me, but if you don't mind spending the money, it's worth a try.  I highly doubt that this product is going to diminish my sun/dark spots as I have tried numerous and more expensive over-the-counter products to do so, and have yet to find that ""magic in a bottle""...

"I recently purchased a new Dell desktop and needed to transfer all settings and files from my HP laptop, both of which are running Windows 7.  Of course, the first place I go when looking for anything is Amazon and was SO pleased to find they had this Belkin Easy Transfer Cable, Prime Eligible and  at a GREAT price.  Please be aware that this transfer cable will ONLY work with Pentium Processor based computers.I own many Belkin computer/camera items and Belkin products always meet or exceed my expectations. This transferred all of my files, settings, contacts etc. and even has an automated report. Once your transfer is complete, a  report is generated, providing a view of everything that was transferred to your new computer. Because of possible incompatibility and licensing issues, some programs and applications may not be transferred to the new computer. The utility provides a list of all programs and applications installed on the old computer along with links to latest versions of the programs to install on your new computer. Please also be aware that if you are trying to transfer anything between a computer and Windows 8.1 this cable will not work.  There are LOTS and LOTS of 1 and 2 star reviews on this cable and believe me, it is NOT Belkin or Amazon's fault.  The product description CLEARLY states how and when this cable will work.  Now, you may use this between a Windows 8.1 computer as long as you UNINSTALL the 8.1 update, roll back to Windows 8, complete your transfer and then RE-INSTALL the 8.1 update.I am very happy with this product and give it a HARDY 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32U4FZK1F12MD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0093HCIQ0#wasThisHelpful","R32U4FZK1F12MD","APDPA11IZPYLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDPA11IZPYLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first ""Juice Beauty"" product and I was interested in it for the organic/natural ingredients.  I am 44 years old, have sensitive/combination skin and if I have a break out or a pimple it will ALWAYS be in the ""tee"" zone.  I have used this product nightly, after cleansing and toning and ONLY at night.I can ONLY recommend NIGHTLY use because the serum DOES leave a shiny, slick & sticky appearance to your face as other reviewers have stated. I haven't dared try and use this under my liquid foundation or make-up as I think it would make a huge mess on your face.I love the fact that it has a dropper delivery and it is in glass and not plastic. I also love the fact that you only have to use a TINY bit to cover your whole face. Some reviewers have ""dinged"" this product on its price, but you use SO VERY little, it is bound to last quite a long time.All in all, a nice, sensitive, organic, natural, no scent way to clear blemishes...","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESIS6BIBHQ1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AV8MLW#wasThisHelpful","R1ESIS6BIBHQ1F","APDPA11IZPYLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDPA11IZPYLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these 3 crocheted storage baskets and thought they would be a bit more rigid than floppy.  If you fold the top over to form a lip they tend to hold their shape much better. I nest one of the small baskets in the large one to create a divided large basket and use the other small basket by itself.  Too bad they don't come in 3 different sizes as it would have been nice to have a medium sized basket instead of 1 large and 2 small.

"Great Idea! I received this T-Shirt frame as I wanted to frame my 2012 Elton John Concert tee.  This frame has a nice, sturdy construction and is made well.  It has a sawtooth hanger on the back for easy installation and is available in either black or white.  Included are folding instructions which are very easy to follow.However, this t-shirt display will only show part of a design as the measurements inside are quite small (21-1/2 Inch by 19-1/2 Inch).  You can really only use this for an adult small - large size with a shirt that has a centered screen-print design.I think this product would be better if they were manufacture in sizes according to the size of your t-shirt you want to frame.  Shelling out  $30 for a frame (kinda pricey, if you ask me) the shirt you want to memorialize SHOULD fit.With this in mind, this frame would be better suited to a child's favorite shirt or sport jersey.  Just make sure to measure the shirt before ordering this particular frame.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XRJPVLFXESEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAMAV5Q#wasThisHelpful","R1XRJPVLFXESEJ","APDPA11IZPYLN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APDPA11IZPYLN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This adjustable Mesa/Aegis Trail Riding Helmet has met all of my expectations! I ordered a Black LG/XLG and is fits PERFECTLY! It features a dial fit retention system in the back of the helmet and is permanently anchored. It adjusts easily for a sure, secure and VERY comfortable fit! I also LOVE the black rubberized coating as it prevents scratches and peeling. The three-point super soft nylon harness system is fully adjustable and has a quick snap buckle.  The Velcro insert/head pads remove for cleaning and replace in a snap.The 6 mesh-covered aeration vents provide ample airflow and keep out bugs and debris. It has a non-adjustable and supportive visor.

"I got this game as a promotional item to play with my meetup groups, since I am a Meetup Organizer. So I did not have to pay for it. I got if after I played it with others in a meetup group. It's a combination of Uno and Apples to Apples. You're given 10 cards that have either a topic or a letter of the alphabet on them. One of each is showing on the table for everyone to see. Let's say that ""Disney Move"" and the letter B is showing. On your turn, you must switch either the topic ort he letter. Let's say you decide to switch the letter to F. So you must now name a Disney movie starting with F. Frozen and Fantasia come to mind. I'm sure there are others. So when you change, make sure you can come up with an answer. If you do, you don't have to pick another card. First player to get rid o all of their cards wins.There are special cards in the deck. One allows you to get rid of two cards, another allows you to switch your card with someone else. Also, if you're too slow, the 10 second timer will decide your fate.

"I got this game last year and brought it to my Word Games Group. Two teams compete with coming up with an answer to a topic with six different subjects. You turn the spinner to determine what your topic is. The topic appears in a small window.  Let's say the topic is New York. Teams go back and forth trying to come up with answer in six different categories containing that topic,  including TV, Movies, Music, People, Places and Things. You cannot pick the same category you picked last time or that the other team just picked ahead of you. On later turns, you can go back to them. Once you give an answer, it cannot be used again in other categories. Once either team reaches the bullseye in the middle, the category ends and teams get the points they earned. First team to get 100 points wins.It was a little confusing the first time we tried it, but we got the hang of it after a couple of rounds. The game comes with black and white markers to place where teams gave an answer. One team uses the black markers, the other team uses white. We found it helpful to place these markers on the categories to keep track of which ones teams last gave an answer in. You may want to get a 30 second timer from another game to speed things along. Teams can take a long time to deliberate. Other than that, this is a good team game that will make you think.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R244ZCZ6GZPN5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3F2NOE#wasThisHelpful","R244ZCZ6GZPN5J","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Questions are challenging and you probably won't get the answer on the first clue, but once in a while, it's possible. Questions are formatted like Match Game, where you fill in the blank. Like ""In 1972, terrorists broke into ________."" Someone in our group knew the answer was the Munich Olympics. More likely than not, you'll have to pick other clues to help you. The first clue will get you five points, each subsequent clue is worth one less point. A maximum of four players or teams can compete. Each team gets their own questions. First player/team to get 30 points or more wins.The game comes with four booklets that cover the 50s through the 2000s The die roll determines what decade you get and in some cases, what other teams choose for you.

"I got this game real cheap at Barnes & Noble. Sadly, Discovery Bay Games shut down, but this was one of their better games. You're given an obscure place somewhere on Earth. You must write down the correct location or come up with a good bluff to convince others. You score points for every vote your answer gets. Places that have come up include Assumption, Diss, Smackass Gap, Bumpass, Pratt's Bottom, Big Ugly and the ever popular Peniscola. One person in our group actually knew Big Ugly was in West Virginia. Peniscola, by the way, is in Spain.Everyone writes down their answer. All the answers are then read, including the real one. Players then vote for what they think the right answer is. If you can bluff well, this game's for you. Plus you get to learn where unusually names places are in the world. The game comes with a cool looking 90 second timer. The only complaint I have about this game is that it did not have the map markers that the instruction booklet mentioned. Also, as in all writing games, you may have to deal with someone whose writing is not easily legible. Otherwise, it's a fun game where you can learn a thing or two.

"I got this package of two games from Amazon. I like 1 vs 100 and I've played that more often. I've cleared the board three times. The e are two games of 1 vs 100 - one where the dollar value increases by $500 with each question for each mob member you eliminate. Then there's the ""Big Money"" game where dollar values increase $1,000 for each question. There's a bonus question to increase your jackpot where a wrong answer will NOT eliminate you. There's also a feature where you have 30 seconds to answer five questions, and three correct answers increases your score. Like the TV show, the game has three helps. You might win them back depending on the special features and if you knock certain people out of the mob (the ones lit up in green). If you lose, you might be able to redeem yourself with a ""redemption question."" for less that what you had.Deal or No Deal plays pretty straight to the show. Pick cases and try to avoid the larger amounts. When the main game is over, there are special games and features for you to try out. Enough diversity to make the game interesting.The game does not have Bob Saget  or Howie Mandel to guide you through the rules and stuff, but the makers of this game have added enough features and bonuses to make up for that.

"I've had this game for years. On a whim, I decided to stick it in my PC this past Christmas. To my surprise, it worked with no problems. Considering this game is more than 10 years old, it was a bit of a shock, albeit a pleasant one. You can play with up to six others, though getting everyone around the computer may be tricky. You determine how many humans and rounds (up to seven each). You can have more or less of certain questions, like science, for example. You can bank on human questions only or set it so you can bank no matter whose turn it is. Play is almost exactly like the TV show. A maximum of seven rounds, dollar values are tripled (or ""trebled"" as Anne says) for the sixth round. And yes, Anne does her quips and insults, just like the TV show.You can choose from up to 24 CGIs as to who you want to play as. A varied assortment of ages and backgrounds, from a 17-year-old high school student to a 66-year-old retiree. You can play a single game or do the tournament challenge. The computer takes the roles of non humans. If you're playing solo, be prepared to get voted off if you have a bad round. But this game is incredible in that I have not caught a repeat question and it moves at a good pace.Anne Robinson has since retired from hosting the show in England. It only lasted a couple of years here in the colonies. This is a game that will test your knowledge and nerves. From someone who loves trivia, this is one of my favorite games. If you can find it, get it. You need to have the disc in your PC to play it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S50UWIPAPMVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F9J7KK#wasThisHelpful","R3S50UWIPAPMVV","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally got to play this game this past holiday season. Like Hollywood Squares and Millionaire, you create a profile that keeps track of your progress. A solo game pits you against two computer players. The first few games, the computer players are no real threat. They will mostly not buzz in for questions or give a wrong answer. As you win more games, the computer players get smarter and more aggressive. They start giving right answers more often and will start buzzing in to answer questions. They might also pass their spins to you. If you have less spins or money, you can pass your spins to them.Format is based on the 80s version of the show that Peter Tomarken hosted. There's two rounds each of four questions and the prize board round. Player with the most spins and most in cash/prizes goes last, respectively, in the prize board round. The prize board is almost an exact duplicate of the show. Computer play seems to be random. They can pass spins and they do get whammies occasionally. You as the human player can always decide whether to play or pass your spins. Passed spins go to the computer player with the higher amount. So far, I've won 10 games. If you lose a game, you can play it over till you win. Overall a fun and challenging game to play. You need to have the disc in your PC to play it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNLNX3BPMX8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002FQIPRM#wasThisHelpful","R3UNLNX3BPMX8S","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered this game for Christmas. It follows the 2010 version where the dollar amounts for the lower valued questions was increased. The ""hot seat"" is there, and the CGI representing you is sitting in it. You're guaranteed money at the $5,000 and $25,000 levels The money amounts are as follows - $500, 1K, 2K, 3K, 5K, 7.5K, 10K, 12.5K, 15K, 25K, 50K, 100K, 250K, 500K and of course $1 million! Your three lifelines are the audience, phone a friend and ""double dip"" where you can give a second answer to a question if your first answer is wrong. If your first answer is right however, you've lost that lifeline - you can't get it back.You have time limits in each of the three rounds. 15 seconds for the first five questions, 30 seconds for the next five and 45 seconds for the last five. Any time saved or left over gets to be used for the million dollar question - if you make it that far. If you don't give an answer in the time limit, the game ends and you leave with the last amount you won. Graphics and game play are very good but the show has since changed its format.You get little bonuses and such as the game accumulates your winnings. New lifelines, wardrobe changes and such. You don't have the stick the disc in each time, so it's stored and saved in your PC the first time you do it. After your lifelines are gone, you have the option to walk away with your current winnings. But the computer will NOT show you the answer to the current question if you choose this option. I find that annoying as all Hell. The questions get harder. I think I've seen the $100K question twice in the 20 or so times I've played. So it won't be easy, but overall, this is a fun game for those who like a mental challenge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FIYHZXLL9FUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TNH1SI#wasThisHelpful","R2FIYHZXLL9FUS","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A correct answer earns you an X, a wrong answer gives O the square, unless it gives you a win. As Peter Marshall used to say ""the third square you have to earn yourself."" In the event three-in-a-row is not possible, five squares will get you a win. Two out of three games wins the match. The bonus round consists of 90 seconds to try and answer nine Q&As. In most cases, this is enough time, but a really long question can cut it close. A few times, I got all the questions right or got only one wrong, which assures you of winning the $20,000 bonus.The are no zingers from the CGIs, the actual celeb clips have them. There are four celebs featured, one for five shows each. They are Brad Garrett (1st week), Kathy Griffin (2nd), Jeffery Tambor (3rd) and Matrtin Mull (4th). That's a total of 20 games. After that, you go back and start over. The questions have not repeated - maybe two or three times max. I.ve been replaying games I lost or where I won but didn't get the bonus.A couple of other things. The game allows for only one player, and you're always X. You see your questions but not the O questions. You just hear and see that O got it right or wrong. Tom Bergeron is the voice that guides you through the rules and reads the questions. It would be nice  if there were more than 20 games and a human two player option. Other than that, this a good reproduction of the show. Plus you don't need to put the disc in to play. Your computer should store and save the info the first time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AC5J5JCNSGS1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SEUN02#wasThisHelpful","R3AC5J5JCNSGS1","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have the cassette and CD version of this collection. It's from the 90s and features artists on the Columbia/Sony label over the years. It goes from the 40s to the early 90s The are different artists for each song, though Andy Williams is heard on two songs - The Most Wonderful Time and I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day. Quite a variety.Artists range from Burl Ives, Peggy Lee and Rosemary Clooney to Johnny Cash, Grandpa Jones and Willie Nelson to Bobby Vinton, Patti Page and Doris Day to Gladys Knight, Elmo and Patsy and New Kids on the Block. Carol Burnett and Liberace are here too.  Interestingly. Johnny Mathis. is not heard on this collection at all, and Lord knows he's recorded his fair share of Christmas songs for Columbia/Sony. Some earlier artists like Nelson Eddy and Arthur Godfrey are missing as well.

"I had both of Mr. Goulet's Christmas albums on cassette. So I was glad when I found out they were both on CD. The real bonus, however, are the three songs he did with then wife Carol Lawrence. They are a snappier version of ""Christmas Waltz"" plus ""Angels . . Heard on High"" and ""Carol of the Bells."" I heard those songs and said Wow, they should've done a whole album of Christmas songs together. The voice comes through crisp and clear. It doesn't sound like the songs have been altered with reverb or anything like that.Solo efforts from Mr. Goulet that I like are Panis Angelicus (what a voice!), O Holy Night, Ave Maria, Home For The Holidays, Little Jesus (Rocking), On This Noel and The Christmas Waltz. There's also a promo of him doing a plug for Christmas Seals on the mono version of This Christmas I Spend With You, which was chosen as their song of the year that year (1964).These songs are all from the 60s, but they still hold up today, even though some were done 50 years ago. A great collection to add to your holiday CDs, and for Mr. Goulet's fans to remember him by. Highly recommended and amazon.com has it for a reasonable price. .","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIABQ2UBDEEP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF4PNLE#wasThisHelpful","RIABQ2UBDEEP6","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great CD that carries on the memory of one of the biggest band leaders of the 20th century. Starting out with Sleigh Ride, we get to hear Jingle Bells, Silver Bells, Rudolph, Frosty, I'll Be Home For Christmas and Silent Night, along with a couple of medleys. Glenn Miller disappeared on a flight in 1944 and was never seen or heard from again. If he were still with us, a Christmas album of his would pretty much sound like this CD.

"Of the 12 songs on this CD, Diana Ross is heard on six of them. The others are done by the London Symphony Orchestra and the King.s Singers. Tracks I like are Go Tell it on the Mountain, I Heard the Bells (on Xmas Day), The First Noel and O Little Town of Bethlehem. The latter two songs were recorded by Diana back in the 60s for her Christmas album with the Supremes. They didn't make the album, but they were heard when Motown (Universal) opened its ""vaults"" and released them on subsequent CDs.If you want to hear more of Diana Ross doing Christmas songs, get her ""A Very Special Season"" CD.

"I've had this DVD game for close to 10 years. I thought I reviewed it, but oh well. This version of TPIR DVD game is by far better than the 2nd edition. First, it has 12 games, including the most popular game, Plinko. The 2nd version has only eight games. Second, up to six can play. Markers and score boards are included. Next, if you just want to play the games and not deal with the ""item up for bids"" portion, you can do that. Great if you're alone. The 2nd edition does not allow this. The Showcase Showdown and Showcase portions of the game are similar to the TV show., except that the showcase features still pictures of the prizes. You get a choice of six bids. Beware - some of the bids may be OVER the showcase price.Games included besides Plinko are Golden Road, Cliff Hangers, Danger Price, Five Price Tags (True or False) Grand Game, Lucky Seven, Most Expensive, Pass The Buck, Push Over, Safe Crackers and Shell Game. The voices of Rich Fields, Rod Roddy and Burton Richardson are heard describing the prizes. Todd Newton guides you through the overall rules of games and such.So much for the good. Now the bad. You must keep track of your winnings. The game does not do that for you. The big wheel ALWAYS starts at $1.00 and there's no real way of controlling it other than pressing your controller button. Bob Barker was the host when this DVD came out. He's not here at all. He would have given this game authenticity. He probably would have commanded a high fee (rightfully so) and he's proven to be difficult to deal with in recent years.  But overall this DVD game has good reproductions of the games it has. I would recommend this game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29BYSVYZJW3RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LFEPHM#wasThisHelpful","R29BYSVYZJW3RE","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this game around the time it came out. Gene Rayburn is your host (natch), and it features celebs and questions from the actual show. However, a few things differ from the actual show. For one thing, only five celebs are featured in each game, not six. Another thing, while Rayburn is shown with actual clips, the celebs are only shown with still pictures with the audio. The Super Match comes at the end of the first round, and the one with the most matches at the end of the second round gets to play the ""Head to Head"" match with one celeb. The celeb differs with every game, and it's not always Richard Dawson.It looks like the games used are from the ""Match Game '74"" era. The questions aren't as wordy or naughty as they became later on in the series. There are 25 games included on the DVD. Once you go through them, you start repeating. Since the answers are from the show, they don't change. So you can memorize them, which makes the replay value of the games predictable. If you're a fan of the 70s Match Game, you'll enjoy playing this. It's largely a trip down memory lane, and they have a lot of celebs on the clips.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKN0WNXMPIZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F1F2GQ#wasThisHelpful","R1YKN0WNXMPIZ3","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this game for a few years. You can play solo or with another player. When there are two playing, the first person plays their entire game, then the second person goes. There's no alternating turns, which I think would've been better. This means the second person knows what score they need to beat before they even pick their first suitcase. I agree with other reviewers that the game moves a bit slowly. However it is a good reproduction of the format of the show, with Howie and the banker guiding you. It looks like they're using the actual DOND set.

"An almost forgotten holiday gem from the Rankin-Bass production company. Originally released as a feature film in 1967, Boris Karloff is the voice of Baron Von Frankenstein, who is retiring and must choose a successor from among his family and monster friends. Phyllis Diller voices the Bride of Frankenstein and calls her hubby ""Fang."" Other familiar monsters appear as well. There are songs and reminders of other movies mixed in here, including King Kong and the ending to ""Some Like it Hot.""This may have been the last thing Karloff did before he died. The video is a little over 90 minutes and there are some ""bonuses"" included. Done in the ""stop motion"" style of other Rankin-Bass features, the video is a nice ""treat"" for kids and adults alike.

"I finally got around to playing this game in my trivia meetup. There are five things on each card. You must arrange these five things in some order, like smallest to biggest or earliest to most recent. You receive different colored markers to do this.  Depending on where you are on the game board, you will move ahead one or two spaces for each answer you get right. You may also move back zero, one or two spaces for each answer you get wrong. Get to the finish first and you win.Topics are varied, which is good. One bad thing is that the topic card must be passed around from person to person to see the five items. You also have to be careful about not revealing the correct order on the back of the card. Up to six players.

"I know the person who created this game, Gil Hova. But I still had to buy this game. I did, albeit on sale, but I consider it a good buy. The game can be played by one to five people. Score sheets, letters, bag, board, 45 second timer, pencils and instructions are included. I'll try to explain the rules.Letters are put into the bag. All the letters, except the five vowels are included. Letters like Q, X and Z are worth more points. There are always eight letters on the board. Two letters will change with each turn. You cannot have more than two of the SAME LETTER or two letters with bonus points on the board at any time. Redraw the letter(s) and put the unuseable letters back in the bag. On your turn, try to make a word that uses the most letters on the game board. The board consists of two rows with four letters each. Going left to right, the letters in the rows are worth 4, 4, 3 and 2 points, respectively. At the end of each turn, the two letters in the right column (2 points) come off the board. All the other letters are moved one row to the left. Two new letters are taken out of the bag and go in the left column.There is a rule about interrupting another player's turn if you thing you have a fantastic word. We found this rule to be confusing and making the game harder to score. At the advice of game creator Gil Hova, we just don't use that rule. The timer should be used if someone is taking too long, or if one person score a word in the two player version. This is all according to the instructions. There are separate instructions and score sheets for one, two, three, and 4 or 5 player games.Overall, I like games like this. It poses a challenge and it forces you to think. One thing you'll experience is that when it's someone else's turn, you'll come up with a terrific word that scores more than the person whose turn it is. This game is out of print, so you'll probably have to get it on amazon.com or some other website like it.

"This game comes with scoring devices and foam rubber fingers - oh goodie! You will use both of these during the course of the game - and there's six of each. Assembly is required when you first purchase the game. You have to fold and snap the scoring devices into place. The foam fingers are ready to go. Here's how the game works:Everyone takes a turn asking a question. There are two types of questions - Have you ever and Would you ever. There are three questions on each card. The player reading chooses the question they want to ask and read it for the other players. Players then take their scoring devices and set it for the answer that applies to them, either never, once, sometimes or always.Then comes the fun part. Everyone now takes their finger - the foam one - and points it at the person they feel is guilty or most likely of doing what the question asked. You CAN'T point the finger at yourself. If you point at the most popular person (the one who gets the most fingers pointed at them), you score whatever their scoring device was set at. You can score up to three points. You then set your scoring device for the appropriate amount of points. First player to get 21 points wins.Some questions have a blank which you can fill in with anything you want - uh oh. The questions are on the mildly provocative side - nothing outright obscene. The game is recommended for ages 12 and over. This is one of those games where you have an advantage if you know the other players. Even then, you may learn a thing or two, and the questions may spark conversations.A fun game that'll get a discussion going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14HPB9M5SDFQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDBZ9IA#wasThisHelpful","R14HPB9M5SDFQL","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Someone I know has this game. He brings it to my Trivia Meetup group every now and then. The game has seven categories. Five that I can remember are TV, Movies, Music, Sports and Nature. You roll a die or dice (can't remember off hand) and move on the board. Where you land determines your category. When we play, we usually agree on a number of questions (like 10) to answer. First player or team to reach that wins the game.The game was made by Barnes & Noble (of course, of course), so that's where you must go to purchase it, or online. This game was made around 2010, and I believe it's out of print. Speaking of print, I find the print on the cards real small, smaller than the Trivial Pursuit cards.

A decent compilation of holiday tunes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIWLESZCRLUL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000AFIU#wasThisHelpful","RIWLESZCRLUL2","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""complete"" CD covers ALL of Doris' holiday recordings. The first 12 songs are from her 1964 Christmas album. Songs I like from these are Toyland, Let it Snow, Be a Child at Christmas Time and The Christmas Waltz. From the rest of the CD, I like Here Comes Santa Claus, Deck The Halls, Old St. Nicholas and Silent Night.There are TWO versions each of Silver Bells and The Christmas Song. A great CD to listen to while sitting by the fireplace and drinking hot chocolate or a spiked eggnog. The freckled blonde has a helluva voice. I believe she's retired now. Hope she's doing well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RC55S2ZGTES7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0091N0FBQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RC55S2ZGTES7","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this CD last year and finally got around to hearing it. Jingle Bells sounds lively with the ""I like a sleigh ride"" refrain. Happy Holiday sounds different from Andy Williams' version but it holds up. White Christmas, The Christmas Waltz, Winter Wonderland and Little Drummer Boy are nicely done. Some songs you don't hear that often are The Star Carol, Christmas Carousel, The Christmas Spell and Song at Midnight.16 songs, and Peggy adds wonderful vocal touches to all of them. Good CD to put you in the holiday mood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19B7JZ6V916HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HT36JG#wasThisHelpful","R19B7JZ6V916HJ","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection features several hits you always hear on the radio at holiday time. Bing, Nat, Elvis, Eartha, Aretha, Johnny and Judy are all here. A couple of great instrumentals, with Kenny G and Herb Alpert giving us Silver Bells and Jingle Bells, respectively. Whitney and the Gospel choir practically reach Heaven with Joy to the World. A couple of new songs add nicely to the mix. Carly Simon's ""The Night Before Christmas"" is NOT based on the poem of the same name by Clement Moore. Songs For a Winter's Night by Sarah McLachlin is another rare holiday gem.

"The only JB Christmas song I had previously heard is Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto. I had no idea the Godfather of Soul had released Christmas albums. You learn something new every day. JB takes on some old favorites like Merry Christmas Baby and Please Come Home For Christmas with original material, a lot of which he wrote. Just a few words into each song, and you know it's gotta be JB singing. Songs I liked were Go Power at Christmas Time, Soulful Christmas and Christmas in Heaven.Ironically, JB died on Christmas Day 2006.

"I originally got this on cassette back in 2000. I finally got around to getting the CD version of it. It's hard to believe Charlotte was 14 years old when this compilation was recorded. She sings like a seasoned pro well beyond her years. A value packed selection featuring 19 songs, with some rarities. Ding Dong Merrily on High, Gabriel's Message and Lo How a Rose E'er Blooming are not heard that often. but Charlotte makes them shine. She adds wonderful vocals to whatever she does. The duet with Billy Gilman, Dream a Dream, is nice but Charlotte is the star attraction here. She didn't need any duets.Favorite songs of mine are Little Drummer Boy, Ding Dong Merrily on High, The Coventry Carol, Joy to the World, Ave Maria (Gounod), Gabriel's Message and Silent Night.

"The Manhattan Transfer (MT for short) have been together since the 70s, so that makes it 40 years, give or take. I enjoyed listening to this CD traveling to see friends and family on Thanksgiving weekend. Jingle Bells starts the CD out very well. On all tracks, the voices are loud and clear, soothing and not overbearing. My favorite tracks besides Jingle Bells are White Christmas, Christmas Time is Here (from A Charlie Brown Christmas), Good King Wenceslas, Toyland, I'll Be Home For Christmas and Christmas is Coming. The latter is a rare song that I've only heard Bing Crosby and The Brothers Four sing.My only complaint about this CD is that it's too short - just 10 songs. I wish they had done a few more. Other than that, a nice CD with a couple of songs you don't hear that often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q1BLBFXS7ADI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I0QJH0#wasThisHelpful","R3Q1BLBFXS7ADI","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this CD back in 2010 when it first came out. Annie is not shy or demure. She sings at full power - nothing held back on this interesting assortment of holiday tunes. Some tunes are not as popular as others. Lullay Lullay (The Coventry Carol), In the Bleak Midwinter, The Holly and The Ivy and When Joseph Was Walking (The Cherry Tree Carol) are not heard as often as God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman, The First Noel and O Little Town of Bethlehem. The latter song has a completely different musical arrangement from what I'm used to hearing, but the lyrics are the same and Annie pulls it off.Annie comes through loud and clear, almost like she's angry. She's definitely put her own spin of this collection of 12 songs. Most of them come off well, a few of them sound too ""intense"" for me. An interesting tidbit - Annie Lennox was born on Christmas Day. Overall, this CD is a collection of holiday songs that's different - mostly in a good way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8VDBFBIMNE0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FW64B16#wasThisHelpful","RX8VDBFBIMNE0","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD, Susan's second holiday effort is better than the first. On ""The Gift,"" Susan sounded like she was straining her voice. On this CD, she sounds more natural. Also, ALL the songs on this CD are holiday related, whereas ""The Gift"" had a couple of non-holiday songs. All of the songs here are great but the standout is her duet with Elvis on ""O Come All Ye Faithful."" I predict this song will become a holiday staple on the radio for years to come, much like ""Little Drummer Boy"" by Bing and David Bowie.Little Drummer Boy on this CD sounds fresh and new, especially with the bagpipes. Susan teams up for Johnny Mathis for ""When a Child is Born,"" a song Johnny has recorded solo and with Gladys Knight. Susan and Johnny play off each other well. Each song on this CD holds up on its own. Susan has one of those voices that comes across as sincere and powerful.

"I believe this is Johnny's sixth Christmas CD, or album if you prefer. His first one was way back in 1958. On this CD, he teams up with other top singers for some holiday caroling. Billy Joel, Natalie Cole, Jim Brickman, Gloria Estefan and Susan Boyle are just a few of the names that were chosen to pair up with Johnny. The result is more memorable music from the man who is arguably the best living interpreter of Christmas songs.Billy Joel is a rarity for a Christmas song. Susan Boyle and Johnny were a perfect match for Do You Hear What I Hear, which Johnny originally recorded back in the 60s. He may not be able to hit the notes as high, but he can still hold and phrase lyrics like a pro. He also tackles some newer songs. Merry Christmas Darling and Decorate The Night were originally done by The Carpenters and Dobie Gray, respectively. Count Your Blessings was written by Irving Berlin and sung by Rosemary Clooney, among others.Johnny still looks and sounds good. He still sells out when he appears in person. By the way, if you ever get a chance to see Johnny perform in person - go! If you can't, this CD is the next best thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12C7UQAJ0EZTB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EULQJXM#wasThisHelpful","R12C7UQAJ0EZTB","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This CD was recorded by Julie in 1982 when she was with Columbia/Sony Records. Most of the 14 songs are ballads with a slow tempo, the type of song Julie does best. O Come All Ye Faithful picks up steam though once it gets going. Other songs I like on this CD are What Child is This, Rocking, Away in a Manger, Patapan and Silent Night. The songs are a mix of well known and not so well known. Of course, Julie adds wonderful vocals to any song she does.

"I got this game as a promotional copy from Buffalo Games to try out with my meetup groups that I run in NYC. It's gone over well all four times I've run it. It's a twist on the Apples to Apples format, but it's fun and easy to learn. Here's how it works:There are celebrity cards with names of the rich, famous and otherwise prominent, past and present, real and fictional. There are situation cards that list a scenario for each round, like ""Which celebrity would you want to friend on Facebook?"" In each round, someone picks a situation card and reads it aloud, Everyone, including the reader submits a card that has a famous name on it. Cards are then placed on the table for all to see. Cards are then eliminated one by one, starting with the person who read the situation card. The person whose card was eliminated picks the next card to eliminate, and so on till only one card remains. The person submitting that card gets the situation card. Depending on how many players there are, the first one to get a certain number of situation cards wins. According to the rules, up to eight can play. You could probably squeeze in one or two more if need be.This is a fun game that's easy to learn and everyone plays at the same time in all the rounds. This is a new game, so the list of famous people are very current. Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, Snoop Lion (Snoop Dogg) and others are mixed in with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Thomas Jefferson. This game makes name dropping fun. By the way, this game was created by Reiner Knizia, who's known mostly for his strategy and ""Euro"" games. Give this game a try if you want to spice up your next party game night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26GR1X1KQSVAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BV15H14#wasThisHelpful","R26GR1X1KQSVAX","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"TP has been around for over 30 years, but the folks at Hasbro keep coming up with different twists to keep it fresh. This 2013 version has different rules from other past versions. Here they are in detail:Each question in the game can now win you a wedge (or piece). No more having to land on a ""headquarters"" to win a wedge. Some people have played the game this way for years, but this version makes it officialYou can ASK A FRIEND if you don't know the answer. If they're right and you go with it, you and the friend EACH get a wedge. Like ""phone a friend"" TP style. Since the friend can get a wedge, there's a motivation to help you rather than screw you over. You can accept or reject the friend's answer in all cases. The ask a friend does NOT apply in the WILD CARD spaces.The WILD CARD spaces let you pick your category. On these, after hearing the question, if you think you know the answer you can say GOT IT. If more than one person says it, go in the order of who said it first. The person choosing the question gets to answer first. On multiple choice questions, only the first GOT IT shouter gets to answer. The GOT IT rule does not apply to 50/50 questions, since the answer is obvious if the first person gets it wrong.According to the rules, ""the first player or team to collect six wedges by successfully answering questions"" wins. If I interpret that correctly, you no longer have to go for the ""game winning question."" to win. This speeds up the game, but I know some die hard TP fans will not like this.The categories on the cards have symbols instead of letters. They are:Blue - PlacesPink - EntertainmentYellow - EventsPurple - The ArtsGreen - Nature & TechnologyOrange - Sports & HobbiesSince you can win a wedge on all questions, the wedges are now all generically grey, but the tokens are all in the colors of the game. The game comes with only 1,200 questions, so your chances of hearing a repeat question will come sooner. The questions are in smaller print than previous TP versions, which I find annoying.  The game seems to have a balance of easy and hard questions. This version of TP is a bit friendlier, but purists may not like it as much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6EVPAJV7F3WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4NJS2G#wasThisHelpful","R6EVPAJV7F3WL","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The game from Hasbro Gaming, features cards with quotes on one side and pictures on the other. A special die tells you whether to lay out pics or quotes along with the amount you have to put up. You start with $10,000. You have to put the stickers on the die the first time you play.Everyone gets $10K, five cards with pics & quotes and one ""funny"" and ""die"" chip. Players in turn roll the die. If it says lay out three pics, players will submit quotes and vice versa. Each player then submits a pic or quote on ONE of the three cards on the table. After everyone submits, players vote on the ""funny"" card and the ""die"" card. You place your chip face down and you can't vote for your own. The player who submitted the pic or quote with the most funny chips gets all the money in the pot. In case of a tie, players vote on the cards that tied. Players submitting tied cards don't vote since they can't vote for their own and those votes cancel each other out.After the winner is decided and paid, discard all the used cards and replenish you deck so that you have five cards. You should have five cards each time someone rolls the die. The person to left of the last die roller rolls next.Play continues until one player runs out of money. At that point, players count their money. Most money wins. In ties, you can declare a tie or do a sudden death thing where those players submit a pic or quote and the others vote on which is funnier.Overall, an enjoyable game with a nice twist on the ""Apples"" theme. The game comes with ""joker cards"" where you can write in your own quotes and submit your own pictures. There is also a disclaimer stating that some pics and quotes might not be suitable for kids under 13. Up to six can play, game takes about a half hour to play. It's available at Toys R Us and other fine stores.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPQTS00Q1P7OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8VHJGQ#wasThisHelpful","RPQTS00Q1P7OY","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this book a couple of years ago when it first came out. Johnny Olson was best known for his long-time association with Goodson-Todman as their main announcer for their game shows for over 25 years, but he did so much more in both TV and radio. Author Randy West gives detailed accounts of how Johnny took on all sorts of jobs and how he had an effect on those he worked with as well as the final product of the show itself. Nobody said anything negative of him. In the world of show biz, that's practically unheard of.The book is an amazing account of covering a man who made a name for himself by the late 60s. He was ready to take it easy when Goodson-Todman relocated him to work in California for what would be the busiest and most productive years of his life. It was all really unexpected to him. He had a bought a farm in West Virginia and commuted regularly to CA to do his shows. Through it all, he had an energy level and work ethic of a man in his 20s. I remember seeing him at The Price is Right and Match Game, running around the place and dancing like a teenager during his audience warm-ups, and he was in his 60s at the time.Johnny O was the best game show announcer there was. The Price is Right had a HUGE hole to fill when he died in 1985. Ironically, Johnny was on his way to a ""Price"" taping when he felt ill and pulled his car over. So he went out ""with his boots on"" so to speak. If you get GSN, the Game Show Network on your cable TV provider, you can still hear Johnny O on Match Game every morning. If you want to know all about the man, this book definitely does him justice.

"Bill Cullen's career as a radio and TV host and personality is one for the books. He hosted more game shows than anyone else and made any game show interesting to watch by just being on it, either hosting or playing. And through it all, he came across as a regular guy with no scandals or backstage drama, like a few other hosts. This book gives a detailed story of Cullen's life from his youth in Pittsburgh PA to his last days in California.As a high school student, I used to attend tapings of shows with Cullen in New York City in the 70s. Shows like Three on a Match, To Tell The Truth, Winning Streak, The $25,000 Pyramid and the ill-fated Blankety Blanks and Pass The Buck. Cullen lived in NYC till 1978 when he moved to California. I got to talk to him out in the parking lot for a few minutes during a Love Experts taping out there.The author does an excellent job of covering Cullen's extensive career. You wonder where he found time to do all he did. Considering he had polio and walked with a limp (which is why you didn't see him walking on camera) and that he didn't look like Adonis. he beat the odds to cover a nearly 50-year career in entertainment. Though he was a top-notch host, his longest running shows were those where he was a panelist, namely I've Got a Secret and To Tell The Truth.Interesting tidbits about Cullen are covered here as well, like the advice Ralph Edwards gave him early in his career, why he ultimately turned down the Price is Right revival in the 70s, how he got to host The Jokers Wild and what he really thought of Milton Berle when he was a guest on Hot Potato.If you get GSN, the Game Show Network, you can still see Bill there every now and then as a guest on various game shows. If you really want to know about Bill Cullen, GET THIS BOOK. Nuff said. Amazon has it.

"I got Brian Setzer's ""Christmas Comes Alive"" CD, so that made me curious. I got this CD and ""Dig That Crazy Christmas"" for about $5.00 each at Best Buy. I got a GREAT buy for my money. The songs are mostly upbeat and range from familiar (Jingle Bells, Winter Wonderland, Sleigh Ride) to not-so-familiar (Cactus Christmas, The Amens, So They Say It's Xmas - the latter written by Brian Setzer).My two favorite songs on this CD are ""The Man With The Bag"" and the ""Nutcracker Suite.""

In the past decade he's become one of those people you hear on the radio in December, like Bing, Nat, Johnny, Andy, the Carpenters, Harry Connick Jr. and Mariah Carey. He takes familiar and not-so-familiar songs and gives them the ""swing"" treatment. He wrote a couple of songs on this CD, namely ""Santa Drives a Hot Rod,"" ""Hey Santa"" and ""Getting in the Mood"" - done to the beat of Glenn Miller's ""In the Mood."" ""My Favorite Things"" is an instrumental.The song range is quite varied.

"The classic album, originally released in 1959 (the year I was born) features songs you hear every year on the radio and in shopping malls. The songs still hold up well. Mostly familiar and upbeat songs on the secular side. What Child is This is the one exception to this, but like all the other songs, it sounds great. Jingle Bells, White Christmas, Here Comes Santa Claus - they're all here. I believe Christmas Bride is an original song, and ""Rudolph"" has a completely new verse that I haven't heard on any other version of it.This was Ray's first holiday album - the one that started it all, as it were.

"Once upon a time, when chorale singers were popular, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller and Ray Conniff were churning out mainstream and holiday albums that get radio play every year. This CD has 12 songs that will put you in the holiday spirit. My favorites are Here We Come a Caroling, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, Joy To The World, What Child is This?, O Tannenbaum and O Little Town of Bethlehem. Nice tunes tastefully done for any holiday party or activity.

"The songs on this CD are from Rosemary's days at Columbia. So these songs are from the 50s when she was in her 20s. She does her versions of Irving Berlin's White Christmas and Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep). She teams with Gene Autry for The Night Before Christmas and Look Out The Window. Other songs I like are Suzy Snowflake, Let's Give a Present to Santa, Snow and Happy Christmas Little Friend. A total of 11 songs (one has a reprise). Nice songs that have been remastered for a new generation of fans.Rosemary left us in 2002.

"Stevie recorded these songs in the 60s when he was a teenager. This CD features the 12 songs originally released along with two bonus tracks from the vaults, per Motown's marketing strategy. Three of the songs heard on the radio over the years are Someday at Christmas, What Christmas Means To Me and One Little Christmas Tree. The two bonus tracks are The Miracles of Christmas and Everyone's a Kid at Christmastime. The latter one is a bit upbeat and I like it better than the former. Familiar tunes like Silver Bells, The Christmas Song and The Little Drummer Boy are featured. The rest is mostly original material, though Twinkle Twinkle Little Me was first heard on the Supremes Christmas album.Amazingly, Motown never had Stevie do a Christmas album as an adult when his music career was thriving in the 70s and 80s. But this selection of songs still holds up. Only Stevie could do Ave Maria with a harmonica solo and make it sound so good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HCS1QGPTVHT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002XL2VG#wasThisHelpful","R1HCS1QGPTVHT6","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Percy Faith was one of the busiest musicians at one time conducting and producing albums for himself and other artists, Johnny Mathis among them. Of the selections, We Three Kings and I Saw Three Ships are my favorites, but all the selections are beautifully done and wonderfully orchestrated. It's like hearing a concert at Lincoln Center.

"Christopher Cross is probably best remembered for hits like Ride Like The Wind, Sailing and Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do). Those songs go back over 30 years. Cross has decided to go the holiday route. The selection is quite good. It starts out with one instrumental verse of Silent Night. It then moves to Christmastime is Here, from the Charlie Brown special. Chris contributes three originals, Does it Feel Like Christmas, A Dream of Peace at Christmastime and The Best Christmas. I've heard the latter before. Chris also takes on some tunes not often on Xmas CDs, Irving Berlin's Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep and O Come O Come Emmanuel.Chris adds great vocal touches and the CD flows smoothly from song to song. This CD apparently is a re-release and can be bought at budget prices. I recommend picking it up and adding it to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSLP5501VJ67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RCO64O#wasThisHelpful","R3MSLP5501VJ67","A1RUBF0FK78E5Y","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RUBF0FK78E5Y?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frank left us a whole legacy of music in general, but his Christmas collection is quite impressive. I believe he recorded holiday albums with Columbia, Capitol and Reprise. On this collection, Bing Crosby joins him on four songs, We Wish You The Merriest, Go Tell it on The Mountain, The Christmas Song and White Christmas, the latter after Bing says ""Don't just stand there."" His kids join him on I Wouldn't Trade Christmas, The 12 Days of Christmas and The Bells of Christmas (Greensleeves). The others all feature Frank front and center. A few selections you don't hear that often, like Christmas Memories, A Baby Just Like You and Whatever Happened to Christmas?

"This is the 55"" B2 model which has a different panel than all the other size panels. That includes models of the E and P series also.PROS:1. IPS panel mostly solves the narrow viewing angle of a typical VA panel (but see below),2. FALD (Full Array Local Dimming). Not a edge lit panel that usually suffers from flashlighting and bright spots (but see below),3. US based support (South Dakota). No worry about trying to converse with someone from who knows where,4. Direct input selection (with an optional programmable remote). No more cycling through the input list to use another device. This is a huge plus.5. Fast boot up (7 seconds) and fast channel changing unlike many other tuners,6. Ability to skip the channel search and add channels later without doing a full scan thus preventing unwanted stations to be skipped in the channel list.7. Generous advanced picture adjustments, (but no gamma adjustment),8. No unwanted 3D or other so called questionable 'features'CONS:1. The fine detail (especially noticeable with facial closeups and any scene with fine detail (grass for example) is lacking. Not a huge difference, but noticeable with side by side comparisons of numerous other sets. Setting the sharpness up to 60 partly solves the problem without adding excessive enhancement though many purists will frown doing this.2. Without the local dimming on, black levels will suffer with a IPS panel. But at least you don't have to be glued to one ""sweet spot"" with a VA panel.3. Local dimming will cause some 'odd effects' which are usually just noticed during 'dark scenes"" (nighttime shots and dimly lit indoor scenes),4. The only function available on the set itself is power and input selection. No column, channel and most important NO menu access. If your remote and/or IR receiver goes south you are out of luck, Bad place to cut corners,5. One combined composite/component shared input. Another bad idea to 'cut corners'. Many still have legacy equipment that need both types. At least provide one of each.6. The tuner signal level/condition indicator is buried under ""System Info"" instead of being available in the 'Info Bar' as it is for the WiFi connection and many other sets.7. Small remote, small buttons, small text that is hard to read, especially on the back side with the keyboard. The main side is not lighted which adds to the problems, but the keyboard side is. Where is the logic there??  Then add a short timeout of the backlight (3 seconds). If you aren't a typist, forget it unless you have decent lighting.8. Firmware updates are fully automatic which sounds good, but there is no notice that you are getting one and no easy way to stop it from happening. It is well known that firmware updates can cause new problems. Real bad idea. At least give the owner a choice of manual or auto updates.9. Slightly higher power consumption than some others (160 watts with the backlight on full, 100-120 watts in normal operation). Surely not a Plasma or a 4k set, but it is higher than many. (Yes, these 4k sets are the new power hogs).10. Poor stand. The metal base that is used is too thin which causes forward & backwards rocking when bumped. It doesn't appear unsafe, but there is no reason for this. Also, the stand has to be completely assembled to the set first before placing it on the table. With other sets,  their stand allows the panel to be lowered into place, then the screws are inserted. A far better design.11. The gray/silver plastic cover to that stand is cheap looking and distracting as is that trim piece around the bezel. The stand should not stand out visually.12. Lastly, as far as I can tell, part of the problem with damaged Vizio sets is the lack of depth to their boxes. They are too thin with insufficient packaging material protecting the panel. I was able to compare this set with a 60"" Sharp that were both boxed, on the floor of a local retailer. The Sharp was much larger. More so than just a larger panel. It looked like it was a 65"" set, not 60"". They have much thicker Styrofoam inserts than Vizio has..Some of these 'Cons' can, or should be fairly easy to fix. Many are just not fully thought out when these were disigned..Note about the reports of problems using wireless Ethernet. I had no problem with connectivity, but my router is only 15-20' away. I had no intention of using wireless due to reception issues and the hassle of security. Besides, running a Cat5e (or Cat6) cable isn't a big deal (if you know what you are doing). You never have to worry about interference of security issues.I can't believe some actually returned their set just because of WiFi problems. That's the same as returning a vehicle just because a radio station wasn't receivable..","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35O4T1C75ZRR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JP7OW9E#wasThisHelpful","R35O4T1C75ZRR6","A1GXYTQDJ0JNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GXYTQDJ0JNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sharp has five model series for their 2014 LCD sets (note; LCD not LED);LE, EQ, SQ & UQ series. The LE is a carryover from 2013 (or earlier, it is a step down from this model).Update 1/7/15;There is what appears to be a firmware glitch. If you turn off that ""Resolution Enhance"" on the 'SQ' model, it causes a very noticeable gray scale shift to green-yellow. On Mode 1 or 2, which is where the set was gray scaled, it is ok. I did contact Sharp on this with photos and was told it will be sent to ""Management"". I noticed something similar on the EQ where if you use the 240Hz mode, the shift is to a magenta tone. Not as noticeable, but never the less noticeable. I also discussed the uniformity issues again with photos.Update  12-30-14After trying SIX different panels, one from the SQ series to see if that was different (it wasn't), I will now call this Sharps ""black hole"" representing the dark area in the center of the panel. This apparently is due to the very limited viewing angle, worse than most VA panels. This is really too bad since it has the 2nd best UI (1st being Vizio) and a great set on inputs & outputs. The hype over the extra sub pixel is nothing more than marketing, not that it really does any good with their consistently bad panels. Really disappointed. Now, I do give up.Updated 12-13-14After trying FOUR different sets I have to give this a two star rating which is still generous. The 1st was the worst, by far. A dark area in the middle half of the panel. The 2nd & third better, but still bad with similar dark and light areas. The 4th was the best, but it still was not acceptable.There is a obvious pattern to the uniformity issues. On all four, the center is the darkest and the rest varies widely. One has a hot spot in the upper right, another, the opposite corner; bottom left.The odd thing about all of this is, Samsung uses Sharp panels on many of their models and on their 6350 model I wound up getting, it has almost no issues with poor uniformity. One reason may be that model uses direct lit (full array) vs edge lit. That and/or Sharps QC standards are far lower. I was planning to post the photos I have of all four screens, but I see no option to do so.Pros; 1. Detail level and motion handling rivals Samsung, 2. Inputs; 4 HDMI, 2 composite, 1 component NONE SHARED! The only line of LCD sets that has this that I know of, just about all the others have the lame, single shared composite/component setup. Needed for legacy equipment, CCTV cameras and it also give your a 5th HD input (though analog). 3. Ability with an optional programmable remote for direct input selection. No more jumping through inputs to get to the device you want to use. 4. Sturdy base. The panel slides in from the top unlike many where you have to screw it together before you stand it up. Far better than Vizio & Samsungs' design, 5. No 3D or other questionable, so called features including that 4k input ability on a 1080 set, 6. Manual firmware updating. You choose if you want the update or not. Far better than it automatically happening without your knowledge. Also, I believe with files from their website you should be able to revert back if there is a issue. 7. Fairly easy access to the picture adjustments menu, though it could of been better with a single button shortcut. 8. Service literature is available, unlike some other importers where the manual isn't even available to 3rd party service shops. How can you fix something properly w/o a service manual? To the importers that don't offer one; what are you hiding? This is a nice plus, 9. Decent sized owners manual (downloaded from their website, not supplied), though it could of been composed better, combining pages to reduce the overall number, 10. Full menu functions are available on the set itself (backup if the remote or IR receiver goes south), not just power, volume & channel change, unlike Vizio, (note; the 2015 models apparently will not have this) 11. Ability to add channels without doing a scan. Saves time, eliminates removing unwanted channels in your channel list later on, 12. Enhanced (US, as far as I can tell) service with these 60"" and above models. Reasonably prompt response and call back. 13. Well packaged, wider box than others. Nylon straps securing the bottom to the top (instead of those plastic 'clips' that are inserted through the upper carton) making it easier to carry.Cons; 1. Panel uniformity is the deal breaker. All six sets (from different dealers) had issues, one very sever, 2. Edge lit, more chance of flashlighting and 'hot spots' over a back lit panel though in spite of the other defects, that hasn't been the problem with the six sets I have had, 3. Leans towards a bluish tint with the highlights and greenish blacks, no doubt due to that yellow sub pixel. One of the review sites hit the nail on the head with that call. 4. Between two and three times the current draw than the M60 Vizio, 5. Limited light output. Darker than other manufactures sets even at the highest settings. The warmest color temperature drops the output even more, 6. Unnecessary picture modes. Why do we need two 'Vivid' settings. No ability to rename modes or bypass ones not used, 7. Slow boot time (17 seconds) and slightly slow channel changing. 8. Buried channel signal level indication. Why it's not in the info bar is beyond me, 9. When you are in a input other than 'TV', accidentally hitting the channel up or down automatically switches to the tuner input, 10. Menu times out too quickly. Annoying when you are doing picture adjustments, 11. That wasteful ""wallpaper mode"" ""quick on"" function defeats the concept of energy saving. Consumption is around 45 watts, even more of a waste if no one is there to see it. (yes, you don't have to use, it but it's the principle of this 'gimmick' which is counterproductive) 12. Non lighted remote (I use a learning/programmable remote, so it's not a issue), 13. Note sure this can really be called a negative, but Sharp is NOT one of the more popular names here.Believe me, I realty wanted this to be the choice. Unlike so many here that don't even try a 2nd set. Real stupidity. At least give the manufacture/importer a 2nd chance. These are mass produced consumer products. There will be differences and defective unit sold. Two, maybe, just maybe three bad ones? But, four? Sorry, that is neither bad luck nor is it a coincidence..","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZGUVWYPHABAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZZZM1A#wasThisHelpful","RZGUVWYPHABAH","A1GXYTQDJ0JNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GXYTQDJ0JNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Yes it is variable, but when using it as a screw gun, it's hard to modulate the speed down to a more manageable level especially with longer screws.

"Replacing a 2008 Samsung 32"" LCD display, this literally blows that set away. It exceeded my expectations.(Note; this is the non ""i"" version w/o the third HDMI input, Internet access & the mostly useless 120Hz processing for around $100 more)Pros,1. Very good video quality, decent blacks (direct viewing),2. Analog audio out for small amps to power external speakers,3. Optical out,3. Thin bezel,4. No unneeded bells & whistles (so called Internet applications),4. Decent menu layout, easy to access without jumping through hoops,5. Direct backlighting, no flashlighting,6. Separate video settings for each input,7. Low power consumption and little heat generation,8. Sturdy stand,9. Lightweight,10. Lastly; US support in English!Cons,1. Only two HDMI inputs and one combined composite/component input (this is a huge problem with just about all TV's now due to cost cutting),2. Contrast drop off and black level increases when viewing off axis, but no different than most other LCD displays except IPS panels,3. Side mounted controls on set hard to see and/or feel (yes I do actually walk up to something to turn it on or off without using the remote),4. Some dirty screen (clouding) effect. On white scenes (snow, hockey etc) there are some slightly darker 'patches' due to mild uneven backlighting though you have to look for it.Contrast ratio on all LCD's falls off from center. I've seen worse, but improvements over the past 5 years make it more livable. The 'pop' goes away off axis due to the black level increasing, washing out the video (depending on how far one goes off axis). Many times you don't notice it, it depends on the program material and room lighting.Would I buy this again and recommend it to others, Surely.

"Updated & revised 6/12/15There is no free ride. The low price has it's downfalls. Of course how this affects you is dependent on your background, experience with Spectrum Analyzers and application.If this is your first SA, it's more than adequate. If you are using it for OTA (over the air) monitoring as in broadcast and/or 2-way communication, it might not be. Coming from a Agilent or similar, it surely won't be.Having experience with a number of scopes under $10k, this is surely a good deal, but the major 'beef' is the slow ""update rate""of the display of the sweep. This is NOT the refresh rate, but the rate data is sent to the screen. Many didn't know what I was talking about. Rigol did, to their credit and was able to supply specs which no one else could. While discussing the problem with both of these scopes, I was told the ""update rate"" is only 5Hz with the 815 & the 1030. The new model; DSA832 rate is substantially faster at 25Hz.Two related problems which are not limited to just this model or brand; reported sweep speeds:1. The readout shown is not always correct. The actual speed is usually slower. Example: 100ms is actually closer to 150ms. 750ms is actually 1,000ms (one second). This is not the only SA that I have seen inaccurate speeds reported. Some will report different rates under the same setting.2. Dropping below 100ms will rarely display a faster updated trace. The 'choppiness' will still be there. The same applies to the older 1030 series. While you can manually dial down to 20ms, it will not show any difference. In other words, while the actually sweep is faster, you won't visually see it.  At least you are able to change the sweep speed up or down, Instek's scopes you can only increase the time..Pros;1. Price (what else can one say),2. Size & weight,3. Decent color display,4. Decent US support in English, unlike Instek which seems rare these days (but see below),5. Tracking generator is close to free ($200 option). I've seen many TG's add $2k to the price. You would be foolish not to equip it this way,6. Preamp included. You do get a warning 'beep' when the input is at the overload level,7. Conventional menu structure unlike R&S, Agilent & Anritsu,8. Perfect entry level SA, especially for hobbyists,9. Decent boot time (20 sec) and immediate shut down,10. Low standby current (1 watt).11. Free 3rd party remote screen capture available that captures in 3.5 seconds (see below).Cons;1. Overload input is 10db/m less than most others; 20dBm vs 30dBm2. Inability to update the display to show sweeps faster than 100ms (depending on other settings) due to 5Hz update rate.3. Very noisy fan which doesn't seem to be necessary since this runs cool,4. Outdated 480 line NTSC resolution. At least give us 600,5. Repair and alignment will probably have to be done in China with a 4-6 week turnaround time though hopefully this will change,5. You can only save screen shots to a USB stick, not to internal memory like Instek's,6. No white screen option for the screen saves, you have to use PC software to invert colors if you wish to print the results to save ink,7. You are forced to name the screen saves with a confusing text entry setup that requires jumping past the  Chinese symbols entry every time you switch from numbers to letters. You have to keep switching back and forth between letters and numbers since you can't use the number keypad unlike Instek,8. Overall specs are in a lower tier class (as expected at this price). Noise floor and phase noise specifically.9. No optional battery or DC operation.10. No 'jog' dial, only a small knob. Navigation buttons are only up & down,11. The 'feet' that fold out to tilt the unit up have a tendency to collapse when you lift the scope from the bench. Instek's system is far better,12. Only 4 markers,13. 3rd party remote control software is bloated and expensive. Surely not worth it. Why can't Rigol provide a basic version?14.

"I had a Extech 8:1 IR thermometer that I was questioning the accuracy of. I also wanted one with a tighter spot size.After doing some research and asking questions to a couple of manufactures, I now know exactly what the deal with the ""distance to spot"" ratio means.With just about all IR thermometers, the minimum distance to get a proper reading is around 12"". Some may go down to 9"" no matter what the ""distance to spot"" ratio is. A higher ratio allows measuring a smaller ""spot"" when you are further away. Measuring closeup, as in electronic work, it will make little difference since it only focuses down so far.IOW's, spending more for a higher ratio D/S will do you no good unless you are interested in measuring smaller areas further away.The lens used in these, I bet all come from the same manufacture. Stepping up in S/D ratio gets you a tighter ratio lens and a couple more features, It does not increase accuracy as far as I can see.Pros;1. Known name,2. Decent price,3. Compromise in price and S/D ratio with the above use and capability (stepping up would be a waste of money),4. Hold & average readings,5. 9V battery,6. Some customizing available.Cons;1. Supplied pouch is mostly useless. Pouch is way too small to properly hold device,2. There is a USB port, but there is no software option as there is for the 750,3. There is no mention of the USB port in the specs, nor of the supplied cable. See below,4. 10+ degree difference when measuring temps around 150 degree over mu Extech. Which is correct?The only use I see with the USB cable is using a PC (Laptop) as a power source when the battery dies. When I called support, they didn't even know that it had a port or cable.

I assume it is just this unit since I haven't read other complaints regrading this. I adjusted the rating down to 3 stars/4/14 Update on button cell life:I had to replace what tested to be a 'good' button cell when the display showed ""Lo"". Apparently this sensitive to low cell voltage. The cell I replaced after 10 months tests good under load in a battery tester.The biggest adjustment is getting use to NOT tapping the scale to get it to display.Pros;1. Just stepping on the scale activates the display, no annoying tapping to get it to activate,2. Footprint is too large for smaller bathrooms,3. User replaceable button battery,4. Better designed plate (if that is the proper term) that others,5. Seems very consistent with multiple readings (unlike other scale reviews), but see below.Cons,1. Display should be wider to proportionately display the digits better (digits are too narrow, they could be easer to read if spaced further apart),2. Display is not backlite. Hard to read without proper lighting,3. Apparent limited button cell life (nine months for me), the circuity is very semsisitve to voltage drop,4. AAA or AA cells would be cheaper to replace and probably last longer (but would raise the height of the scale from the floor),5. Kinda slow to show weight. Up to 10 seconds from first stepping on to get a reading,6. If you want a 2nd reading, you have to wait 10 seconds for it to shut down, there is no 'reset' function to get another reading.When stepping on the scale, there is a two second delay for the display to show, then five or more seconds to stabilize the reading depending on how much you move around.

"If this was 10 years ago, it would be Ok, but it isn'tSDTV (standard definition) is long gone (for the most part). Sure, this receives and can record HD stations, but only at DVD quality which is SD (as in NTSC). The editing ability is good without the hassle of a PC, but come on Funai, lets get with the program.As important, the HDD has been downsized to a 2 1/2"" Laptop drive (see below). This is a HUGE disappointment as they went backwards, since the mount for a full size drive is still there. It was adapted to a smaller drive with the associated smaller SATA & power interface that won't allow a full size drive to be used. The power supply was modified to reduce power consumption, which is good, BUT, it was discovered this caused issues with the full size 3 1/2"" drive so they did this fast fix.Pros;1.

This does not record HD, nor does it even show HD when using it as a tuner,2. HDD has been changed to a smaller 2 1/2"" Laptop drive format. This is due to cutting corners in the PS (power supply). This in turn caused issues with the larger 3 1/2"" drive, forcing this modification,3. The tuner is called a 'hybrid' that forces the user to switch between analog & digital channels when operated on a CATV feed,4. Two ugly oversized and unnecessary buttons on the front panel that should be replaced with full menu & navigation functions. After all, this can be used as an editing deck that can be used at a desk. You don't need a remote to use this,5. No front panel pause button,6. No component record ability (no issue with DRM, it isn't digital),7. No Guide of any kind for recording off air. Recordings have to be labeled to program names,8. High power consumption when in standby by todays standards (4-5 watts),9. Can not combine titles,10.

"Update 11/27/13;A slightly revised model with the new, larger remote is now available at the same price as the original. Cosmetically it is the same with the same board (chipset), but a couple of changes to the display were made. The term ""boot"" is replaced by the term 'menu"" when one is using the menu. Also, a new website replaced their current, slow to respond site. The firmware page needs a lot of work. I wouldn't try to figure out what is what, but go to the thread in AVScience forums to get the current (or past) versions.For OTA (Over The Air) the latest FW version is probably the best. For CATV users, it will depend on you system. For systems that provide virtual channel numbers for their OTA stations use versions labeled (virtual). For systems that don't provide this, use versions that are labeled ""physical"".Pros; 1. Tuners: one ATSC/QAM, NO analog (NTSC) capability, 2. Ability to enter individual channels without doing a complete scan, 3. Ability bypass a initial scan in the Installation setup, 4. Ability to remember both channel tables; OTA & CATV in one list as long as you don't do a scan. You would need to add a A/B switch to access both. (see photo) 5. Allows complete removal of channels, not just skipping them, 6. Lightning fast boot time of 10 seconds. Yes, I said 10 seconds, 7. Fast channel changes, unlike many other DVR's, 8.

This is capable of more than one storage device using a USB hub (thanks to jjeff), though there is only one front panel USB jack, 16. Internal power supply instead of another wall brick, 17. The format utility is fast. It's a quick version and takes around 5 seconds. (I didn't try it with a blank drive, it was formatted to ext2), 18. Recordings off the connected hard drive can be played to a PC and/or transfered there with no issue. The photos section didn't display some .jpg's for some unknown reason. It had no problem with .ts files from DVD's. 19. Choice of RF pass through (loop through) or modulated RF ch 3 or 4 (NTSC) for old school TV sets with no a/v inputs. But, only when powered up, 20. Music files can be played while in the Photo mode. Selections automatically advance no matter how thew pics are being viewed,Cons;1. Channels numbers on the display are just consecutive numbers starting with the lowest virtual channel number and ascending upwards. What on earth were they thinking here?,2. Some recordings do not get recorded. Hard to find a pattern to this. No where as bad as before,3. Bright ugly red display. Surely can't use it in a bedroom at night,4. The very small enclosure size doesn't allow it to be placed under any other equipment.There is also the probability of heavy cables pulling it off the shelve due to lack of size & weight,5. The remote is just as small, so are the labels. Very hard to see and push buttons. The button layout is not logical either,6. There is no indication on the display of recording status. Nothing preventing it from getting turned off which will cancel the recording,7. The manual misses a lot of functions and there are numerous mistakes. It's too small to read (though you can download a full size manual off their website). Being written for the Chinese market with mis named terms is a major problem,8. No skip function,9. Clock can not be set manually. If the reference stations clock is wrong, you can't do anything about it. Also it is only a 24 hour format,10. You can't playback and record at the same time,11. Only one tuner,12. The single USB port is on the front panel. While practical for a memory stick, it surely isn't for a HDD connection with the cable hanging off the front.13. There is no mention anywhere other than in the system information screen that this has a ATSC tuner, only QAM. there is also little mention about the recording capabilities,14. There is no analog capability.update: added info on different firmware versions","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZ77JYW3LQEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BFIJQ10#wasThisHelpful","R3TZ77JYW3LQEX","A1GXYTQDJ0JNH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1GXYTQDJ0JNH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I normally don't comment on other reviews, but in this case I felt it was appropriate. This may not look like real CF on close inspection, and it may not contour to every application; but it also costs 10x less than you'd pay for one that does. $5 and free shipping for 5 feet of this material is an awesome deal, and no I wasn't asked or paid to say that.That said, I found this material very easy to work with. I bought it for a couple small applications I'd been wanting to try and it's been fantastic - easy to trim with an X-acto knife, can be stretched slightly to conform to shape, even more so with some heat. I made a custom wrap for my wife's Fitbit and she's remarked how well it's holding up even wearing it daily. I've also used it to wrap a couple of my ecig devices that get used daily, and it looks great while protecting the finish (see pic).

"I've always been an Otterbox fan, particularly the Defender series for the extra protection. But the looks of the HTC One M8 were too nice to completely cover, so I opted for the Supcase instead. I realize it won't offer the same level of protection a Defender would, but I am glad to see that it's a fairly sturdy case for a 1-piece. The fit is very snug; a little tight getting it on, but that's to be expected. Very impressed with how well the port cutouts are placed. The rear mic in particular is so small that a slight mis-fit would cover it; but it lines up perfectly. The raised bevel on the front is just high enough to keep my tempered glass screen protector from touching when face down. I haven't tried the IR blaster since putting it on, but others have had no problems.The only ""con"" I'll add is the back panel. The listing states Frost Clear, so I was expecting mine would look identical to the one pictured. However instead of clear, it seems to be slightly tinted, giving the gunmetal grey a bronze look. Not exactly what I was hoping for since I picked this case based on its ability to show off the phone. I'll post a few pics in the customer images section to show what I mean. Overall a good case, but I would've preferred that the ""Frost Clear"" option was as depicted.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AIGPUTQO2QRG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IJ0R02Y#wasThisHelpful","R3AIGPUTQO2QRG","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I typically like to spend some time with a product before reviewing it, but I'm already so impressed with this screen protector I decided to post right away. I've always used screen protectors on my devices. Typically I get the static type, as the wet applications are just a mess. This however, was my first tempered glass protector; and I've already decided I'll be using them for everything from now on. Installation was the easiest I've ever done. Zero issues with air bubbles. The glass itself looks flawless and is crystal clear. The reason I chose this one over others was because one of the main complaints I read with other brands was the sharp edge. The rounded edges on this one are smooth, comfortable on the fingers, and actually look really good. I'll post a couple pics in the customer images section to show the fit and finish on these. Definitely recommended-**Update** 07/28/14 Almost 2 months with this screen protector and it still looks like the day I put it on. I wanted to update to say I've had 2 different cases on my M8 now, including an Otterbox Commuter, and the PThink Protector has worked great with both of them, and doesn't affect case fit whatsoever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLK72WS8M4UYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9ZGNKI#wasThisHelpful","RLK72WS8M4UYK","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, the plastic this case is made from is way too thin to provide any actual protection. It would most likely fracture from a bump, much less survive a fall and offer protection to the device. That hard to open plastic packaging that most store-bought items come in nowadays feels sturdier than the plastic this is made from. Even the cheap cases from the Verizon store are twice as thick as this.Second, for a case that is brand new, it looks used right out of the package. Scratches and scuffs are evident on most of the edges, most likely from poor handling of these cheap, bulk produced products. (See my pic in customers images)I'm glad is was so cheap, because it's definitely a throw away case.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJ8J4H5DQ6FI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BF4HI4#wasThisHelpful","R3HJ8J4H5DQ6FI","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I knew by the price that this was no ""Otterbox-quality"" case, I still expected a bit more from a brand new item. The first thing I noticed was the flexible sides of the case have a cloudy, dull finish instead of clear (see my photo in customer images). Second, one of the edges where the hard plastic back is mated to the flexible portion is not attached.

"As most of the reviews have already said, this thing moves alot of air. And it does it at an acceptable volume as well. Not the quietest fan out there, but I'm not sure you could find one this strong that's any quieter. I've come to like Lasko fans, and this one is no exception. I use it to blow air from the cooler parts of the house to the warmer areas and it does that well. My only con to list is the base could be a bit wider.

"I bought this fan to replace an old one that had quit on me. I live in FL and even with A/C, some areas of the house get warmer than others, namely the bedroom. When the ceiling fan wasn't enough I put a pedestal fan at the foot of the bed and found it helped quite a bit. When the old one ( an OceanAire )died, I shopped around and found this Lasko model. Had I known how strong this fan was I would've replaced the other one long ago. The lowest setting on this fan is equal to the old one on high. I'm not kidding when I say the first night I had it set up my wife grabbed an extra blanket for herself, and that was only on the medium setting. This thing really pushes alot of air.Assembly was fairly easy. The front grill took a few minutes of fumbling with since the tabs and slots didn't seem to want to align correctly. They did eventually, it just took a few tries. The base is nice and wide, although it could be a little heavier to help with stability. I actually placed the stand between the footboard and the edge of the mattress on my bed so as not to have to worry about it tipping- problem solved.

"1st off, I found this on another site on sale for $39.99. Amazon usually has the best prices, but I was able to find this cheaper this time.I do occasionally game on my PC, but my main reason for buying this particular keyboard was the backlighting. I have a slide out for my keyboard so working in the dark always left me straining to see keys. With this one it's no longer necessary. There are 3 lighting levels to choose from. I prefer the highest, but the keys are visible (in the dark) on any level. When the room is well lit you don't really notice the backlighting.I have tried the macros, just to see how they work. They're easy to set up and function as they should. The media and calculator buttons open their respective programs (I did install the included software, not sure if they work without that installed). The keys have a solid feel to them, and are on the quieter side. They are a bit smaller than my old standard keyboard though, I can already tell I'll be inadvertently hitting other keys. The palm rest is non-removeable. A non-issue for me but be aware if you have limited space.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26RRPQK493DMR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZV51DI#wasThisHelpful","R26RRPQK493DMR","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased two of these Timex alarm clocks for my wife and I.First off, for the price, this clock is packed with features. My main reason for choosing this was the multi level display dimmer; some clocks are just too bright. This one offers different levels of brightness and is perfect for me at the lowest level. The USB charger is convenient since I alway keep my phone on my dresser at night. Having a battery backup is also a must. I don't really have much use for the 2nd alarm or nightlight, but it doesn't hurt to have them.The only 2 flaws I see are 1) every time you set the alarm, it beeps a confirmation that it's set (rather loudly). This is irritating when your partner is already asleep, but there's no way around it that I've found. And 2) Except for the large snooze button, the rest of the buttons are close together and are hard to differentiate in the dark by feel alone. Some space between them or raised surfaces on the buttons would have been welcome.Overall I'm happy with these clocks. I would've given them 5 stars if there was a way to silence the beep when you set the alarm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EPCY5ULP29LC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004I8WHC4#wasThisHelpful","R2EPCY5ULP29LC","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've used this pillow for some time now. The Pros: It's definitely better than a standard pillow for cpap users. Even with nightly use, the higher edges have held their shape and height, which allows you to position yourself so the mask hangs over the side and is not pushed into your face. It is a firm pillow, but still fairly comfortable, either on your back or on your side. The cons: Overall size is a bit small, could be a little wider. Also, as opposed to some other styles, while using this pillow on your side, it offers little/no support for your forehead. I often feel as if I have to hang my head over the edge of it to get the benefit of not having the mask smashed into my face. It's still superior to using a regular pillow, but I may eventually try one that has more of a cut-out for the mask while offering better support for the whole head.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K9PWG4OBHPN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034EQ4CW#wasThisHelpful","R2K9PWG4OBHPN3","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For quite some time my wife has wanted to replace our old, dull set of kitchen knives. After seeing that sets can run anywhere from $20 to $1000, I started reading reviews on Amazon and finally settled on this set. We weren't disappointed. First, shipping was faster than anticipated (glad I used the free shipping and didnt pay for the upgrade) and the packaging was sufficient and the product arrived intact. Second, The price was very reasonable for a set that included so many pieces.The knives all came in a thin plastic sleeve with a cardboard sheath over the blade. They have a heavy, sturdy feel to them and the stainless handle gives them a professional look. Although my wife could name each knife on sight, I was impressed with the array of different knives even if I didnt know the intended purpose of some of them. The utensils are a nice addition as well that will surely get put to use.The blades on these have been very impressive so far. Mind you, we've only just started using them since Christmas, but after having a cheap department store set for years, these things are like razors. So far while chopping carrots and cutting steak my wife has made a point to tell me how much of a difference these knives make compared to what we had. Even the prospect of having to hand wash these hasn't bothered us as long as it lends to these knives staying in the condition they're in now. The only slight disappointment I had was that the block doesn't hold all of the knives included in the set, so some of them have to be kept in a drawer. However that's only a display issue and I'm not going to dock a star from the review for that.I'll try to check back in a month or two and update how they've held up after some usage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XXEIKO2QYXSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FSTIE6#wasThisHelpful","R1XXEIKO2QYXSI","A12I73B1D67Q0K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12I73B1D67Q0K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was looking for something strong enough to charge my ASUS Tablet (I tried 8 different chargers), IPAD, 4 phones. This has plenty of power.

The actual cord is about as thick as a USB cord. The plug for the transformer is at one end, both prongs are narrow, but if you plug it in to the top of your outlet it will hang down and cover the bottom outlet.

The next step up is nice (bought for daughter) because you can sit down stairs and scan around, but for us and nap time not a deal breaker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32U1SKND5Q7T3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VL2VRY#wasThisHelpful","R32U1SKND5Q7T3","A3ONII9X9JLI16","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3ONII9X9JLI16?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice women's timepiece. It has a pleasing design and the popular 38mm size. The three small subdial windows show day of week, day of month and hour in 24h format. (The included user manual does not mention the last subdial mode. This particular model does not have a stopwatch function.) It looks stylish on any woman's wrist and is appropriate for most occasions. It's rated 3ATM which means it's safe to wear in showers or washing hands, but not for swimming - much like the new Apple Watch.The reason I give it 4 stars is it does feel heavy - heavier than similarly priced watches we've bought from Amazon over the last few years. The heft is enough to make it a little less than the perfect daily wear I think most would like. Some women probably don't mind, but the manufacturer should have shaved a little weight to make the watch more comfortable.

"This Hoover cordless vacuum uses a LiIon battery, which means it's less susceptible to memory effect seen in older NiCd batteries used in cordless vacuums. This gizmo actually consists of a handheld and a housing unit with the traditional handle and roller, so you can use it in two modes: as a handheld or as an upright.Since it's cordless, it's best for light duties - and at those it does a very good job. I use it on hardwood, low pile rugs and carpet and it picks up most dirt and dust. It's not powerful enough if your rug or carpet is dirty, but that's not the kind of cleaning this is designed for.

"The Nuud case is unlike any other case that claims to be waterproof I have seen: it actually leaves your iPad's screen (including the camera lens) exposed to the elements.The back cover is the typical Lifeproof type, although to my dismay I found the cutout for the back camera not perfect aligned with my iPad mini 2's back camera. (This case is designed for the Touch ID mini 3 but is also compatible with mini 2 and the original non-Retina mini.) It does not block the camera's view but is a bit unsightly when you notice it.  Otherwise, the usual ports and buttons are covered.The front piece is the surprise here: it's just a frame without a screen protector. You can actually see it in the product picture on Amazon: your hand actually touches the iPad mini's screen. The frame creates a seal around the screen rather than enclosing it completely. You must do a water test with a ""dummy"" before installing your precious iPad mini.This is where I felt I was not sure I could trust the Nuud. I did the water test and thought the dummy didn't get wet, but my spouse saw otherwise. Also, even if I had been 100% correct, that the Nuud does create a waterproof seal around the screen, leaving the screen completely exposed really does not sit well with me or the actual user of the iPad mini 2, who had wanted to take the device into our city pool. Also, on a day-to-day basis your screen is completely exploded to dust and fingerprint and dirt. You cannot have a separate film-type screen protector on because that would be detrimental to the sealing functionality of the case.In the end, I decided not to keep this on the iPad mini. For casual users especially those who are more concerned with rain or those who want use this in a controlled environment like shower or bathtub, it's probably a good case. Still, you must always keep in mind your iPad's screen is left naked.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7GU9XWX4NMX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SOXN9NK#wasThisHelpful","R2R7GU9XWX4NMX","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As someone interested in math and politics, I was looking forward to reading this book. But I came away disappointed. The problem is simple: the author uses one-sided pseudo math to argue for a left-wing agenda. I'm no right-winger; I'm all for objective nonpartisanship, and I vote according to this lifelong principle. This author pretends to be analyzing issues arising from our Constitution in terms of math/statistics but he only tells you what he thinks is relevant and, gasp!, correct. Anything else is stupid and ancient and outdated.  He fails to see that human psychology and behavior and social issues cannot be modeled in math. His argument that (traditions-minded) politicians ""ignore"" ""sound math"" therefore are anti-human is just an example of the left-wing mantra ""if you disagree with me, you are a bigot who will be swept away to hell by the progressiveness of human development"".","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDX9O1MDKWQ9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142141595X#wasThisHelpful","RDX9O1MDKWQ9Y","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an ionizing air purifier for small space. They key word here is small.

It has a small fan which has three settings. The ionizer also has three settings. There is no separate power switch.The fan is quiet at the low setting, tolerable at the medium setting, and can be drowned out at the high setting if you have your stereo on. The works best at getting rid of smoke particles and moldy odor. It works in a small bathroom against toilet odors as well.

"(I should note that I received one of these from Amazon Vine for review purposes. The gate was not packaged in any plastic wrap but was instead directly placed in an outer cardboard box. Due to either poor packaging or rough handling by UPS, the top handle was partially damaged during shipment. I do not include this in my review here.)This is an excellent indoor gate for keeping babies and toddlers and also small pets from certain areas. In the case of small pets like the cat we have, you need to train them not to jump over this gate, as it's pretty low in height, about 2.5 ft.The best thing about the gate is it can be hardware mounted via screwed-in hinges like most safety gates but can also be mounted via its built-in pressure pads. If you mount it at the top of stairs, you must use the screw-in method because the pressure mount mode does not create a strong enough hold. A toddler or a running pet can easily take it down, hence not safe for top of stairs. Instructions and screws are included for hinge mount. Of course, you must drill holes on the wall and/or banister. In this mode, you swing the gate open.I use this at the bottom of our indoor staircase, so I have it pressure-mounted. Ditto if you use it in a doorway. In this mode you can swing the gate or slide the mobile panel. The beauty here is it's very easy to mount on the pressure pads. You do need to pay attention to alignment to ensure a strong mount, and I recommend doing this with a helper. But it's pretty much an easy job for any adult, even mothers. :)The lift handle is big and easy to operate, unlike Safety 1st gates I bought and installed in the past. (I have bought and used several different Safety 1st baby gates.) There is a button you need to slide and hold in order to open the gate. If you have carpal tunnel you do need to be careful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LFU2I2599VJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009YDFX2Y#wasThisHelpful","R1LFU2I2599VJ9","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This bedwetting warning system consists of two pieces: A flexible plastic sensor unit which you tape to the outside of the child's underwear (obviously where the pee comes out), and a chubby alarm unit that your child must wear on the night shirt. The two pieces are connected by a electrical cord that measures about 3 ft. This is NOT a wireless system.While the alarm unit is not heavy, it's thick and does require 2 alkaline batteries. The cord and the alarm unit may not be comfortable for your kid. This is unfortunately the case with my son. He hates wearing the alarm unit. He does have sensitive skin so he find it hard to fall asleep wearing the alarm. The cord also makes him feel uncomfortable because he likes to sleep on his sides. Your child may not object to this setup, though.If your child can tolerate this system, it should work well in waking him or her up when urine comes out and into contact with the censor. The manual says if the system helps your child stay dry for 14 days in a row, you can discontinue using it. I tested the censors by simulating urine on underwear and it did set off the alarm. The alarm has different tones so your child doesn't get used to one tone and fall back asleep when awakened. The idea is he/she wakes up to the alarm and over time conditions him to associating bedwetting with being woken up by an alarm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4E5G7ES7XO0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQWN744#wasThisHelpful","R4E5G7ES7XO0T","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many, I've been a Transformers fan all my life, and my kids are the same. This Bumblebee features a ""one-step flip"" design where it transforms from robot to car via raising and flipping the right leg. Going the other way is also easy, although the two tabs that release the locking mechanism is poorly constructed and often require extra effort.What the simplicity in the design takes away is the whole magical experience of hiding away all those body parts in order to transform, the very essence of Transformers. Also, this new design makes the two legs complete useless in robot mode, and you can't even turn or bend them. Bumblebee's head looks unusually small due to the new placement. In the end, there just isn't too much replay value, especially in the robot mode, despite the presence of a largely gimmicky disc-shooting hand.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BQFDRRODYARZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ILA28G0#wasThisHelpful","R1BQFDRRODYARZ","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first time I'm using Charmin's bath tissue (aka toilet paper). I noticed three things to the paper i buy at Costco, Sam's Club and my local supermarket.First, the rolls are the biggest I have seen. They are big because they include a lot of sheets and also because each ply seems thicker than other brands.Two, the thicker ply does seem to be accompanied by the higher-than-usual quality if the paper itself. I've noticed that the paper doesn't tear as easily as the brands I'm accustomed to, which is a very welcome change.Third, the paper is smooth on its surface. Now, while I like this smoothness, my spouse doesn't. So this aspect is a matter of individual taste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2043TV98THRJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DNYXJ4E#wasThisHelpful","R2043TV98THRJH","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book, published by a UK or India-based publisher, presents some programming concepts for kids. It's not really for parents but rather for kids themselves to read and follow along. Two programming environments are introduced: MIT's difficult-to-use Scratch (definitely NOT forbkindergarteners) and the popular adult language Python.Some concepts are introduced and the kids get 3 snall projects for Scratch and 4 for Python. Either because the programs have updates since publication or the authors were being careless, there are steps that simply don't work. The way the concepts are presented could use better organization and explanation.I would say this book is for kids at least 11 years old, i.e., in 6th grade or higher.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ6ASQS6Y4P9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146541956X#wasThisHelpful","RJ6ASQS6Y4P9C","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had this for over 3 weeks and I'm really happy with the drive.  2TB is not a lot these days but I use it in a NAS (network-attached storage) server here at home, along with 3 other drives between 2 and 3 TB each.  The drive is fast, no doubt, with its 7200 RPM rotational speed and SATA III interface and 64 MB of cache memory.  More importantly, it's quiet and, even without any benchmarking or even stopwatching, it appears to resume from sleep/standby very quickly (I noticed this when I first put it in an external drive enclosure and attached it to my Toshiba laptop).  I really don't think anyone can go wrong with this drive.WD says it includes the latest vibration-protection technology in this drive.  I have no way of verifying this.  I've never had a problem with drives crashing when I move my NAS server around gingerly even while it's still on and working.  Will a drive like this survive an earthquake?

"I bought this on Amazon.com from a third-party seller, unfortunately they send me a gray-market ZS30.  The instructions are in English and Chinese (no Spanish so you know this is not for the American market as half, or more, of the U.S. population now speak Spanish as a mother tongue!), but more importantly, the video formats are all 25p, which is not the 30p formats we use here stateside.But the camera is absolutely excellent.  It has GPS which finds location faster than my older ZS7 (but still nowhere as fast as the instantaneous locationing on my Nokia Lumia phone).  Panasonic's Quick Menu is always a pleasure to use, as it lets you access the most commonly used functions for each shooting mode.  The location of the video button is a bit weird as it's located right next to the power button, on the top to the right of the shutter, so sometimes, in the dark, I forget which is which.Yes, you can zoom optically, up to 20 times, while shooting video, and the motor noise is zero in the video captured.  Panasonic's tried-and-true intelligent zoom feature can increase the effective zoom by up to another 30% without degrading image quality whatsoever. (This can happen because the ZS20's sensor has more pixels than even the highest resolution output by the camera.)  I do wish there were a raw output option.  The manual mode lets you adjust exposure and speed manually (but not focus distance), and is relatively intuitive to use.Picture quality is nothing short of excellent, even in dimly lit situations.  in the old days Panasonic's camera tended to output noisy images.  I don't know if they still use Sony's image sensors, but this one gives better, smoother images.  You can tell by opening a picture in Windows Photo Viewer and going to 100% and looking at the pixels.Video image is excellent, too, and to my surprise, the non-US 25p formats play back well on my Toshiba laptop in Windows Media Player and VLC Player.  No stuttering whatsoever.  One minor gripe is when you zoom optically, and when the scene lacks contrast, the focus tends to hunt around more often than on my previous ZS7 or on any of my Sony digital cameras (primarily the TX series).  This is not an uncommon problem with auto-focus digital cameras when it comes to video recording, but I'm surprised it's an issue here but not with the older ZS7.I got the white ZS30 and, boy, is it stylish!  It's also ergonomic (save for the location of the video recording button).  The high-res LCD screen is also touch screen like on any smartphone nowadays. The icons do tend to be a little smallish, but still tappable.  You also get mechanical buttons and D-pad as usual, so it's really easy to use whether you prefer touch or old-style button push.The ZS30 is a great, top-notch all-around compact camera for all sorts of purposes, from travel to portrait to parties.  When it comes to taking pictures worth saving (as opposed to sharing with the 3,000 strangers on your Facebook friends list), a good camera like this beats any smartphone (unless you have the Lumia 1020 phone with its 41MP sensor).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VUUS3DLMIWIB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPPRO3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3VUUS3DLMIWIB","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This baby monitor product comes in two plain boxes, one containing the camera and the wireless monitor (called ""Lila"") and the other a small motion monitor (called ""Oma"") which you place with the baby to monitor breathing movements.  I'll focus on the ""Lila"" part.I really like the small LCD monitor.  It's cute, it's stylish, it's functional, and it's easy to carry.  The button felt a little stiff to me at first but I got used to the tactile feedback in no time.  The small size makes it very pocketable, so there's no reason why you can't carry it with you. Range on the wireless reception is good for a single-family house, although like most video monitors the image starts getting noisy when you're a floor below where the camera is. When there's insufficient light, the camera returns gray-scale images, and I feel this camera has a sensor that's not as light-sensitive as the one on my old Sony video baby monitor.  One con of the portability of the monitor here is the screen is smallish, so if you're a grandparent, no disrespect here but you might have a hard time seeing the baby's movements.The monitor uses a battery but like every other baby video monitor product I've used or seen, the camera must be plugged in.  For this price, I feel they should have made the camera battery-powered, too.  At least give the customer that option.Overall I feel this is a nice product that works well, if you're okay with the small LCD screen.  Some video baby monitors on the market today have up to 7-inch screens.  BTW I'll never recommend you using a mobile app, because there have been reports of bad people hacking into WiFi networks to watch what you and/or your baby is doing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUKC4S6NMMBUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FM5LK2K#wasThisHelpful","RUKC4S6NMMBUI","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's unfortunate, I must admit, that I have to rate this upright vacuum only 2 stars (""I don't like it"").  It's actually a pretty capable bagless vacuum. It's easy to put together, although you do need a Philips screwdriver to assemble the handle to the body. It sucks pretty well, and the spring-loaded power cord management system reminds me of my old Panasonic vacuum, which is to say it's really convenient as you don't have to wind and unwind the power cord each time.Unfortunately, the vacuum has a very strong chemical odor every time I use it, to the point that I actually fear using it in my kids' rooms. My kids (like most modern youngsters) suffer from dust allergies (among other respiratory problems), that's why I have several HEPA-rated vacuums.  This one uses a HEPA filter, too.  But every time I run it, the strong odor, which seems a mixture of rubbery and oil smells, permeates the air.  It really kills the sense of keeping the house clean.I've never had a vacuum that gave out an odor like this before.  I really wanted to like this vacuum.  I'm going to keep the 2 star rating until the odor goes away after I use it in the living room for a few more weeks or months. (I needed to post this review as I got the vacuum from Amazon Vine and we're required to post a review within a month of requesting the product for review.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSK0UXI56HNLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJQQRH6#wasThisHelpful","RSK0UXI56HNLP","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really good thermo jar for the kids, as long as you are aware that its inside is really small, much smaller than suggested by its total body volume. It's best for a lunch-sized hot soup, that's about it.  It can't even hold enough pasta for a 1st-grader's lunch.  I really wish the maker had gone to a bigger size and made it more practical. But if the 10 oz. rated volume is enough for you, I think this is going to please you.I wasn't able to measure how long it held the soup hot. My son eats lunch 3 hours after leaving the house, and every time he says the soup is still hot.  The label says it can keep food hot for 5 hours and cold for 7 hours.  The jar is well made.  But like I said, if its inside usable volume were bigger, I'd have rated this 5 stars and bought another 5 of them.  Still, I can recommend it to folks who are okay with the small volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I917E0AF68BU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO0JZLC#wasThisHelpful","R3I917E0AF68BU","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I use a TyIt Powerplant LiIon charger all the time, so my experience with this Mipow charger inevitably compares with my overall positive experience with the TyIt product.I have to say I'm rather disappointed by this charger. It just feels cheaply made. It comes with a USB extension cord (the male-to-female type) and a small cheap pouch, but the maker fails to include an AC charger, much like the case with the Kindle products.  So you're supposed to plug the input connector into a PC's USB port or an existing USB charger.The input connector is simply ridiculous. It consists of just the plastic connector inside a normal USB plug (the white plastic in USB 1 and 2, and the blue plastic in USB 3). The connector has two metal contacts. The poorly written instruction sheet, printed in poor ink and in tiny fonts, make no mention of which way this ""naked"" connector should go. I actually tried many times before deciding that you must insider the ""naked"" connector into a USB port so that the metal contacts touch the plastic connector (black in USB 1 and 2, blue in USB 3) inside the port.  Imagine doing this on a PC and you forgot which is which.  Adding a normal USB casing would have made the user's life so much easier.I tried this with a couple of USB chargers I already have, including my Acer tablet's AC adapter with USB slot and a dedicated RCA wall USB charger, but somehow the Mipow never charged.  I finally plugged it into a Lenovo laptop. It still wouldn't charge. I finally used the included extension cable, and then it started charging.  At the start of charging the Mipow, two of the indicator were lit, indicating 25-50% of power inside the cells.  It took over 8 hours (maybe 9... I'm not sure) for it to fully charge.  Imagine charging this power brick when it's completely discharged.  Like many unhappy Kindle users, Mipow users probably have to wait 20 hours for it to charge from zero to full from a computer USB port.  Not a positive experience.The input connector shares the same space as the micro-USB output connector. This part is like the TyIt Powerplant product, in that a micro-USB output is built-in.  Like the latter, the Mipow also includes a full-sized USB output port (female), so you can charge products like Sony and Apple that use proprietary cables.  The built-in micro-USB does not fit into my Nokia Lumia 1520 phone's micro-USB port well.  If I move the connector just a little, the 1520 reports the charging power has been disconnected.  This makes me very unhappy.  I've never had any quality issues with the TyIt, which I bought from Amazon.com a few months ago.In short, I feel the Mipow has some quality issues, and the use of a ""naked"" USB connector for input charging is a very poor design choice.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R290KJT11MIDYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6KQ2GC#wasThisHelpful","R290KJT11MIDYD","A5JLAU2ARJ0BO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5JLAU2ARJ0BO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm in love.  Here is the newest object of my affection... the Zyliss French Press mug.  I'm a coffee fanatic.  I drink only organic free trade exotic beans from all over the world and am as finicky about roast, pure water, grinding, and brewing as any other coffee connoisseur out there... but this mug is an exception to my rules.  Cardinal rule #1... Thou shalt not touch plastic to roasting, grinding or brewing coffee.  UNLESS you are in a rush and on the road or work in a crazy hectic job and still want to enjoy your beloved french press coffee from home as an instant coffee.  This little baby is a snap to use.  Toss 1 spoon full of your fresh ground coffee beans in the bottom, pour on you purified hot but not boiling water, leave a little head room for cream, sugar and your press...  then slide the press into the channel slowly and press down to the bottom... place in your organic cream, honey or pure cane sugar... stir... pop the top on...  and VIOLA! you're enjoying a cup of joe that makes Starbucks seem as gross as that old Folgers in the can.  Oh sorry if I offended the Starbucks and Folgers drinkers...  but the good news is... you too can use this nifty french press to make a cheap cup of coffee to supply your caffeine needs for the day.At this price... I'm buying another one.  At this price... if you're a coffee drinking family... everyone can have their own fresh brewed to go every morning.  You just can't beat this gizmo!PS... the ONLY 2 cons I have found about this cup is...1. Do not fill it all the way up... and hold onto it firmly with a good grip when you SLOWLY press down the french press piece or you will be making a total mess and getting coffee grounds inside your coffee... maybe even burning your hand.2.  When you add the hot water the internal air inside the double wall expands and escapes making a funny hissing whistling sound that you can barely hear so it confused me at first about where the noise was coming from.  I see nothing wrong with the cup and just think of it as my new cup has a personality!  It talks to me and tells me how good that coffee is it's brewing for me...hahahahaa","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ4NH78LFUV2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F9ZTL6U#wasThisHelpful","RJ4NH78LFUV2C","A27YGMQ79RSZYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27YGMQ79RSZYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Okay... You can safely buy this grinder and save your money compared to all the other identical grinders on Amazon... and by now I'm sure you are confused.  This one is identical to all the ones that look just like it.  It's going to do the job the same in every way as all those other grinders that look identical to this one.  First of all... it's the size of a tall pepper grinder like they have in the restaurants... that sack of coffee shown is tiny. So keep that perspective in mind when you are looking at these grinders. They all are the same size. This grinder has nice quality slightly brushed stainless steel.  Mine has no flaws. The bottom simply pulls off with a twist while pulling down.  Mine was a bit stuck when I got it but after some rocking back and forth while pulling and twisting it finally came loose and now it works perfectly.  Just don't shove it so hard up into the top that you  have difficulty when you go to remove it.  I like that design because there is no threads to wear out or break.  It's going to last a long time.  The top cap come off so you can adjust the grinder.  The directions are clear and I didn't have to adjust mine at all.  It's perfect for my french press grind as it came.  You just put the beans in the top and put the cap back on, place the handle on the top notch and grind.  Here is where you may encounter some issues.  It is a small grinder... so it requires a firm grip on the middle of the grinder and place the base on a flat surface to provide vertical support.  DON""T PRESS DOWNWARD ON THE HANDLE WHEN GRINDING.  This is the rule with ALL manual coffee grinders.  It is the prime reason they wear out and break.  When you grind use NO downward pressure.  Keep your hand on the knob of the hand and make circles that are as parallel to the flat surface as you can.  Your effort will be reduced and grinding will go easier.  Pressing downward on the handle achieves NOTHING but breaking the handle and putting stress on the burr.  It will rock the central axle the burr is attached to in a back and forth motion that will ruin the mechanism and the burr.  So while grinding coffee... keep a steady hand going in an even flat circular pattern as possible to get the best out of your grinder.  You'll notice this requires a firm controlling grip on the base of the grinder to maintain stability while grinding.If you're looking for more than coffee for 2 people... this grinder probably isn't for you unless you just like the exercise and are a super conscientious ""green"" fanatic who can't afford a bigger coffee grinder... or you're living in a tiny house... or whatever reason you have for wanting to own a small grinder and grind pots of coffee with it.  Personally, I'm the only coffee drinker in the house and I want 2 or 3 cups per day so this is all I need.  At any rate... I'm super glad I bought this grinder especially now that I found out from so many people that it's identical to theirs that cost twice the price.  I paid $11 for this and most of them cost $17 to $25 for the exact same item.  I can confirm the burr is ceramic.  The grind is infinitely adjustable.  The bottom catch cup is a plastic cup surrounded by stainless steel so you can see through the little window at how much coffee you have in the catch cup.For the purists out there... No plastic is involved with the actual bean grinding process.  There is a plastic support inside the grinder that houses the axle and it's only function is to keep the axle rod centered inside the tall cylinder hopper where you place the beans. It does not rotate.  It does not perform any grinding function and once the beans enter the burr they are only contacted with ceramic and metal.  The only plastic is... the knob, the internal axle support, the little catch cup housed inside the steel cylinder.  So if you are going totally plastic free in your lifestyle... this isn't for you. But... if you are only worried about the health risks with plastic... as I am... this is a safe buy for you.  Both the plastic cup and the plastic support are the BPA free types... rigid plastic.  The internal support looks and feels like high density melamine.  The bottom cup looks poly.Cleaning can be performed using white rice ( the cheap hulled kind of rice that I don't eat but is most common in America ). Just put a tablespoon full in there and grind it up.  It soaks up oils and cleans the burr.  A shot of canned air after cleaning gets all the rice flour you just made out of the works. Also the removable handle can be secured with a rubber band for traveling and storage.Summary - Excellent bang for the buck... one of the few cheap buys that isn't cheaper in quality.  Grinds a great bean for all brewing methods. Perfect for 2 people but not for a whole pot of coffee for 4 or 6.  Easy to clean, small, portable, can hold several days worth of coffee inside for grinding along the way on a camping or other trip.  This one is identical and just as high quality as the more expensive grinders that look like this on Amazon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Z4APFE8RYFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MT18RC#wasThisHelpful","R10Z4APFE8RYFV","A27YGMQ79RSZYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27YGMQ79RSZYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought this to replace our pump that came with the Intex 15 foot round pool because the pump that came with it was not doing the job in South Texas.  I'm sure it would work in a less hot and humid area of the country but here in Houston... we need a massive pump so this one is doing the trick for us.  I LOVE IT.  So much easier to clean and use than the original pump.  It is massive overkill for our tiny pool and that's perfect for us with this crazy algae that happens down here. My pool is now crystal clear all the time and the skimmer is now working properly for the first time since we got the pool.  I can vacuum the bottom just using the auxiliary port while still filtering the pool at the same time.  It has plenty of suction to even pick up small gravel that our idiot yard guy slung into the pool by accident.  If you plan on using this pump for the smaller Intex pools with the smaller diameter hoses... you'll need to buy ""Hose Conversion Adapter Kit for Intex 1500gph and 2500gph pumps"" that is sold here on Amazon. Just type that into the Amazon search and you'll find it.  You'll also probably need some O rings 026 Buna O-Ring, 70A Durometer, Black, 1-1/4"" ID, 1-3/8"" OD, 1/16"" Width (Pack of 25) that Intex is really stingy with when you buy their pools.  I also used some zip ties... the thick white plastic super long strap tie downs that make that clicking sound like a zipper when you pull them tight.  I used those to support the hoses coming out of the pool by strapping around the top rails then going under and around the hose so it can't droop.  Those drooping hoses put constant pressure on that seam around those inlet ports.  You'll bust them out if you don't support the weight of those hoses in some way.  Tying them to the top rail of the pool just makes sense.  On the lower port you can loop 2 or 3 zip ties together to extend the length down so it can support that lower inlet.I also suggest you get the Unicel brand of filter for this pump because it not only saves you a LOT of money on the filters but it's a superior filter. You can just hose it off over and over again so that one filter is all you need for a season.  I use 2 so I have a clean one to put in when I open the pump and take out the old one and close the pump and turn it on, then go clean the filter that is dirty and let it dry for the next changing.  The filter you want is:  Unicel C-5315 Replacement Filter Cartridge for 15 Square Foot Intex B FilterAnyone with a 15 foot round pool from Intex that lives in the south and is having trouble keeping the pool clean... this 2500gph pump is your answer.

"I can't live without these things.  Okay so I grind my teeth at night... what ya gonna do?  I tried everything and hated them all.  So sick and tired of waking up with raw patches on the inside of my cheeks from the expensive adjustable dental guards.  Twenty bucks and the thing wounds me at night... omg I was angry.  Then I saw a bunch of these in the dollar store near my house.  It said overnight disposable and I bought it for just a couple nights relief from the guards that I already owned. That's how desperate I was for ANYTHING else to wear at night.  Not to mention some of those things taste nasty and I'm sure that plastic is HORRIBLE for your health.  So I tried Plackers... OMG Hallelujah.  Never going back again.  I don't care what the box says ... unless you're an extremely aggressive grinder these will last you for months.  So far I've had to change them for losing them, washing one in a pants pocket, the dogs stealing it off the night stand and chewing it up, and a parrot that pulled it out of my hand and promptly bit it into pieces.  Only once have I worn one to the point that it wore out.  I put it in a case with Listerine (Original formula - the gold color) mouth wash to keep it sanitary.  This is the ONLY comfortable mouth guard out of the dozen or so I've tried.  It has no taste.  If you bite down hard your teeth just feel springy resistance that bounces back into shape. I've literally tried to bite through it as hard as I can and I can't do it.  It barely puts a dent in that pad between your back teeth.  The little thin front piece that attaches the two plates is so unnoticeable when you wear it that I had no problem feeling uncomfortable so I couldn't sleep like I had with the other dental guards.  I will NEVER go back to any other guard as long as I have these.  I'm actually entertaining the idea to buy enough boxes to have them for the rest of my life because I fear they will stop making them one day and I'll be desperate again.  That's how much I love Plackers.  No more grinding headaches and tooth pain!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3690YG6RVLDVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GDKH9C#wasThisHelpful","R3690YG6RVLDVV","A27YGMQ79RSZYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27YGMQ79RSZYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Love this yarn.  Pure white that really looks like quality wool / cotton blend but it's poly and machine washes well... and tumble dries too.  Keeps a good shape and has a little more heft and body than Super Saver.  Not much... just a little.  Makes a super warm blanket when worked in a solid stitch.  You may want to note that this yarn doesn't have that ""plastic"" shiny look the Super Saver has. When you compare them the Super Saver just looks poly plastic but this yarn actually looks more expensive than it is.  It is a matte white.  I prefer this white for Christmas projects depicting snow or Santa, etc.  You'll almost never see a slub or a tie off in this yarn.  Out of about 30 skeins I""ve encountered 1 tie off.

"Lovely as always!  This is a bone color yarn that isn't yellow toned but a true bone off white.  I love the texture I get with this yarn over the Super Saver that doesn't even have this color available.  The fabric I crochet with this yarn comes out looking more professional and smooth than Super Saver yarn.  It really looks like wool / cotton blend but it's neither.  It washes and tumble dries well and makes a very warm blanket if you are doing a closed stitch or knitting for a solid material used in warm blankets.  For open work like lace stitches (shells & chains) this yarn holds the pattern shape better than Super Saver.  There is less stretch and slip.  It still glides well on the hook and gives a wonderful even tension.  I've tried it will all types of crochet hooks... including bamboo and wood... it does very well.  I find very few slubs or tie offs in this yarn.  I only have found one tie off yet in a skein and I've probably used about 30 skeins of this brand now.  Over all it's a better quality more expensive looking yarn than Super Saver for about the same price if you shop the sales.  If you are substituting it for Super Saver take into account that this is an every so slightly thicker yarn with more heft.  It is still worsted weight and in almost all cases can be a perfect substitute for Super Saver, but keep in mind its slight difference. This yarn will be a bit more firm with less drape than Super Saver.  I have a summer top pattern that called for Super Saver and I tried this but it had too much body and poofed out from the bodice down like a marshmallow.  The Super Saver top had the proper drape in the baby doll style top so the bodice looked gathered but not puffy.  It's a very slight difference but could be a game changer for some patterns.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LTK3O5KS2M7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JX10HKU#wasThisHelpful","R2LTK3O5KS2M7W","A27YGMQ79RSZYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A27YGMQ79RSZYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because of past antibiotics my teeth are permanently yellowed and so any food stains make it so much worse.  I had given up hope because our dental plan doesn't cover whitening or cosmetic enhancement to counteract the damage from antibiotics. This product removed almost all of my coffee and food stains and brought my teeth to their best look which isn't as bad as I thought it was after all!  I'm so pleased that all the dark areas between my teeth are gone and I'm left with creamy white teeth now... not yellow!  So they didn't get brilliant white like the photos or most others are bragging about... but I'm very happy that it did remove all the actual staining that is possible to remove.  If I didn't have the antibiotic side effects that actually turn the inside of your teeth off white then I'm sure my teeth would be gleaming white right now.  They feel GREAT.  There is plenty product left to keep using it every few weeks to maintain the whiteness.  You have to be careful not to use too much the first time and let your gums get used to the product because it will burn.  I can only tolerate it for 15 minutes.  I was pleased that it comes with 4 dental trays that are super easy to form to your teeth. I haven't used 2 of the trays because the first ones are still perfectly good.  Not sure if the light actually helps or not.  I see no difference.  They also don't tell you if the light is actually UVA light in the proper spectrum for killing bacteria or just some bright blue LEDs. I would be interested to know that.  Proper UVA oral lights are great for after brushing teeth to kill bacteria that will cause tooth staining and decay.  The lights worked well and were much more comfortable than my UVA light I use for sanitizing.  I've had this product for a while and still have enough product to last me many more months.  If I have to guess-timate...  I'd say it's a year's worth of product.  I'd definitely buy this kit again.

"I love my VicTsing!  I've got this one and the newer one as well and both work well.  The only thing is... 10m is more like 5 to 8m for me.  It should be able to play my music very well from my bedroom to my pool in the backyard but it won't.  Unfortunately it's way too burning up hot outside right now to take any electronics like a tablet or phone out to the poolside. So I'm still stuck with the issue of not having any music during the daytime hours. Still... this little beauty has a big bold sound that makes it great for the shower, in the kitchen, and I use it to watch Netflix at night so I don't wake up the whole house blasting the surround sound.

"Works great.  Easy to synch up with my bluetooth speaker so that any sound from any device with a sound jack can play on my speaker.  Great for listening to tunes by the pool from my computer that has no bluetooth.  Conversely it will make any speakers I have that have a headphone jack on them into bluetooth speakers.  So now I can listen to music in the kitchen from my bluetooth smartphone because we have speakers for a TV in the kitchen.  I haven't tried any other uses for it yet but these two.  The battery life seems good.  I watched a marathon of Breaking Bad last weekend and this unit worked for at least 6 straight hours transmitting to my bluetooth speaker.  I also bought another brand of this type device that is much more expensive and I don't see any difference at all.  The other brand boasts a lot of extras to prevent lagging when watching video content (like streaming Netflix) and better battery life.  This JETech unit kept pace with the other brand exactly.  They both function identically, they both have excellent battery life and recharge very fast.  The JETech did not have any latency issues when streaming 6 episodes of my series.  All the sounds matched the video in real time so it was perfect as far as my eyes can tell.  I'm kind of sorry I paid a lot more for the ""fancy"" one now because the JETech is just as good... and it's actually smaller than the fancier one.  Well at least I saved some money getting this one as my second unit because I plan on using them to transmit and receive in tandem so I can listen to my computer music out by the pool on some cool outdoor speakers I got a while back that are hardwired.

NOTHING.All I know is with ONE shampoo my yorkies stopped biting their backs and our cat that had mange on its neck is regrowing hair and stopped scratching.  I did spot cleansing on the other kittens that had the odd fungus stuff under their chins and it's gone in one treatment.

"Came exactly as shown & discreetly packaged. Even my hubby didn't know what it was. It also comes with a colon attachment that I believe is disposable. The hose is silicone and a much wider diameter than my old ""hot water bottle"" set. The fittings do not screw on they push together. I have to say I'm glad I know exactly what tip I'm using for this and will not need the other one because it fits so snug and secure I can't get it back off. I love the wide top that I can get my whole hand inside to wash it out.  The quality of the material everything is made with is very high.  If there is anything I'm unsure about with this product it is how long that little hanging hole is going to last. So far it's fine and doesn't seem too stressed but when I put the hanger on it it feels a bit too flexible (stretchy) and it is very close to the top.  I like that it came with 2 hooks... a big plastic one and a smaller metal one. The clamp to turn it on and shut it off is vastly superior to my old one. It seems like it will last a long time and it has quite a few settings to regulate flow.  I would definitely buy this set again but I doubt I will need to for another 10 to 15 yrs.  It does have a smell but it's not chemical.  It smells kind of like baby powder?

"The Fire TV Stick is way faster than my Roku HD. The UI and the remote itself are very responsive, though I liked the Roku's UI a little better. The included remote does not support voice search, but you can add voice search by buying the fancier remote or installing the Fire TV app on your smartphone or tablet.Usually we watch Amazon Prime on our projector via our smart Blu-Ray player, but when I'm watching something alone or for those rare occasions when we don't want to watch something on the projector, I'll sometimes turn on the TV instead.

They were sort of ok, but they started fogging up after about 2 or 3 miles every time.

"My wife has adult braces and wanted to try one of these out based on a friend's recommendation.  She said it has made it a lot easier to wash all the crud out from around her braces and between her teeth, so she doesn't have to spend as much time using the flosser things.  I've started using the Waterpik Ultra in addition to my normal flossing because I think the two are complementary.  Each one does a better job in some respects, but is not as good as the other in some other respects. For example, flossing goes a great job wiping the scum off the surfaces of your teeth that the toothbrush can't reach, and the Waterpik rinses away gunk from all the nooks and crannies where you cannot floss. I always use a full tank of water--first I make a pass around my entire mouth cleaning around my teeth, then I increase the power and make another pass just hitting my gums.After watching a video review comparing the new WP-660 with this older WP-100 model, we decided to go with the older model which seems to be built and designed better. The only features this older model lacks compared to the WP-660 are the timer and intermittent ""massage"" setting, but I don't see that feature as very useful, and you could mimic it yourself by using the thumb ""stop"" button on the wand. We like the larger storage compartment, longer coiled tube, heavier construction, and better wand holder.The only thing I dislike about the Waterpik Ultra is that the pump controls are on the base unit rather than the wand, but I understand this is a simpler and more reliable design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DEIFB1F72AKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GLRREU#wasThisHelpful","R2DEIFB1F72AKR","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately this mixer's bowl is narrower and deeper than those of our other mixers, so the bowl and paddle are not interchangeable with any of our other mixers. When I tried retrofitting this mixer with the bowl lift from a broken mixer to use the standard 6-Qt bowl and paddle, the paddle scraped the bowl.

"I ordered this clip-on double loupe for part of my wife's costume for an upcoming steampunk event at a nearby historic railroad and museum, but I'll also use them to examine the cutting edges of my woodworking hand tools and for removing splinters.These loupes seem to work ok for the price, but the product photo is inaccurate and the description does not seem to be accurate.  The bar for each loupe extends past the main shaft, making it easy to flip each loupe up or down.  Despite the product description which claims 5x and 10x magnification, the package says 3x and 10x.  Elsewhere the package claims there are two 3x lenses, which would produce 3x and 9x magnification levels. I don't have another loupe for comparison, so I can't say for certain what the actual magnification powers are.

"You might be wondering why there are so many people who say these magnetic featherboards work great and can practically lift a table saw, while there are so many who say they slide around or lift right off. I'm pretty sure the distinguishing factor is that some of these people's saws have nice thick cast iron tables and the others have thinner steel tables.My table saw and bandsaw have thick cast iron tables, and the pair of 150lbs magswitches will still slide once engaged, but they require a fair amount of force. I think the force required to slide them is greater than the force you would typically apply with a featherboard anyway.I've also tried it on thinner steel surfaces with disappointing results. For example, on my steel front door, refrigerator, and even on the steel casings on a couple tools, it required almost no force to slide the featherboard around, and it was also relatively easy to lift the featherboard off the surface even when the switches were locked on.If your saw has a steel table instead of cast iron, I suspect you'll be sorely disappointed with this starter kit. And of course, magnets don't stick to materials such as aluminum and granite, so if your tool's table is made of any non-ferrous material you shouldn't even be looking at magswitch-based accessories. But if you have a nice thick cast iron table, this thing will stay put well enough.If you want a Magswitch featherboard, they're all expensive but this one is the most versatile because you can remove the mag switches and attach them to your own jigs or fixtures. If you use the included multipurpose base and featherboard attachment, you can flip the featherboard around to use with a table saw or bandsaw in the typical configurations, or to use it with the table saw fence on either side of the blade. Magswitch Technology also offers several accessories for this featherboard, such as a resaw guide and vertical featherboard adapter, though for the price you might be tempted to make your own attachments.The main thing I don't like about Magswitch products (or most magnetic accessories, for that matter) is the price. Even when it goes on sale, this kit only goes down to $60.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14I2DPMPUH9XA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AO3IJM#wasThisHelpful","R14I2DPMPUH9XA","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this activity tracker because I was disappointed with the Garmin Vivofit and wanted to see how the cheaper Pivotal Tracker 1 compared. My wife and I both tried this simultaneously with the Vivofit and both bands gave similar step counts. Given the price difference, buying the Pivotal Tracker is a no-brainer if you have a compatible smartphone, assuming you don't wind up having the static shock problem. Even though it requires an annual subscription, it would take at least 6 years to equal the cost of most competing wristband-type activity trackers. But on the downside, it isn't compatible with my phone so I had to sync with my wife's phone.  It's also really uncomfortable to wear (compared to the Vivofit), and it reset on its own numerous times before I decided to send it back (apparently due to static shock).My wife also tried the Pivotal Tracker and although it stayed put on her wrist when adjusted to the smallest size, there was about a 3/4"" or larger gap on either side of her wrist because the rigid part of the band is significantly wider than her wrist.  This device is definitely not for people with small wrists.What I like:- Cheap!- OLED screen is readable in the dark- Wristband doesn't immediately fall off if it accidentally gets unsnapped- Somewhat works as a standalone pedometerWhat I don't like:- The device sometimes randomly resets (apparently due to static shock)- Device lost my data on several occasions (when I synced, the app didn't show any data for the previous day)--maybe this was related to the random resets- Screen not bright enough outside- Requires a relatively new phone (iPhone 4S or newer, or a late 2013 or newer Android phone running Android 4.3 or newer)- Not compatible with laptops- Wristband is ""one-size-fits-all"" (i.e., made to fit a very large wrist)- Wristband is uncomfortable- Recommended charging procedure is a hassle (instructions warn NOT to charge it overnight)- It's effectively a disposable device which you can replace every year with your subscription renewal, but the company doesn't offer a recycling program- If purchased directly from Pivotal Fitness, the company itself does not allow you to return it for a refund under any circumstances (though they will offer an exchange if the band is defective)--so if you want to try it out despite all the known issues, make sure you buy through Amazon so there's at least some hope of returning it if it doesn't work for you.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JY8IUSAZIR11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q8KDU6C#wasThisHelpful","R2JY8IUSAZIR11","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This cord winder is NOT a wonder.  When it's cold out, the rubber winding wheel doesn't grip the cord and fails to wind it at all.  The hand crank requires you to place the Wonder Winder someplace within arm's reach, so it isn't as handy as a self-retracting cord reel.Also, I need to look at mine again because I must have assembled it wrong or must be using it wrong.  I had assumed one-hand operation to wind a cord, but I have to pull and hold the top lever to push the cord against the winding wheel, which is kind of a pain and further limits placement.  But even if I do manage to resolve this issue, the product is still a dud if it can't wind up a cord when it's cold out.Once I started to question its usefulness in my garage shop, I thought I'd try salvaging it by using it as a portable cord winder.  Whenever I see my wife using the ""around-the-arm"" technique to coil a cord (which damages the cord over time), I try showing her how to properly coil a cord.  She inevitably gets annoyed at me because the over-under technique hasn't ""clicked"" for her yet and she doesn't have the patience to keep trying until it does.  I thought the Wonder Winder could help this situation whenever she needs an extension cord outside.  My wife does prefer using the Wonder Winder this over any hand-coiling technique, but the whole assembly is really clunky to use in this way so I ended up buying an extension cord storage reel instead.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2205PMR3Y4C8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005A1K1#wasThisHelpful","R2205PMR3Y4C8X","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Irwin's XP600 line is a huge step up from their wimpier SL300 line, but these clamps aren't great for woodworking and are overpriced considering you can get top-of-the-line parallel clamps for the same price.  The SL300s are good for holding jigs and stop blocks in place.  The XP600s have a lot more clamping power, and they work great for general clamping or spreading.  They're probably good for rough carpentry but I don't have any experience in that area.However, if you're a woodworker these are not the clamps to stock up on. They'll work fine with cauls but they don't function very well on their own as parallel clamps for glue-ups, even with the rubbery plastic throat extensions for the jaws.  It wouldn't hurt to have a couple of these clamps for the convenience of their one-handed operation, but you're better off buying some Jet parallel (K-body) clamps during one of the 50% off sales, if you can hold off until Black Friday or one of the other big sales throughout the year.Of course, you also obviously won't want to use them for welding because they're plastic and they'll melt.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MSSMXI14PU0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001V5ZCGA#wasThisHelpful","R2MSSMXI14PU0C","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I'm no costume designer but the look and fit of this shirt are genuine enough that I think a casual observer would be hard-pressed to notice any flaws in your costume if you decided to film your own new TNG fan series.  Black threads are visible at the seams, but I think that's forgivable for an article in the $25-$30 price range.  I like that the pips are actual pins rather than stickers or embroidered on, and that they include a little reference sheet so you know which ones to use for a given rank or character, in case your memory is a bit rusty or you didn't quite pay attention to those subtle details.  The communicator pin is a heavy rubbery pin, and mine is poorly-painted...but hey, it's still better than a cheesy embroidered-on design, and I suppose I could always touch it up.I have a hard time describing the fit based on Amazon's answer options to the question, ""How does this product fit?""  I'm a 6'1"", 175 lbs man with a slight belly and the medium shirt fits well except for the weird armpits.  It's hard to describe, but I think the armpits of the shirt basically extend further down the side of the shirt in order to produce a sleeker look, so when you lift your arms it feels like you're pulling the side outward a little.  Imagine a flying squirrel spreading out its limbs--okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you probably get the point.  Based on the sizing chart, I think the small definitely would have been too small, and I suspect the large probably would have been baggy.  Then again, with free returns I probably should have ordered 2 or 3 sizes and sent back whatever didn't fit.I understand that I'm a bit biased, but I think the shirt looks great on me if I suck in my gut a little and don't raise my arms any higher than the guy in Amazon's product picture (he has his hands on his hips).  It feels like if I lift my arms much higher than that, the armpits or sides will rip open.  I also understand now why the TNG crew constantly have to tug their shirts down.  The elastic at the bottom of the shirt is probably supposed to hold the shirt down at your waist, but what really happens is that every time you lift your arms or take a deep breath (thus lifting your diaphragm), the shirt rides up your torso and the elastic prevents it from sliding back down.  For better or worse, this shirt seems almost *too* authentic!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F3FAXQM41N92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0029F1X0U#wasThisHelpful","R2F3FAXQM41N92","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say, I feel more than a little ripped off by Festool with this interface pad.  This product is nothing more than a squishy lightweight foam (like that used to package electronic components) sandwiched between two respective pieces of hook-and-loop material.  Oh, and it has the hole pattern cut for dust collection.Does it work?  Yeah, sure, it helps but it doesn't seem very durable.  But the box it came in probably cost just as much to produce as the materials for the interface pad itself.  The materials couldn't have cost Festool more than $.25, yet they charge $24 for the interface pad--that's an obscene markup, even for Festool.  I don't know, maybe getting the hook-and-loop layers to adhere at all to the foam was an engineering nightmare and they have to charge so much because they don't sell very many.  Even at $6 it would be overpriced, but I wouldn't feel like I had been scammed.I guess I'll see how long it lasts, but if I need another one after it wears out, I'll just try making my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQ7F69EA0XYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0039X73H8#wasThisHelpful","R1DQ7F69EA0XYI","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought my wife a Garmin Vivofit because it seemed the easiest to use and requires less maintenance than all the other options.What I like:- Low maintenance: you only have to replace the battery once a year- Waterproof, so you can shower with it- Includes an extra rubber clasp to help keep it from falling off (which was apparently a problem early on)- Includes 2 sizes of wrist bands- Multi-function LCD shows step count,- Includes USB dongle to sync with a laptop, in case you don't have a smartphone or your smartphone isn't supportedWhat I don't like:- Grossly exaggerates your step count by a random amount- PC application didn't save workout details that my wife entered- Doesn't have a vibrate modeUnfortunately, the first dislike in the list is enough to ruin this product.  The entire point of an activity tracker is to record how much exercise you get, but the numbers are completely inconsistent.When my wife used it for a few days, it consistently logged more than 16,000 steps a day.  On days when she *didn't* go to the gym, it counted more than 20,000 steps.  I thought perhaps we could figure out a baseline and just ignore the first 15,000 steps or so, but if it records more steps when she doesn't exercise, how can she even begin to set goals?It recorded more than 10,000 steps during a day when when I mostly spent my afternoon sitting or standing in one place at a basketball game, and had very little physical activity outside of that.  I'm pretty sure the most sedentary couch potato could reach Garmin's default goal of 7500 steps during the course of a day.  The kicker?  It counted 30 steps when I put on my socks, and another 20 steps when I put on my shoes.I contacted Garmin about the inaccuracy, and they said it's an activity tracker and cannot differentiate between a step and other motion such as driving, brushing your teeth, or cooking.  Maybe I expected too much, but I had assumed if all the fitness band manufacturers were reporting ""number of steps"" that implied they had some advanced software algorithms capable of distinguishing different types of activities.  I'm tempted to try a few more types of fitness bands to see how they compare, along with a standard pedometer as a control, but I'm hoping I can find someone else who's already run that experiment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36H6WYEMA0N4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HFPOXM4#wasThisHelpful","R36H6WYEMA0N4R","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this particular model because of the large display, and because it handles imperial units in both decimal and fractions, as well as metric.  The deciding factor was its performance in a side-by-side comparison with a much more expensive digital caliper.I don't have anything else by which to gauge this caliper's accuracy, but at the very least it seems to get consistent, precise readings.  The jaws aren't perfectly parallel, but they're certainly close enough, especially considering that I'm using this for woodworking.  If I measure a piece of paper with the tip vs. at the inside (near the bar), I get ever-so-slightly different readings, but the difference is within the tolerance specified in the user manual.One nice feature is that the caliper remembers its position even when turned off--that is, you don't necessarily have to zero it each time you turn it on.  Maybe this is standard on digital calipers, but I expected the tool to automatically zero each time it's turned off and on, regardless of the jaws' position.  I'm glad that's not the case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AWITRZXHSH0D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AQEZ2W#wasThisHelpful","R2AWITRZXHSH0D","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The instructions say to crush the swab at both ends and shake it twice, then squeeze until yellow liquid comes out of the end.  This is where the problems start.  The liquid is a tiny dot of brown, not yellow as stated in the instructions.  After rubbing it on the test surface, the entire tip turns brown.  It's supposed to turn pink or red if there's lead, but the brown color makes it difficult to tell whether there's any red.

"I bought this Braun/Oral-B Professional Care power toothbrush to replace my previous Philips SoniCare toothbrush.  Although the brush heads are equally expensive, the Oral-B was sealed much better and did not succumb to moisture that seeped inside and eventually shorted out the electronics, which is what killed my SoniCare toothbrush.At first I was disappointed that the Oral-B toothbrush's head didn't spin/vibrate as fast as my previous SoniCare, but I quickly found that it had much better reach inside my mouth, and could really clean every little crevice, nook, and cranny around my teeth and gums.  Overall, the Oral-B's maneuverability allowed me to get my teeth a lot cleaner.I tried some generic toothbrush heads to save on cost, but the bristles were much harder than those of the genuine Oral-B brush heads.  (Ideally, you want to use the softest brush possible to help avoid damaging your tooth enamel.)Alas, after almost ten years of faithful service, the Lithium Ion battery no longer holds a charge.

"By today's standards, this 256 MB flash drive is a relic.  Although it supports USB 2.0, the write speeds were are only okay if you're writing large files.  It's horrible at writing many small files.The Cruzer Mini isn't very ""mini"" compared to more recent models, some of which are smaller than my thumbnail.  On the bright side, that means it's a lot harder to lose.  But the downside is that you have this huge ""lever"" hanging out of your USB port.  Its plastic shell is acceptable, but it certainly isn't very rugged.  My boss accidentally smashed one in his car door, and of course it was damaged beyond repair.  (A few of us at the office each chipped in a couple bucks and gave him a tougher model with a titanium shell after that incident.)My biggest gripe, however, is that the cap is easy to lose--which I'm sure is the main reason why they include three caps in the package.  And the more you remove and reattach the cap, the looser it gets over time.  The lanyard is nice, but I've never really been one to wear a lanyard around my neck unless I'm at a conference.  You certainly wouldn't want to attach this flash drive to your keys, because the little tab that's meant for the lanyard is just plastic and will break off in your pocket.All in all, it's okay compared to other models of the same vintage, but even back in 2004, there were other models that held up better on your keychain, were more compact, and didn't have such an easy-to-lose cap.

"If you've walked down the oral hygiene aisle in the store lately, you've probably noticed that there's pretty much no such thing as a standard tube of toothpaste any more.

Both the older model and newer model seem to work best if you make the maximum-sized batch.

"I bought this for our vintage travel trailer.  The ball part fits up into the coupler and the shackle goes down over the top.  Our trailer's coupler, the closing mechanism has a lever with a loop on the end, and the loop pushes down right where the shackle goes.  With a little finagling I can route the shackle through the loop so that the closing mechanism is locked onto the ball, in addition to the coupler lock's normal locking method.The only thing I'd change is that I would prefer to have a lock without a universal ball.  Because the universal fit, the lock fits kind of loose in a 2"" coupler, so in order to lock it snug on your coupler, you have to squeeze the shackle and lock body together while locking it.  It would be nicer if you could just replace the ball on the lock, that way it would fit snug on its own and you wouldn't have to hold the body of the lock up against the bottom of the coupler while turning the key to lock it.The lock has a lot of angled and rounded surfaces so it should be somewhat impact resistant, though I'm sure anyone who wants a trailer badly enough would figure out a way to break or otherwise defeat the lock.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C79BG0MNU7UK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OC3Q2I#wasThisHelpful","R3C79BG0MNU7UK","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the Bosch Vertical Quick Clamp for use in my Kobalt (Lowe's-exclusive brand) 10-in sliding compound miter saw.  In some ways it's an improvement over the clamp that came with the saw, but in other ways it's a step backward.The clamp is such a simple device that there's not much to say about it, but I'll start with the good.  The quick toggle lets you quickly release and clamp items of the same thickness.  With my old clamp, I had to turn the adjustment knob several times to loosen and tighten the clamp enough to swap in a different piece.Unfortunately, all of the thought went into the toggle mechanism, leaving shortcomings in other areas.  The only adjustment possible is the threaded part.  On my other clamp, there's a hex screw that I can loosen and tighten for quick coarse adjustments.  If most of your material is the same thickness, the lack of a quicker coarse adjustment won't be an issue and this clamp will save you time.  But if you often work with materials of different thicknesses on a given project, I highly recommend making shims of several different thicknesses to use for coarse adjustment.The other drawbacks might only apply to me because I don't have a Bosch miter saw, but I think they're worth explaining anyway in case someone else wants to use this clamp on a non-Bosch saw.  Although the Bosch Vertical Quick Clamp  fits into the clamp holders on my Kobalt saw, it just barely fits.  The diamond-textured part of the shaft is actually slightly larger in diameter than the smooth part of the shaft, so although I'm sure it's more than adequate, it just doesn't feel as secure without as much of the shaft in the clamp holder.  I'm also a little concerned about the diamond texture itself scraping the paint off of my saw around the clamp holders.  Update: also tried the clamp in a DEWALT DW715 15-Amp 12-Inch Compound Miter saw and it does fit better in that saw because of the larger, tapered clamp holes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34WVRNOAQJNBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AO4TC6#wasThisHelpful","R34WVRNOAQJNBJ","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Belkin 12-outlet surge protector is awesome--there really isn't much room for improvement.What I like:- 12 outlets, so you can plug in a ton of stuff- 6 of the outlets can accommodate the chunky brick/wall wart power adapters- flat plug only requires about an inch of clearance (great for plugging in behind furniture)- swivel plug lets you angle the cord off to either side- phone and coax surge protection- inexpensiveWhat I don't like:- Middle strip of outlets can be blocked by especially chunky wall warts plugged in along sides- Some of the outlet safety covers are too hard to slide and others slide too easily (not a serious issue for me, but it might be an issue if you have kids)- doesn't have RJ45 (Ethernet) surge protection--though there might be a different model which does have thisOne thing that I'm not sure about is the design of the surge protection circuit.  I've always used Panamax surge protectors on my more expensive electronics like my desktop PC and my home theater equipment, because Panamax physically disconnects the power when the surge protector finally blows and is no longer capable of absorbing a surge.  As of a few years ago, most other brands, including the well-known brands like APC, did not disconnect the power to any plugged-in devices after the surge protector exhausted its surge protection capacity.  I'm not sure which surge protection design the Belkin uses, but for most applications it should be adequate--and if it isn't, you can always file a warranty claim with Belkin or file a homeowner's insurance claim.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM0JXSYSO0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000J2EN4S#wasThisHelpful","RM0JXSYSO0O","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I put this DVD in my DVD player and pressed Play, it just went through an hour and forty-three minutes of deleted scenes.  (Ba-dum-bum)  But seriously, folks, if you've ever wondered what it would be like to watch a movie almost entirely composed of deleted scenes that shouldn't go into the special features (let alone, the final script), you can stop wondering, because Grown Ups 2 is just that.  If you haven't seen the first Grown Ups, watch that one and forget this sequel ever existed.  If you did see the first Grown Ups and expect a coherent follow-up in the sequel, you're in for a big disappointment.Grown Ups 2 is a continuous sequence of mostly-lame gags, though there were a few genuinely funny parts that did did make us laugh.  There are no deleted scenes in the special features, because if they had deleted everything that should have been deleted, they would have only had enough material left to make a 3-5 minute webisode around each of the handful of funny bits.  There were two or three times in the last half hour where I thought they were finally setting up a big, incredible adventure, but it never materialized.  I guess I was okay with that, because the movie was already dragging on forever and starting the adventure at that point would have made it even longer.SPOILER ALERT=============The premise of Grown Ups 2 is that all four guys (three of whom are married with kids) have moved back to the hometown where they grew up, and now on the last day of school they're collectively having another mid-life crisis.  David Spade's character is set up as the worst off, having a teenage punk kid visiting from out of town--a son which the all-but-forgotten mother only told him about over the phone a couple days prior.  Supposedly the kid is in high school, but he looks like he's in his twenties.  Spade's character tries makes some wisecracks in an attempt to bond.  The kid obviously doesn't like him from the start but is willing to give him a chance.The four friends go back to their old hang-out spot so one of the guys can jump off a cliff into a lake (something which he always managed to find an excuse not to do back when they were  young) and finally earn his man card.  But there are a bunch of college kids hanging out at the lake, and up on the cliff the four grown-up male friends encounter a bunch of stereotypical fraternity jerks.could say the theme of the movie was ""bullies.""  Insults ensue, the four guys get ready to fight, then one of the frat boys makes a cheesy battle cry and an army of frat boys jumps out from behind bushes and rocks, surrounding the four doomed friends.  Frat boys make them jump off the cliff naked one at a time, with the other college party kids watching from the lower level of rocks on the other side of the water.  Kevin James lands on David Spade, who then cries, disgustedly, ""I was inside of you!""The middle part of the movie is basically a bunch of half-baked attempts at humor, desperately hoping the audience keeps watching until the two big showdowns at the end--it's almost like they didn't have a single professional comedy writer or script writer on the crew.Near the end, Sandler's character throws a big party.  The first showdown is with the main bully from Sandler's past (bully played by none other than Stone Cold Steve Austin).  This part is pretty much the one good bit of writing in the entire movie.  Sandler wants to teach his son how to be a man and stand up to bullies.  Upon hearing this, Austin's character (who has been a huge jerk the entire movie) can finally relate to Sandler and immediately hatches a plan--Sandler can punch him, and he'll go down like a sack of bricks.  The plan changes a bit as the two chat in their boxing poses, and eventually Stone Cold is cowering and pleading for mercy.  Sandler continues his trash talk to milk the situation for all it's worth, and then some.  After that situation is resolved, the frat boys show up for revenge because someone previously trashed their frat house and they assume it's the four Grown Ups whom they shamed earlier at the lake.  (As it turns out, Spade's son was the one who vandalized the frat house, but  nobody cares at this point.)  Everyone gets in a big fight which the ""townies"" eventually win, a little later there are some warm fuzzy moments, and finally the credits roll.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24TEH63ITAU1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FNSR0M0#wasThisHelpful","R24TEH63ITAU1I","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mine is bigger than yours.  Yeah, you read that right.  How big is your TV?  50""?  60""?  Maybe 75"" if you really splurged?  Well, just for comparison, my 170"" screen gives me a larger picture than a 3x3 grid of 50"" TVs.  That's more than 9x the screen size of the most common ""big screen"" TVs.When I was going to replace my old 24"" tube TV, I had a few options and didn't like any of them.  For $500, I could buy a 32"" TV, for $800 I could get a 40"" TV, and for $1200-$1500 I could get a 50"" TV--which seemed obscene to me.  I couldn't see myself ponying up even $800 for my minimum ""desired"" TV sizewhen I could get 9x the size for not much more by going with a projector.  I ended up settling on a 32"" TV and a projector...now the only thing left was to choose the projector.At first I was going to buy one of the sub-$1000 projectors that had just hit the market, but they all had a relatively short throw and poor mounting options--I would have had to have an ugly appendage sticking out of the middle of my living room ceiling, and it would have been a pain to run the electrical and video connections to that spot.  I started looking into projectors with lens shift and a longer throw and longer zoom range, and soon realized I would have to increase my budget for the projector to about $1300-$1400.  My plan was to mount the projector on the back wall above the entrance to my living room.  I didn't plan on really needing the lens shift, I wanted it just because it seemed like it would make setup a little easier and because I could shift the image down (vertically) by a little bit instead of having to deal with distortion and keystone correction.Using the calculators at ProjectorCentral.com, I narrowed down my options to the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 720 LCD projector and a competing Mitsubishi DLP projector.  Although I don't suffer from the condition that causes some people to get headaches and nausea when watching a DLP picture, I didn't want any guests to feel less than awesome when watching movies at my place.  I ended up snagging a sweet deal on the Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 720 on sale for less than $1000, and cashback and a free (by mail) replacement bulb brought the cost of the projector itself down to around $600 (after factoring in ~$300 for the replacement bulb).It wasn't until I tried to ""temporarily"" set up the projector immediately upon getting it home that I began to truly appreciate just how much versatility lens shift adds to a projector.  I set the projector on top of my DVD shelf in the back left corner of my living room.  All I had to do was aim the projector straight forward, level it, then fiddle with the zoom and a couple of dials (horizontal and vertical lens shift) to perfectly size and line up the picture!  For the uninitiated, lens shift lets you turn a dial to literally shift the rectangular image up or down (or left or right) without distorting it.  You can literally put the projector anywhere in the room, so long as the throw distance and zoom range allow you to properly size the image for your screen.  *This* is why you find some people on audio visual systems forums who insist on having a projector with lens shift.That initial temporary setup worked so well, I gave up on the idea of putting the projector on a shelf above the entrance in the back of the room and left the projector on top of the DVD shelf.  Eventually I moved the DVD shelf to the back right corner of the room so people walking in and out of the living room couldn't walk in front of the projector beam as easily.  Now if you're just heading for a couch, you pretty much don't bother anyone else who's trying to watch the show.The picture is incredible...and did I mention enormous?  The blacks are a bit muted, but that's to be expected with an LCD projector.  It's true that the colors won't be quite as vibrant as those from a high-quality HDTV, but everything looks great nonetheless.  And from the couch about 20 feet away (heck, even from the one that's 10 feet away), 720p still looks pretty sharp.  DVDs, Blu-ray, and streaming Amazon Video and Crackle via my Roku HD (which maxes out at 720p anyway) look good enough that I'm starting to wonder if I'll be able to skip 1080p and jump to a 4k projector a few more years down the road.  I've also played VHS tapes on the projector, but--as you might expect--the picture was so fuzzy and lacking in detail that I almost might as well have been watching without my eyeglasses.The main downside, picture-wise, is that I need to supplement my living room curtain with another layer or two of blankets or sheets if I want to watch something on the projector when it's really bright outside.  Alternatively, I could turn up the brightness of the projector's lamp, but that reduces the lamp's life and causes the fan to run much faster (i.e., much louder).  Although the projector has almost every type of home theater video input that has been commonly used in the US since before the turn of the century (HDMI, VGA, SCART, component, S-video, and composite), it would be nice if it could output a digital audio stream to my receiver (which is still a great 7.1 receiver but predates HDMI).Several years after buying this projector, I still think it was one of my best big-ticket purchases.  Even though it's a little outdated, it still puts up a great picture and impresses guests.  And because we don't have an eyesore hanging down from the middle of our ceiling (thanks to the lens shift and long throw), most visitors can't even figure out where the picture is coming from until we point it out in the back corner of the room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JTKSZSNF88CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000YNS0D2#wasThisHelpful","R2JTKSZSNF88CP","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

About 3-6 minutes later (depending on whether you pressed the button for ""fresh"" or ""set-in"") you can empty and rinse the dirty tank and put the machine away.What I like:- easy to use- no excuse not to clean up the mess right away- works ok on fresh messes- completely automatic: start it and walk away- onboard hose and accessory tool storage works wellWhat I don't like:- doesn't work very well on set-in messes- leaves the floor much wetter than our full-size Hoover Dual-V carpet cleaner- just as noisy as our full-size carpet cleaner- power cord storage works okay, but could be improvedMost of my likes and dislikes above are pretty self-explanatory.  We've tried it with both hot and cold water, and the temperature of the water doesn't seem to make much difference in the machine's ability to clean up a set-in mess.  I'd recommend pretreating with a foaming or spray carpet cleaner if you have a set-in stain.Unfortunately, after using it on the living room carpet, I kept stepping on the spot that had been cleaned, and for more than a day it continued to make my socks wet whenever I stepped on it.A minor gripe is that the power cord storage isn't as good as it could be.  If you wrap the cord in a circle around the two storage pegs, the cord will get twisted and over time will become damaged internally.  It's too difficult to use the over-under cord coiling technique.  If you wrap the cord in a figure-8 around the pegs in an attempt to keep the cord from twisting, it starts to bulge out too much in the middle of the figure-8, and the loops of the figure-8 can come off of the pegs.The Spotbot also has a manual brush, and while it can be somewhat useful for trying to scrub in corners where the spotbot itself can't reach, the manual brush isn't anything special.  But at least it's on par with the other portable spot cleaners.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NT18JF59KCP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00450U7QS#wasThisHelpful","R2NT18JF59KCP4","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intel has a reputation for making reliable SSDs, and their best-in-industry 5-year warranty backs that up.  I've used the following SSDs:Crucial M4 256 GB - laptop boot drive (Windows 7)Intel 520 Series 240 GB - laptop boot drive (Windows 7)Samsung 840 PRO 256 GB - tethered via USB to host external VMware VMsIntel 530 Series 240 GB - laptop boot drive (Windows 8.1)I replaced the Crucial with the Intel 520 after a month or two because my laptop was crashing, but I now think the crashing was the result of a defective secondary SATA cable in my laptop.  Over the course of about a year with the Intel 520, my laptop would occasionally fail to boot with a ""No bootable media found"" error when I powered it on.  Power-cycling the laptop always solved the issue, so I'm not sure if it was a problem with Windows, some quirk related to the SSD, or the laptop itself.  For several months now, I've been storing my many VMware VMs on an external Samsung 840 PRO and the VMs run as fast as if I were running the guest OSes natively on my laptop.So, what about the Intel 530?  I haven't done any formal benchmarking, but I can say that, in practical terms, it's just as fast as the Crucial M4 and the Intel 520, if not faster.  So far I haven't had the weird temporary ""No bootable media found"" boot hiccup with the 530, but I'll update my review if it does come up.Since I haven't used the Samsung 840 PRO as my boot drive, I can't give any direct comparison between that and the Intel 530, although the spec sheets suggest the Samsung is considerably faster.The SSD is only 7mm thick, but if you buy the retail kit, it contains an adhesive shim to make the SSD fit into a 9mm slot.  This is a slight downgrade from the Intel 520 series, which included a screw-on shim.  Both the 530 and 520 series also include the 3.5"" mounting adapter and the silly ""Speed Demon"" sticker.As with the 520 series, the 530 series performs background optimization of free space--in other words, while TRIM is supported, it's not required in order to preserve performance (assuming the drive is not constantly under 100% load).Although there are faster SSDs on the market, if you just want to buy a current-generation SSD (as of 11/2013) manufactured by a company with a proven history of reliability, this drive is a no-brainer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX0ZKQSZPISSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DTPYT78#wasThisHelpful","RX0ZKQSZPISSJ","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, these are a great value.  I ordered them on Nov 12 and the estimated delivery window was Dec 9-Dec 26, but the USPS delivered them at the beginning of the delivery window.We use Square Register for the cash register at our store, and people prefer signing with a stylus instead of their fingers.  Some people expect the tip to be hard instead of soft, so it throws them off at first, but otherwise these work fine.  Aside from the color selection, these styluses are identical to the brand-name Targus stylus that sells for $15 in stores.  Just as with the Targus, the tips eventually tear and render the stylus useless, but each one usually lasts us at least a few months.  At about $0.14 each, that's not much more expensive than a BIC pen, but you don't have to deal with a finicky pen.The only thing I really hate about these things is that I keep having to throw away the aluminum stylus rods after the tips wear out.

"We use this scale at our bakery/restaurant.  For a while, our products were baking up inconsistently because sometimes the kitchen staff would get distracted and lose track of how many cups of an ingredient they had added.  Now they just set the bowl on the scale, zero it, fill it with the first ingredient until it's close to the prescribed amount, zero it again, add the second ingredient, and so on.Occasionally the measurement will fluctuate by a fraction of an ounce (or gram), but let's be realistic--for the ingredients that you weigh, you're not going to ruin a recipe by adding a tiny fraction of an ounce too much or too little of anything unless you're trying to prepare an unreasonably-small batch.  The quantities of any recipe are always fudged into nice ratios of convenient units.  It's not like all the eggs in a carton are guaranteed to be within 0.01 oz of one another, after all.The scale is a nice, easy-to-use machine and the units are easy to read.  We tape plastic wrap around the front of the scale to make it easier to clean and to keep powdery ingredients from working their way inside.Unfortunately, this is our third scale of this type in about 3 years because we keep wearing out the buttons.  It isn't made for commercial use, and I'm sure it won't last any longer than the others--but it will be put through a lot more punishment in our commercial kitchen than it will in anyone's home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JONUJ5Y8ZSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E7AZQA#wasThisHelpful","R1JONUJ5Y8ZSA","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't know anything about trailers or hitches until I started shopping for a trailer and hitch for our 2009 Chevy HHR.  This one is identical to several other brands and mounts firmly to the frame.I had to buy a step drill bit to slightly enlarge the rear passenger-side mounting hole on the car frame.  In hindsight, I probably could have gotten a (much cheaper) 1/2"" grinding bit instead.The most difficult part of installation was properly torquing the forward driver's side bolt, because it was hard to get a good angle between the muffler and the bolt with my non-ratcheting torque wrench.This kit comes with everything you need except the ball, a locking pin for the receiver, and a lock for the trailer ball latch.  If I had thought of it sooner, I would have bought a replacement Euro-style drawbar with the welded-on ball for a little more security (I'll probably do that anyway sometime further down the road).  On the other hand, if you pull several trailers which require different-size balls, you can save a few bucks by using the included drawbar and just swapping the ball instead of having a drawbar for each ball.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I8DVT9YSYUKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JF0RWM#wasThisHelpful","R1I8DVT9YSYUKL","ARUDTZ5BNUHA6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ARUDTZ5BNUHA6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased my first air pump in the 1970s. I believe it was a Rena 100. I later added a Rena 200. I wish I still had one. These pumps were small, quiet, powerful, and lasted forever.Fast-forward to 2015, this Tetra pump replaces a $10 pump from Walmart that lasted 5 months and then rattled into pieces. I had it suspended on a rubber band inside the aquarium cabinet. It was not silent, but the noise was tolerable and it could only be heard around the tank.I suspended the Tetra pump as well but it took two rubber bands. The odd shape of the housing gives it a large footprint. There is limited shelf space in the cabinet and this was necessary. It isn't really designed for suspension, but it worked.For those not realizing this - you have to connect tubing to both outputs, otherwise it will be loud i.e. emitting noise not just vibration.The pump's vibrations are of a lower frequency than the inexpensive pump and the vibrations result in a low but omnipresent humming noise. The vibrations travel through the framing of the house and can be felt 3 rooms away and from the basement to the 2nd floor. I am really not impressed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF9J39OK0ZTPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PB8SNQ#wasThisHelpful","RF9J39OK0ZTPF","A33IJGLTVS5MDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33IJGLTVS5MDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These shoes make me trip a lot over my own feet.The quality seems to be a problem as well, but after only wearing them for a day I can't say yet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XPDYI1EVZUOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRGYLK6#wasThisHelpful","R2XPDYI1EVZUOD","A33IJGLTVS5MDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33IJGLTVS5MDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All-plastic item that looks and feels a bit better and sturdier than comparably priced products I have seen in local stores. The stand is metal, though. I ordered a 2nd one for the big party next week. I have seen replacement spigots here on Amazon - comforting to know for when it should become necessary.The one-star deduction is for the design of the ice insert - it is too small and only reaches down about 1/3 of the height of the dispenser. It will keep cooling the air inside the container after the first few drinks have been dispensed, which is better than nothing. Unless you want to pour ice directly into the drink and dilute it with water, you'll need a better solution.Overall, I think this is a good value and I would purchase another one myself. For the dinner party where we serve the food on fine china I would use something nicer.PS: So the 2nd unit came and I am disappointed. It was missing the protective plastic shoes but came with two spigots. Go figure. I had some extra plastic shoes from the first unit that I used. It has a big, very visible scratch in the front going down from the top edge. And why does a set of two cost more than two individual ones? Again, go figure.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R320V46JAS5C24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNQWPX6#wasThisHelpful","R320V46JAS5C24","A33IJGLTVS5MDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33IJGLTVS5MDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It reminds me of self-published books.The anecdotal background stories are old lore and the recipes are ok, but you will need another source for comparing ingredients and cooking processes - this one is not complete enough nor is it free of errors and it cannot be your only reference.

"I ordered two of these in different colors and from different sellers. I received 3 - the seller in China must have mixed up the shipping. The ones that came from China had a ""free gift"" included - a stylus and a whistle(?).I removed the screen protectors from the iPad 4s and in they went. Like someone else here I noticed the oily pattern that forms between the case and the screen at first when pressure was applied. This could have been residue from the old screen protectors. After removing the front again and wiping the screen and the inside of the front cover with a micro fiber cloth, this no longer happens.The process of inserting the iPad into the case requires a bit of strength - the white clips can be stubborn - and takes time. You will not want to do take it out of the case often.The kids complained that they have to remove the rubber flap that covers the rear camera before they can take a picture. They reported that this piece was the first to break on their friend's cases.The screen protectors are not the same quality as regular screen protectors - they get easily scratched. It does appear, though, that this is a popular case for school iPads because of its simple design.

"I purchased the camera a few months ago for 30% more than what it is listed now, but did not have time to install it until recently. Today, at under $100, this camera is even more attractive. I have been using IP cameras around the house for nearly 15 years now. With the DS-2CD2332-I I can finally say that I have a good product that is worth the money.I am using it outside, mounted to the ceiling of the front porch, with PoE from a Cisco SMB switch. It is protected from direct sunlight and the elements there and I am not worried about its life expectancy.The camera's image is crisp and detailed, better than of my much more expensive Acti TCM1231 that is now several generations older, has fewer features, and still retails at around $600.There is not much ambient light on my street at night and the night recording conditions are challenging. There is this plant hanger right in front of it that is very bright in the IR illumination, but the front yard behind it remains largely obscure. I will have to combine this with a motion light if I want to see who or what is roaming around my yard at night.The other challenge of the location is the high contrast between sun and shade in the afternoon. I attached a separate image showing how the camera performs there.In any case, I do not see the plates of cars driving by, or even the make and model of the car in most cases. Fast moving objects are burred. Don't expect that kind of performance.The camera and its firmware can do more than you will want or need. It was detected by the Surveillance Center on my QNap NAS and I use it on one of the NAS channels. The camera can write to a NAS itself and does not need other software for that, but I like to see all camera channels on one screen, and with all different vendors and models this works best in the QNAP software.I purchased $100 IP cameras nearly 10 years ago that are still operating, but the difference is staggering. I feel that with the Hikvision we are getting so much in this price segment that it will be at least another 10 years before another product will surpass it in image quality and overall value.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQORH3ZUBD9Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RL2FZF0#wasThisHelpful","R3OQORH3ZUBD9Q","A33IJGLTVS5MDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33IJGLTVS5MDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can no longer record all my cameras because QNap reduced the number of available camera licenses to 2. The original Surveillance Station still supports 4, but the software has not been updated in 5 years and the camera support is a bit outdated, so there really wasn't a choice but to install Surveillance Station Pro. I initially gave the QNap NAS glowing reviews after coming from Synology because of this very fact - the support of 4 cameras out of the box. I feel betrayed now.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176LZQYA6G1FW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008PRCB48#wasThisHelpful","R176LZQYA6G1FW","A33IJGLTVS5MDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33IJGLTVS5MDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You WANT to take it down when not in use, to prolong its life and the free up yard space, for mowing the lawn, partying, etc - because it is so easy.

"Make sure you review the shipping terms AFTER selecting a color and, implicitly, the vendor. This is one of the SKUs here on Amazon were you can be in for an unpleasant surprise if you don't.

They will charge your card right away but you may not see any merchandise for months.Now to the case. It is study and protects the iPad well. The stand can be removed. When it is on and even when folded, it sticks out at an awkward angle and the back is not entirely flat. I am not convinced that a front cover is the way to go.

"I installed this in a tiled shower a week ago and so far is has been holding to the wall. Dispensers that are falling off the wall must either not have been glued properly, i.e. with as much surface of the plate contacting the glue and the wall as possible, or no surface preparation was done. It needs to be dry and oil-free. Or maybe certain tile material does not work, e.g. if it is too porous.I also installed a Better Living Classic dispenser a couple of weeks earlier in a marble shower, so I can't help but measure the simplehuman one against the Better Living.What I like:- the modern ""chrome"" design- the easy one-hand operation- it dispenses a good amount of gel with each squeezeWhat I do not like:- the almost invisible label on the cover. Clearly this product has not been designed for the 50+ demographics. If the content is roughly the same color, you will be struggling to remember which is which for some time. I have to take the cover off and hold it against the light to be able to read what is in it.- you are stuck with shampoo/conditioner/soap. Better Living includes additional labels.- post-shower cleanup is more cumbersome in comparison. I have to remove each container from the plate to be able to wipe the back and the wall behind it.- pricey!","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DV7X1D90IWO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YNQX16#wasThisHelpful","R2DV7X1D90IWO9","A33IJGLTVS5MDS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33IJGLTVS5MDS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a fun movie. It's made for children, but adults all seemed to love it, and we did too. I honestly bought it originally because of the various YouTube videos of people teaching their Cockatiels to whistle the theme song. The orchestrated version is extremely catchy. But after doing some reading up about the film, I found it's one of the currently still most popular children's films worldwide. We loved the storyline, and the crazy characterizations. Japan is definitely the place for weird, but usually workable ideas. Totora himself, the Catbus, and all the creatures help two young sisters cope with moving and an ill mother in the hospital.The 2-disc Blu-Ray/DVD version does contain both the newer Disney version - voiced by the Dakota and Elle Fanning - who do a fine job, as well as the original Japanese version (with various subtitles included). Some purists only like the Japanese version, while others like a previously released English-speaking overdub with different actors, that is no longer in distribution. Regardless, at least the original is included, and the new version is just fine. I see no reason for complaints at all. Very enjoyable, and some great extra bonus features as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8BDKL7SEKNI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEYYEJ4#wasThisHelpful","RN8BDKL7SEKNI","AIKQB96YODOVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIKQB96YODOVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great film. Very eye-opening storyline, if a bit unbelievable. The concept is that in the future, humans will be so lazy as to send in, basically, android clones of themselves, to do their daily routine, while the real people hide out at home. The biggest selling point is that the clones can look any way you want. Disfigured or self-loathing people can give themselves great bodies and looks. It says a lot about the future of image and what it means to be a ""real"" person. And, just as many do live in faked lives today, the question comes with what happens if a wrench gets thrown into the machine, after everyone is comfortable and set in their hiding ways. What if the system stops working, and real people must venture outdoors once again to face each other as they really are. Interesting topic and conversation starter film.

"I am thrilled with this product. I had just come to own several various old books, some over 60 years old, and some of which were quite dusty. I had done some research on what professional book restorers do, and all of them recommended the soot sponge (aka ""chemical sponge,"" although there are no actual chemicals) as one very useful method. It definitely worked wonders.Now, just to clarify, this WILL NOT remove stains - as in, anything that has soaked into the material. I noticed many bad reviews complaining about this. Think of this product as a large eraser. You wouldn't expect that to absorb dried in coffee stains or anything, would you? Same principal. It only removes ""surface"" dirt and soot, whatever is able to be ""released"" from the material. This is a very important point to take note of.Having said that, I had gone through the process of wiping down the books, which still appeared dingy, with some musty smells. Some restorers recommend vacuuming, but I think that is not necessary in most cases. I then used the sponge, and could immediately see the difference. The covers brightened up right away. Just to be clear, you cannot expect it to ""put back"" what is not there. That means, if colors have faded due to sunlight or ink fade, that is what you get, faded colors. What this will do is remove any dirt, soot, and dingy materials that are covering the material. And so, while not looking completely brand-new, all the books definitely improved in appearance, as I said, right away.If that is not enough, there is a follow-through method using a ""Chemical Clean Cover Gel,"" but that gets into some serious commitment, and is using harsh, toxic petroleum-based chemicals, best to use only if you know exactly what you are doing. That said, this sponge is the best way to start the restoration process.------To Note:  This product can also be used on window and lamp shades, blinds, various upholstery and more.And note that, since it does behave like an eraser, it will leave ""droppings"" behind, that you will need to clean up as you use it.And you can wash it after use, but never use it wet. Dry it completely.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6OQSU7SX2RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B31GA8#wasThisHelpful","RM6OQSU7SX2RL","AIKQB96YODOVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIKQB96YODOVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wonderful vacuum sealer. A friend of mine had been recommending that I should get one of these for quite some time. I had initially resisted, thinking it's ""just another kitchen item"" that won't get used, and will eventually just be put away and forgotten. Now that I got one, I find I was quite incorrect. Since I have gotten more into food dehydration, as well as other aspects of food saving, I have come to find that this is quite an invaluable tool - and I use it quite regularly.It is easy to operate, well, for the most part (when trying to seal bags that are not usually used in it). Actually, it has done very nicely with bags that are not the usual recommendations. But it performs exactly as promised. This model also can use the zip-lock bags that use a vacuum pump.

I never had it on DVD before, so it's a nice addition to my collection. The story line is great.

"I didn't know what to expect, since I had read varied reviews about different bulbs and companies, but... these were very nice. Relatively easy to pop in, and the function nicely. Now... keep in mind, if you are using these on a dimmer system... they will NOT go as dim as your halogens or whatnot. The reason is that these use so little energy, that they stop registering on the dimmer switch long before a different bulb would. This is why you can get a lower ambient light on the halogens, because it's still sucking power. But, these dim just fine, just not quite as dark. They have a nice hue, and have been a big help in reducing power costs at home.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QB2FYUWWJH0K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KW5UDYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QB2FYUWWJH0K","AIKQB96YODOVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIKQB96YODOVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I enjoy reading the occasional good cook book, and recipes of foods that appeal to me, but in this case, I took a blind chance on just a few items mentioned in it. I could not be happier. The foods shown within, the layout of the book, the way in which it is written, the clear and concise recipes... makes this a true joy to own.

The knife and screwdriver (small as it is) are fine. Oh, and if you want to use the bottle opener, or some other aspects, BE AWARE that it will separate at the top, and fall off the keychain.

Very easy to handle, quality construction, and I love the additional extras it has with the screwdriver, veggie-peeler, fish-scaler, bottle-opner, and more.

BUT... while they are advertised as a kitchen tool, I really see this as an absolute must-have tool for anyone going camping or hiking. It's versatility would be best utilized on trips like that. ONE COMPLAINT - The magnetic protective sleeve is total crap. The magnets barely hold onto anything while empty, and absolutely not at all while the shears are inside.

In my case, I am running a program (OnSong) that contains song lyrics, tabs, etc, and having this located discreetly down on my mic stand is so much nicer than a more obtrusive music stand (even worse when you have all paper pages of lyrics and notes that can possibly fly away).This tool became indispensable almost immediately upon my getting it. Now I cannot imagine going on stage with it - when I need it. As well, it's a great idea for practices too, as it holds the iPad nearby, where you can also make changes in lyrics, notes, and notations with whatever program you are running.

"I recently got Bell's Palsy, which, amongst other facial paralysis issues, cause my nose muscles to collapse a bit. Before that even, I had had subtle breathing issues, with my nose closing in and not allowing proper nasal oxygen intake when running or hiking. I inquired with many medical device companies and asked about any sort of circle implant to keep my nostrils open, but no one knew what I as talking about, and recommended that I should invent one. When checking on Amazon, I found quite a few and ordered a varied selection. These Brez premiums are the product that I like the best.These are very easy to insert, relatively soft and unobtrusive, and do an excellent job at keeping the nostrils expanded open. There will be some adjusting to be made, depending upon the individual, and it may not even be the perfect fit for some. But for me, I could not be happier. These have been a God-send in helping me with my breathing issues.Price-wise, I think they are more than they should be, but in comparison, I would still rather purchase these for the quality and ease of use. I do think, if they became more popular, the price would come down drastically, but we'll see. It's not that intrusively expensive.I'm not sure why they seem to be non-reusable. I personally do re-use them each for several days. Most of the other products are in fact created to be reusable for at least a couple of moths. The box states that these are one-day use products. I would like an explanation.Also, all the different products, this one as well, state not to use the product for more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period. I would also like an explanation for that. It seems as though they are comfortable enough to be left in.All in all, I cannot give enough praise to this company and what they offer.

Also, these Etymotics come with an attachable string, to keep them connected (a nice extra), and a carrying case. Large enough to insert and remove, and it provides the protection we should have.Both are great companies, and a definite must-have for anyone around loud music or any other noise, and an a necessity for any musicians.

And in that, I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in mathematics, or needs a reason to find it interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24O8PRMQYBN9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402788290#wasThisHelpful","R24O8PRMQYBN9H","AIKQB96YODOVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIKQB96YODOVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been looking for a proper clapboard for my filmmaking endeavors. I settled upon this one, for the balance of price and offered quality. I was not disappointed. This clapboard is solid and sturdy, and offers everything you would require on the board for making notations. If I was to make any complaint, it would only be that the ""slap"" sound could be a bit louder (for my expectations), but that really was not an issue for me, as it provides adequate ""clapping"" noise. A definite must-have for any filmmaker.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM98HENUSO3HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H2GZWVW#wasThisHelpful","RM98HENUSO3HO","AIKQB96YODOVC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AIKQB96YODOVC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grew up not 10 miles from the Canadian border and we would always look forward to getting our Mackintosh's Toffee bars.  Then, several years ago, Nestle's stopped making the bars and had bite sized individually wrapped ones that were made in Switzerland.  The Swiss can make excellent chocolate but they had no idea how to make the Mackintosh toffee.  Due to public outcry, Nestle's brought the bars back again.  Albeit, they are smaller and are in a plastic wrap and not in a box as the originals were.  My friends from Winnipeg found them in a grocery store and brought me a bunch of them.

This belt has two side belts with velcro to add support and adjust the tension as desired.  (Some have just one that wraps around which isn't as nice.)  The sizing is true to size.  I ordered a 5XL but probably could have used the 4XL.  But, no problem, it's easy to just overlap the main belt further.  It's better to have too much belt than not enough.

In only a few minutes I had everything trimmed off and ready to rake up.  It will be very nice in the fall to cut down the perennials in my wife's flower gardens also.  I've read reviews where it was mentioned the unit is heavy and tiring to use.  I have a LOT of weakness from a spinal cord surgery gone bad.  If I can still use it OK it can't be that heavy.I specifically wanted a cordless trimmer that uses lithium ion batteries.

"Just like the other reviewer, I purchased this tenderizer mallet because I wanted the largest, heaviest and best made tool I could find.  I put it in the drawer and didn't use it for a year.  I tried it out just recently when making Swiss steak.  After about 3 whacks, the head came loose.  I was surprised to find that the head is actually a hollow casting.  The only thing holding the head to the handle is the thickness of the aluminum casting where the wedge is driven in which is only about 1/4 inch thick.  About all I could do was to soak the head end of the mallet in some water and to drive the wedge in a little further.  Even so, the head doesn't stay firmly affixed and I don't think I can trust it to stay on.  It's made to look like a wonderful tool but is in reality something you would be much better off not owning.

"It is elegant and remarkably slim. My Paperwhite fits snugly inside without the possibility of falling out, and the magnetic closure works effortlessly at keeping it shut and powering it on and off with total simplicity.I have no idea what the heck other reviewers have said about it not fitting properly. Maybe they don't actually own a Paperwhite - who knows? Mine does.UPDATEThis morning my lovely paperwhite dropped approximately 18"" to the floor, flat - not on the edge. It was encased in this cover. I have included a photo of my damaged Kindle.This case is finished and I am now orderering a brand new Kindle to replace my dead one. Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe how I feel.I am so sorry I gave such a glowing initial review because I've had other covers in the past which provided better protection. I have never replaced a damaged Kindle until now.

"I was tired of watching my husband popping corn in a pan - making a total mess in our kitchen. I had resisted buying one of these after reading different reviews of various similar models. But finally I had to give it a shot or ban popcorn from our home forever.We both love this machine. It is sleek, very easy to use, requires no clean-up except discarding un-popped kernals, and pops about 98% of the kernals used. The color is okay, no big deal as it sits inside a cabinet until we use it.We don't bother with the melter piece on top of the machine so I can't say if it works well or not. We buy regular grocery popcorn from different vendors and so far everything has been fine. The brands we use do mention that smaller kernals might get blown out and not popped. So my husband tilts the machine back at a slight angle to improve our odds.So far, so good. And my kitchen stove looks nice again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FJKOLKF66MI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005RRBGYA#wasThisHelpful","R2FJKOLKF66MI7","A2J19U8H5SSFCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J19U8H5SSFCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've ever run across one of my previous gazillion phone case reviews you'll know that I always love the latest one I've bought. Well - here we are again!This terrific all-in-one version is easy to put on (2 pieces, snap together - simplicity), lovely two-tone purple colors, all ports are totally accessible, and the price is excellent. I also love that the attached cover flaps for both the charging & earphone ports are firm and solid feeling as opposed to other cases which either have no cover or they're so flimsy that you (me) wind up just cutting them off.The overall feeling is not quite rubbery and not quite hard plastic but extremely comfortable to grip. I absolutely have no fear it will slip out of my hands. And it's slim. No thick, Otterbox bulk. I am very confident that with this case on my phone, an accidental drop will not have some horrible, serious repercussions.Sorry. Not one negative thing to say.

"I have been a huge fan of the relatively inexpensive, paperish, hugely saturated facial masks by companies like My Beauty Diary and others ( you can find my many positive reviews) until stumbling upon these lacey, saturated, fantastic masks.I really can't contribute more than other outstanding reviewers have elaborated on the technical advantages of these lacey versions compared to the paper ones except to say how wonderful it is to position the mask over your face and neck and then be able to gently secure it by pulling it over your ears. Genious. The paper masks were good except the chin area never stays in place and I'm always checking to make sure the rest of it hasn't slid around on my face.These cost a little more but the results were so great after my first one, I immediately purchased 3 more boxes of this version and another one to try out.I am way past 50, but my skin looks terrific.

"Needed this for a lovely area rug purchased from Home Depot. Have no fear dear buyers, this baby is gigantic. So much so that if you have a couple of smaller area rugs that need a rubber mat underneath, for the value and exceptional quality I would suggest buying this one and cutting it up to your requirements. Much cheaper than buying individually sized smaller ones.The weave itself is very tight and I have not observed any evidence of marking up my wood floor.  But in the event this happens, just run a soft mop with either vinegar & water, or some store brand cleaner to remove the pattern from your floor.In any case, this is a very apt product that will protect your surfaces from permanent scratches while enjoying your various area rugs.

And, amazingly, for once I can actually reach the little on/off mute button on the left side of my Iphone 6. Up till now I've just left it on because I couldn't access it through the thick layers of protection.The color is more of a reddish pink rather than the vibrant red color shown on Amazon, but I have no problem with this.

"This is a perfect case for total coverage, minimal weight & bulkiness, terrific bright colors, at a more than fair price.First you apply a screen protector to the face of your phone (an absolute necessity), then you pull the thin rubber cover over the whole phone (obviously leaving the screen totally visible), then you snap the plastic front & back covers over the rubber...and you're done. All ports, speakers and camera are available without obstruction, but your precious phone is protected. It's still slim & sleek, but the slight rubbery feel to the plastic doesn't make you think the phone will slip from your fingers.I bought the black one with the multi color chevron arrows all over. Attractive and yet easy to locate against a dark surface - think purse, car seats, etc.  My only criticism matches another reviewer regarding access to the small switch for turning volume off/on.  Impossible to reach without a sharp object or taking off the whole cover.  Not a deal breaker for me. Almost never need that switch and the other positives negate this issue.I'm so happy with this cover that I convinced my husband to buy the black/gold version for his phone.

"I needed an uncomplicated and entertaining book to read and happily found it in ""Manhattan"". This is a surprisingly engrossing and totally enjoyable way to spend a couple of afternoons & evenings.The premise of three young women from entirely different backgrounds joining together to better themselves and defeat a common enemy is not entirely original. But its the paths they choose and the outcomes they reach that made the journey worth taking. I liked all three women immensely and truly cared about what would happen to each of them.My only very small disappointment was the neat way that everything tidied up in the end. After losing myself in their stories, I was kind of hoping for something a little more original at the conclusion. But honestly, it wasn't enough for me to downgrade my review.I had a wonderful time reading this book.

"I have sensitive skin but in the past this brand was always one that I could use without issues but found to be very expensive. So I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to give this moisturizer a try and not have to spend any money.I used my Shiseido cleanser and then applied this cream afterwords.  It has a wonderful, smooth texture going on and as a result you don't need much to cover your whole face.  A very economical plus.  The very next morning I had several small blemishes above my chin.I stopped using the cream for several days to allow my face to heal and then decided to try it again.  This time I used a simple facial cleanser by Lush products and again I applied the Divine Cream.  The following morning I had a brand new blemish on my cheek and the beginning of the small blemishes again by my chin.  So I immediately discontinued using this product.I know that a lot of reviewers love this item and you have no idea how badly I wished I could join them.  Unfortunately my results have been drastically different from theirs and I want to present as honest a review as possible.  It's probably just me, however I would defintely recommend looking at all of the ingredients if you suffer from sensitive skin issues like me.

"As someone who read and enjoyed the first book involving these characters, I have to say that this one was every bit as exciting, engaging and almost impossible to put down.  And although this book can stand on its own as a result of the outstanding background provided by the author, I would strongly recommend reading the first one so that you can fully appreciate this talented writer and these terrific characters.The synopsis is simple enough - a young man is accused of a murder for which he takes full responsibility.  However, the circumstances of this crime are not as obvious as everyone chooses to believe.  And the old saying about ""no good deed goes unpunished"" comes to mind again and again.  But you're in for a whole bunch of twists & turns along the way.This is a terrific, multi-layered journey that will take the reader from New York to Alaska, Europe, Russia, the Ukraine and back again.  I was never bored or distracted by trivial nonsence or unnecessary fillers. Outstanding story-tellers have become harder and harder to find these days. Orest Stelmach is a master story-teller.My pre-order for the next book is already in place and I am eagerly looking forward to continuing this journey.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EQISJ2FNXNTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CO9CRSS#wasThisHelpful","R3EQISJ2FNXNTE","A2J19U8H5SSFCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J19U8H5SSFCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to like this speaker.  It comes complete with international plugs, an a/c wall charger, and two pouches which I assume is one for the unit and one for the accessories.  It is somewhat attractive with a built-in stand that allows you to either place it on its side or in an upright position.With most speakers, once you have paired it with your device (an Iphone 5s, in my case), you should be all done. This is not so with this unit.  The speaker has a spring-loaded slide switch that you push on. It gives you a guitar confirmation tone so that you know that it's working. Now you must go to the ""Settings"" icon on your device and manually choose the Klipsch speaker. Then you will hear another guitar confirmation tone letting you know that it is paired. You must do this EVERY SINGLE TIME. It is ridiculous. Of course when you turn it off, it will give you yet another guitar confirmation tone.The sound is very good, but the extra step of always having to re-enable the bluetooth connection through ""Settings"" totally negates anything positive about this speaker.  There is absolutely no reason why my Sony SRSX5 and my JBL Charge automatically pair with my device whenever I turn them on, and yet this one does not. I keep trying to understand why the developers came up with this procedure, but it totally baffles me.I know that other users have complained in the past about charging issues.  Perhaps Klipsch listened to them and fixed this problem because I have not had any difficulties with that.If you're gonna spend money on a good speaker, please look at the Sony SRSX5.  It is an outstanding speaker with logical functions and exceptional sound.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW3Y1BKRBL65F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRKOFIQ#wasThisHelpful","RW3Y1BKRBL65F","A2J19U8H5SSFCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J19U8H5SSFCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My heading says it all.  This is a really beautiful unit that delivers great sound with a solid bass and clear treble.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and have yet to find one single negative aspect.Once you have paired this unit with your device (Iphone 5S in my case), you're set to go.  You push down on the on/off button on top of the unit and you have connectivity every single time.  It came already charged up but I let it run down so that I could see how long a fresh charge would last.  It lasted almost 1 week of constant usage.The only thing that it does not do is charge up your device.  You will still need to use your USB or a/c adaptor for that purpose.I own the Klipsch GiG as well as a JBL Charge and this speaker blows them both away.  I listen to everything from David Guetta, John Williams, the Grateful Dead, David Benoit, Pharrell to Curtis Mayfield and I can tell you that every single track sounds crisp and clear with a strong bass that does not overpower the artist.  Even MLB broadcasts from Yankee Stadium sound great.It is sleek and sexy and would be welcome anywhere you want to enjoy exceptional sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T460L7QYQ3VW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I053ICY#wasThisHelpful","R2T460L7QYQ3VW","A2J19U8H5SSFCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J19U8H5SSFCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have owned Defender cases.  I have owned Mobo cases.  This is the best value, protection and presentation I have had in any Iphone case.It has 3 easy to assemble pieces which fit beautfully and perfectly on an Iphone 5s. Again, it is for the Iphone 5s, not the c.  The colors are even more vibrant in person than in the photo - if you can believe that.  The protection is similar in principle to the Otterbox Defender series in that you have a soft cushion cover closest to the phone and then 2 outer plastic pieces which snap together over the cushion and form a barrier in case of a drop. I have small hands and with this case on, my  phone is still easy to hold with almost no bulk whatsoever.  All buttons are covered and easy to use, and there is plenty of open space on the bottom for plugging in a charger.The vendor is terrific in that they provide the full package for your protection. There is a clear transparency to protect the front of your phone, a cloth to keep it clean, and even a stylus if you choose to use it. Absolutely no excuse why your phone can't have total coverage and at an extremely, almost ridiculously low price. And it arrived super fast.  People, this is really a bargain.  In fact, I'm planning on buying another one, just to switch out and get different looks.Please consider this case if you are looking for something that is unique, dependable and inexpensive.

"Let me begin by saying that I have absolutely no interest in airplanes, their workings or their history.  So why did I get this book?  I was intrigued by the title and its implications.  What an incredible surprise this turned out to be.I kinda thought it was gonna take me through the history of the jet age in America and around the world.  It does and then some.  This book is about the hospitality industry, the gourmet restaurant industry, the publishing industry, the real estate industry and the entertainment industry.  I'm sure I've left out quite a few others, but I'm sure you get the idea.What a terrific author!  This man knows how to weave a story that takes the reader in so many directions that you don't even realize how much information you have just absorbed. This book is very educational, but not like a text book.  You want to read more and, in fact, there are so many different individuals referenced throughout, that I was constantly going to my Iphone and looking up the photos of these icons and others who are now lost to history.  I wanted to know even more about them.  And that is the highest complement I could ever give an author.Yes there is plenty about the evolution of the airplane from war and cargo to transportation of the rich, famous, notorious and the rest of us. But there are also the back stories, the gossip, the juicy details that most books like this leave out.  I don't care how many planes were constructed and who got which contracts - that's boring and you can find that information just about anywhere.  But to hear about the back room deals, out of control egos, and incredible exploits of so many of those titans of the industry and then to splinter out those stories to include hotel magnates,  stars of stage and screen, politicians (of course), mobsters (same thing) and so many other colorful characters - now you've got my undivided attention. I can't recall the last time I had so much fun reading anecdotes to my husband (who is a flight enthusiast) and hearing him say ""I didn't know that"".This is the kind of book you want to keep around even after you've devoured it from end to end.  You'll find yourself picking it up and re-reading different chapters because there is so much to learn - it'll be like discovering it all over again.  If you can't tell by now - I loved it.  A history buff's delight - with salacious stories and pop culture thrown in for good measure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4R9PJO8HP6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345536959#wasThisHelpful","R2W4R9PJO8HP6J","A2J19U8H5SSFCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J19U8H5SSFCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed Rob Lowe's first book so much so that I never hesitated to pre-order this release as soon as it became available.  I'm very glad I did.Neither a fan nor critic of Mr. Lowe's onscreen work, I must say that I am very curious as to whether he has written these books on his own or with the help of another writer. This is only because I find the flow of his words so comfortable, entertaining and very often eloquent, that it seems as though he has wasted time in front of the camera instead of behind the pen.I detest reviewers who insist on practically reproducing the entire book in their rewiews.  This is the job of the reader - not a reviewer.  I would hope that my endorsement or suggestion that you at least try a sample before judging the author would be helpful.  It isn't Tolstoy (thank goodness), but it is a very enjoyable opportunity to share the experiences and observations of another individual.  One who has had some pretty interesting experiences in his life.The only anecdote I will mention involves his time in rehab and the story about Buck - a composite drawn from another person who was a participant in his sessions.  The story of this heartbreaking and tragic individual is so well written that I found myself crying at the end of the chapter.  I never, ever cry at the end of chapters.  And this is why I'm so amazed at the level of writing.  It actually moved me to tears.If you're looking for dirt and garbage about other celebrities or entertainers, than I think you will be very disappointed.  That is the job of TMZ, etc., not a fellow actor.  What Mr. Lowe does is provide you with some glimpses into his profession, his family, his beliefs, success and failures. He does not paint himself in the warm glow of perfection.  He is honest (I hope) and objective about the road he has taken to get where he is today - warts and all (although I have to believe that somewhere in his home there is an aging, horrific portrait taking its toll).This really is a good book.  It is the story of a very lucky man who worked his ass off to make it in one of the hardest professions one could ever attempt employment. He loves what he does, unabashedly worships his family, and is grateful for every day of his life. A winner all the way around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K6HTNIVBMOOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7YYU#wasThisHelpful","R3K6HTNIVBMOOG","A2J19U8H5SSFCJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2J19U8H5SSFCJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this twin mattress for my 2.5 yr old as a first big bed after much research on organic mattresses. I was so excited and happy that everything was truly organic and there were no chemicals to worry about. The scent of the mattress is light and natural, so that did not bother me at all. Unfortunately, when I had the chance to lie on it for a bit, it was very firm and uncomfortable as I could feel the springs. It is marketed as a children's mattress, but I wanted a mattress to grow with my child, especially when spending $850.I contacted Naturepedic with my concerns and they were nothing short of amazing and accommodating. Because of this, the retailer accepted my return out of the return period ( they were amazingly helpful as well). It killed me to return it because I wanted to love it, but it just wasn't right for me. I would suggest trying the mattress out first before purchasing. (Lesson learned for me, but I tried to do the best for my child.)However, I will and have been a repeat Naturepedic customer. I love their mattress protectors and their pillows. When a company stands behind their product, that is the most important thing, and they get a A+ in my book.

"I usually buy Huggies Pull Ups, but since I have used both Pampers and Huggies regular diapers, I decided to give purchase these.These are absolutely horrendous. I literally opened the box (not even the plastic packaging) and was overwhelmed by the perfumed scent of these diapers (seriously can make you gag).

"To make a long story short, I thought I had only one itty bitty mouse that somehow managed to get inside my VERY CLEAN house to escape the cold. He was hiding out by the oven and dishwasher. Spent tons of money on all kinds of traps, nothing worked. Didn't see much ""evidence"" left behind and thought maybe he died somewhere or ran back outside. Ha...ha...I was wrong.Turns out...there was not one, but quite a few...and they were all hanging out in the GARAGE....eating and living the luxe life in a pile of GRASS SEED!! Ugh, they tore open two bags of GRASS SEED. Who knew they loved grass seed. Note to self, NEVER keep grass seed anywhere in or near the house again.Once their food source was removed, I placed these traps baited with chunky peanut butter... along with electronic ones that cost $20 each, spin traps, and some glue traps. Lo and behold, one by one, these are the traps that worked. Not the others. One even caught two mice. I thought it would be disgusting and that maybe there would be blood from being snapped, but it's a clean catch. Just use gloves and pick up and dispose.I will warn you though that these will NOT catch baby mice. I saw one just sitting on top of this trap, eating the peanut butter. Trap didn't snap. The mouse was too light. So far, I caught 15...yes 15...in a matter of days. Thank goodness they were in the garage.I haven't caught another in a few days, so hopefully they are almost all gone. I am not that naive to think they are all gone. I know there must be one or two hiding out still. Hopefully they will get hungry enough and get caught.Few tips:1 - Find out where they are hiding and WHAT they are eating. Eliminate their food source and make sure everything else you have is sealed in plastic bins. Once you do that, the traps with baited peanut butter will lure them.2 - Or can be #1, find out how they came in. I found a tiny hole that was next to the garage door. They can get in a dime sized hole. Make sure you use steel wool to fill holes or professional sealant. We used the spray foam. Also, check to see where they scurry. Who knew mice can SCALE walls?! Seal up any spaces by pipes that are in your garage and on the ceiling.3 - Put a few traps out in different locations. Keep them near the walls or corners.4 - Try to keep them away. I tried peppermint oil, but I found that these mice dragged a peppermint oil cotton ball to the trap. Hmm..ok...that's NOT supposed to happen. I have a few ultrasonic pest repellents plugged in, but don't really know if it works. They were still around, but maybe it scared them to different areas. Who knows.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QIKPQY9RTIDQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YL4MG0#wasThisHelpful","R1QIKPQY9RTIDQ","A10STX704CY2IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10STX704CY2IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this book because I thought it would be a great go to guide for quick, healthy, easy recipes. Most of the ""recipes"" involve just mashing and pureeing fruits and veggies. I don't need a recipe book for that. I wasn't impressed in most of the advanced recipes either.However, the one main reason why I returned this book is because the author is CLEARLY misinformed or ignorant. In the front section of the book, the author suggests that CANNED TOMATOES is a great source. How on earth can an ""organic"" cookbook recommend this. Canned tomatoes is one of the WORST things you can eat, nevermind feed to a baby.Please read two excerpts below from research studies.BPA is a toxic chemical linked to reproductive abnormalities, neurological effects, heightened risk of breast and prostate cancers, diabetes, heart disease and more. To avoid this hazardous chemical, avoid canned foods entirely and stick to fresh fruits and vegetables, or switch over to brands that use glass containers insteadespecially for acidic foods like tomatoes.Experts won't even eat this food.1. Canned TomatoesThe expert: Fredrick vom Saal, PhD, an endocrinologist at the University of Missouri who studies bisphenol-AThe problem: The resin linings of tin cans contain bisphenol-A, a synthetic estrogen that has been linked to ailments ranging from reproductive problems to heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, acidity (a prominent characteristic of tomatoes) causes BPA to leach into your food. Studies show that the BPA in most people's body exceeds the amount that suppresses sperm production or causes chromosomal damage to the eggs of animals. ""You can get 50 mcg of BPA per liter out of a tomato can, and that's a level that is going to impact people, particularly the young,"" says vom Saal. ""I won't go near canned tomatoes.""The solution: Choose tomatoes in glass bottles (which do not need resin linings), such as the brands Bionaturae and Coluccio. You can also get several types in Tetra Pak boxes, like Trader Joe's and Pomi.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I84QCGSLBAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1598699261#wasThisHelpful","R20I84QCGSLBAO","A10STX704CY2IH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A10STX704CY2IH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
